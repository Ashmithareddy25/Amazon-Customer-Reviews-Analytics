B00003CX96|5.0|The most serious part of the movie puts the small town feelings in perspective.  The father (the same actor who had the serious talk with Molly Ringwald in \\"Sixteen Candles\\") has a great talk with his son - the lead character - about life and growing beyond your roots.   <br />This is a funny, moving movie that tells you to be all that you can be even when others try to minimize you.

B000HEYVD6|2.0|As I read this book I was rollng my eyes and thinking that it had to get better.  This novel doesn't get better unfortunately, it just gets more hackneyed and contrived with an unmistakable antiAmercan slant that drips from the page after page. It seems as if Baldacci wrote ths one in about as much time as it took to read it.  Wow was this bad.
B00004WZV3|5.0|<br /> If you consume movie entertainment like fast food, and <br />don't want to put your thinking caps on, you might be <br />better served with the average Hollywood action flick, <br />or a sitcom on TV. <br /> <br /> If you have reached the point in life, where you begin <br />to ask yourself, what sense it all makes ... welcome to <br />the club of Amazon customers who, obviously, are of high <br />intelligence and have a special taste. <br /> <br />Personally, I don't like today's Barbra Streisand much  <br />anymore, because of the way she presents her political <br />views on her website and elsewhere. When disagreement  <br />turns to bad attitude, it's time for me, to take a hike.  <br />On the other hand, I do not hesitate for one second to  <br />describe this film version of Isaac Bashevis Singers  <br />\\"Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy\\", as one the Top 10 Hollywood  <br />movies of all times. <br /> <br />Yentl, the young woman in Latvia, Eastern Europa, in the <br />year 1904, is not allowed by society to study the Talmud <br />and other books about God, history, science and the roots <br />of humanity. But she is tutored by her loving father.  <br />When he dies, she leaves her small village, slips into  <br />the role of a man and begins to study with a community  <br />of scholars. However, she does not stop thinking, feeling  <br />and somewhat acting like a woman - despite her charade of  <br />being a man ... and her complicated situation comes back <br />to haunt her.  <br /> <br />Certainly, Ms. Streisand plays, to a certain extent, <br />herself in the movie, and some particular details of  <br />her character become obvious ... so what? In that  <br />particular film, it works! \\"Yentl\\" is an incredible piece  <br />of work, and I don't see how it could not be appreciated  <br />by a majority of today's intelligent women and the men  <br />who love them.
6304698623|4.0|Unless you're a die-hard Shirley Temple fan, it would be hard to deny that this was the best version of THE LITTLE PRINCESS ever. Leslie Matthews is superb as Sara, and Liam Cunningham is excellent doubling as both her father, Captain Crewe, and as Prince Rama. The entire cast is wonderful. I love the scenes in the beginning set in India. They set just the right magical mood for the story. I also love the scenes in the attic at Miss Minchin's. They are fun and imaginative. The escape across the rooftops is actually suspenseful in this version - it wasn't in the Shirley Temple film. Most everything is more effective. The Temple version was carrying so much political baggage at the time that it weighed the story down. Thankfully, this one is free to fly. And the ending is far, far more satisfying.<br /><br />The theme, \\"every girl is a princess,\\" is universal and timeless, and one that every little girl should hear and believe. And what better way than in this classic tale presented so well by filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. This is a film for the whole family, and one that I would highly recommend.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
1591396190|4.0|Blue Ocean is meticulously researched and easy to comprehend. The concept the authors encapsulate is not new; it is as simple as saying, \\"Do something different than the competition.\\" The text does an excellent job formalizing the analysis of differentiation. However, it is ultimately an academic tome and overlooks a critical concept in innovation and differentiation: Origins. In reading the examples of Cirque du Soleil and Southwest Airlines, one must remember how these businesses began. Were the ideas the brainchild of a corporate behemoth analyzing the market in terms of Blue Ocean's principles? These businesses began small and grew from entrepreneurial innovation. If you take the extreme examples of Cirque and Southwest, in turn, development came from street performers escaping the cold and an instate air service exploiting legislation to keep it from competing. All in, the book is a fine articulation of \\"Do Something Different.\\"
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Hmmmm, disappointing movie for the likes of major film stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. <br /> <br />I like the premise of the movie being that of the Grimm Brothers and how they may have come up with the fairy tales they wrote! But other than really good special effects, I can't say the movie was really worth watching! Pass on this film.
0618680004|5.0|This book deserves the widest possible readership, particularly among those who, at the outset, are most inclined the oppose its message. Dawkins makes a strong case that religion is not only anathema to science, but socially dangerous. Even more controversially, he argues that god does not exist based on probability theory. Simply put, however improbable is the existence of life on earth and evolution, the theory of a God creator is far more improbable still, and does not at all solve the problem of explaining the origins of life. This argument is unlikely to persuade many who are not already atheists. More sadly, this book is unlikely to be widely read except among those who are already in members of the choir, so to speak. It is a pity because Dawkin's arguments against religious faith are powerful. Plus, he is a delightfully witty and engaging writer.
B000JBWXNC|5.0|It's only been a mere 2 years since a full length Incubus CD has hit shelves, and only a year since we got three new tracks thanks to the Stealth soundtrack, but somehow it felt like it's been forever. However they have not missed a single beat. This is a version of Incubus that doesn't single any single fan out. If you loved S.C.I.E.N.C.E. there's a few tracks here that are just calling your name (A Kiss To Send Us Off, Light Grenades, Rogues). If you liked Make Yourself and Morning View, a good portion of Light Grenades is for you. And then there's the seemingly few of us who loved A Crow Left Of The Murder as well. They still have that 'sound' and a few songs call back to it successfully (Love Hurts, Oil And Water, Paper Shoes). As much as this CD beckons back to those days, it's still easily identifiable that they grew a lot and have certainly evolved so Light Grenades serves as it's own CD as well.<br /><br />If it was even possible, Incubus sounds as good as ever. Brandon still proves to be one of the elite few who sounds good in everything he does. Mike finds a way to better himself even after that awe-inspiring solo on Sick Sad Little World. Jose has more great beats in store. Ben offers up some truly catchy bass lines. And Kilmore actually serves a fairly big part this time around(!). So if you've been a longtime fan then your appreciation for them is only going to grow, and heck, if you're new they welcome new listeners with open arms.<br /><br />From the very beginning it's obvious that Incubus took their time crafting Light Grenades to have an excellent flow. Quicksand flows into A Kiss To Send Us Off like no other track they've ever made. From there they don't stop. The almost overwhelming heaviness of songs like Light Grenades and Rogues are something I didn't expect but they fit perfectly. A Kiss To Send Us Off and Rogues are also more in the hard rock variety, both serving as true highlights. The mid-tempo songs like Dig, Anna Molly, Oil And Water, Diamonds And Coal, and Paper Shoes keep the pace going swiftly and aren't without Incubus' now trademark lyrical prowess. With this being Incubus you know the slow songs included such as Quicksand, Love Hurts, and Earth To Bella parts I and II aren't going to drag down the overall listen either. What's really nice about Incubus is the fact that they have so much emotion in each track without it being overbearing and unwelcomed.<br /><br />Seeing as how this is the import, we get two unreleased songs, Punchdrunk and Look Alive. Punchdrunk has Brandon sporting some insanely catchy vocals throughout. It's a strange song, mainly lyrically, but serves the Incubus catalog justice. The latter of the two unreleased tracks, Look Alive, is much more upbeat than it's counterpart, again complete with oddly intriguing lyrics. The guitar and drum work are particularly excellent. As to whether it's worth paying 30 or so more dollars just for these two tracks, nah. I love them and I bought this, however it'll serve more of a collector's purpose than anything else. So it's up to you in which way you go. Just know that these two songs are awesome and shouldn't be looked over.<br /><br />My favorite songs are A Kiss To Send Us Off, Dig, Light Grenades, Earth To Bella (I and II), and Pendulous Threads. I was lucky enough to have gotten my copy a few days before the release date so I've heard Light Grenades countless times already and I've still yet to find a song I don't completely love. If that's a testament to how good the band is, or how good the CD is, I don't know, but this is sure to be in the ol' CD player for a good long time. Past that, if Incubus has even piqued your interest in the least Light Grenades is going to be chock full of everything you'd ever want. As an addition, I may be in the minority on this, but I think we just found our `CD of the year'.ter, Diamonds And Coal, and Paper Shoes keep the pace going swiftly and aren't without Incubus' now trademark lyrical prowess.

B000I0QK74|5.0|This is the best Christmas album I've heard in several years.  It's as if \\"Have yourself a Merry Christmas\\" was written and meant for James to sing.

0743298020|5.0|I had been looking forward to reading _The Thirteenth Tale_ for a long time before I actually read it, and so I worried I'd be disappointed. My worries were groundless. This tale is a hypnotic, lush drug that hooked me and didn't let me go, not even after I'd turned the last page. <br /> <br />Margaret Lea, a bookseller and sometime biographer, is hired by reclusive, eccentric author Vida Winter to write her life story. Winter is famous for her dark fairy tales and for telling only lies when questioned about her past. Finally, now, she will tell the truth of her origins. <br /> <br />Margaret is a woman with ghosts of her own, and she finds a kindred soul in Vida as the tale unfolds. And what a tale it is--a moldering mansion, incest, dark family secrets. The twist, when it comes, is stunning, and makes things click into place with eerie perfection. After you've shut the cover, you'll find yourself opening the book again hours or even days later, rereading some scene or other, because the real significance of it has finally dawned. Usually, mystery plots leave me satisfied but not feeling the need to ever read the story again. But I want to read _The Thirteenth Tale_ all over again through the different lens of knowing the twist. <br /> <br />I disagree with the readers who charge Setterfield with hubris and claim that she's trying to eclipse the \\"greats\\" of literature. I see this book not as a pretension but as a love letter to all the books that she has loved. <br /> <br />In my wildest dreams, _The Thirteenth Tale_ would be illustrated by Audrey Niffenegger. I'd love to see that...
B000HCO83Q|2.0|I have not viewed the DVD of this, so I can't comment on the quality of the bonus features or anything like that.  I saw it in Grauman's Chinese Theater opening night with a packed house and the excitement was all around me.  The last two X-men movies were decent adaptations under the helm of Bryan Singer, X2 being the superior movie, and although Brett Ratner had taken over the directing reins, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and I went in without any pre-conceived notions.  I came out angry that they ruined what could have been the best X-men movie thus far.    So going into it, I thought X3 had a lot of potential.  From the trailers it seemed to have some really great action in it as well as visual effects.  I thought the opening scene was really fantastic.  When I saw the giant sentinel head fall down through the fog I got really psyched because I figured it was foreshadowing the fact that we'd be seeing more sentinels later on.  And then you never do!       I liked the fact that it turns out to be a danger room sequence because that's something else I always wanted to see in the movies as well, so it was off to a good start.  And then it immediately started going downhill when Jean returns as Phoenix and they kill off Cyclops.  I will admit Cyclops isn't my favorite X-man, but I definitely feel he got the shaft in these movies.  He was hardly in X2 and then to just kill him off like that?  He definitely should have been around for the final battle at least.  Supposedly the reason behind this being that when I heard the screenwriter Simon Kinberg speaking at Comic Con this past year in San Diego, he explained the reason he killed Cyclops off so early was to show the audience right off the bat that anything can and will happen in this movie.  I believe the more accurate explanation is that James Marsden was busy shooting Superman Returns with Bryan Singer and so it was probably in his contract that he required a minor role in The Last Stand.I liked Beast a lot in it.  He was a great addition and I wish he had been in every single movie.  That's probably the one thing most people will agree they did right.  Kelsey Grammer was a great casting choice. He really nailed the character showing us Beast's intelligence as well as his ferocity in battle.  It was cool to see Angel make an appearance but he wasn't in it very much and they didn't develop the Cure storyline very well.       It was obvious they were going to eventually have a Pyro/Iceman showdown and it was cool to finally see him turn into ice, but they should have done it sooner.  I wanted to see him surf on ice like he does in the comics.  And I can't believe they didn't have a Juggernaut/Colossus match!  How could they possibly have these two in the same movie and not think to do that is beyond me.     All right, so here's my biggest complaint and the biggest change I would have made.  I hated the fact that they kept taking away mutant powers from characters like Mystique and Magneto.  I won't even get started on Prof. X getting killed because it does happen eventually.  The worst thing though is having Rogue go through with the cure.  I was completely convinced that at some point she would show up again and touch Phoenix, and not only would that bring Jean back to normal, but then Rogue would gain her flying and strength abilities through that and be able to fly around and destroy stuff in the final battle.  I realize it's not exactly the way it was done in Marvel continuity but it would have been much better than the alternative.  The fact that Rogue lost her power and they killed off Phoenix was the worst decision ever!  It made Rogue's character pointless throughout the entire series in my opinion.  Why would they put her in the first movie without all her powers unless they were planning on giving them to her at some point?  She should have either had them from the start or not been in the series at all if this is how they're going to treather character.     The Last Stand never really felt like an X-men movie all the way through.  That's why I say it's a decent action movie for those who knew nothing about the X-men prior to the movies, but for fans of the comics and the series, it's truly a disappointment.  They got a few details right here and there, but for the most part it seemed like they just picked up where the last one left off and then made it up from there and had no idea what to do.  What they should have done would be to have ended it with the X-men and the brotherhood of mutants fighting each other, but then had sentinels show up, so they would have had to team up temporarily in order to survive.  If they insisted on including the cure story line, there should have been a subplot about the sentinels rounding up mutants and forcing them to take the cure if they're unwilling to.  I really wanted to see a sentinel battle if you couldn't tell.     And the fact that they teased us with Gambit's name, Remy LeBeau, on a monitor in X2 but didn't bring him in for the third (and possibly final) movie is inexcusable.  I believe part of the reason they were killing off characters and taking away their powers was to put an end to the series, thus \\"The Last Stand\\", but I definitely think if they wanted to bring it back in a few years, they could introduce Bishop.  If anyone remembers Bishop, (the time traveling mutant from the comics who's always trying to alter the past to fix the future), and if they were to make another X-men movie, Bishop should come back and stop this movie from happening.  Or at least stop Prof. X and everyone else from dying.  Also the scene at the end of the credits really didn't make much sense at all and it felt like the final insult to X-men fans everywhere.  Overall, I couldn't understand why the producers couldn't have attempted to keep it more true to its comic roots, but for now, we can let the X-men movie franchise rest in peace.
B000HT3P7E|1.0|I am a huge fan of this show.  I think it's extremely well written and I love all of the actors.  These DVDs really do not do the program justice.  They contain almost none of the original music from the aired episodes.  It is all replaced with crappy filler that sounds like something you'd hear in an elevator.  CBS only played for 2 real songs because they were necessary to the story.  The music that they used to replace the original sounds like tracks that would come with iMovie because they are free to license.  The lack of music makes some scenes just plain awkward at times.  It seriously hurts the moments.  The episodes completely lack the same emotional punches as the ones that aired.  For example in \\"The Slutty Pumpkin\\" the perfectly placed Nada Surf song \\"Inside of Love\\" is gone and the episode's ending feels abrupt.  In the episode \\"Okay Awesome\\" most of it takes place in a dance club.  The cheap music that is now used feels completely out of place.  The original episode sounded like they were in a club, the replaced music is just strange an unfitting.  I was really disappointed by this because I really enjoy this show and wanted to introduce friends to it using this DVD set.   It's just not the same.   I'd rather watch the episodes on the internet now.  The picture may be blurry but at least it's the real show.

078401213X|5.0|I don't doubt that if Orson Welles was still alive would be proud of this extraordinary film that somehow materializes just a part of the immense possibilities of expression the cinema has to offer us.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the allusive reminiscences of the Kafkaesque must be present to mirror the rudeness and the vertigo generated by two extreme positions around this math genius, who lives in a very humble apartment in Manhattan crammed with high tech devices - a sharp metaphor indeed - obsessed and extremely convinced the universe and all its included events (as the stock market) obey to unknown patterns, and so predictable. Trapped, as it were, by bouts of paranoia and crippling migraines, he must face besides the compulsive harassment of external elements, a shady brokerage firm and a Hasidic cabal interested to know about the significance of God and the number 216 which is a curious number, given the fact is the first positive integer number that may be divided exactly by the rest of the numbers from one to ten, (excepting the numbers five and seven) that gives us an idea of its wholeness as set of sets. On the other hand, 216 is multiple of 12 (216 = 18 x 12) and you know the special significance of 12 in the history (the number of Israel' s tribes, the number of members of a jury, the number of Zodiac symbols, the number of months in a year, the time of the day or night in hours, and a wide etc.<br /><br />The formidable employment of black and white remarks still more the messy ambiance and adds a claustrophobic environment that reaffirms its kinetic intensity.<br /><br />And please, at the moment to watch Matrix again, establish by yourself the countless dramatic resemblances.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I must say, when I rented this dvd from Blockbuster, I expected to be thoroughly disappointed by a sappy, watered-down version of one of the most powerful and moving Broadway musicals of all time.  I was, however, shocked by Chris Columbus's sensitive and accurate interpretation of the show.  There are very few changes made from the original libretto.  In fact, I watched the film, while following along with my liner notes from the original cast recording, and found almost no deviation, down to a parenthetical stage direction in the notes stating that Roger puts on his jacket and leaves the building, which occured simultaneously with the same scene in the movie. The few cuts, which are well-planned and smoothly executed, include the unfortunate, but understandable absence of the song \\"Contact\\".  Instead, the scenic montage of Angel's declining health takes some getting used to, but in the end, does more justice to the effects of the disease in reality.  Rosario Dawson, while slightly unbelievable as a heroin addict, gives a much more enjoyable musical performance than Daphne Rubin-Vega, in my humble, professional opinion.  Tracie Thoms turns in a comparable performance to Fredi Walker, though her melismatic contribution to \\"Seasons of Love\\" culminates with a pleasant high C, as opposed to the high D performed by Walker. <br /> <br />On the flip side, the extra features make this set well worth the purchase.  There are a plethora of documentaries from the making of the show and the movie, to the biography of composer Jonathan Larson.  The information is both fascinating and inspiring.   <br /> <br />I could go into more detail, but I found the reviewer below to be quite accurate, and overall, this is definitely a worthwhile experience, both for rentheads and newbies alike.  I was surprised and thrilled by the quality of the production, and the degree to which it held true to the show.  It is a brilliant film, to be sure.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I thought that *Transamerica* was a wonderful endearing movie.<br /><br />Bree is just about to get her final surgery after getting the final approval from her doctor and therapist.  However, she gets an unexpected call from Toby, who claims to be her alleged son.  Toby is in jail, for prostitution and drug possession, in NYC when he made the call.  When Bree's therapist discover about the call, she holds back the approval for surgery, thus frustrating Bree.<br /><br />Bree thinks that if she bails him out and sends him to his mother, all will be solved.  So she flies over and bails him out.  From there, Bree learns that the mother is dead.  However, there is a stepfather in Kentucky.  She's determined to drive him there, despite his protests.<br /><br />The drive across America, from NYC to Kentucky to Arizona to California test Bree and Toby.  Bree is determined to hide the fact that s/he is indeed the father.  The guilt builds in Bree every time that Toby mentions the desire to see and live with his father.  On the other hand, Bree is developing a slow awkward bond for Toby.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie is when Bree and Toby make a stop in Phoenix to see her parents and sister.  Bree may have been estranged from her family and has developed her own indentity.  However, nothing changes in the eyes of their parents, including their stubborness to call her Stanley, her given name.  Bree's mother truly cracks me up, especially at the restaurant.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is about the pursuit of happiness.  However, just what one must do to achieve happiness.  Must one employ lies, estrangement, denial?  There are those that will not accept your path to happiness.  There are those that encourage you to chase happiness.  There are those that don't care.  Regardless, only you will determine or allow what may stand in your way to happiness.<br /><br />*Transamerica* is worth a watch.  You'll laugh.  You might cry.  You'll gasp in shock.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This movie misrepresents and edits the facts and only reports the information that backs up one side of the story while ignoring the information that completely contradicts every claim that it makes.<br /><br />I can't imagine how anyone with even a middle school science education could be fooled by the junk science used in this film but since so many people seem to have fallen for it I will detail more information below.<br /><br />(1)Near the beginning of the film, Gore pays respects to his Harvard mentor and inspiration, Dr. Roger Revelle. Gore praises Revelle for his discovery that atmospheric CO2 levels were rising and could potentially contribute to higher temperatures at a global scale. There is no mention of Revelle's article published in the early 1990s concluding that the science is \\"too uncertain to justify drastic action.\\" (S.F. Singer, C. Starr, and R. Revelle, \\"What to do about Greenhouse Warming: Look Before You Leap. Cosmos 1 (1993) 28-33.)<br /><br />(2) Gore discusses glacial and snowpack retreats atop Mt. Kilimanjaro, implying that human induced global warming is to blame. But Gore fails to mention that the snows of Kilimanjaro have been retreating for more than 100 years, largely due to declining atmospheric moisture, not global warming. Gore does not acknowledge the two major articles on the subject published in 2004 in the International Journal of Climatology and the Journal of Geophysical Research showing that modern glacier retreat on Kilimanjaro was initiated by a reduction in precipitation at the end of the nineteenth century and not by local or global warming.<br /><br />(3) Many of Gore's conclusions are based on the \\"Hockey Stick\\" that shows near constant global temperatures for 1,000 years with a sharp increase in temperature from 1900 onward. The record Gore chooses in the film completely wipes out the Medieval Warm Period of 1,000 years ago and Little Ice Age that started 500 years ago and ended just over 100 years ago. There is evidence from throughout the world that these climate episodes existed, but on Gore's Hockey Stick, they become nothing more than insignificant fluctuations (Gore even jokes at one point about the Medieval Warm period).<br /><br />(4) You will certainly not be surprised to see Katrina, other hurricanes, tornadoes, flash floods, and many types of severe weather events linked by Gore to global warming. However, if one took the time to read the downloadable \\"Summary for Policymakers\\" in the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), one would learn that \\"No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder days, or hail events are evident in the limited areas analysed\\" and that \\"Changes globally in tropical and extra-tropical storm intensity and frequency are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal variations, with no significant trends evident over the 20th century.\\"<br /><br />(5) Gore claims that sea level rise could drown the Pacific islands, Florida, major cities the world over, and the 9/11 Memorial in New York City. No mention is made of the fact that sea level has been rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year for the past 8,000 years; the IPCC notes that \\"No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been detected.\\"<br /><br />(6) Near the end of the film, we learn of ways the United States could reduce emissions of greenhouse gases back to the levels of 1970. OK. Assume the United States accomplishes this lofty goal, would we see any impact on climate? The well-known answer is no. China, India and many other countries are significantly increasing their emission levels, and global concentrations of CO2 may double this century no matter what we decide to do in the United States. Even if the Kyoto Protocol could be fully implemented to honor the opening of this movie, the globe would be spared no more than a few hundredths of a degree of warming.<br /><br />In 1998, The OregonInstitute of Science and Medicine (OISM) issued a petition for signature by atmospheric scientists saying there is no scientific evidence indicating that human-created greenhouse gases are causing catastrophic global warming. That petition was signed by more than 17,000 scientists and leaders involved in the issue.<br /><br />Global Warming scaremongers have tried to discredit these statements from the opposition, saying either they are too old to be counted in today's debate or that they weren't signed by real scientists.

1401302378|4.0|This is a straightforward book that explains in clear, simple terms how online commerce is removing the constraints of traditional distribution channels, where because of limits of time, space, and geography of bricks-and mortar retailers only a very limited number of products can make it to market.  The ideas are very clearly communicated using graphs and are well supported with solid data, mostly from the entertainment industry.<br /><br />The reader should be aware, though, that it focuses almost exclusively on the entertainment industry, and doesn't show how it applies to others whose main essence cannot be easily converted to bits.  Even within the entertainment industry, it doesn't fully address the devastating effect digital piracy is having on it and the challenges involved in getting people to pay for bits. Finally, the book's focus is primarily descriptive, not prescriptive. There is no mention here on what a business, especially a large, established one, should do when mass markets fragment into niches.  Should they focus on building a solid platform that allows them to deliver products for many different niches, or should they identify the highest-value niches and go for them? In this sense, you should regard this as a pop economics book rather than a business book, and if you're ok with this, you'll greatly enjoy reading it.  Otherwise you'll be better off waiting for more targeted business books on the implications of the Long Tail phenomenon, which are sure to come.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I purchased this CD after seeing the movie.  The music is enjoyable to listen to and passionate as I would think Frida was.  I purchased this CD a second time to give to a female Hispanic artist who identifies with the trials and tribulations of Frida.  This artist now paints while listening to this CD.  Her artwork not only has improved but has become popular.  I defiantly recommend its purchase.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|As the movie begins a clear dislike of everyone but the little girl develops, but then it starts to warm up.  One after another each family member shows a humanity, focusing on Olive.  She realizes that she is no beauty, but she has convinced herself, and everyone else, that she has the skills needed for winning the Little Miss Sunshine contest.  With one mishap after another each member of the family develops a depth and snese of caring that helps them coalesce into a full and happy family.    Dysfunctional?  Not a bit.  The family functions very well, as much as any other family, even with initial starts and stops, with each one caring for the other, which is no more apparent than at the end of the movie.  The movie is certainly not predictable, although in hindsight, Olive's performance, being coached by her foul-mouthed coke-sniffing grandfather, could have been nothing else but the delightful shocker that it was.    On another level, this movie helped to expose the promiscuity of the parents who send their little girls to beauty contests, parading them as adults.  This is just sick, and the movie makes this point very, very well.    A different kind of family movie, and one that works on many levels.
078322611X|5.0|Somehow, a movie about a baseball field being built in a cornfield and that the edge of it actually is the gateway back to Heaven for ghosts doesn't really sound schmaltzy and that's probably the reason why the film was such a hit and why people, upon hearing of the film, go \\"oh yeah that movie, I loved that!\\". Course some don't like it but it's remarkable how little detractors I find. It's hard to say whether it's one of those American classics on line with Godfather and E.T and whatnot but as it stands, it's quite a great movie that never seems to get old which surprised me quite a bit.<br /><br />Ray Kinsella is a farmer in Iowa raising a corn farm with his wife and daughter. While outside, he hears a strange voice: \\"if you build it, he will come\\". He hears it so many times that but he has no clue what it means until it dawns on him: build a baseball field and maybe baseball great late \\"Shoeless Joe\\" Jackson will come back to play baseball. With a supporting wife (she actually condones building a baseball field and never gets mad? Where can I find me someone like her?) but with financial concerns as well as local gossip, he builds it and sure enough, Shoeless Joe as well as other ballplayers show up to play. There's more to it than that and he'll get a chance to reconnect some people's problems as well as his own.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it made quite a bit of money, it's actually not a very elaborate looking movie. Instead it's all the characters and the story and the film never seems to drag which is quite something since it's essentially a film about baseball. The film's iconic line \\"if you build it, he will come\\" is still in my head since when I was younger and it's just as cool now as it was then. It's also a film where you really have to suspend disbelief in huge chunks. The idea of a baseball field bringing the dead back to life is quite something but we never seem to feel like \\"oh good lord, now what?\\"<br /><br />As far as acting is concerned, it's nearly perfect. Kevin Costner has often been ridiculed, moreso for Waterworld and the Postman than his acting and granted he's not the most depthful actor, he's at least very likable as the everyman here. James Earl Jones is quite perfect, making his baseball speech heartfelt and uplifting without having this kind of pandering. Same for Burt Lancaster who just exudes this kind of calm like you almost couldn't get in a fight with the guy he was so nice. The others are either pretty good like Ray's wife but then we have the wife's brother Mark who's kind of more annoying than villainous.<br /><br />Around this time, Costner was kind of on a roll. His turns in JFK, Bull Durham and Academy Award winner Dances With Wolves was big and in the same group is this film which is still a delight...even though personally, I'm a bigger hockey fan. \\"Rink of Dreams\\" maybe?ed, it's nearly perfect.

0307237699|5.0|You can't read a book by a guy who might run for President without sizing him up in that context. And, in fairness, if you're a guy who might run for President, you can't write without remembering how critical people are. You can't be careless with language, or throw in wisecracks that might offend someone somewhere. Therefore, don't read this book expecting Dave Barry or Dan Brown. On the other hand, you gotta admire a guy who tells you what he believes and why before he even declares for the race whether you agree with him or not. In that context, this is a book everyone should read. In that context, it was an excellent book. <br /> <br />I read the book and never found a reason to dislike the guy or quibble seriously with his writing. I never disagreed with him, nor thought him naive. His opinions were carefully considered, and based on a broad base of knowledge of law, history, and common sense. He always articulated both sides of an issue concisely and fairly before explaining why he came down on the side he did. Coincidentally, in virtually every case, it was also the side I came down on. That means either we are both very smart guys, or he is a genius who knows how to make people think they always held his opinion.  His thought process was refreshingly presidential. <br /> <br />Before I read it, my fear was that a guy who taught constitutional law might not have real-world problem solving skills. I still don't know for sure that he does, but he certainly has internalized the process for building concensus and solving certain kinds of problems. And maybe that's more important than if we agree on some detail of a free trade agreement. <br /> <br />Still, in the real world, I'm going to guess he might have trouble fixing his own car or hanging drywall. My worst fear remains that he might not possess enough ruthlessness to anticipate and defend against the cunning moves that a seasoned pirate or thug might make. In a knife fight, Cheney or Saddam would carve himup. But he is also the kind of guy that could probably surround himself with a few gunslingers, and smart enough to know he needs them. You don't need to be the best bar fighter if you have a good and loyal bouncer. Ike had Nixon, JFK had Bobby, Clinton had Vernon Jordan. So far, Obama's got Oprah. She's good, but she's no Karl Rove. The Audacity of Hope did not deal with that issue at all, and that's probably his political weakness.  <br /> <br />My biggest concern with Audacity of Hope was that the book was not as breezy as the population demands, so not many people will actually read the whole thing and come up with their own opinion. They will only know what Rush tells them, or what Wolf tells them. On the other hand, it was a serious book by a serious guy, and that's a refreshing change of pace, presidential-candidate-wise. I hope all the other potential candidates provide us with this kind of detailed and thoughtful position paper before the election season heats up.   <br />Kenn Amdahl, author of There Are No Electrons: Electronics for Earthlings, Joy Writing: Discover and Develop Your Creative Voice, The Land of Debris and the Home of Alfredo, and co author of Algebra Unplugged and Calculus for Cats

B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin and his son, Giles, have put a lot of love into this recording. And who better than to enhance the original recordings than George Martin, the fifth Beatle. The new recordings maintain the integrity of the originals while giving them fresh, beautifully nuanced interpretations. I was apprehensive about this recording before I put it in the CD player, but have grown to appreciate the overall work. I do believe the later recordings by the Beatles, beginning with the Revolver album, work better with the multi-layered sound but the earlier recordings come across much richer. The vocals have a clarity that are moving, especially \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" This CD is worthy to belong in anyone's Beatles collection.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album is a pleasant surprise. Room For Squares and Heavier Things tended to be bouncy and pleasant with the same methodical approach. Both those albums got 5 stars in my opinion. Well 5 was the highest I could go, but I would definitely go higher. John filled this album with some edge, and it caught me moreso than the other two albums.  <br /> <br />The huge single, Waitin' on the World to Change, leads off the album and really kicks it off perfectly. The mellowed out \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\" follows and the chorus was the first thing that really got me going. The newly present edge comes out with \\"Belief\\" and \\"Stop This Train.\\" \\"Belief\\" starts with some guitar that most people wouldn't recognize as John's. The chorus really surprised me and I found myself listening to it three times in a row because I enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br />It's a short review, but I could go on for much longer about this album. He showed another dimension in his career, and that only excites me when he comes out with another record. 10/10, Two Thumbs Up, and 5 stars!

B00026WU4G|3.0|In his excellent study, \\"Bob Dylan: the Recording Sessions (1960-1994),\\" Clinton Heylin suggests that there is a \\"great lost album\\" that was created in the Power Station recording sessions during the spring of 1983.  The cuts that were selected and ultimately released as this album are a shadow of what could have been.  Heylin opines that if an alternate set of cuts had been released it would have been Dylan's \\"one true masterpiece\\" of the 1980s.  The more exposure I've had to the songs he refers to, the more I have to say I agree with him.    I was in my final year of high school when \\"Infidels\\" came out.  It was the first Dylan album I purchased and I almost foolishly dismissed him based on my initial exposure to what I heard.  The presence of former Stones' guitarist, Mick Taylor, and Dire Straits' lead man, Mark Knopfler (who co-produced this with Dylan), were what drew me to seek out the album.  Instead of the raw organic rock and roll sound I expected, I heard the lifeless overproduced sound typical of many recordings of the era. Also, as other reviewers have noted some of the songs that were released have lyrics that strike one as being politically naive at best, offensive at worst.      In spite of the above problems, Dylan's brilliance as a songwriter does come through on a couple of songs on the released album (\\"Jokerman\\" and \\"I and I\\" are great songs).  However, the tracks I heard later that were discarded from the sessions for this album (most of which were thankfully officially released on the \\"Bootleg\\" series albums) suggest that Dylan has to be one of the poorest judges of his own work.    This is the album I wish Dylan had released:    1. Jokerman (unreleased alternate cut)  2. License To Kill  3. Man of Peace  4. Lord Protect My Child (released on \\"the Bootleg Series\\")  5. Tell Me (one version released on \\"the Bootleg Series\\" but another unreleased version is equally good)  6. Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight  7. Blind Willie McTell (the still unreleased electric version not the acoustic one on \\"the Bootleg Series\\")  8. Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart (alternate version that remains unreleased)  9. I and I  10. Foot of Pride (released on \\"the Bootleg Series\\")
B000ESST6U|5.0|David McVicar's spirited, audacious 2005 Glyndebourne staging of Handel's preeminent opera seria comes to life in a surprisingly robust 2006 DVD package that spreads the marathon, four-hour work over three discs. Not nearly as outrageous as David Alden or Peter Sellars, McVicar exhibits a more manageable theatrical flair with an idiosyncratic blend of historical periods and dramatic styles from slapstick to melodrama. Bolstered by Robert Jones' impressive sets, it's a lavish production that places the classic story of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra within the context of the 18th century British imperialism encroaching upon Egypt. Above all else is G.F. Handel's wondrous music, including some of his best arias, impeccably played by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment led by estimable Baroque specialist William Christie.<br /><br />A splendid cast has been assembled starting with British mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly who transforms herself most convincingly into a stalwart male for the title role. Performing in an especially low Baroque pitch, Connolly sings superbly while perfectly evoking the swagger of a warrior. With her stunning coloratura, she hits the expected high points without disappointment - Act I's \\"Va tacito e nascosto\\"; Act II's casually lyrical \\"Se in fiorito ameno prato\\" competing with a virtuoso violin solo by Nadja Zwiener; and Act III's \\"Aure, deh, per pieta\\" when Caesar returns to Egypt after his escape from Tolomeo. As Cleopatra, 25-year old Australian-American soprano Danielle de Niese is a ravishing presence along the lines of Angelina Jolie. Physically ideal in a variety of eye-catching costumes, she handles the character's diverse sequence of arias with aplomb - Act II's \\"V'adoro, pupille\\" in the guise of a goddess prepared to entertain Caesar; the moving \\"Se piet&agrave; di me non senti\\" later in Act II; and of course, Act III's \\"Pianger&ograve; la sorte mia\\" as she laments her defeat by Tolomeo.<br /><br />In another cross-dressing turn, German mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager makes Sesto's desires for revenge of his father's death most palpable, especially on the aria \\"Svegliatevi nel core\\"; and Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon is moving as Sesto's grief-stricken mother Cornelia, Pompey's widow. Their characters' much-anticipated duet, \\"Madre!...son nata a lagrimar\\", closes Act I in beautifully rendered style. Though clearly overshadowed, the men perform exceptionally - Moroccan countertenor Rachid Ben Abdeslam as Cleopatra's servant Nireno (especially on his comic song-and-dance, \\"Chi perde un momento\\", complete with a Supremes-like back-up group); French countertenor Christophe Dumaux as Cleopatra's treacherous brother Tolomeo; and British baritone Christopher Maltman as Tolomeo's general, Achilla, who bravely switches sides only to meet a ghastly fate. Helping considerably in defining the various characters are Brigitte Reiffenstuel's often clever costumes, as well as the animated choreography, partially inspired by Bollywood musicals, by \\"movement director\\" Andrew George.<br /><br />Commensurate with the stellar production, Opus Arte has provided a strong set of extras in the DVD package. On the first disc, there is a helpful synopsis that uses snapshots of the performance to explain the complex storyline. Of more interest is a half-hour featurette called \\"Danielle de Niese and the Glyndebourne Experience\\", which spotlights the gorgeous soprano in an informal portrait similar to MTV's \\"Cribs\\" series. A naturally telegenic personality, she gives a tour of her rented cottage, drives to the venue, strolls with Glyndebourne executive chairman Gus Christie and shows how she prepares for the role. On the third disc is the more substantive, one-hour documentary, \\"Entertainment Is Not a Dirty Word\\", directed by Ferenc van Damme, in which McVicar, Christie, Connolly, de Niese, Kirchschlager and George lend behind-the-scenes insight on the production and discuss at length the freedom allowed by this newest interpretation. There are also slideshows of the rehearsals and the final production on the third disc.est interpretation. There are also slideshows of the rehearsals and the final production on the third disc.
0143034901|5.0|I read an average of two books per month, both fiction and non-fiction. I don't claim to be a literary critic, and I have no qualms about reading a light work of fiction just to pass the time on a plane. The Shadow of the Wind is, however, one of the best books I've read in years. There is strong characterization of several of the characters, especially Fermin, who I came to love. The plot about a the mystery around the author Julian Carmax reminded me of many a Victorian novel and was intriguing in its own right, but the feel of the neighborhood that Daniel Sempere grows up in in post-Spanish Civil War Barcelona and the coming of age story that is wrapped around the main story line offers the reader a multi-faceted experience. The novel is just plain well-written, too, which makes it a pleasure to read. There are a few one-liners of dialog that I wanted to jot down as quotes to remember -- wish I'd bookmarked those pages now. This is a book well worth reading.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|This new version simply looks far better than the older versions using early DVD technology.  It is stunningly clear with crisp color and great sound.  While it may be true that we can wait until the new versions come out in 2007, that does not diminish the quality and beauty of this release.  <br /> <br />This version of the film does clarify a few mysteries by confirming the hypothesis that Ford's character is a replicant by inserting the unicorn scene.  Although the deletion of the Mary character is still subconsiously obvious.  I found that for some reason, the clues that Deckard uses to find one replicant after another were more obvious and easier to follow in this version, perhaps just because of the remastering, or possibly because one is less dependent on being bridled by the voice overs, and pays more attention to the movie.   <br /> <br />To the reviews that find the film more challenging: This version is less \\"Accessible\\" since it loses the voice overs that provide cartoonish explanation. And it is worth saying that Blade Runner is not an action movie for pulp sci-fi fans.  It is a heroic, tragic, deep, meaningful, literate essay on individualism, memory, life, technology, and what it means to be mortal. It is a modern day Greek tragedy.  It is a movie to be personally witnessed and contemplated. It is not a Saturday afternoon popcorn venue for friends looking for reprieve from the work week.  There many of those, are prescious few of these. And this one is to be savored like a late night dinner of champagne and lobster. <br /> <br />Buy this version, buy the next version. But enjoy one of the most wonderful and memorable films ever made.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I don't know what kind of feedback I'll get from this, but this is my honest opinion. I have read most of the reviews on KISSOLOGY, and I understand that many of the bootleg tapes have better video and/or audio quality than much of the footage on this compilation. Not trying to be pious or judgemental here AT ALL, so please don't misunderstand me, but let's face it. People, you are not SUPPOSED to have bootleg videos and this stuff is brand new to fans like me. <br /> <br />As a dyed-in-the-wool KISS fan from WAY back, I have often been envious of people (my friends included) who had bootleg footage of KISS, but I just couldn't do it myself, knowing it wasn't right. Call me a prude or whatever you like, that's just the way I felt/feel. Now that KISS has released this footage of their old shows that have been available for years in bootleg form, I have read some reviews panning the new footage as \\"worse than the bootleg videos\\" or \\"If you have the bootlegs, save your money on this DVD\\", etc (paraphrasing).  <br /> <br />Well, as a huge fan who has never bought nor seen the bootleg stuff, I am VERY pleased with this DVD! It is all new to me, and that makes it even more worth the modest price! I suppose in that respect, I have no idea what is missing or altered in this compilation, but I really don't care at all. It's GREAT to see this old, grainy footage of VINTAGE KISS in the form it is in, and I wouldn't trade this DVD for any other DVD straight up. No way! <br /> <br />So again, please don't think me too judgemental. I really don't mean to be. If you have your bootleg videos, go ahead and enjoy them and more power to you. To each his own, I always say. God knows I often wish I had some of those old boots myself at times, but just couldn't pull the trigger. But NOW, I don't need them! This is the REAL STUFF! And I give it 5 stars. Admittedly, not EVERY aspect of this DVD deserves the 5 star treatment. Grainy video quality on the oldest shows, sub-par audio on thosesame shows, but hell, this is KISS as KISS was meant to be, and I LOVE it enough to give it 6 stars if I could! <br /> <br />Happy New Year, KISS Army! Peace.

Ive listened to this album... trying to give it a chance and have found that i just dont get it. American Idiot the song is garbage. however i will be fair and give som credit. \\"Wake Me up When September Ends\\" is a good song, along with, \\"Are We The Waiting\\", \\"Saint Jimmy\\", And \\"Homecomming\\" the rest are just unbearable. IM not one to be very bias on music... if it sounds good i listen to it. but i just cant sit through every track. IM not trying to push my own beliefs on anyone here, if you like this album then good for you, ive always liked green day. Ive been listening to them since 3rd grade. but I must say, Billy Joe has really let me down on American Idiot.
B000FWHVKA|5.0|The Knife slips its blade in slowly in this, their third and eeriest ablum to date.  Their sound has never been so insidious and effective.<br /><br />Most of the songs loom large and unapologetic on a static-heavy foundation of pure electronica.  The Knife experiments with some serious, in-your-face sound changes, most of them involving bizarre vocal arrangements (that sound melted, tweaked, and tweezered) and massive chunks of computerized noise.<br /><br />When they're not infiltrating the nerves with schizophrenic, hyper-active machinery (\\"We Share Our Mother's Health\\" and \\"Like A Pen\\"), they're lulling listeners into dim groves of lyrical whispers (\\"Forest Families\\" and \\"One Hit\\").  This is the kind of album that's so avant-garde, so experimental, so hard to define and yet so insistently familiar that the urge to compare it to other records of its kind is almost unresistible.<br /><br />But, in all honesty, there really is no other record to compare it to.  The techno-militant urgency of \\"Neverland,\\" the winding orchestral phantasms of \\"Marble House,\\" the star-lit brilliance of the title track -- they may play like the distant cousins of Bjork, Massive Attack, Aphex Twin, or the Sneaker Pimps, but they are still indelibly unique.  Fans of electronic music will be more than pleased, and everyone else may just find a few reasons to give the genre a more serious look.
0375507256|5.0|It's hard to know where to start with this book, so I'll do so by saying that of the 130 or so works of fiction I've read so far this year, this is easily among the best. I suppose that's because Mitchell effortlessly blends a number of fictional genres I happen to like, including historical, science, neo-noir, dytopia, farce, and comic. This is done by structuring the book as six separate novellas, each of which is cut in half. The first half of the book presents the first half of each story, in chronological order. Then, the middle of the book is the \\"bridge\\" story, set in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, after which, the second of half of the five other stories unravel in reverse chronological order. To a certain extent this is merely a gimmicky way of presenting six novellas (one character, a composer who is arranging a six-part piece with the same title and structure as the book even admits as much, \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky? Shan't know until it's finished.\\"), but the recurring themes of the mankind's capacity for evil and the man's inhumanity to man and the transience of civilization are what bind it all together.<br /><br />The first story is \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\", and appears as the journal of a San Francisco lawyer in the 1850s who has been traveling in search of a legatee and is now en route home. A stop in the Chatham Islands (near New Zealand), opens his eyes to the both innate cruelty of both native peoples and the colonial system which professes to be saving them. His account, with clear echoes of Melville and Conrad, is found in the library of an aging composer living in Belgium in the 1930s -- which is where the second story takes place. Its unearther is bisexual composer Robert Frobisher, who has insinuated himself into the luxurious home of the decaying blind genius in order to hide out from his numerous creditors. His trials and tribulations are recounted via hilarious scathing letters to an old Cambridge friend which then turn up in the third storyline.<br /><br />This takes the form of a '70s pulp thriller starring a Latina investigative journalist looking into malfeasance at a California nuclear plant. This \\"Luisa Rey Investigation\\" is a very capable thriller which turns up as a manuscript in the offices of a contemporary London vanity publisher. The publisher's story is Kafkaesque farce, as he is incarcerated by person or persons unknown in a retirement home/prison. His attempts to learn who put him there and to escape appear as a film watched by a genetically engineered McDonald's waitress in a dystopic futuristic Korea. This is a very well-realized story worthy of any sci-fi anthology, with overt nods to films ranging from \\"Blade Runner\\" to \\"Soylent Green.\\"<br /><br />The central bridging story, a far-future tale of a boy's post-apocalyptic survival on a Hawaiian island is definitely the weakest, requiring the most heavy lifting on the reader's part due to the constructed slang. In it, a peaceable farmer/herder community are continually at risk from warlike neighbors. An envoy arrives from a technologically advanced group, potentially upsetting the delicate balance of power. This storyline clearly binds it to \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" in Mitchell's attempt to show how human behavior simply cycles back around to established modes. If this all sounds bafflingly complex, it really isn't. What it is is a set of completely immersive stories with distinctive settings, characters, and styles, but common themes. Mitchell is at ease across genre, time, space, gender, race, you name it. The stories can be read for individual enjoyment or one can track the progression of various recurring cues and behaviors as an exploration of the corrupting and dehumanizing nature of power.

This band proudly wears its influences on its sleeves while delivering a fresh sound and brings the energy to new levels. The melodies are hypnotic and the vocalist makes the best of his abilities.

1596912367|5.0|At this point in his career, I don't know if Boyd is capable of writing a bad book. With his past work he's shown himself to be a writer at ease in multiple locations and time frames, and here he plays to that strength with a narrative moving back and forth between 1939 Paris and 1976 England. The story starts in the latter, where single mother Ruth Gilmartin is given a rather shocking manuscript by her aging, Cotswold village-dwelling mother, Sally. It's a well-worn adage that we can never truly know our parents, and Ruth is given prime evidence of this, as her mother's manuscript reveals her true identity. The sharp, white-haired, garden-tending widow grew up as a White Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; in Paris, and was recruited into the British Secret Service in 1939.<br /><br />The story of Sally's three year espionage career in Edinburgh, Belgium, and U.S. are meted out through further manuscript packets over the course of weeks. Anyone with a penchant for spy stories will find the details of this fascinating, from her training in mnemonic tricks and losing six-person tails, to her work in a unit dedicated to planting false stories in newspapers around the world, with the intent of both misleading German intelligence and bringing the U.S. into the war. (This is all based on the very real presence and activities of British intelligence agents in the U.S. during World War II.) However the modern story has its own element of more immediate intrigue, as Sally is convinced that someone is out to get her. Ruth thinks her aged mother is just paranoid, but agrees to try and track down the mysterious man who recruited her almost forty years previously -- if only to prove her wrong.<br /><br />Yes, the mother's doling out of her life story in manuscript installments is a rather clunky device, but Boyd has always had a fondness for having characters speak through letters, diaries, and so forth. And yes, these epistletory devices are always much more fluid and dynamic pieces of writing than any normal person would pen, but Boyd sweeps you along with his elegant prose and good pacing. Some reviewers have criticized the book for an imbalance in interest between the stories of the mother and daughter, however that may well be missing the point. Sure, Ruth is \\"just\\" a English-as-a-second-language tutor with a young son to look after, an everchanging roster of awkward foreign students, and an unfinished history dissertation. But such normalcy serves to both highlight the difference between her life and the secret life of her mother's, and give the reader someone to identify with. This may feel to some as \\"Boyd lite\\" due to the espionage storyline, but such pigeonholing seems to smack more of knee-jerk genre snobbery than anything else. Boyd is among the finest novelists of his time and once again he proves his ability to write female characters better than almost any other male novelist out there.

B000J103PC|4.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is based on the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman's journey of self-discovery through fashion -the clothes and the industry. Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent college grad with ambitions for a career in journalism. Having little luck finding a writing position in New York, Andy interviews for a job as 2nd assistant to the editor-in-chief of \\"Runway\\", a fictional premiere fashion magazine. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the world's most powerful fashion editor, who holds her staff and her favorite designers in a state of perpetual awe and terror, decides to \\"hire the smart fat girl\\". So Andy lands the job \\"a million girls would kill for\\". It seems that the job will kill Andy until she decides to embrace her boss' values and pour herself into it, launching her to professional success and personal turmoil.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a bit confused when it advocates embracing one's vocation and its culture without reservation...but then says Andy should stay true to herself and walk away from it all. But that is easy to overlook, because this is such an enjoyable film. It's an homage to the fashion industry in which the city of New York is a sort of overarching character. Meryl Streep is not to be missed as Miranda Priestly, whose incisive, merciless quips inject some black comedy. The stand-out performance comes from Emily Blunt, however, as Miranda's 1st assistant, a fashionista who both envies Andy's success and depends upon it. Stanley Tucci does a nice turn as \\"Runway\\"'s acerbic but sympathetic fashion director Nigel. These people don't mince words! And that's a real pleasure.<br /><br />\\"Runway\\" magazine is modeled after \\"Vogue\\", where Lauren Weisberger worked as an assistant to editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, the inspiration for Miranda Priestly. The film's view of fashion editors is accordingly optimistic. The truth is that fashion editors are not at liberty to criticize bad designs, because the design houses pay for the ad space -even if they convince themselves otherwise by frowning on the occasional garment. But \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is an entertaining look at one component of the fashion industry. It respects clothes and the people who create a market for them. It conveys why fashion is important, while it encourages us to laugh at the fashion industry's excesses.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features are 5 featurettes, 15 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a Gag Reel (5 min), theatrical trailer, soundtrack promo, and audio commentary. \\"The Trip to the Big Screen\\" (12 min) discusses the character of Andy and Miranda, finding the right tone, and setting the movie in the fashion world with the film's producer, director, and writer. In \\"NYC and Fashion\\" (6 min), the cast, director, producer, and costume designer Patricia Field talk about the role of New York in the movie. \\"Fashion Visionary Patricia Field\\" (9 min) is about the career of designer Patricia Field, including interviews, and how she approached the clothes for this film. \\"Getting Valentino\\" (3 min) is about luring designer Valentino Garavani to appear in the movie, including a brief interview with him. \\"Boss from Hell\\" (2 1/2 min) interviews people on the streets about their crazy  bosses. The audio commentary is by director David Frankel, producer Wendy Finerman, costume designer Patricia Field, screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, editor Mark  Livoisi, and cinematographer Florian Ballhaus.

0131103628|5.0|I think the reviews and high marks are very fitting for this book, for what it is intended to be as noted in the prefaces -- \\"This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C.\\" \\"The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable colleague will help.\\"  <br /> <br />The book is pretty concise, and packs a lot information and examples into the book that are excellent. Even though it is concise, it still does a pretty good job in explaining C and it's constructs. I was especially pleased in the second edition because they expounded a bit more to reach further down to the more inexperienced programmer, like me, to lend a hand. The examples are very good and they all actually work. What also is nice about the examples is that they are very useful in the real world, and pretty much complete, not just snippets -- this book will never really outgrow it's usefullness to you. Additionally, the assignments do a nice job in reenforcing what you have learned and allow you to put into practice the concepts, and even stretch your abilities a bit more.  <br /> <br />So in summary, this book is excellent for the general audience of programmers who want to learn C, and also appropriate for the more inexperienced programmer, and also for the newbie with no programming if s/he is technically inclined, although for the newbie I would probably recommend instead the \\"C primer plus\\". I find myself borrowing someone's \\"C primer plus\\" after I've thought long about, experimented, but was still unclear on some issue that I just didn't quite get from this book. However, if I could only have one C book, this would be it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I am hard on movies about quirky characters and their obligatory \\"dysfunctional\\" families. I've seen too many that are nothing more than chains of tired cliches strung end to end. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\"'s vibrant, genuine characters stand out among quirky indie relationship films. Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a frustrated motivational speaker with high hopes for a book deal. When his 7-year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is accepted in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, the family wants to make sure she has the opportunity to pursue her beauty pageant dreams. But wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) can't drive a stick shift. Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) can't be left alone. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Olive's talent coach. And silent teenaged brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is just put upon. So they all pile into the family's yellow VW minibus to drive Olive 700 miles to California.<br /><br />Owing to Michael Arndt's heartfelt script and its wonderful ensemble cast, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is both hilarious and credible on an emotional level. The characters are active and deliberate, never reactive, and never played for laughs. The interplay of several generations of characters without demeaning or marginalizing any of them always does wonders for relationship dramas. The middle-aged parents, delinquent grandpa, optimistic child, and morose teen are all fully-realized, equally interesting people. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" never feels contrived even though it could hardly be moreso. The characters don't feel like cliches, even though I've seen them before. The family actually functions very well. In the end, I couldn't help liking all of these people and laughing with them all the way to California.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): This is a 2-sided disc with a full screen version on Side A and widescreen on Side B.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is a chaotic, unqualified joy.<br /><br />It's comforting to think that such a family exists. A dysfunctional, eccentric collection of absolute individuals unites, however reluctantly at times, in support of the one nearly-normal member of the family, an irrepressible seven-year-old girl who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. This is not your typical little beauty queen, the miniature adults one sees made up in glittery fluff on parade in front of adoring adults living vicariously off the hype; this is a normal-looking, apparently happy little girl who recognizes her family's various oddities and accepts them as they are - as they all ultimately come to do themselves.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. Greg Kinnear, always a joy, plays the father convinced of his own ability to sell a how-to video on getting where you want to be in the world by being a winner (\\"There are two types of people - winners and losers\\") and who has imbued his daughter with this philosophy. His view is taken with a grain of salt by every other member of the family; the at-wit's-end mother (Toni Collette, another great performance) who is pretty much singlehandedly holding the fort; Grandpa (Alan Arkin, who has made a life's work of memorable quirky roles and this is no exception) who has taken it upon himself to coach his granddaughter on the talent part of her beauty-pageant performance - woefully left to his own devices by her parents, who are lost in their own problems, and who in retrospect should have been paying more close attention to details - and who is an unashamed and unapologetically vulgar old sod who was kicked out of his quarters in elderly housing for heroin use, but who clearly loves the little girl; the older malcontent teenaged brother of the girl, who has taken a vow of silence until he graduates high school and can enter flight school; the mother's brother, Uncle Frank (Steve Carell - this guy is everywhere lately), a professor of Proust, openly gay and battling his own demons, who has joined the family due to a recent suicide attempt; and the little girl herself, winningly played by Abigail Breslin and stuck with the less-than-childlike name of Olive (no slur on the Olives out there; just thought it a singularly weighty nomer for a seven-year-old, but as she has the best outlook of all of them, perhaps that's the point).<br /><br />The family in toto embarks on an expedition to Redondo Beach from Albuquerque in an elderly VW bus that mirrors the overall quirks of its owners; the horn sticks, the clutch gives out; and the family each deals with their own problems. It is a study in the fact that each person's personal trauma is supreme to themselves, if to no one else; though a problem might seem unimportant to all other members of a group, it is insurmountable to the person involved. Olive's mission, however, in an absolutely priceless performance among her peers - in age at least, if not sensibilities - brings a fractured family together as nothing else can.<br /><br />This is one of the strangest feel-good movies I have had the pleasure to watch in a very long time. There isn't a bad performance throughout (catch a cameo by the guy who plays stodgy, know-it-all Hodges in CSI, near the end of the movie; here he plays a really likable staffer at the pageant).

B000EHRVP6|1.0|I can actually only give a review of the first couple of minutes of this movie because that's all <br />I could stand to watch. If they titled this movie based on the single word that seemed to come <br />up most frequently in the poorly written dialog, you migh think it was a trashy porno movie. <br />I could only stand to watch about ten minutes of the movie because I got fed up with the <br />\\"F\\" word coming up every 30 seconds or so. Who wrote the script? Eddie Murphy...? <br />And even if the \\"F\\" word hadn't been used so much, just based on what I saw, I would have <br />probably turned it off out of bordeom anyway.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|A wonderful gem of a film. The cast is superb as dad, mom, daughter, son, and grandpa, trapped together in a road trip in a sunny yellow bus. Hilarious at times (especially the scenes with grandpa, played by Alan Arkin), touching and sad at others, this film touches all the right emotions and makes for a great ride to a hilarious ending at a silly and creepy beauty pageant for little girls. Little Olive (Abigail Breslin) sparkles and charms throughout. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is heartbreaking when his dreams of being a pilot in the Air Force are dashed by the accidental discovery that he is color blind. The characters go in all directions, with Toni Collette providing the binding tie. Excellent movie.

We all want to be caught up out of our ordinary life... Maybe because it is the only true adventure, maybe because that experience makes us feel completely alive... It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon, but that doesn't diminish its value, because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives...<br /><br />Here, Merryl Streep and DeNiro are the kind of people who are ready to take action on an opportunity... Following a chance meeting in a bookshop, pre-Xmas, the two central characters find themselves inexplicably drawn to each other... But both are married... She has a husband, he has a wife and two lovely kids...<br /><br />Both are meant to be together but they are inexperienced, uptight... And neither really knows what to do with his fear, shyness, hesitation, and confusion... On this thread of plot hangs a nice romantic film where two super stars combined their talent to conquer a dry script...<br /><br />Director Ulu Grosbard makes sure there are plenty of subway stations, trains, hot dogs, coffee, driving rainstorm, two adjacent pay phones, walks through the streets, swelling music, and much more for the lovers to get romantic over... His motion picture is strictly traditional, which makes his sensitive film something fresh and entertaining...
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie profoundly moves me....one of my all time favorites! It beautifully illustrates that to be deeply in love is not just bliss, but painful and bittersweet. Although sometimes we all feel like we would like to escape or forget relationships, this love is part of who we are and can never go away . I always cry at the end of this movie and it feels so cleansing. Watch this movie... whether you love it or hate it, the experience is so worth it. And, the music is amazing. Watch it again ....
B00005MFO9|4.0|After his successful direction of \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", Richard Fleisher tried his hand with a new kind of submarine... His \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" ventured upon the unfamiliar seas of the human bloodstream, and carried the magic of miniaturization to its logical limits-the shrinking of four men and a woman to microbe size, making the voyage entirely rough and hazardous...<br /><br />The plot follows a team of three scientists: a surgeon (Arthur Kennedy); his technical assistant (Raquel Welch); the chief of the mission (Donald Pleasance), plus the skipper of the ship William Redfield and a security agent Stephen Boyd for a possible \\"surgical assassination\\"...<br /><br />The interesting submarine (\\"The Proteus\\") is miniaturized by a secret branch called CMDF (Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces) and injected into the bloodstream of a defecting Russian scientist who has suffered brain injury and a coma from an assassination attempt... The crew must navigate to the scientist's brain and destroy the point of damage with a laser blast within a 60-minute time period...<br /><br />Although the plot is a tedious matter of implausible sabotage, \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" is a film of authentic wonder: The fascinating environment of tissues and organs of the human body through which the actors move are life-sized sets exquisitely reconstructed in great detail with amazing artistry...<br /><br />The plot creates a constant era of suspense... The ship and its crew are continually threatened by the system's natural defenses... Leonard Rosenman's futuristic score nicely complements the bizarre on screen happenings: the strange sound of the human blood rushing through arteries; the rhythmical muscular movements of the heart where 'every beat separates the human being from eternity.'<br /><br />With two Oscar Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction, 'Fatastic Voyage' is certainly the most unusual journey into the human body, the first film to portray the vast world of inner space...world of inner space...  <br /> <br />

You can feel the energy of the audience, and if you were at the concert like I was it takes you back in an instant to one of the best concerts I've ever been to.
B000A59PMO|4.0|This is not the sort of show I am usually interested in.  But after reading numerous words of praise, I took the leap.  Now I'm embarassed to say I'm a fifty-something male enamored of the whole Neptune crowd.  What sets this show apart is the great dialogue:  witty without relying on endless stale James Bond-type puns like most \\"witty\\" detective shows. (For example, I'm almost at the point where I have to skip the opening of CSI because of Grissom's \\"cute\\" observation about the crime.) The relationships between the characters are also well developed.  This is no Sopranos, but every meal doesn't have to be filet mignon.  I'm always happy with a high quality cheeseburger.  The first two seasons of Veronica Mars fit the bill.
0618680004|4.0|While the book is interesting and reads rather easily, it often jumps from science to diatribes and anecdotes and then back.  The book seems to be more of a compendium of previous writings or thoughts jumbled together.  It feels more like the dialogue of a couple of drunken academics trying to make the same argument at a neighborhood bar, along with the interspersed attacked on a colleague here and there.    <br /> <br />While I am sympathetic to Professor Dawkins' views, in parts, I took offence to some of his attacks.  If Prof. Dawkins is trying to \\"un-convert\\" the converted, he must be careful not to begin his attempt at un-conversion with insult.   While I do not believe in God, my family does and I could not help but feel a little insulted.  It would be better, to turn a phrase, to still love the believer, but hate the belief.     <br /> <br />I feel that the argument could have been better served by making the divisions in the book more concrete.  For example: The Harm of Religion; Evolution; and \\"Meme\\" or Social Evolution.  In the very least, the final chapter should leave an impression or a summation, instead it leaves the reader wondering what the entire chapter was all about and feeling as though he/she arrived at the appendix 30 pages early.  <br /> <br />So while the book will not win any literary awards, it deserves to be read by all.  Whether one agrees or not, is beside the point, anyone who is religious, agnostic, or atheist, can benefit by learning what one side of the debate has to say. Not learning about the opposing view will only arrest the growth of one's personal beliefs. So read Dawkins, Darwin, Moses, Mathew and Mohammed.   <br /> <br />\\"There is the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance of being right.\\" - J.S. Mill  <br />
0743289412|4.0|I've long admired King's works and spent many a sleepless night staying up to finish one or another of his books.  Lisey's Story was no exception.  It's so rich and colorful and scary and yes, at the same time it is a love story.<br /><br />King has always portrayed the mentally ill with a creepy, too-familiar and yet bizarre twist and he once again does that here.  Scott's father and brother, and Lisey's sister are totally \\"abnormal\\" but hauntingly recognizable.<br /><br />Booya Moon is a fantastic, beautiful, frightening and magical place.  I found myself totally drawn to it; hoping it would soon re-appear in the story and dreading that it would.  You want it to be a fantasyland much like Disney -- an escape from the bad stuff.<br /><br />Once again, Stephen King has created a story and a world that is much like our own, where love is the only weapon that works on the monsters. Maybe a bit cliche as a theme, but it's dressed up in new clothes here.  And, old clothes.  And it's naked, too.<br /><br />I gave this one four stars just because in some places it got a bit boring and long, which I don't usually experience in King's books.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|The Nun's story is one of those films that leaves an impression like no other. It is one of the most, if not the most, powerful film I have ever seen dealing with religion, personal conflict and the will to keep going. <br /> <br />The Nun's story follows the story of the young Gabrielle van der Mal (Audrey Hepburn) who decides to become a nun. We see how she becomes one of many, dealing with religion, personal feelings and her obligations. She becomes a nun in hospitals, studying to be able to go to Congo, where she becomes the assistent of a Doctor. But even though Gabrielle, now named sister Luke, wants to do everything right and according to the rules a nun must live to, the inner struggle just becomes stronger and stronger. <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn once again delivers. She acts extremely powerful and is totally believable as the struggeling sister. This was her prove to the world back in the 1950's, that she also could act in stead of just looking pretty on the screen. Her third oscar nomination followed for this role, which she sadly didn't won, but definitely deserved.  <br />The rest of the cast also acts great. Peter Finch potrays the doctor sister Luke gets assigned to. He acts convincingly and gives a satisfying performance.  <br />The film also features a fantastic supporting cast which have been rightly selected by the filmmakers and helps bringing the story to life even more.  <br /> <br />The locations, are from dark and sad to colorfull and bright. The beauty of the exotic Congo has been magnificently captured on camera and gives the film a fantastic atmosphere and look.  <br /> <br />Next to Hepburn's beautiful performance, the thing that grabbed me the most was the story. It is extremely powerful and emotional. It even had a kind of thriller edge to it sometimes. Those moments made me wispher things to the screen like: \\"No no no, don't do that\\".  <br />The story just pulls you in and keeps you there till the very end of the film. It is drama from the highest level.   <br /> <br />Wonderful filmmaking, beautiful locations, a fasenating Hepburn and one of the most powerful stories I have ever seen.  <br />And that last shot, those last few seconds of the film will always be burned in my memory.  <br />
1594200823|5.0|I was scared to read this book. Already a health-conscious and picky eater, I worried that with the knowledge in the book I wouldn't be able to maintain the ignorance required to eat the occasional candy bar or slice of bacon. And I already have a hard enough time eating enough calories in a day. <br /> <br />But it turns out that ignorance is not bliss, and as Pollan states in the introduction, \\"this is a book about the pleasures of eating, the kinds of pleasure that are only deepened by knowing,\\" and he is completely correct. Your body and the earth will thank you for acting on some of the knowledge that can be obtained from reading this. Not only is it fascinating, it is a page turner and an easy read. Pollan has done all the work of connecting ideas and following thoughts to their many logical conclusions.  He is one of the most curious, thoughtful and empathetic writers I have ever read. Now buy this book.
0393061434|3.0|While I'm a huge fan of Wozniak the engineer, I wasn't thrilled with iWoz the book.  The writing is very simple and very repetitive - you could condense the book to half the size without omitting anything.  Also, I felt that many of the topics discussed lacked follow through.  For example, I was drawn in to a subject like the creation of \\"CL 9\\", only to abruptly leave the topic and move on to other times. <br /> <br />That being said, as a memoir, the book succeeds in revealing Woz's personality and what makes him tick.  It was interesting enough to not only lead me through the book, but to pursue other perspectives about the beginnings of Apple and his relationship with Steve Jobs. <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, \\"iWoz\\" is worth reading, but don't set the bar too high.
0064407667|3.0|Let me mention right away that there are some things in this book that I believe are not appropriate for children.  Molotov Cocktails and polygamists are mentioned, and the entire premise is based upon a grown man wanting to marry a 14 year old girl.  I feel that marketing a book with this kind of content to youngsters is in bad taste.<br /><br />Aside form that, the plot of the book is well-thought-out and there are some pretty funny jokes here and there.  Yet, overall, the book is a downer.  I assumed the disclaimer on the back was sarcastic, but it really isn't.  This book is only for people who are into seeing depressing stuff.  The mood of \\"The Bad Beginning\\" somewhat resembles the helplessness featured so prominently in the film \\"Teenage Crime Wave.\\"<br /><br />Rant of the Day: What's the deal with these recent kids books defining difficult words every four pages and promoting book-reading to the point of shamelessness?  I first noticed this in \\"The Tale of Desperaux\\" but see it much more pronounced in \\"The Bad Beginning.\\"  I certainly won't be happy if EVERY adventure book, mystery book, comedy book, wizard book, etc. for children MUST fulfill some kind of educational quota.<br /><br />\\"The evil dragon raised up its ferocious paw to slay the gallant knight, and then....  By the way kids, you know what gallant means?  Let's take a mood-killing timeout from the thrilling climax of the book to do a little vocabulary!  Oh, and the knight LOVED to read books in the library too, just so you know!\\"<br /><br />To the author's credit, he makes good use of humor in his definitions of certain words.  He never explains what the deal is with the Count's eye decorations, though.  Obviously he intends to explain them later in the series.

B00004W510|5.0|Enough has been written, and some of it with an eloquence that is to literature and history as the music is to its musical context. Greil Marcus was amongst those shouting from the rooftops when the music first surfed the waves, and I read him for his wowing erudition and historic reach. I know the time and place where I first heard 'Jemima Surrender', and 'When You awake', for instance. And there aren't too many moments like that in a life. People argue about the relative merits of the two albums, The Brown and The Big Pink (with its anonymous looking cover and a bit of Bob naif painting on the cover). I don't seperate them. There's a slightly rockier feel to the numbers here. But the atmospherics are, unsurprisingly, similar. I've always preferred the aching isolation of,'Whispering Pines' over the more biblically inclined,'I Shall Be released' for the haunting Manuel vocals; but what a pathetic quibble. With tragic prescience, he teeters on the rim of flighty transience and earthly entrapment. Helm's command of 'The Night of Old Dixie' and with Manuel,'King Harvest' replete with righteous indignation are absolutely thrilling. Was there ever a more desperate tone in rock than Manuel's in this disturbing utterance of Union disenchantment? These songs, Rag Mama Rag, Rockin' Chair etc. are those I coached my eldest daughter with and the fruit is in our choral joys on car trips and around the campfire, for as long as we both exist. Whatever, if you were compiling your own greatest Band double CD, you'd be hard put to exclude any from these CDS. I did this, having read Barney Hoskins rather jaundiced bio on The Band(in that he shared the opinion of Helm about Robertson, it seems), and followed his lead with a compilation. A bit of Stagefright ('Daniel', 'Masterpiece','Life is a Carnival' and the paranoia of 'Stagefright' itself)),'Arcadian Driftwood' and 'It Makes No Difference' from Islands get a guernsey. There are other things that lesser bands would settle for. Butnot after these crescendo moments. I rate 'Moondog Matinee' up there too, to the point of not pirating a thing or spoiling its integrity. Again, Manuel's brilliant rendition of Sam Cooke's,'River' is an angelic achievement and never fails to move me. And the cover art? (setting the template for a host of country rock American bands of the 70s as well as their musical agenda: the complete retro parody being The Eagles,'Desperado'). The lads (and there's a host of others from the shoot that have turned up over the reisssues) looked to have freshened up for some Matthew Brady Civil War reportage, which cleverly twinned with the archaic musical themes. How my mother re coiled when I set about rummaging the thrift stores for 30s and 40s cast-offs from deceased estates, in a painful effort to mimick my heroes.
B00007AJF8|3.0|I give this film:  3-1/2 stars.    I would have given this movie 4 or even 5 stars but I found the explanation given for the phenomena of entering & 'being' John Malkovich to be weak (Even for a fantasy story).  i.e.  I felt the primary explanation for this, given by Orson Bean's character, was a big let down.      On the plus side the film does have many funny and unusual elements.  For example:     John Malkovich playing himself under such bizarre circumstances.  Charlie Sheen plays a wonderfully exaggerated version of himself.  Cameron Diaz made-up to look so dowdy (She plays a pet shop manager who keeps all her physically and emotionally damaged animals at home with her).  A master puppeteer who tries to present creepily morbid skits as 'kid shows'.  An office building with a strange and silly 7-1/2 floor (The building has crow-bar in the elevator so you can pry open the doors between the 7th and 8th floors).  A secretary with a college degree in speech therapy who doesn't seem to understand what people are saying to her.
0743454537|4.0|I started this book at 11pm last night and finished it at 7am!  I couldn't put the book down. =)  I kept trying to find a place to pause, but I found I just couldn't..I had to find out what was going to happen next.   <br /> <br />The book is powerful and very well written, and deals with the topic of genetic engineering and organ donation in a very intelligent and easy-to-understand manner.  You easily connect with all the characters, they come alive on the page and your mind--and you find yourself in their shoes as they wrestle with difficult decisions. <br /> <br />That being said, there were a few things that bugged me (hence the four star rating I gave).  First, I felt that Anna's vernacular in the book was a little bit advanced for a 13 year old.  I realise the author wanted to show Anna as being advanced for her age, but she used vocabulary most 13 year olds never use, and I think she needed to \\"teenage it down more\\". <br /> <br />The ending was a bit over-the-top and hence unbelievable.  The author said in a Q&A that she did it because it felt the most realistic--but it felt incredibly unrealistic and \\"Hollywood\\".   <br /> <br />Overall though, I recommend this book to anyone because it's one you simply can't put down.  Despite the negatives I listed, the book is a gem and I can't wait to pass it on.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Roger Ebert mentioned in his review that there appeared to be two endings to this film.      The first \\"ending\\" happening about 1/2 hour before the film's actual end.   If the movie had ended at that point (With the lead character deciding to futilely wait for the Blue Fairy on the ocean's floor) it would have been a much bleaker film.     But this 'first' ending seems to better fit the major theme the film was developing up to that point.  That theme being:     Despite the lead character's intelligence he could not see beyond his 'programming'.           The character doggedly clung-on to his highly unrealistic beliefs and dreams to the point that they were going to destroy him.     All he had to do was 'let-go' of these silly beliefs/dreams and he could lead a wonderful life. (This is, in essence, what the William Hurt character told him.)     Many parallels can be drawn between this character's dilemma and what is going on in our world today (e.g. Religious fanatics willing to be suicide bombers.)     **** mild spoiler below ****    But the film's actual ending involved futuristic alien-like androids creating a fake world in which the lead character's fantasies could come true, so that this character could 'die' in peace.  In other words, these 'aliens' determined that there was no use in trying to change the lead character's mind and that the humane thing to do would be to let him die believing in a lie.    I have read that this ending was actually Kubrick's idea, but I some how doubt that Kubrick would have portrayed it as such a wonderful and joyous event, as Spielberg has.
078322933X|1.0|Some movies are so bad they're good.  This isn't one of them.  This movie was the kind terrible that I wish I could undergo selective electroshock therapy to erase any knowledge of its existence.  I like all the stars in the movie, but now this movie is going to taint the experience when I see them in future movies.<br /><br />For a movie that faithfully follows a time-tested formula, it manages to tweak everything just wrong.  The creepy psycho homicidal maniac isn't an interesting kind of creep.  While you obviously hope he gets what's coming to him, waiting until the end of the movie is far too long.  And what sort of accent or dialect is that supposed to be?<br /><br />I wish I would have stopped watching before the family dog was beheaded.  I wish I had never seen it.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.  Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon--a wonderful actress in the right role--you will wish you hadn't seen her in this dreck.
B00005JPCD|5.0|Having scanned this section, I am profoundly disappointed at how critical people have been on \\"HAPPY FEET\\". However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  The Box Office speaks for itself.  It is a gorgeous movie and the animation is simply enchanting.  The movie is rated PG.  It does contain material that may be disturbing to those old enough to understand what it is saying, but that material is real.  It is occurring.  Man is destroying the planet.  Yes, there is a message in the movie, but tell me a kid's movie that doesn't have a message?  Whatever that message may be?  The music is wonderful (involving the cream of the crop of singers) and I bought the soundtrack.  The voice-overs are superb with a stellar cast.  Just looking at Mumble's little face and hearing his voice is enough to make the hardest cynic melt, and as George Miller said in a \\"making of\\" ... if the movie makes you want to reach out and touch the fluff, we've succeeded.  I certainly wanted to reach out and touch the fluff.  There are many messages in this movie, and unfortunately, they are true.  If you are different in this world, you can feel exiled, humans are raping the sea and it does focus on the power of conservation. Mumble's \\"difference\\" in the end, are played out as a happily ever after finale.  Conservation is so important - otherwise these creatures won't be around for generations to see them - even in a zoo or aquarium.  I would thoroughly recommend this movie to kids and adults.  You go away feeling moved and upbeat ... and wanting to see those little faces as much as possible.
B000001GK9|5.0|This is a very great performance, but not one that I turn to all that often. Even in its \\"Karajan Gold\\" edition, the sound is less than ideal. It's also sort of a Brucknerian approach - very marmorial. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but I prefer the quicker tempi and slightly sharper textures in Abbado's Berlin remake (fits on a single disc too). Also, for this type of approach, I feel that Bertini does an even better job of capturing the zen-like, \\"otherwordliness\\" of the slow and quiet passages sprinkled throughout the piece. Bertini's is also just better recorded, but you can only get it by purchasing the box of his entire cycle. Still, all that considered, I think that any budding Mahler enthusiast should hear this Karajan performance at least once. It's recoreded somewhat upfront, which only goes to highlight the huge dynamic range Karajan frequently got out of any work. I once saw Karajan do the Bruckner 5th in Vienna, and I absolutely thought that the Musikverein was going to come tumbling down upon all of us - all of that with an orchestra that's no larger than that in the Brahms first! Come to think of it, \\"go for the Gold\\" - you NEED to hear it at least one time.
B00006IX0R|4.0|Besides the songs being shorter, for people who like the Cranberries rather than just like a couple Cranberries songs, I feel a compilation is not the best way to go.  For myself, of my top 20 Cranberries songs, only 6 appear on this compilation.  I don't fault the people who put the CD together.  I just think it's tougher to categorize Cranberries songs compared to songs from other groups.  The individual CDs contain so many secret gems.  And while my gems will be different than yours, it's almost certain that if you like most of the songs on this compilation, you'll find even more you like that aren't contained in this shortened list.

B00000B9BD|5.0|Although, I'm not too crazy about the track \\"Benedictus\\", nor the silly little \\"Hey Little Man\\" tracks, I do think that everything else on this album of \\"Grave New World\\" are the strongest, most important recordings that the Strawbs ever did.  It is certainly the Strawbs best line-up of their most important personnel.<br /><br />\\"Queen of Dreams\\" is a great psychedelic folk song.  \\"Heavy Disguise\\" sounds very Beatle-ish.  \\"New World\\" is probably Dave Cousins most angry song.  \\"The Flower and the Young Man\\" is a beautiful folk ballad.  And \\"Tommorrow\\" represents the distance that folk \\"hard rock\\" can achieve.  \\"On Growing Older\\" is a great short piece about simply that: grower older.  And the last three tracks of the original album are just warm and fuzzy, beautiful but slightly hypnotic, psychedelic folk music and Progressive Rock.  This is one of the last Strawbs albums that I bought when I was collecting Strawbs albums back in the seventies.  Who would have thought that their best album would have been the one I bought last from A&M Records.  After this album came \\"Bursting At The Seams\\", \\"Hero and Heroine\\", \\"Ghosts\\", and then A&M's last album from the Strawbs, \\"Nomadness\\".<br /><br />After their \\"Nomadness\\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts.  But none of this music ever really went to pop radio.  It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M days.  Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after they left A&M.  Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \\"Deep Cuts\\" and \\"Burning for You\\".  There are a few good tunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable.<br /><br />The album afterwards, called \\"Deadlines\\" ended strong.  Their songs \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" and \\"Words of Wisdom\\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs ever.<br /><br />Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years.  Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums.  In 1988, their album \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" and 1991's \\"Ringing Down the Years\\" are both pretty good.  I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \\"Nomadness\\".<br /><br />But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to lose their appeal once again.  What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep re-recording earlier songs, like he thinks he's improving on them.  I wish he wouldn't do this.  In 2002, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together called \\"Hummingbird\\".  Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in 1971 to join Yes and to do solo projects.  And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some re-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday.<br /><br />Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album.  All the other members just came and went over the years.  But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M years (1969-1975).  If you can find it, look for their double CD called \\"Halcyon Days\\" (the US version).  It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package.  In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M have no intentions of releasing their albums separately.  You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have.<br /><br />I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD.

Hey, maybe if enough people feel like Mr. Dawkins, he can be the new prophet for atheism.   He appears to think he is a god because he obviously has all the answers. <br /> <br />Read this book to see what other people think.  It's an eye opener because he is such a thought leader in the evolution world.......evolution+atheism+Dawkins=   Dawlutionism, the new religion for today's non-believers.  He has made me think, if this is a leader in the Darwin camp, then ID may very easily have a chance. <br /> <br />What happens when you die? <br />What is the origin of the species?   <br />Dawkins can't seem to answer these just yet. <br /> <br />Ratings based on the following: <br />1-content <br />4-ease of reading <br />4-interesting <br />2-author credibility <br /> <br />I will be reading more of his books on evolution to see if they are more informative or more ranting.  <br />

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I really like the renditions Sarah McLachlan does of traditional Christmas carols and her original song is beautiful.  I played it during a holiday party and many of my guests liked and asked about the music and wanted to get one for themselves.  If you like her music you will not be disappointed by this new collection.
6304493681|5.0|I would like to start off by saying I've seen Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2ng Gig. I figured the movie was worth a watch and I was in for a surprise. I loved the music, it was very soothing throughout all of the series. The action scenes were well placed and nothing gets me more hyped then watching cyborg cops battle cyborg villains. The story is truly complex and many deep themes are involved. Such as political corruption and real world issues evident in the real today. I also like the detailed backgrounds and the character designs. Visually, everthing was stunning, especially the fight scene at the end (I don't want to ruin it though). Only two anime movies have captivated me this much, Appleseed and Akira. And dare I say the overall visual representation in my opinion is better than that of Akira's.
B00005JPBD|5.0|Pedro Almod&oacute;var is this viewer's favorite film creator.  His ability to wrangle humor, pathos, core feelings, endlessly fascinating characters, color, design, musical montage - all the elements of one who is in charge of every aspect of the final product - is matchless.  He has evolved from the wonderfully madcap early films that continue to appeal today to the profoundly moving, human, verismo touched with surrealism stories that now grace the screens.  VOLVER is a crown jewel in his growing flock of cinematic achievements.<br /><br />Almod&oacute;var both wrote and directed this story about women, a tale that embraces his obvious profound admiration for the Feminine while fleshing out a group of characters about whom we care deeply.  It is a moment in the lives of several women whose pasts have been in some way abused by men.  Raimunda (and extraordinary Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) is a working mother whose husband Pedro (Antonio de la Torre) is an unemployed slob, a worthless man whose misbehaviors include attempted molestation of Paula (Yohana Cobo), the fourteen-year-old daughter, who accidentally kills Pedro in his attack.  Raimunda takes the blame, hides the body in the freezer, and continues her life of work and caring for not only Paula, but her very elderly aunt T&iacute;a Paula (Chus Lampreave) who is apparently being cared for by neighbor Agustina (Blanca Portillo) - who has been diagnosed with incurable cancer -  but who is actually cared for by the 'ghost' of Raimunda's deceased mother Irene (Carmen Maura).  A friend of Raimunda's asks her to care for his restaurant while on a vacation, a potential burden Raimunda turns into a successful eatery venture for a crew filming a movie.  Raimunda's sister Sole (Lola Due&ntilde;as), a quiet hairdresser, discovers that the 'ghost' Irene is her real mother who has been in hiding since her supposedly incendiary death, takes her in disguised as a Russian to help her beauty parlor business, and understands that Irene wanted to return to correct some sad moments in the past, lies that must be confessed if her daughters and granddaughter are to have meaningful lives.  It is the magical way that each of these women interacts to share needs, buried secrets and pains and support each other that makes this multilayered film glow with an aura that only Almod&oacute;var can create.<br /><br />To say more would break the spell for those who have not seen the film. Be assured that Almod&oacute;var has not written a tragedy: his ever-present flamenco obsession  (here a song beautifully sung by Estrella Morente but inhabited by Cruz!) his preoccupation with color, his flare for outrageous comedic scenes, his artistic camera angles, and his use of amazing graphics during the titles are intact and some of his best here.  While the performances of Cruz, Maura, Due&ntilde;as, Portillo and Cobo are astonishingly fine, all of the ancillary characters are beautifully realized.  The musical score by Alberto Iglesias and the cinematography by Jos&eacute; Luis Alcaine are Oscar worthy  also.

0380715430|4.0|I got this book after having read a few of Bryson's other works.  His style is that of a sarcastic crumedgeon, but it can be really entertaining-- if you're on his side. <br /> <br />Some of the review are pretty harsh.  Overly so, if you ask me.  Take this book for what it is.  If you want a scholarly, well-researched, impeccable presentation of the development of the English language, this isn't the place to find it.  But if you're just looking for a light introduction to linguistics, this is a fine book, especially if you wouldn't mind reading a few funny jabs made at the expense of languages and their speakers. <br /> <br />Maybe there are errors in this book.  That's fine with me.  I'm not a linguist (and neither is Bryson), and I have no intention of ever becoming one, so I don't see much harm in a couple of mistakes.  But if I were an expert in this field, I'm sure they would irk me, to say the least. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this is, first and foremost, an entertaining book, rather than scholarly.  And on that note, I thought it was a big success.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I didn't like Hostel. The premise is frightening. The idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it, is a great concept for a film. It's just too bad that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be.<br /><br />It starts off like \\"Euro-trip\\" or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies.(YAWN) Lots of fake boobs and characters acting idiotic, in a fake atmosphere. (CAUGH) Scenes in dance clubs that don't look realistic. You know, the types of places where people are dancing to loud music, but somehow can talk to each other in a normal tone of voice and everything is brightly lit so you can see all the movie extras pretending to dance in the background.(BORNING)  Just like all the clubs, I've ever been to, right?(YAWN) Anyway, this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts, giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main characters.<br /><br />Then it turns into the horror film it should be. The scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation, but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffective.<br /><br />Then the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that's played out, for the most part, for laughs. Kids paid in bubble gum help the good guy get away by smashing the bad guys heads in with rocks as they chew away and blow bubbles. (???) The two girls and guy who set them up are easily killed when they luckily appear in front of the getaway car. The man that killed his friends just happens to be on the train on the way home so he can kill him and somehow not get blood on himself, and then continue on his way. So is the movie supposed to be realistic, scary, or funny? Its falls short of any of these things. Eli Roth needs to pick one and do it.<br /><br />The music is terrible. Not in the fact that the music itself isn't good, but for the fact that, A: it doesn't fit the movie, and 2: There's way too much of it. There's a scene where the Characters are merely walking across a courtyard, and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in Harry Potter. Completely out of place and distracting, further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scared.<br /><br />I gave \\"Hostel\\" a 2 out of 5 for a frightening concept, and the puke was a nice touch. . .

B00001NFHU|3.0|There's enough good music to make one disk of quality, but instead they made a double of mixed music, some of which I could have made myself late on a Saturday night.  1983, by Hopper is terrible, I guess the writing was on the wall for him in neon.  Chloe is excellent, as is the other Ratledge studio number.  Ten minutes of the live half is worth listening to.  If you don't this post-Wyatt period, buy As If... which contains Chloe, but then you'll miss Pigling Bland.  It contains Kings and Queens to make up for this.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Another great 80s movie I grew up watching.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.<br /><br />There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Wes, Mikey and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.<br /><br />The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.<br /><br />The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell<br /><br />Coosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.<br /><br />The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever has friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it.ine of the movie is so true. Do we really ever has friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it.

But, he also composed some incredibly catchy tunes in this hard-bop style.  \\"D-Natural Blues\\", \\"Mr. Walker\\", \\"West Coast Blues\\", and my favorite \\"Four-on-Six\\",have all become standards and are played here with elegance, logic and a tremendous sense of swing.

1582701709|5.0|I'm new at this thought business, but it makes perfect sense to me.  My friend gave me the cd as a gift, and I love it because it makes me feel good.  I also love books by Joel Osteen and Emmett Fox.  Joel's books are current day, and he definitely understands the thought process, as Emmett did when he wrote his books 70 years ago.  Bill Wilson, the founder of AA also understood the power of thought.  None of this is new, but The Secret presents the thought process in a way that the average person can understand.
B00005JOLI|2.0|I read a few chapters of the book, then stopped because the dialogue was so dull. I figured the movie would be better.  Well, the movie seemed like a teenage boy's simple idea of fantasy.  Dragons and their riders were killed many years ago and an evil king took over the kingdom. All hope is gone, for there are no more dragons or dragonriders. A young (17-year-old) farmboy named Eragon finds a stone.  The stone hatches a helpless baby dragon. Unbelievably, a few days later, the dragon has a telepathic voice, is quite huge, and loyal as a dog. Eragon is just a farmboy, he doesn't want to be a grand rider. Brom, a uncle-like storyteller, teaches Eragon a few snippets about being a dragon-rider. Brom and Eragon flee the farm, chased by evil bad guys. Watching the movie was just like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, David Edding's Belgarion series - a young farmboy has a destiny (here, a dragon), and a mysterious old man teaches him the ways of life while they flee the bad guys. <br /> <br />Eragon is lauded throughout the whole movie as a destined hero, but I thought he seemed outright stupid. Eragon is bonded to the last dragon in the world. If a dragonrider is killed, his dragon dies too. Eragon is also a farmboy who can't fight. Yet Eragon keeps on rebelling against the wise Brom and running to fight evil Urgals who can kill him (and therefore his dragon) in a heartbeat. Then Eragon gets a dream from a captured elf (a young teenage girl who looks like any human, except she wears feathers in her hair) and of course, he runs out to rescue her and imperils his dragon. Brom tries to get Eragon to understand how important it is that Eragon stays alive so the last dragon stays alive too, but Eragon has no head for strategy and only knows that he is smart and strong enough to save this girl from whatever unknown is holding her. Talk about overconfident and stupid. He should at least try to learn more about his enemy before literally walking into his lair. <br /> <br />Eragonis actually quite annoying.  He's disrespectful, ignorant, selfishly reckless and can't see beyond the end of his nose. He is really, really cocky.  Once Eragon is on his own, he overacts like he's a confident 30-year old leader and only then, after the fact, does he start to talk respectfully of Brom. Eragon is also annoying in his patriarchal attitude towards his dragon. At one point, his dragon tries to reason with him, and his response is, \\"I'm the rider, and I say we go\\". Hence, they go. Hm, arrogant and treats his dragon like property?  The entire story is populated by evil goons, middle-aged men, a dragon, Eragon, and two teenage beauties (of course).  Both teenage girls are the tanned, sweaty, heavy make-up, super-skinny kind, with bony faces like you'd see on a magazine cover. Aren't elves supposed to look ethereal or at least not quite human? <br /> <br />The scenery is beautiful, very mountainous and vast. The hardest part of the movie was the dialogue; it was very inane. Perhaps the cheesiest line was, \\"...into the sky...to win or to die!\\". There's no humour or interesting conversation between any characters. There's little to no camaraderie. Eragon is annoying and has no manners (he gets a nice set of armour or someone saves his life, and he doesn't even say thanks!). He'd be a lot more interesting if he showed any humility. Either he's rebelling against being a rider or he's confident that he can take on anyone. If he were smarter, he'd be training with his dragon on how to be a better fighter on horseback, or practicing his swordplay. The story relies on the natural-born ability theory of power. Eragon doesn't need to practice riding maneouvres/swordplay/magic - it just comes naturally to him because he's the chosen one! Unlike Luke Skywalker, Frodo and Belgarion, Eragon doesn't really try to improve his skills, because of course, he was born with what he needs - or so the movie suggests.  Once Eragon realizes he can use magic, Brom tells him to use it as a last resort, and of course, being a good listener,  Eragon uses magic over and over again.  The intelligent, telepathic dragon sounds like a loyal dog with very little personality or assertiveness with her rider - she meekly does what he tells her to do. The evil king doesn't sound evil at all (he has a very ordinary-joe voice). Over all, I'd have to give it 2 stars for the scenery and computer generated dragon.  The hero was ignorant, arrogant and had no manners, the dragon wasn't treated like an equal, and the dialogue was terrible. It really seems like a simple kid's fantasy - there's little depth or originality in this movie.

0143034901|4.0|'The Shadow of the Wind' is certainly an enjoyable mystery.  However the mystery itself (involving a little known writer whose works mystically draws a teenager into a web of bizarre intrigue), while at times quite creative, ultimately poops out.  So what keeps the reader motivated?  I would say two factors: its location, and characterizations.<br /><br />The author is obviously in love with Barcelona, where the mystery takes place.  His rich descriptions of the city and its people are most captivating.  Fortunately the author doesn't get too carried away.  Since the story takes place right after the Spanish Civil War he also highlights the misery of its poor citizens and clearly points out the corruption which poisoned most everyone.<br /><br />Now are for the characterizations, .. wow!  All characters are so carefully drawn, be they charming, rotten, funny or morose.  The dialog and humor expressed by these characters is uniformly terrific.<br /><br />However The Shadow of the Wind is not a classic by any means.  The ending is disappointing (, after an especially strong build up).  And the prose itself has lapses, either due to limitations of the author's skills, poor English translation, bad editing ... or all the above.<br /><br />Bottom line: certainly a worthwhile read!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This is a cute, romantic and dramatic movie that is really unusal but done very well.  I love the Sandra and Keanu combination.  They click really well and the chemistry between them is like a Meg and Tom chemistry - they belong together on the screen. <br />Some parts of this are predictable, and some will leave you with your jaw wide open when you see it all unfold.  It's a great and cute story that is probably more of a chick flick than anything else.  I thought the special effects were good (especially when they were both in the park) and while at first you might be confused and frustrated by not understanding where it is going - be patient because when it all comes together, you'll realise that it was worth the ride.  Really well done and a new fast favourite of mine.  Enjoy.
B000003N89|5.0|Most of the songs here are unfamiliar to me. But in every track one hears the remarkable singing voice of Krall. She is one of those singers like Streisand who makes the voice a musical instrument. She  moves  us in so many subtle ways. And there is something about the quality of her voice, its fullness, its beautiful timbre. She seems also to have such control of what she is doing , and she is always making it interesting with new little riffs here and there. She is the best 'new singer' I have heard in years.<br /><br />Just a remarkable singer who it is  pleasure to hear.
0962477060|5.0|Being a player for longer than I care to admit, I can only say that I wish this book was around when I began playing guitar all those years ago. Were I to be elitist about it, I could say that Fretboard Logic does have many holes in the information presented (as some of the other reviews have pointed out). That is a valid comment, but not really a fair one. What book or series of books truly DOES cover everything that you need to know to learn an instrument? Conversely, the truly casual player wanting to simply learn a few chords and strum simple, open chords may actually find that this series is more information than they need.    Fretboard Logic is a very pragmatic method of thinking about the fretboard, scales, and chords. It does NOT teach theory in much detail (nor does it profess to do so).    If you are looking for information to help you communicate with other musicians in a theoretical sense, this is NOT the book for you. There are countless books out there for music theory...My favorite is \\"Edly's Music Theory for Practical People\\" by Ed Roseman.    What the Fretboard Logic series of books will provide is very pragmatic information that you can use to get a fast grip on the layout of the guitar fretboard (pun not intended). It could be described as a wide-angle view of the fretboard. Using several simple patterns, aptly called the \\"CAGED\\" system, you can find useful chord voicings all over the fretboard and get a handle on scales and lead patterns. It pulls together a lot of little bits of information that you probably already have floating about in your head, if you have been playing for any length of time. That was the case for me, at any rate.    I gave this a five-star rating for what it IS, not for what it isn't. Unfortunately, the name is a bit misleading in that it is called a \\"Method\\" series. It actually would be best described a supplemental information that works well in conjunction with most any method series. My personal recomendations for method books would be the \\"Hal Leonard Guitar Method\\" for true beginners or \\"A Modern Method for Guitar\\" by William Leavitt, for the more advanced player.    The bottom line is that in order to be a truly proficient musician, in addition to Fretboard Logic, you will need to learn:  The notes on the fretboard... yes all of them  Music theory  Site Reading (yes, standard notation, not just TAB)  Develop good relative pitch (ear training)  Scale and chord construction  Harmony  How to work WITH a band (very important) instead of being a lose cannon  Guitar technique  LEARN THE STANDARDS in whatever genre you chose  Improvisation    The list could go on and on, but my point is that this book is not a silver bullet but rather is a goldmine of pragmatic information, if taken in the correct context. There is a very good reason that many professional instructors teach the CAGED system in private lesson. It is the quickest way I have found to begin learning your way around a guitar fretboard.    It is also important to keep your ultimate musical goal in mind. If music will be a hobby and not a profession (or \\"semi-profession\\"), the Logic series may take you as far as you need to go, especially if you don't intend to play along with others very much. There is nothing wrong with that. It just means that things like theory and site reading (for example) will not be as important to you as they would to a session player or gigging musician.     If you keep all this in mind, you will NOT be sorry you bought this series of books. I have never found a better roadmap of the fretboard (in a broad view) than Fretboard Logic. There simply is no better way to pull together all the little pieces than studying these books. They simply are not THE only books you will need, if you want to be truly proficient.    RHB

B00005JKNF|5.0|The Film    Gosford Park is a magnificent country estate owned by Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his bored trophy wife Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) they have extended a hand of hospitality to their relations and friends to join them for a shooting party weekend. People of consequences gather for a bit of sucking up, bringing their personal valets and maids behind them to jump to their every whim. For life above stairs Lords, Ladies and any other hangers on all seem locked in their own boredom flocking and circling like vultures trying to remain civil to others while flushing out their position and rank in society and excising it whenever possible. Everyone  has one mission for the weekend to see how rich they can stay, so they can remain to keep their life of boredom. Above stairs is full of talk; each eccentric visitor has their own story.....and a motive.    Meanwhile in the kitchens and corridors below-stairs the servants run around for the comfort of their employees, filled to the brim with bustling mess, gossip and duties all keeping them extremely busy. While some servant's duties bring them above stairs they remain discreet and in their place, although their all eyes and ears they pretend in front of the upper curst that their antics just didn't happen. Again below stairs every servant has their own skeletons and story.    Events of the weekend begin to bridge generations, class, sex and personal tragedy this finally leads to a midnight murder, the fact being it's a whodunit but the real question lingers in the whole household, Does anyone seem bothered?    My Notes on the Film    Directed by Robert Altman, I love this film it's just wonderful; before I go any further into the mention of cast, I must add Gosford Park is meant to be a satirical film although I didn't realize that until I got into the film, I begun to treat it as just that, although part comedy and part murder mystery the focus of this film is based on the characters and every character has their moment in this film. It's about the goings on above and below stairs in the 1930's with many, many stories of different lives weaved into it, best thing to do would be to sit back and enjoy it, let the film and story line wash over you. Although there is a murder, let that take the back seat with so much else flowing through this film the murder takes the smallest role let it remain a piece of irony.    Cast    Where do I begin.... fantastic cast, a lot of British acting talent in this film, two wonderful actress really stood out, (The Two English Dames)  Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith both excelled their talents in this film Mirren portrays Mrs Wilson the perfect servant who's a respected embittered housekeeper and Maggie Smith as Constance, the cash strapped Grand Dame. From the male leads a stand out for me was Jeremy Northam portraying the suave visiting celebrity Ivor Novello his just marvellous.    The rest of the cast would be either British or American, all are equally brilliant, pulling together to keep it really entertaining, some faces are more familiar than others Ryan Phillippe, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Kelly Macdonald, Richard E Grant, Clive Owen, Derek Jacobi, Emily Waston, Kirstin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, even Stephen Fry makes a small apperance, The whole cast in this film even the new I have not named would be a great talent to watch.     Robert Altman I praise for doing a wonderful job to this film and Julian Fellows for the screenwriting, Sometimes with a lot of great talent in one film it doesn't always seem to work but for this film it certainly does.

What else could go wrong, Emma Corrigan wonders, and finds out when the plane she's on hits turbulence and she finds herself confessing all of her secrets (from the story of how the lost her virginity, to the coworker she can't stand, to lying about her weight) to the stranger sitting next to her on a plane. When they land safely, Emma just files this event away as one of those moments that she'll regret, but who cares because she'll never see the guy again. Until she does. The next day at work the mysterious stranger from the plane shows up in the office and it turns out he's the head of her company. Not only that, but he remembers all of her dirty little secrets....<br /><br />Can You Keep A Secret? was a fun, enjoyable book and a must-read for Sophie Kinsella fans. The story bore a striking resemblance to another book I'd read recently, Queen of Babble by Meg Cabot, or I guess it's the other way around since this book came out first. Regardless, if you liked Queen of Babble I think you'll enjoy this book and vice versa. Otherwise, just know that Sophie Kinsella writes the sort of chick lit it's hard to find flaws with. The heroines themselves aren't perfect, which makes them more endearing, and the heroes are the type of men you'd want for yourself. Such is the case with Can You Keep a Secret? and I'd definitely recommend it for a night in when you're in the mood for a laugh.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Recent comic adaptations have generally been spectacular and Superman Returns is a decent addition to that list.  But it really missed the mark in several areas.  The first is that it was a little too true to the original Christopher Reeve movies.  That was 20+ years ago and most people probably don't remember those movies or what happened in them.  Even if they did, it's okay to re-imagine the mythology of Superman (like Batman Begins, which did an excellent job of creating an origin for the Dark Knight).  Another thing is that they kept the campiness of the original movies.  Making Luthor some clownish villain detracts from his ability to be a real threat to Supes.  The Luthor on the Smallville TV show is actually a more interesting, layered character. <br /> <br />Second thing...to put it as kindly as possible, the actors sucked.  Kate Bosworth looks like she's acting in a high school play.  Terrible miss-casting.  She doesn't look like she's old enough to drive let alone have a 5 year old son.  Routh does a great Christopher Reeve impersonation...if only that were the goal.  He brings nothing new to the role.  Superman could be one of the most interesting dramatic characters of the comic world.  A being raised in a humble family, with the powers of a god.  Think about the conflict that he could be feeling with simple morality... lots of dramatic meat for future stories, maybe... <br /> <br />Last complaint - the film has no sense of where it lies in time.  Jimmy is still wearing his bow tie, the fashion and some of the set pieces seem like they're pulled out of the 20's, but they have shuttles and computers. <br /> <br />Okay, so the good things... great special effects, good action, good potential for sequels.  The best thing is probably the super kid, a real surprise.   <br /> <br />Overall, worth watching for the brain candy aspects, but it could have been so much more.
B00005JNQA|4.0|I'm surprised there are so many so-so reviews of this movie - I thought it was really good.  The plot was pretty hard to follow at times, but Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn were great, and there were times when the suspense was almost too much to take.  The twist at the end was totally unexpected - all along I thought I knew what was going on, and who the bad guy was, but that was completely shattered in the last scenes.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it was a little long and convoluted - I kept thinking the movie was about to be over with, and then a whole new plotline would come up.
1401307450|3.0|While the book is interesting and Kiedis has had a unique and exciting life in some ways, it also sort of blows the lid off the myth of the exciting celebrity lifestyle, at least in this case.  His life seems full of a lot of desperation and misery.  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on here who have a lower opinion of Kiedis since reading this book.  I definitely lost a lot of respect for him after reading this.  He always did seem like a somewhat nice guy, but after reading his story, seems more like a vicious, thieving, jerk who lucked into working with some talented musicians and becoming famous.  He wasted most of his peak years using drugs and feeling sorry for himself.  I'm glad he finally got clean, but he still comes across as an immature, hollow, selfish person who thinks the sun rises and sets with his every move.  The last part of the book does become a bit dull, as he fell off the wagon so very many times and it all starts to get redundant.

I wanted to see this on Christmas Day, but found out that this movie was already sold out then so it was best to have went on Thursday and I wasn't disappointed.

B000I5X80G|3.0|I bought the DVD version expecting live footage of the concert and was let down when I saw nothing more than the same pictures cycling over again while the same songs that are on the CD played. There was no video, only the same pictures playing. I would have saved 10 bucks and just bought the CD. The music is fine though. I too wish Young would release more of his live music. To sum up---don't buy the DVD version.
B000002AHM|5.0|It is impossible to describe how amazed I was when I first heard this CD.  There is fire, feeling, heart, passion, virtuosity and even humor on this disc.  The musicianship of these guitarists is pure and incredible.  What is truly amazing is how the McLaughlin, DiMeola and De Lucia are able to blend together seamlessly, maintain their individuality and not step all over each other while playing.     <br /> <br />If you play guitar, buy this CD.  Be warned, though.  This CD will cause you to either want to practice a lot more or just throw your guitar away because you will never be this good. <br /> <br />You will never hear a finer recording of acoustic guitars.  Period. <br /> <br />One final note: This is not background music.  Listen to it intently with the volume turned up.  It rocks.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|The original poem may have been a classic but this retelling was better, far better.  It only covers the part of the story involving the two main characters Grendel and Beowulf.  For those looking for two dimensional entertainment that defines it's characters as either good or evil you will be greatly disappointed.  In this retelling Grendel is no monster and Beowulf learns the enemies he has slaughtered as the hero of the Geats had names, friends and he learns that his life is uncomfortably similar to those lesser individuals that cross his path.  If you like movies like Blade Runner where the point of the movie wasn't for the hero to slaughter his enemies but was for the hero to question, learn and grow then this movie will appeal to you. <br /> <br />I suspect the primary group of folks who will hate the movie will be those biblical scholarly types who have been trying to reinterpret this story to somehow have something to do with christianity.  The movie takes a poke at that (the mark of Cain thing) that most will miss unless they know something about the ongoing attempts to say this was a christian inspired story when there is zero evidence to suggest it was anything other than the pagan story that it is.  It also shows christianity in an equal light with the nordic pagan faith and I think that will inspire some to give this a lesser review than it deserves.  This is a story about human complexity and everything lives in the gray areas between black and white.
B00005JLEX|5.0|If these 17 episodes were all that existed of this show, it probably would not be such worthwhile viewing. However, considering that it developed by its third season into perhaps the funniest sitcom ever made and stayed that way to its end, it is fascinating. Elaine isn't even a castmember in the pilot, and overall the characters are trying to find their moorings. However, Jason Alexander has the character of George down from the very beginning. His over-analysis of the phone calls or physical actions to figure out a woman's exact motives were really classic George. The next episode, \\"The Stakeout\\", is the first with Elaine. It's also the first time we hear the name of the imaginary character used as a mythical prop throughout the series - \\"Art Vanderlay\\". In this case, he is the made-up reason George and Jerry are staking out the building in which a girl works so that Jerry can \\"accidentally\\" run into her and get to know her better. You see, all he knows about the girl is the name of the law firm where she works.<br /><br />Season two gets much better, with such classics as \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" in which Jerry, George, and Elaine all go out to eat at a Chinese restaurant before going to see \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", but are forced to wait an incredibly long time for a table. This simple concept with which we all have experience, waiting for a table, was turned into comic genius in this wonderfully crafted episode. Everything about this episode clicked from Elaine's desperation, to George's frenetic anticipation, to Jerry's levelheadedness. The only thing hard to relate to in the age of the cell phone is George trying to find a telephone.<br /><br />\\"The Deal\\" in which Elaine and Jerry try to maintain their current friendship and restart the past sexual side of their relationship - which Jerry calls \\"this and that\\" - is funny and very spot on as to the relationship between men and women. However, the show must have decided to abandon the concept, because in all later episodes Jerry and Elaine act like this particular show never happened. \\"The Phone Message\\" is an underrated classic in my opinion, and epitomized the extreme awkwardness of George's situations that would be re-visited many times in Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. In this episode, George has left progressively nasty messages on his girlfriend's answering machine. He enlists Jerry's help to switch the tape before his girlfriend returns home and hears the messages. Like many Seinfeld episodes, the grand plan of one of the characters (in this case, George) comes to an end in an unexpected manner, but this episode actually had things work out for George in the end, which is something that wouldn't be seen very often afterwards as the series progressed.<br /><br />The only bad thing about the first two seasons is that you don't see as much of Kramer as you do in subsequent seasons. Plus, there is a bit of rewriting that takes place involving Kramer's financial situation. In these first two seasons early on it is mentioned that Kramer makes more money than Jerry. In later seasons much is made of Kramer's spotty employment history, including the fact that he has been on strike from working in a bagel shop for several years over wages, and he returns to work after the strike is settled only because the minimum wage is finally raised to the wage his union was demanding.<br /><br />I recommend these first two seasons, mainly for the point of seeing all of the character development that takes place getting everything ready for the truly great season three.Jerry and Elaine act like this particular show never happened. \\"The Phone Message\\" is an underrated classic in my opinion, and epitomized the extreme awkwardness of George's situations that would be re-visited many times in Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm.

0971057907|5.0|I started brewing several years ago after reading a book on home brewing from my local library.  The book got me started, but it left me with a lot of questions.  Over the course of the next year, I bought or borrowed several of the more prominent books on homebrewing.  None of them were much help for anything but the bare basics of how to brew your first beer. Then I found this book.  Palmer answered all of my questions and made the vague parts of brewing clear.  His organization and writing style are excellent.  I have brewed a lot of beer since buying this book, and I still find myself referring back to it often.  Overall, this is a great book for the beginning and intermediate brewer.  You can brew a lot of beer before you outgrow the content of this book.

0452284392|3.0|Content is moderately interesting - nothing exceptional that hasn't been said before / better elsewhere.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Out Of Control\\" by Kevin Kelly instead.<br /><br />Much more research was done in Keven's work which reflects a more detailed and even broader view of the systems research.
0618680004|4.0|I enjoyed this book \\"The God Delusion\\" and I agree with the exposition of science, natural selection and evolution contained therein but not quite with the overall conclusion. For natural selection to have a basis in realization, to be able to work so to speak, an inherent capacity or perhaps \\"predisposition\\" must be present in matter. It is impossible to avoid this conclusion (even if or because the universe can perhaps be mapped with only the values of 6 fundamental constants etc.). Never the less, the author has done a pretty good job on the science and social-science side of a subject dauntlessly tackled.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? because it promotes discussion on the interface between science and the divine not because it is necessarily germane in and of itself.<br /><br />I must mention that it seems that it is not so much God that should be set up as a target for the author's ire than it is the idea of god as posed by institutionalized religions (in the main at least). However, the approach offered by Advaita, Taoism and Buddhism has been clearly skirted and this is a perhaps not so fortunate.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the author has not applied the required degree of analysis to wards the application of natural selection and evolution in relation to understanding the component of consciousness of the individual or that of humanity as a whole, in relation to the concept of god. This degree of analysis has however, been well applied to what it may seem to represent for the situation as seen by ordinary religion. By this I mean that the author tries to kill the whole concept of God rather than to evolve it. This, not withstanding the surprising character of some of the language he has chosen. For instance he refers to \\"Darwinian mistakes\\" as \\"blessed, precious mistakes.\\" One may ask blessed by whom or what? To which (since the author apparently seeks to eliminate god) the emergent answer might well be \\"by objective materialism\\" and if that is indeed the case then what has been said is no more than \\"god is (at least) the perceived and apparent universe\\" as described by scientific objectivity.<br /><br />But there is a little more to it than that for it is not possible to dismiss such an approach by ridicule, as he does, through use of the term \\"lazy god\\". To put it another way, if instead of killing god one tries to evolve the concept one might well wind up (at the limit) with an identity of the form \\"physical capacity = intelligent design\\" since the author also seems to concede (as would I as a population ecologist) that it is scarcely possible to improve the design for any organism that does what it does within the circumstances presented (or words to that effect) - provided one is dealing with a \\"stable\\" natural ecosystem. However, as I see it, the term \\"evolution\\" is only a descriptor of a process and does not speak to the question \\"why\\", \\"why is there a capacity of the physical universe which permits this process (of \\"evolution\\")?<br /><br />In attempting to refute the challenge posed to a scientific analysis of life, which takes the form \\"complex things could not have come about by chance alone\\" the author cites the mechanism of evolution by natural selection as the obvious answer. However one can also see that all other things are not equal in practical reality. A probability distribution only describes the relative frequency of events in relation to particular aspects of classification. In the world of biology the events themselves are each observed as \\"one of a kind\\" and the classification categories (used to cluster events) can be expanded or contracted at the will of the analyst but are still at least roughly bounded in principal by physical conditions at some scale or another. It is true that within such bounds and at the level of the individual organism, there exists the capacity for successively directed incremental change, if events are left to themselves due to \\"natural selection\\". But it is a matter of pure terminological convenience as to whether the final form is judged and labeled as being due to the character of the events themselves (say so-called random mutations - but even these are constrained by physical potential) or by the nature of the boundaries which inherently serve to contain the successful expression of events. If one takes the boundaries as dominant then the principals of matter determine the outline of realized events and one could well speak of the resultant form as being \\"design induced\\" (as dictated by the inherent capacities of matter). If one looks at the variability expressed by an individual character within one generation and the next then only those variations suited to particular ecological circumstances pertaining during reproduction and growth will survive and one may then speak of accumulated design arising through the chance that this or that form survives. Is there intelligence working in the expression of the resultant form (or \\"design\\")? The answer is yes if one thinks that matter and life are non-chance realizations and no if one thinks that somehow the universe and its constituent matter arose by chance alone (all states and non-states are equally likely in this or any other universe).<br /><br />The author also states that \\"like nothing else, evolution really does provide an explanation for the existence of entities whose improbability would otherwise, for practical purposes, rule them out\\". But, unfortunately this is not an exhaustive proposition. A viable alternative is that the world and all its entities is continuously created from moment to moment within the consciousness of mind as a consistent appearance. Sri Ramana Maharshi formulated it thus: the world and the mind arise as one but of the two the world depends on mind alone. That alone is real in which this inseparable pair have their rising and setting, the one eternal Self.<br /><br />If one is initially bothered by the immense time-frame involved for evolution to express itself in the form of a living environment, as we know it, then it is possible to consider that time is relative. Thus the mind-boggling march of evolutionary sequences, as measured in years, represent merely (perhaps) instances, in what might otherwise be termed \\"god-consciousness\\". As such, these are of such short relative duration that they may be said to hardly even exist from the viewpoint of such a creator. There is a short poem, drawn from the wide literature of Advita, illustrating this idea:<br /><br />Now the wonderful world is born,<br />In an instant it dies,<br />In a breath it is renewed,<br />From the slowness of our eye,<br />And the quickness of God's hand,<br />We believe in the world<br /><br />Professor Dawkins also suggests that a God capable of calculating the balance point for the proposed 6 fundamental constants of physicality governing the universe would have to be at least as improbable as the finely tuned combination of numbers itself, and that's very improbable indeed. So? This is exactly germane. The degree of probability is not really the issue and in this sense it is something quite meaningless. If a comparison between chalk and cheese is suggested in relation to the source and the realized expression of the universe then this is certainly the case. God is not anything that can be described in relation to any item within the universe except perhaps as an analogy in which human consciousness is likened to the reflection of the sun in a bucket of water and god to the sun itself.<br /><br />Professor Dawkins proposes that \\"human thoughts and emotions emerge from complex interactions\\" (of physical entities) and \\"nothing else (except in the sense of natural phenomena that we don't yet understand\\"...). To which one might say \\"quite, and therein lies the rub\\". One may even agree that of course these are natural phenomena and consistent with the appearance presented by the universe and that further, yes the universe is an infinite structural regress, but what is it exactly that seems to exist? Why does it exist? In what is its support? A big-bang? Then from whence the conditions as pre-curser to such an event? A cycle? Then a cycle in what and why? Etc And, after all really, is it objectively extant or just a figment of imagination arising in the same way as a fully-formed dream? Professor Dawkins furthermore says \\"I am calling only supernatural gods delusional\\". True, there are no supernatural gods as per this definition but this is really a \\"straw-man\\" argument for eliminating the divine. There is the observing consciousness and there is (apparently) \\"the observed\\" (form) even if this is largely emptiness admixed with intersecting force-fields. But, it is often proposed that it is the observer only that allocates the outlines to form. As a Buddhist might state the matter, form is emptiness: emptiness is form...<br /><br />It thus takes a relatively minor adjustment in perspective to formulate an understanding that god IS an infinite regress, that god and the anthrophic principal are co-extensive, that god does indeed represent bandwidth sufficient to include all of the universe and the minds therein.

0634086782|5.0|Although it is only one of many jazz theory books on my shelf, I find that this book sticks out for its breadth and applicability to performing and arranging in the jazz idiom.  This is accomplished through the sections on piano playing for all jazz instrumentalists where the topics include both voicing and comping rhythms.  The latter is usually left out from theory books.  There is also a chapter devoted to solo styles where the student can read through analysis of solos with the musical example provided in the book.  There is a chapter on arranging for various ensembles as well as a chapter that deals with \\"Early and Traditional Jazz\\" a much overlooked area in our jazz history studies.  The book even ends with a chapter on practicing that deals not only with what one should practice, but why we practice particular aspects of the music. <br /> <br />Of course there are all of the requisite chapters on scale/chord theory and the ii-V-I progression that you will find in most books, but it is the added material that appleals to the player as much as the theorist.  That is what makes this book a superior buy to many others.
0618680004|3.0|This is an interesting and thought provoking book.  However, it is written from an intellectual space of what appears to be a bit arrogant.  While it attempts to cut down various philosophical arguments with hard scientific evidence, it does not examine the underlying assumptions of its own paradigm.  One of these assumptions is that the only valid epistemology (theory of knowledge) is science.  Interestingly, having such a tacit assumption is itself a metaphysical statement.  In other words, if science concerns itself with what can be measured with the senses and its extensions, it doesn't necessarily follow that all that can not be measured isn't real.  For example, I can't objectively see my love for my partner through a microscope, measure its intensity with an instrument, but I know it is real.  Love seems to be outside of space and inaccessible to the scientific method.  However, few would argue that love is real and many are willing to even give up their lives for their child, spouse or an important cause.  Could love not be real?  Is it merely an epiphenomenon (i.e. the appearance of having a reality apart from another phenomenon vs. substantially real).<br /><br />Another issue I have with this book is that it doesn't take into account what we have learned from physics in the last 100 years.  Specifically, we have two major theories, quantum mechanics and general relativity that are not unified.  Quantum mechanics points to a universe that is probabilistic and paradoxical.  It defies our everyday perception of things in a variety of ways.  Chemistry and the life sciences are built upon this physics edifice which is far from bullet proof, simple or free of complex and far reaching interrelationships.  The perspective that things are reviewed from also causes reality to show up differently.<br /><br />In addition, in order to have \\"predictions\\" in the life sciences, it is important to sacrifice complexity for precision.  This means we make assumptions about what to ignore and include.  Could we be ignoring something more subtle than our instruments could measure?  It would seem this is quite likely and chaos theory suggests just how complicated even predicting the weather can be.  How can we know what we don't know?  Perhaps a new theory will emerge that will put an end to our understanding of the universe as it is explained in this book in the way that quantum physics completely undermined Newtonian physics.<br /><br />What I like about the book is that it provides excellent food for thought and presents an interesting scientific argument.  If one reduces all of reality down to what can be measured at this point in time, from a very specific point of reference, it is compelling.  However, what if there are emergent properties that occur along with the creation of order that we don't understand?  Personally, I don't believe consciousness is a mere epiphenomenon and that has been adequately and conclusively explained.  I also don't think it follows that just because we can't measure something at this point in time it doesn't necessarily exist.  This is not a scientific argument.<br /><br />While I think there is a place for scientic arguments about religion such as those presented in this book, I also think that a scientist views the world through a familiar lens that comes to be ignored much the way a fish doesn't necessarily notice the water it swims in.  It seems to me that other disciplines, cultures and paradigms that have persisted through time may have something to contribute even if what they say can not be validated by the scientific method.  Again, is the scientific method the only valid way to know something?  For example, can you really learn everything about falling in love by studying it from the outside?  Does experience add something to objective fact and is this valid knowledge?  I leave it to the reader of this review to answer this question for themselves.<br /><br />I'm glad that this book came out and I agree that there are many dangers to unconscious and unexamined beliefs.  However, I feel this criticism could apply equally to some religious groups as well as groups of scientists.  Perhaps exploring things from a perspective that most likely no one is completely wrong might be more productive.  I think the Dalai Lama and many other writers do a good job with this approach although they may not delve as deeply into the hard science.  I would like to see more hard scientists come to the table with this kind of attitude for the benefit of everyone.  An attitude that a particular method or viewpoint is supreme seems to be a recipe for creating blindspots which is the antithesis of an open and curious attitude.<br /><br />While this author seems to have an axe to grind, he does make a useful contribution to the ongoing dialogue (debate?) between religion and science.  However, I don't think his facts justify the strong stand taken here.  However, I was impressed with the concessions that the author made to Einstein and his beliefs.  I would have liked to have seen more of this and I believe this attitude of wonder more exemplifies the scientist at his very best.  We probably only know as much about the universe as an ant does about our nervous system.  How can we know what we don't know?  I believe the paradoxes of quantum physics drive the point about complexity and common sense perception home very well.  The same can be said of relativity theory.<br /><br />While I conceed that much of conventional religion is mythical that is not to say that it doesn't reveal something about reality.  For example, do mathematical equations about sexual excitment and attraction really fully disclose the nature of sexual excitement in the way a poet such as Shakespeare can?  Is this type of knowledge really without value?  Is it possible to capture reality in words and equations?  I can certainly read about swimming without ever having been in water, but does actually getting in water add a type of knowledge that can't be captured in words?  Is this true of other dimensions of the universe?<br /><br />Personally, I think that religious questions should be open to inquiry by the scientific method and other means as well.  I also acknowledge a symbolic dimension of reality that may transcend reason as we know it.  If it were not so, why would symbols have such power and what is our dream life all about?  Certainly, Carl Jung thought this was an important dimension of the psyche and there are many interesting cross cultural correlations that are difficult to explain.  Another Jungian concept that is difficult to explain away is synchronicity which sounds a lot like non-local connections and effects in physics.<br /><br />While I doubt that God is an old man in a white robe that lives in the clouds, I am not ready to toss the idea of God out the window based on selective evidence that arises from one particular vantage point.  I personally think we only are seeing the tip of the iceberg with respect to the universe and while we may not be able to prove God's existence, it doesn't seem to me it follows that therefore, God doesn't exist.  This is faulty logic and it has come up over and over in the sciences as we have learned more and developed better instruments.<br /><br />Also, every scientific idea or concept lives within a subject.  Science as such only lives within a conscious mind.  There are no facts floating around apart from an observer which implies that perception can't be separated from a subject of the effect of a subject's assumptions, blindspots, schemas and even somatic conditioning.  I think it is interesting that some scientists are very quick to dismiss consciousness as an epiphenomenon when it is consciousness that is doing the reflecting on the very fact that consciousness is like \\"static from a radio.\\"  To me, it appears to proceed any concept and is acting underneath the level of observation to screen various things in and out.<br /><br />Perhaps the author of this book has an understanding that I missed.  However, I am still humbled by what we don't know and the limitations of all of our respective branches of knowledge.  While I agree it's good to challenge untenable ideas, I don't think we are in position even with respect to the physical universe to make absolute metaphysical statements.  After all we haven't even unified the two major theories of physics which underlies this authors entire argument in that chemistry and theories of evolution are based on a tacit acceptance of the validity of physics.<br /><br />If you are open to entertaining a more broad and inclusive framework or provoking deeper questions, you may enjoy reading FORGOTTEN TRUTH or DOES RELIGION MATTER by Huston Smith.  Another useful read that is entertaining, insightful and tries to integrate science with other ways of knowing and branches of knowledge is Ken Wilber's A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING.  While you may not agree with everything in any of these books, my guess is it will contribute to your understanding and raise some of the type of questions that aren't completely addressed here.  Another good book along these lines is INTEGRAL SPIRITUALITY which just came out.<br /><br />In closing I respect this author and I am grateful that he put forth this argument.  No doubt, it is something many people need to here.  On the other hand, I don't think the book is closed and it is in responding to intelligent arguments such as this that our knowledge increases.<br /><br />If you found this review useful or very unuseful I would appreciate hearing your comments.

What I'm saying is that there appears to be a degree of scientism (metaphysical assumption that whatever is outside the realm of scientific study does not exist or is not significant).  I also want to make it clear that I do see science as ONE of a number of ways to know and that perhaps we could benefit from looking at ALL possible ways of knowing including direct experience which is often beyond words.

B000E0WJIC|5.0|When I first heard tears don't fall on the radio, I had to check out bullet for my valentine's album \\"the poison\\". So I went out and bought it, and it was one of the best investments for under $20.00 I've ever made. The reasons why this is quite possibly one of the greatest metalcore albums of all time: <br /> <br />1. The intro track is a simple instrumental consisting primarily of cellos and light background music which lulls the listener into a feeling of surrealism and tranquility only to lash them directly into the fray with the first song which beings with a blood curdling scream. Outstanding! <br /> <br />2. All the tracks on this CD, especially track 8 are hateful, vengeful, spiteful, and provide for some of the best power-lifting workouts ever. If you don't work out, however, they still provide amazing auditory entertainment for hours for ANY metalcore fan. <br /> <br />3. The combination of fast paced music and screamo vocals combined with slower more musical interludes and harmonious singing creates a wonderful eclectic combination of hot sticky metal-rich goodness. <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD NOW!!! I have listed to it hundreds of times already, and I'm still not bored of it. <br /> <br />Bands similar: <br /> <br />1. avenged sevenfold (older stuff) <br />2. Atreyu <br /> <br />
B00005JNX0|5.0|Madagascar is yet another offering from Pixar that entertains my son, while yielding breaktime for Mommy. My favorite aspect of Pixar movies (and Madagascar is no exception) is that I don't mind the sound of it filling my house, in fact I can even sit and watch it with my son, as this film includes enough humor to appeal to adults without exposing my child to age inappropriate humor. As an educator, I also appreciate that Madagascar has enough factual information to peak my son's intellectual interest in animals and places depicted in the film. As it gets harder and harder to find something \\"with no shoots\\" as my son says, this movie fulfills what we are both looking for.

I was one of the Democrats that jumped ship to support Ralph Nader. After reading this book, I am impressed with the warmth and the values of this young senator who has had quite an interesting life. I'm impressed with Barack Obama's beliefs when it comes to faith, health care, and the need to establish some protectionism for our nation.<br /><br />Barack Obama's book is one book that makes me feel proud to be an American again, and I'll gladly support him if he should run in 2008 after reading this book.

B0001IMKTA|5.0|My introduction to Spock's Beard came several years ago when I chanced to hear \\"Snow\\". I liked that quite well, and so I added it to my ever-growing prog collection. Since then, I have gotten into SB, Neal Morse and many of Morse's side projects but as good as they all are, none of them match the power and beauty of The Light. <br />Prog fans should be delighted that this masterpiece has been re-issued. There is so much here, both musically and intellectually, that it towers above much of the prog that is on the market today. And that says a lot, because there is some very good progressive rock music being written and performed in the new century. <br />I like the whole CD, but my favorite cuts are the title cut and The Water. Morse's voice is often so Lennonesque that one would be forgiven for thinking that the Beatle has been reincarnated in the person of Neal Morse. One writer objected to the profanity in the FU/I'm Sorry sequence of The Water. While I'm opposed to the gratuitous use of profanity, it happens to fit here and is very powerful indeed. Listen to what Morse is singing and then tell me that there has never been a time when YOU felt that way. When that sequence is over, Morse is done with the profanity and moves on to another segment of the story. If you listen closely and try not to focus on the profane, you will find that The Light is a very dazzling and deeply spiritual recording. <br />Obviously I recommend this to all prog rock fans. I am a fan of the Inside/Out special edition packs and this one is no exception. When you buy this edition, you get an oversized CD folder that includes an attractive lyrics booklet, a small poster, and a couple of postcards. Get The Light, Special Edition while it remains available!

B00005JN2Z|5.0|While this movie certainly wasn't the best movie I have seen, it is a very good movie nevertheless.   <br />The acting is superb.  Tom Cruise, regardless of religious affiliation, does an excellent job as a hitman who has taken a ride with Jamie Foxx, a cab driver, who is actually being taken on a ride of his own.  Jamie Foxx does a great job as a bewildered and frightened cab driver who knows he will be held accountable (at some point) for the actions of his client.  The interplay between the two actors is great, and the performances are more than convincing. <br />The plot is pretty original, though it is moderately predictable.  The writing is above average, and the movie is funny at times--if you like morbid humor anyway.  It should be remembered that the movie isn't supposed to be a funny movie. <br />While the messages of the movie are a little presumptuous at times, the movie can pull it off by being a good enough movie for me to take it seriously. <br />If you want to see this movie, I would recommend buying it, since you will surely want to see it again.

1563894696|4.0|With Frank Miller's blessings, scribe Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale went ahead and spun a mystery entrenched firmly within the time frame of BATMAN: YEAR ONE. This DC graphic novel's first incarnation was in the format of a limited 13-issue maxi-series back in 1996 and narrated the Darknight Detective's exhausting, year-long effort to capture the media-dubbed \\"Holiday,\\" a serial killer whose first victim is slain on Halloween.<br /><br />Thru the course of the year, Holiday continues to execute his victims but solely on national holidays, every time leaving in his wake an untraceable .22 pistol and the appropriate holiday memorabilia. His victims predominantly seem to be mob-affiliated, either close relations or upper-echelon members of the Falcone syndicate. The killings threaten the eruption of a mob war between Carmine \\"the Roman\\" Falcone and Salvatore \\"the Boss\\" Maroni, the Roman's chief rival and the second most powerful mobster in Gotham. Meanwhile, Batman, Police Captain Jim Gordon, and D.A. Harvey Dent make a solemn pact to end the mob tyranny on Gotham.<br /><br />So I've heard all the hype and I finally got a chance to read BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN - and it's pretty darn good. The hype is a bit overblown because this one's not exactly up there in the rarified atmosphere of BATMAN: YEAR ONE. Some negatives: I just can't believe that this mystery is so perplexing that it couldn't be solved by Batman in under a year's time (I know, this is his first year, but it's friggin' Batman here) - and, really, what's so disappointing is that he doesn't even solve it. And, as much as I enjoy film noir and noir novels, I couldn't get in sync with the crime syndicates as derivatively depicted by Loeb. The only remotely diverting mob character is Falcone's gargantuan daughter and enforcer, Sofia Falcone Gigante.<br /><br />Loeb's use of Batman's gallery of rogues smacks of being perfunctory and arbitrary, as the writer flings haphazard costumed  villains into the fray seemingly because it's expected in a superhero comic book. His characterizations of the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, and Poison Ivy are half-hearted and cardboard. And, while I could see why the Calendar Man is given a more-or-less pronounced role in the goings-on, he is definitely no Hannibal Lechter.<br /><br />A key element to the success of the BATMAN: YEAR ONE mythos was the refreshing portrayal of Jim Gordon as an aggresively honest and very capable cop who will brook no nonsense from his crooked fellow law enforcers. In many ways, Frank Miller wrote him in such a way that I immediately thought of Wyatt Earp taming Tombstone. Gordon fully shared and earned the star billing with Bats in BATMAN: YEAR ONE. Here, he takes a back seat to Batman and Harvey Dent and comes closer to resembling the Commissioner Gordon we've all known for so long. I didn't like it.<br /><br />That was the vinegar part of the review; now, here's the sugar. On the positive side, the Joker, Catwoman, and especially Two-Face are fleshed out and made three dimensional here, or as three-dimensional as these wacky nut jobs can get. I could actually see the logic of the insane Clown of Crime becoming insanely jealous of Holiday (\\"The town isn't big enough for two homicidal maniacs\\") and thus going on his own murder spree. Catwoman is nicely ambivalent, occasionally abetting Bats but not about to give away her underlying motivations. Long time readers of Batman are treated to the nuances of the devolution of Harvey Dent, who starts out here as being crusadingly on the side of the righteous but, thru the course of THE LONG HALLOWEEN, descending into what he ultimately will become. That he, Jim Gordon, and Bruce Wayne are friends lends a particularly bittersweet element to the book. Batman, of course, remains Batman.<br /><br />A dominant selling point for BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN is Tim Sale's artistic contribution. His excellent pencil and inks, combined with Gregory Wright's muted colors, with anoccasional foray into full-out black and white renderings, lend a stark and somber tone to the proceedings, evocatively realizing Gotham and its shadowy residents. Echoes of Frank Miller's style abound in Tim Sale's efforts, especially in  several gorgeous, full page lay outs. His Batman is depicted as having the same brawny mass as Miller's version, if more defined muscularly. BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN  is a handsome product, encumbered with some flaws but showcasing competent writing and some truly solid artwork. And I guarantee you will not see the killer's identity coming (it's a little murky, although there are clues interspersed throughout). On the same level as BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE and BATMAN: YEAR TWO, BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN is vintage Batman and is a worthy addition to the Caped Crusader's canon. So, I'm giving this one 3 and a half stars.occasional foray into full-out black and white renderings, lend a stark and somber tone to the proceedings, evocatively realizing Gotham and its shadowy residents.

B00012FXB8|5.0|This movie is probably the most under-rated movies of all time. Sure it was different, but why would you want more of the same? The directors cut actually helps the movie alot, but still doen't really explain the plot holes that really need to be filled. Like where the hell did those eggs in the starting come from? But who cares. This movie is awesome and shouldn't be talked down apon. The look of the movie is almost perfect to me. The director should be really commended. Do not listen to those who talk down about this movie. It was great
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|You know, a lot of bands seem to get softer with age. I personally think this album has some of thier heaviest songs on it. I can honestly say I like every song on this cd. Oh yeah, and since when does putting out a single mean you're a sell out? Anyways, definatly worth buying.
B000002GEV|5.0|Before the blockbuster pop album \\"Breakfast in America\\" Supertramp was considered to be a progressive rock group.  The group's first two albums were very progressive and given the general lack of salability of progressive rock in any era neither album was very successful.  The group retooled their sound and tried again with \\"Crime of the Century,\\" which many people consider one of Supertramp's best albums.  The music was still progressive, but with a distinctive pop flavor that would become increasingly evident in their next several albums.  Fans of Supertramp and early progressive rock will need this album for their collection.<br /><br />Richard Davies introduces the song \\"School\\" with a haunting harmonica solo.  This melancholy song has progressive elements as it ponders the conflict between tradition and conformity and the reality of life.<br /><br />In a pop style with a hard edge is \\"Bloody Well Right.\\"  The lyrics are relatively simple and ironic, more so because of the placement after \\"School.\\"  The song appears to be about the accuracy of complaints, but then you realize that the singer is agreeing without agreeing.  In one portion of the song the singer says that he agrees that you can complain about school and you must be right, but there is right from one person's point of view and then there is a more universal accuracy.  I sense this song makes fun of complainers.<br /><br />The song \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" is an excellent mix of progressive and pop.  This song contains complex lyrics and wonderfully constructed music.  At nearly seven minutes in length this song is the second longest on this CD, and is one of the most artistic songs in Supertramp's repertoire.  Almost as long, \\"Asylum\\" follows and is another complex and artistic song, though it is also more progressive than \\"Hide in Your Shell.\\"  There are sufficient vocal elements to complement the theme of insanity and the final part of the lyrics in the accompanying booklet trail off with the end of the lyrics; quite a nice touch.  This song also acquires harder elements as the song progresses, with wailing guitars, yells, and layered instruments.<br /><br />\\"Dreamer\\" moves back into progressive pop territory.  However, the theme stays in the range of \\"Asylum\\" by implying that there is a borderline area between dreaming and insanity.  Even the vocals have an edge that implies a bit of craziness.<br /><br />\\"Rudy\\" is the longest song on this CD.  This progressive song is sad.  Rudy leads a humdrum life looking for something and not finding it.  This song reminds me of Supertramp's early music rather than the pop direction they were heading.  The music is complex and follows the story of the lyrics, which are neither catchy nor easy to remember.  However, progressive fans may prefer this kind of music over the songs with pop features.<br /><br />The song \\"If Everyone Is Listening\\" retains a few progressive elements, but there are pop features as well.  This song has a very catchy hook and the lyrics are quite listenable.  I think this song could have been a single.  This song continues the theme of the previous song in that the previous song is about how a life can be mundane and meaningless, while this song implies that we are actors in our own play, and things happen that can be changed if only people were listening.  The lyrics are good and the music is very good.<br /><br />Staying progressive and with social consciousness is \\"Crime of the Century.\\"  The song asks not-so-subtly who is responsible for the problems we see in the world today.  Rip off the mask and you see you and me; sobering for anyone who still pays attention to the ills in the world in this supposedly enlightened era.<br /><br />I prefer progressive rock over most forms of music.  It goes without saying that good progressive rock is preferred.  Because of my preference I enjoy Supertramp's progressive and progressive pop music more than their pop music.  Conversely, others like the pop and dislike the progressive, sometimes calling it noise.  \\"Crime of the Century\\" contains both styles, and may be a difficult purchase for some listeners.  However, some believe that \\"Crime of the Century\\" was an artistic peak for Supertramp, including at least one member of Supertramp, though their commercial peak was yet to come.  As usual, it comes down to taste.  I have a preference for this music because it is different and requires you to pay attention to the lyrics and the music to enjoy the more challenging works.  If music is something you hum along to you may want to move on to something a bit lighter than this album.<br /><br />Note that there is at least one later, remastered version of this album.  You may wish to see which of the various versions of this album best meets your needs before you buy.<br /><br />Enjoy!the pop and dislike the progressive, sometimes calling it noise.  \\"Crime of the Century\\" contains both styles, and may be a difficult purchase for some listeners.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I just received \\"LOVE\\" for a Christmas Gift.<br /><br />  Lucky too because I doubt my choice would have been to get<br /><br /> it before. Once I heard this Version of many songs complied in the<br /><br />order it plays. You get a whole new experience listening to The Beatles.<br /><br /> My favorite so far is how some selections have been remixed together with multiple songs. And it all sounds very interestingly new and fun.<br /><br /> The first track starts with \\"Because\\" and it sounds so fresh. But I believe all that was changed was the insturments was not playing. When you hear them sing this way. you can hear it sounding so crisp as if the Beatles was recording it Again. If you feel only the original music is all you want to hear. I would suggest to listen to this at least once.
B00005G8V4|4.0|Any group with a catalog that includes albums such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" along with their numerous other releases will forever have to live up to their reputation. In the hands of other groups \\"The Division Bell\\" would be considered a high-water mark in their repertoire; in the hands of Pink Floyd this is just another competent, beautiful album.<br /><br />The album opens with the instrumental \\"Cluster One,\\" featuring the sounds of Mother Earth herself. The music is quiet, thoughtful; an introspective introduction that provides a flavor of things to come, and perhaps reminds you that this CD is a Pink Floyd CD; you can expect art, a touch of this, a touch of that, and it will be tinged with progressive elements.<br /><br />The stronger elements of \\"What Do You Want from Me\\" contrast nicely with the opening piece. The song has elements that date back to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" While the work breaks little new ground for Floyd, it is the reliability and quality of the music and lyrics that make it so addictive. This music is the same while being different. Those contrasting guitar chords are Floyd. \\"Poles Apart\\" follows in a similar vein. However, the power of the lyrics of \\"Poles Apart\\" pulls you into the imagery painted by the combination of the music and lyrics. Once again the keyboards remind me of \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"Marooned,\\" is okay. This instrumental track may fit with the theme of the introduction, but is otherwise uninspired. The instrumental is pleasant and mellow, an accompaniment to floating clouds and mellow water surrounded by whispering spring trees; music to get dreamy by.<br /><br />When I first heard the lyrics of \\"A Great Day for Freedom,\\" I thought it related to the breaking down of barriers between East and West at the end of the cold war. Multiple listening now convinces me that the song has more to do with the departure of Roger Waters than anything else. The music is mellow and good, but to use the lyrics as may have been done distracts from my enjoyment of a musically good song.<br /><br />While the music of \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" starts with a jazz flavor, or may even remind a listener of Vangelis's \\"Blade Runner\\" music, the lyrics are surreal and hint at paranoia and being left out. Richard Wright's music retains only a hint of Pink Floyd's usual musical style and while the change in flavor may provide some needed variation, the variation is also too noticeable to a focused listener. This track is one of my less favorite tracks on this CD.<br /><br />I like the music and the lyrics of \\"Take It Back.\\" There is a strong pop beat to this song, but it is so listenable and the lyrics are complex so that it is an enjoyable song. My only objection is the pop-like repetitive lyric at the end of the song. The harmony is well done, but the repetition is annoying.<br /><br />The lyrics of \\"Coming Back to Life\\" are evocative. The song is a lament, a seeking, a journey, a vision, an ending and a new beginning. It is amazing that David Gilmour managed to squeeze so much into the sparse lyrics of this song. While this song retains some of the pop flavor of \\"Take It Back,\\" the lyrics will challenge an analytical listener and turns what could have been a mundane song into a good listen.<br /><br />\\"Keep Talking\\" uses a bit of a gimmick with the synthesized voice of physicist, cosmologist and author Stephen Hawking at several places in the song. I like this song with its Pink Floyd style. However, I keep thinking that this song sounds similar in places to another song I heard on an early Pink Floyd album; I am just unable to pinpoint the song. Perhaps the style is so strongly similar to early Pink Floyd that I keep thinking this is a song from \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"Lost for Words\\" is a song of frustration. How can you help overcome the differences between you and those who may be your enemies? This song really has no answer to the question, but how many songs of any genre use the words \\"doldrums\\" and \\"cauldron,\\" particularly in the same song? For a while the vocals have a bit of a Bob Dylan feel to them, particularly in the opening stanza. Later we hear the sound of a boxing match in the bridge leading into a stronger, more Floyd style vocal. This song also contains a four-letter word that I am unable to recall having seen in a Pink Floyd song. I was a bit surprised by the inclusion, though it fits well with the theme.<br /><br />The last track, \\"High Hopes,\\" is my favorite on this CD. It is progressive and strong and a wonderful way to finish off a CD. My opinion of this CD was strongly flavored by this last track that contains so many musical elements. The song in introduced with bells and a haunting piano. The initial vocals are dark and plaintive. The lyrics are full of unrealized futures and lost pasts, a feeling that we are coming to the end. The tolling of bells and the heavy bass are sad and nostalgic. While it would be easy to accept the end as depressing, it is the well-executed artistry of this song that makes me happy rather than the sadness of the song. I hope for a return of Floyd.<br /><br />This solid CD is a worthy addition to Pink Floyd's catalog. We can only hope that there might yet be something released in the future from this ground-breaking and influential group. This version is an import; other, less expensive, versions are available!<br /><br />Enjoy!mies?

B00005JPDS|3.0|Will Smith stars as struggling salesman Chris Gardner in an overwrought rags to riches inspirational story that highlights the strong bond existent between Gardner and his young son Chris played by star of the show and Smith's real life son Jaden.<br /><br />Times are tough for Smith in 1981 San Francisco where he's barely scratching out a meager existence as a salesman of bone density scanners.  His wife Linda played by Thandie Newton is becoming disillusioned working a double shift and still fighting to keep the wolf away from the door.  Frustrated she checks out of the marriage in little more than a cameo role and without much protest leaves Smith to care for their son.<br /><br />Smith, a naturally bright guy without the benefit of a college education gets an opportunity to vie for an internship as a stock broker for Dean Witter Reynolds.  As the competitive internship is unsalaried, Smith literally kills himself trying to make ends meet, winding up in a homeless shelter.<br /><br />His perseverance fueled by his deeply emotional relationship with his son, ultimately and thankfully pays off as he attains his goal.<br /><br />For an uplifting story I found that the plot was far too heavy in the depressing details of Smith's striving to succeed which made the film seem needlessly long.
0099450259|5.0|In a murder, there is usually one mystery to solve, even though plots are far-fetched and convoluted. This murder (of the dog mentioned in the title) has the actual killing, the highly involved world of the detective, and the question of whether \\"they all live happily ever after\\" to unravel. <br /> <br />I read this book on recommendation after hearing a very inspiring talk by a Danish gentleman at a software testing conference. His story concerned a company that employed predominantly autistic people. Whilst autism and the less severe Asperger's Syndrome are not the same, there are many similarities. Mark Haddon`s tale does not describe life as a sufferer of AS (Asberger's Syndrome), but more lets the reader experience it. For the story is told in the first person by a 15-year old. <br /> <br />Most people will have come across autistic or AS people, possibly at school, but the condition is only more common today because it is better understood. However, never has society been so excluding of people who do not conform. The 15 year-old Christopher lives in his own world. His world is conveyed very powerfully though the chain of events that begins with him finding a neighbour's dead dog. I had already worked out the unusual chapter numbering by the time this is described, and the narrative is also about writing a book, with a very understanding teacher at the special school giving advice and encouragement.  <br /> <br />The killing of the dog is solved in the middle of the book, not by sleuthing, but by confession, and this leads to a paradigm-change for Christopher. Notwithstanding that, the book is a story, a mystery, a parable and a warning for all readers. It may make you feel guilty about how you treated others in the past, but I hope it inspires you to act differently, to consider that the vast majority of individuals have a useful contribution to make to society, and to understand the massive pressures that having a disadvantaged child bring to a once-loving,stable relationship. <br /> <br />Most of all, seeing an AS person, with obsessive behaviour and a compartmentalised world, may help us all realise that autism is not a disease. It is a spectrum. Most of us are on that spectrum, somewhere. Many are further to the autism end than they would have realised hitherto.   <br /> <br />Read it. It will do you good. <br /> <br />Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (morganp@supanet.com) <br />
B000ICKPQY|5.0|This episode embodies why I love this series. The bad guy is bad - and makes appearances throughout the series.  <br /> <br />And now, this episode offers some more understanding of the Wraith species and actually BEGS you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs. <br /> <br />Now you really don't know what to think...except that today is a day of honor. <br /> <br />I won't blow it for you. Watch this one FIRST if you're not sure about which episode to sample... <br /> <br />and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci-fi adventures. <br /> <br />
B000J103YI|5.0|This soundtrack is simply amazing!  Everyone shines!  And Jennifer Hudson sing \\"the song\\" no words at all.  She did a fantastic job.  I get chills/goose bumps listen to And I am Telling You.  Pretty much all the songs with the exception of 2 or 3 are on the CD.  It flows from beginning to end.  Great CD that should pick up some awards!
B00005JPDY|5.0|This is a great film and one that I highly recommend, but it is not without flaws.  I won't rehash th plot because other reviewers have already done a much better job than I could do. But first the flaws and these are truly minor.  The costuming and set design were very well done, but Matt Damon's makeup was poor.  We watched him over a period of 30+ years and he never gained weight, turned gray, lost hair, or showed any sign of age, unlike Joilie who looked more mature at the end than she did at the beginning. The sound could have been better because some lines were muffled and in this film every line is important.  The organization of the film -- which is done in flashbacks -- could be better because it was hard to track the sequence of events but the footnotes in the corner helped, but if you miss one you are at sea as to what is going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent film and Matt Damon does a good job and the story is very similar to the George Smiley Tinker Tailor Spy.  Alec Guniness is more convincing as a spymaster but the destruction of Edward Wilson is more easily observed than with George Smiley but both characters end as The Walking Dead -- hollow men, wrapped in honor but devoid of family, friends, intimacy, trust, or anything worth living for other than God and Country.<br /><br />I thought this film really brought forth the reality that our government is dominated by the Ivy League Patricians.  This has been true throughout the 20th Century and it is this \\"old boy\\" network that has created compromised politicians, led to corruption in government, and has placed the country at risk on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The movie presents a variety of moral and ethical decisions which makes this film a good one to watch and discuss with your teenage children.  Edward Wilson's march to personal destruction is determined by individual decisions -- some small -- like the sexual encounter with Clover, which had disastrous results -- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.  The decision to spy on his professor was an ethical one but one that characterized Edward Wilson as a man who placed country above himself.  This dedication ultimately leads him to the heart rending decision regarding his son, which leaves him compromised.  This is a film with very complex characters whose motives are deep rooted and not easily discerned during the movie itself, but become clearer on reflection.  It vividly demonstrates the corrosiveness of secrets - especially on families.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers didn't like the film because it was too slow and too long.  It has a slow pace -- but these are spies not Tom Cruise on a \\"Mission Impossible\\" more aptly titled a \\"Mission Improbable\\".  It has no car chases, bombs, babes, or any of the usual fare that appeals to the adolescent mind. This is a thinking man's movie and an exceptional one at that.  It definitely deserves the 5 stars.- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Devoted fans of The O.C. are sure to enjoy this Season Two DVD set.  After last season's heart-tugging finale, the whole gang is back for junior year at Harbor, but Seth and Ryan find their girlfriends have moved on and found new loves.  The guys are no slouches, either:  A new lab partner spells romance for Ryan, and Seth falls for the wild and worldly manager at the Bait Shop.  Meanwhile, the adults are in for lots of drama as Caleb and Julie have marital problems, both Sandy and Kirsten feel the urge to merge with other people, and even the Nana in Miami gets lucky...maybe.  One main character will leave the O.C. for good and one (or two?) will die.<br /><br />What a season!  The plotlines combine comedy and pathos effortlessly, the characters we came to love in season one continue to evolve, and the writing is superb.  This DVD includes lots of behind-the-scene cool stuff and fun bloopers that were sadly missing from the season one DVDs.  I wish there had been commentaries by the lead actors, but there are two by the creative staff that are quite interesting.
B000I5X81K|5.0|After my first listen to this CD, I was unimpressed. My absolute favorite is his self-titled album. But a friend let me borrow her DVD \\"The Making of Awake\\" and it definately changed my opinion. Being able to see the meaning behind the music was very insightful. Plus Josh had more input on this one, which makes it more personal. Now I can say I am hooked on this CD as much as his first. Yes, it is different than his other work, but change is good. How can he grow as an artist if he is doing the same things over and over?  <br /> <br />Like millions of others, I love his voice and am excited for what the future holds for him. He's not my typical genre of music (hard rock and new country) so I am surprised that I love his music so much. He definately has talent and so much potential. The same cannot be said for most \\"artists\\" on the music scene today.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Like another reviewer said, I was hooked the first time I saw Everwood, and that was the last season. I was so happy to see reruns on Family channel so could get the background. It does seem, however, that not all of the episodes are aired.  I don't know how I ever missed the first seasons of this. I cannot understand WHY this was cancelled !!!  It has something for everyone, and gets to the nitty gritty of people !! I love Andy, Amy, Nina, Rose, Harold, Edna, Ephram, Delia,Bright, all of them ! I look fwd to when ALLLLL the episodes are on DVD.
0385504209|2.0|All the falsehoods that Brown puts into his \\"Da Vinci Code\\" are enormously annoying. It is one thing to have a fictional story play in a historic background that is basically described correctly, but quite another to add statement upon statement about history and historical figures that are outrightly wrong. Years from now, I will meet people who will tell me that Emperor Constantine made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, that the Bible is distorted by layers of translations, or that Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper\\" is a fresco, falsehoods that they took from Brown's book, although that may have forgotten their source by then. This book should only be read accompanied by a source that corrects Brown's continuous historical distortions, such as &lt;[...]>, which I found quite helpful.<br /><br />The story itself is a wonderful adventure, with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and quite a lot of suspense. Although the heroine is a \\"cryptographer\\", the problems that our protagonists have to solve are actually classical riddles, playful, often in wonderful verse, with lots of surprising allusions and unexpected solutions. Without Brown's historical lies, this would be quite a nice book.
B000055Y0X|5.0|A good movie, and one that makes you think a little.   <br />Just enjoy the movie, don't analyze it.  <br />Peter Sellers is great.
B000J103PC|4.0|This was just Okay.  Typical Chick flick with a happy ending.  Blah Blah Blah.  Wait for Cable. I guess if you really bored rent it.   <br /> <br />
B000J10EQU|4.0|I waited a while to see this film because I was just not sold on Routh as the man of steel, but after seeing the movie, I think he was a good choice, eventhough it was a bit creepy to see him mimic Christopher Reeve, it was almost like caracature.  Kevin Spacey was fantastic, though i was taken aback at how dark they made Lex, I mean to have him actually Murder Superman was shocking and the way it was done was so cold and raw, but he did channel Hackman with some of his humor.  It was a gorgeous film to watch, the cinematography was stunning.  If  you have any interest in Superman or enjoyed the Superman of Christopher Reeve, then i dont think you'll be disappointed in this film, but be forwarned it can be dark.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie was great.  I loved this movie.  When I brought this home my husband said I will not watch this movie.  Chick Flick.  He watched the entire movie with me.  I was floored.  He said that was a really  good movie.  And it was!

I answer:  5.1 Surround Sound.  AND!!!!: a hilarious - new - beginning to the beginning of the credits of the movie of the film!  What more can possibly be written about the sheer genius of this landmark cinematic milestone???  HELL, I don't know!!  What I do know is that every time a New, Improved, Deluxe, Magnificent, Refined, Extended, EXTRAORDINARILY UNIQUELY updated version of this movie is released, I WILL be first in line to purchase it. So there!!. . . Oh, and the new HD film transfer is very nice, very nice indeed.
B00000J7SS|5.0|When I first heard this music, it was at a time in my life when I was searching for life's meaning and the music struck a certain resonance with my core being.  I don't care about what Miles did before, after or during this time period, who his inspirations were or what effect this album had on future music progressions...I love this music for the music itself...it blows my mind in a way that no other music out there has ever been able to accomplish.  The reviewer who said this music was not drug inspired must themselves be out of their minds...it was produced at the height of the psychedelic revolution (Hello!?!).  Although I love everything about all of the tracks, my two favorite pieces are John McLaughlin and Miles Runs the Voodoo Down.  This stuff is completely original and hits you on so many levels...the musical contributions of the other members of the band are obscure yet intertwined through Miles haunting trumpet...the sounds create something transient and beautiful.  The only other Miles album I've heard that comes close to moving me the way this album did was an obscure later double album release called \\"Get Up With It\\".  So dim the lights, light some candles, pour yourself your favorite drink (or smoke), put this CD on and set yourself adrift...
0634060384|5.0|Some reviewers of this and other books in ths \\"Real Book\\" series have commented that the contents of the books are not provided. However, if you check the Hal Leonard website, you will find the list of songs included in each volume. (You'll have to do an internet search because the website address can not be posted here.) I found this particularly helpful and I suspect others will, too. These are great volumes and they are LEGAL versions, so the songwriters actually receive royalties on their work, as they should. <br />
0307346609|5.0|I'm so glad I came across this book. It was a great read. The author covered everything from every perspective from all over the world. The images he put in my head scared the crap out of me. This book makes me want to go buy a mountain and put booby traps and walls all around me. My only complaint was that sometimes I would get very involved with a character and before I knew it, his section would be over. All I can say is, this is the best zombie book I have ever read. And then at the end he gave a nod to Romero himself. I liked that he followed those rules. I really liked this book, if you like zombies, this is a must read.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|SPOILERS    While this version isn't perfect, most of its flaws are due to Donner's inability to shoot or re-shoot many scenes. Hence, I agree that this cut should be viewed as an an \\"approximation\\" of what Superman II could've been had Donner been allowed to finish it.      Removing the campy scenes made the three Kryptonian baddies much more menacing.  Non isn't a mere comic relief here; instead, he's a \\"big truck with hair on it\\", as Perry White put it.  Ursa remains superbly villanous; hissing \\"Let ME kill [Luthor]!\\"  Zod did more action to back up his threats. In one scene, he gleefully fires a machine-gun at the White House security staff.  This DVD also better explains Zod's hatred of Jor-El, by replaying scenes of the latter urging Krypton's council to punish the trio.    I've always liked Susannah York's scenes in the Lester cut, but Marlon Brando's scenes have much better continuity with the first movie. The dialogue was particularly good in Kal-El's talks with Jor-El. Kal-El argued that he only wanted to have as much, not more\\" chance at happiness as the people he has been serving. He later painfully realized what his dad was going to sacrifice for him yet again.      Marlon Brando portrayed Jor-El as an authoritative and intelligent leader and father, who would not hesitate to give his own life in order to save his son.  The \\"Jor-El repowers Kal-El\\" scene relies much more on their father-son dynamic than on special effects.    I liked this version's take on how Lois concluded and proved that Clark is Superman in disguise. Again, I praise the screenwriter for Lois' clever hints to Clark about her suspicions of his alter ego.    Luthor's scenes with Otis and Ms. Tesmacher ran a bit too long, as they had in the first movie.  But these actors do have perfect timing and chemistry.  Very witty dialogue during their escape from prison, and Miss Tesmacher's comments about the lack of decors and restroom in the Fortress of Solitude.    I'd initially thought it was pointless for Superman to turn back time in this movie.  He'd already outsmarted his enemies; besides, he knows Lois will never reveal his alternate identity.  But I came up with one justification for meddling with time -- Superman wanted to spare Lois from the anguish of knowing that she and Superman/Clark can't live together, despite them seeing each other at work everyday.     It would've been interesting what other ending Donner's team would've filmed had they returned to the set. But I prefer this DVD's ending to the memory-erasing kiss in the theatrical release.    All in all, Donner's work did make me feel that this version is a better extension of the first movie. It brought back much of the thrill I got when I saw the original movie in my childhood.  My huge thanks to those fans who  never lost hope in petitioning Warner Bros to release Donner's footage!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first came to learn of \\"Firefly\\" after seeing \\"Serenity.\\" About a month ago, HBO Signature Asia began advertising the feature film \\"Serenity\\" in most cable channels here. I found it odd that HBO would advertise in a channel other than its own. Initially, I felt that there must be some kind of buzz for HBO to do this. I do know from a year before that Mr. Roger Ebert gave \\"Serenity\\" some good marks but I just wasn't able to see it, either because it didn't show here, or maybe I just missed it. So by HBO's recommendations, I watched it. \\"Serenity\\" did leave some good impressions on me. Who says that Science Fiction movies need to be high- budgeted in order to work?<br /><br />So how do I describe Firefly?? Truly, it is unlike anything I've ever seen. While it is undoubtedly a science fiction, the feel of the Western Frontier past and some cultural mixture of East and West have been thrown into the lot. It's like...... well, it's like throwing the carrots, celery, spinach and the squash all together into the blender. While this fruit and vegetable concoction may not be so good, \\"Firefly\\" on the other hand, is. Despite its flaws, this show has a high amount of likeability.<br /><br />Okay, sorry to you Browncoats for saying that the show has some faults, but here are two or three that I must point out:<br /><br />1.) First off, I think the actors need to improve their Chinese. 95% of the time when they speak Chinese, I can't understand a GORRAM! thing they're saying. And, I'm supposed to understand it, living in Taiwan and all. So instead of being serious about a scene, I sometimes find myself guffawing after they've said their Chinese lines. However, this misfire will mostly go unnoticed to Western viewers.<br /><br />2.) Second, since \\"Firefly\\" is a mixture of the future and the past, it sometimes suffers heavily from present day mentality. I really do not know how to explain this well. It's like the Future but with the Present Day mentality imposed on it. For example, one would think that in the future, security technology would have made it hard for crooks to find a loophole in the system. But right there during the episode \\"Trash,\\" we see our heroes hack the garbage disposal system IN BROAD DAYLIGHT and in a place that was supposed to be crawling with Feds!! Maybe the feds were sleeping or the tracking computer malfunctioned when our heroes were performing their heist. Hmmm, the police sleeping and computers malfunctioning........... sounds like the present.<br /><br />3.) There are other flaws, but these are mostly minor. Things like budgetary constraints and some of the CGI that could have used improvement (like the canyon chase in the episode \\"The Message.\\")<br /><br />Far from downgrading the show, I point the above because I really wish that \\"Firefly\\" gets a second season soon. To Mr. Joss Whedon: I hope my suggestions are helpful. \\"Firefly\\" has a lot of potential in it. Frankly, I'd rather choose this show than the new \\"Battlestar Galactica.\\" (Although, I must point out that \\"B.G.\\" is a good show itself. It's just that it sometimes feels like it goes on and on in a circle that we get tired of the supposed character development. And, it has somewhat become obvious who the Ceylons masquerading as humans are. Really, most of the time, I get this feeling that no actual human have been left alive and that all those on board Galactica and Pegasus are actually Ceylons just waiting for their programs to start up!!)<br /><br />\\"Firefly\\" has a lot going for it. The characters, while these are essentially space thieves and smugglers, are likeable enough and never stereotyped. It's the relationships between the characters that make it work. As the show progressed on, there's almost no contention between the crew members. Captain Reynolds has one very loyal crew there! This is the magic formula that gets them through all their dangerous adventures (especially in the episode \\"War Stories.\\" Anyway, I guess I'm just tired of shows that have mutinous crews in them.)<br /><br />Another thing that \\"Firefly\\" has in its advantage is its lack of pretension. This is the Layman's Science Fiction. It totally lacks the technical lingo that is the trademark of the Star Trek Series. And, while there are no aliens about or any presentation of how aliens live on other planets, it does give us a view of what human life on the frontier planets might be like. Sadly though, there aren't enough episodes to really give us a larger picture of this.....<br /><br />The cultural mishmash in this Whedonesque `verse help make it all fresh; as do the script and the witty dialogues. There's a good dose of humor thrown in to make things fun. And, it's not dumb as some purport it to be, but quite intelligent (except when it shows that Present Day Mentality.) I like the character Mr. Nathan Fillion plays, as the Captain Malcolm Reynolds and this relationship he has with Inara (Morena Baccarin.) Both of them have trememdous sex appeal. There's electricity there between them but kept wisely in check.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Firefly\\" entertains. But to be fair to you REAVERS out there, I must say that it may not please everyone's tastes. Except ice cream, what does anyway?? (GASP!!! Did I just say Reavers?? *Shocked* I mean to say `Readers.' Apologies!!)  If you watch the show, just go along for the ride, suppress the Critic in you, then put it under the sofa and sit on it if you have to. Eventually, there's a good chance that the \\"Firefly\\" glow will get into you, because it really has that quality.<br /><br />Not since \\"Brisco County,\\" \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" and \\"Friends\\" have I been entertained like this.

B0001611DI|5.0|This is the one. And I shouldn't even limit it to that genre: this is one of the must see horror movies of all time. Gore: over the top. Not for the squeamish.

But, don't miss the stuff besides the gore: this is a stinging indictment of American consumerist society, cleverly executed as \\"just\\" a horror movie. I'm not afraid of zombies after watching this movie (they are pretty funny in most of the film) - I'm scared of MALLS!
B0002BK9J4|5.0|prior to buying this album, i had heard almost nothing off of it.  i saw the music video for poison heart on youtube, but other than that, the album was a mystery.  to me, it is like a combination of brain drain and pleasant dreams.  it works greatly, although it isnt as good as either of them, it is still damn fine in its own right.    as for this edition, i think the captain oi re-issue versions of brain drain, mondo bizarro, acid eaters, and adios amigos are the best editions we are going to be seeing for a while. it would be nice if rhno re-issued these(along with animal boy and halfway to sanity) somewhere along the line in much the same way that the first 8 were done. that would be..well..mondo!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sad to think we only got one season of this exciting and gritty look at the future of mankind.  This is good stuff.... characters cleanly defined with little clutter for the sake of an episode... just enough flashback history for you to get the gist without dragging down the forward motion... and even though the series moves in a linear fashion, each episode is enough of its own story so as to not leave you lost if you missed a detail.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the space sci-fi genre... the only downside is the series was cancelled just as some juicy plotlines were converging.
B00005MAM2|1.0|That's it, no more non Miyazaki. I have never been disappointed by a Miyazaki movie, whether it be [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], [[ASIN:B0001XAPZ6 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]], or even [[ASIN:B0001XAPY2 Porco Rosso]], they are all great. This is the second movie done by this guy that I've seen, the first being Steamboy and I have to say that if he is considered a great than I won't even bother in the anime genre anymore. I thought I was an anime fan, but this one made me change my mind. I am a Miyazaki fan, not an anime fan. NO MORE NON MIYAZAKI ANIME FOR ME!<br /><br />Now let's get to the movie itself. I'll break it down into pieces for you.<br /><br />Story - what story? There's this motor gang, they go out hitting people, and one of them gets hurt and taken to a government lab. There they give him power, how they never say, but they do. After some scenes of spilling his guts and getting attacks by milk stuffed teddy bears the guy escapes and starts killing people and blowing stuff up. He knocks down a bridge, a lot of buildings, blows up a stadium, and even brings down a satellite. He goes looking for Akira, some guy who did something in the past (what is never clear) for some reason and when he finds him turns into a big glob or something. Normally I like strange stories like this one, but please make it have a little bit of sense.<br /><br />Characters - there are lots of characters, but none of them get much past. Tetshuwa, the guy that turns into a glob thing, is an orphan and was beat up a lot as a kid. He is really a very angry person who takes his frustration out on all those around him when he gets his new powers. Really he's the only character in the whole movie that gets any sort of attention. The characters of Kanada, Kia, and the cornel guy, are never developed. There just . . . there.<br /><br />Setting - The year is 2015 and something happened in the 80's that did something bad so now Tokyo is a rat hole where bad stuff happens all the time to good and bad people, but then again there aren't that many good people in Japan in 2015 anyway. The city is really a nice piece of work, but I never really know what happened to everything. There was a nuclear war or something that Akira had something to do with, but I would like to KNOW what exactly took place.<br /><br />Soundtrack - I am spoiled. I own the music to the [[ASIN:B0000DZEA1 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]], [[ASIN:B0001XAS7G Hayao Miyazaki Box: Princess Mononoke/Spirited Away]], [[ASIN:B000BCE8QY The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]], and dozens of other movies. I have a very high standard for soundtracks. But I have to tell you whoever came up with this soundtrack must have been drunk. There are only a few parts where you can actually take your mind off the confusing story to listen to the music, and every time it is the same thing. People yelling dramatically. It is very annoying.<br /><br />Ending - umm, what ending? Did you see an ending? Caus I didn't. Call me whatever you want, but I just didn't get it, what ever it was. There's a ball of light, Tetshua gets sucked into it, Akira goes into it, and everything gets destroyed, the end. SOMBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I MISSED. No, really, tell me what i missed. Aparently there's suposed to be some deeper meaning that all the fans of this movie keep talking about, but I didn't see any. I really want to know what the ending was suposed to mean, so if you know, tell me. Please. . .<br /><br />Well there you have it. I just want to say that if this is the standard for anime than I'm through with the genre. THIS MOVIE IS THAT BAD!!!!! and please people, don't give me a \\"not helpfull\\" vote just because you disagree. if yuo are able to leave a respecfull coment please do so. thanks.but then again there aren't that many good people in Japan in 2015 anyway.

0435123432|5.0|Since this novel was written decades ago - I would say that \\"At First Sight\\" (starring Val kilmer) is a rip off of this novel. Except that in this novel the main character is mentally retarded instead of blind.  <br /> <br />The novel is in the form of a diary written by the main character. As the character's IQ improves and he becomes smarter the diary's contents become profound.  <br /> <br />When I read the main story line on the cover - I expected an emotion filled mushy and cheesy novel. Since this novel was given to me as a gift I started reading it anyways. The first few pages did validate my initial impression - but soon enough I realized the novel is anything but mushy and cheesy. Of course it is an emotional roller coaster - but the author has done such an amazing job in narrating the story that you never feel any mushiness. Instead you would relate to the emotions that the main character goes through. Additionally you would also be able to relate to several other characters in the novel.  <br /> <br />Simply put this is an awesome cathartic novel - the ups and downs of the mentally challenged main character are just a metaphor to the readers' individual trials and tribulations.  <br /> <br />Warning to the weak hearted - do keep a box of tissues handy !
B000F3AAUW|5.0|There are a lot of long and in depth reviews below so I'll try to keep it short and sweet.  This album is fabulous!  It sort of reminds me of some of Andre 3000's more experimental solo work.  My favorite track would have to be \\"Just A Thought,\\" with the sinlge, \\"Crazy\\" coming in a close second and \\"Storm Coming\\" also getting repeated play. There's quite a variety of songs here, they definitely don't all sound the same, but they still fit together nicely I think.  The only song that I tend to skip is the first track, it's a little bizarre and hectic.  All in all I look forward to the next release!
0151003084|5.0|Not for young children. A wonderful child like book for adults! I love Edward Gorey's artwork, and his dark humor is incredible. I read it out loud to myself & end up a little creeped out, yet uncontrollably giggling.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|Don't miss this highly unusual, haunting film.  It is truly a product of the late 1960's and some things including the score are dated but also perfectly  evoke the time period.  Other Amazon reviewers have compared this ambiguous morality tale to an expanded TWILIGHT ZONE episode and the comparison is fair.  And again as others have said 55 year old Burt Lancaster looks fantastic in a swimsuit and remember this was filmed in the days before liposuction!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I love good guitar music and thses 2 CD's are full of great guitar work. Long songs, great riffs, strong vocals and that great Chili Peppers style woven though both CD's. A FANTASTIC RECORDING! I have listened to this at least 12 times in the last couple of weeks and like it better all the time. A classic in the world of Rock music IMO. Excellent!
B000HT3P7E|4.0|Well, I totally find this series to be a delight to watch as you empathize with all characters.  This DVD collection is basically your no-frills edition.  But, I am not complaining since this series doesn't exactly have stellar TV ratings.  So, this TV show making it on DVD is a big deal for me.  Now, I would have expected 3 discs in 3 cases but there are 2 cases (one case for first disc and another one for 2nd and 3rd discs on each flap).  Well, you will love the designs on the discs since they remind you of the episodes: blue French horn, pineapple, and weather map.  Plus, you have commentaries on some of the episodes as well as blooper reels.  Overall, Barney would say this is \\"legendary\\".
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Why can't these two actors make more movies together?  They were so incredible together in SPEED as young actors and obviously they only improved with time.  This movie was so incredibly romantic, I rented it and subsequently bought the DVD along with it's awesome Sound Track.  You must get both.  The sound track is so soothing, I play it all day long, while cooking or just relaxing with a cup of tea.   <br /> <br />As others have said, don't try to analyze the movie too much.  I've watched it over 6 times and I'm still puzzled over certain spots.  Just enjoy the simple plot of a parallel universe where two lovers meet and set the screen on fire with their heat.  One of the best romantic movies I've seen in a very long time.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Love is the answer. All you need is love. Love is the flower, you gotta let it grow. All these things are true, but Love is also the adaptation of The Beatles catalog to the antics of Cirque du Soleil. What if the music of the 60's included DJ cross fades like those made popular in modern dance circuits? It might sound a little like Love. Some of the combinations chosen are intriguing ~ \\"Blackbird\\" blended with \\"Yesterday\\" ~ \\"Come Together\\" with \\"Dear Prudence\\". But while these new mixes are probably necessary to sample a large swath of The Beatles catalog during the limited time of a Cirque du Soleil performance, I find most of them unnecessary for an album. That is not to say that some of the results are not spectacular. The melody of \\"Within You, Without You\\" sung over the tribal drumming of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is both hypnotic and eminately pleasing. Likewise the version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which replaces the Eric Clapton jam with a George Martin string arrangement adds new dimensions to this classic. But the real star of Love is the remastering where the integrity of the individual songs is respected. Thankfully, that is most of the album. The songs and sounds come through as though they were recorded \\"yesterday\\", as beautifully clear as a sonic artisan spring where the cool waters of creativity and emotion flow forth without a hint of crackle or distortion.    I have listened to these songs all my life. I try to take care not to listen to them too often, least they lose their power to move me. Love has allowed me to listen to these songs again as if for the first time and that is a gift. The Beatles at the hight of their creativity were an artistic force to be reckoned with. Each one of them shines on this album ~ the soaring vocals, the better then perfect harmonies, and the excellent and innovative musicianship. They took everything to the next level and Love takes them to the next level. I hope with all my heart that similar care and attention will be given to the whole Beatles catalog. The poetry of it all be dammed for the moment, \\"Love\\" is not all we need.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|The extended version of The Wicker Man is a disturbing classic that will be etched in many an individual's memory for years to come.    The movie begins with the search for a missing girl, where Howie, a Scottish policeman played by Edward \\"The Equalizer\\" Woodward, leaves for Summerisle, an isolated location that is detached, both geographically and culturally, from the mainland of Scotland.    During his search, Howie is shocked by the pagan customs prevalent at Summerisle. Rituals honoring earth and sun gods are replete with dances performed by women (some of them nude), parades that include citizens who dress as if they were team mascots, and rites honoring the local, cultural heritage conducted by third-generation \\"high priest\\", Lord Summerisle, who is craftily played by Christopher Lee.    Lord Summerisle, who is the torchbearer of the pagan practices mixed in with advanced agrarian proficiencies passed down from his grandfather, has continued the tradition of celebrating a key annual event, namely May Day. During this observance, the aforementioned rituals occur alone if there has been an abundant crop within the past year; if, however, there has been a not-so-productive season, then the celebrations must conclude with sacrifices of a most disturbing nature. After discovering this most sinister side of what was once perceived as a harmless, yet civilized, society and knowing that May Day is both just around the corner and on the heels of a bad harvest, Howie comes to believe that the girl he is searching will be \\"offered to the gods\\".    It is upon this conviction that Howie intensifies his investigation, and further encounters with the people of Summerisle will set the final stages that will transform what was a highly predictable detective story into a prologue to the last scene, the arrival of the \\"The Wicker Man\\". It is near the end that the climactic tone is surged forth so suddenly that the audience is anything but fully prepared for the shocking last three minutes.    If ever there was a movie with twists that paralleled the wickedest of bait-and-switch patterns imaginable, this is it.     A final word of warning: with occasional nude scenes and reverberating themes of fundamentalist Christianity versus paganism, The Wicker Man is not suitable for everyone, especially those who draw a rather thin line between fiction and reality. So be careful in choosing those individuals you plan to watch this with.
B00030590I|5.0|I love Zhang Yimou's films and found this one to be no exeception.  The use of color and imagery is amazing.  I'm not sure how many Americans realize that the old Technicolor movie cameras found their way to China allowing some its greatest directors to make use of the best and most stable color movie process around.  I'm sure it was an honor for Jet Li, Tony Leueng and Maggie Cheung to make a movie with him and such a wonderful movie too.  The story is told beautifully and movingly.

B000002UAI|4.0|...this actually isn't bad. Okay, there are some bad songs, mainly covers: their version of Mr. Moonlight ties A Taste of Honey as the Beatles all-time worst (It may even BEAT A Taste of Honey); and Words of Love isn't really much better. Their readings of Rock and Roll Music and Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby are surprisingly limp; the only worthwhile cover is Ringo's lightweight but entertaining showcase Honey Don't. And why weren't the contemporary singles I Feel Fine and She's a Woman (and their rockin' cover of Bad Boy) not included here? Stupid UK traditions...<br /><br />Still, this is the best set of Lennon/McCartney originals to date: Lennon was finally finding his voice, that is, an introspective, Dylan-esque one. Tracks like No Reply; I'm a Loser; and I Don't Want to Spoil the Party prove this, and are not coincidentially among the best songs on the album, along with Paul's pretty acoustic ballad I'll Follow the Sun. And who can resist smiling and singing along to Eight Days a Week? Every Little Thing is about as close to a lost treasure as you'll find in the Beatle catalogue, it's really a great song, and deserves to be remembered as more than \\"that song that Yes covered\\". A couple of the originals are slight, but still entertaining (the country-influenced Baby's in Black; What You're Doing, wiht interesting harmonies), but it's No Reply; I'm a Loser; I Don't Want to Spoil the Party; I'll Follow the Sun and Every Little Thing (Eight Days a Week is available on most compiliations) that carry this album and make it a must for Beatles fans.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|The movie's plotline it is as 'cliche' as you can get.  A troubled teenager who lives in a foster home gets himself in trouble (yet again!) but this time meets a gorgeous girl, falls in love, and also finds the meaning of life.  I must also mention that the script and the direction of the movie was not so impressive, either.  So, artistically, two stars would be a very generous rating for this movie.  However, this is a movie about dancing.  And to rate the movie's depiction of dancers 'dancing' I give it five stars.  I would also give the casting director credit for casting the two main characters of this movie, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.  Their vibrant and sexy nature completely draws us, the audience, into the screen and makes it a little more bearable for us to watch the weak plotline unfold.  And then when they dance, it is simply amazing.  The dancing, on its own, makes the movie worthwhile to watch.  Unlike other movies about dancing, these actors both come from a dancing background and you can clearly see that in their performances in the movie.  I also liked that the movie allows the actors to break into dancing a few times before the big finale, unlike other movies where you have to wait 'til the end to see the actors show off what they can do.  Lastly, I read that Channing Tatum was one of the top 10 most googled people in the recent months.  I think that is enough to tell you that he is sizzling HOT in this movie.  ;-)

B00005V9HH|4.0|\\"The Usual Suspects\\" seems at first to be the typical tale of a gang of urban criminals. But each minute brings the viewer deeper and deeper into a world in which things are not as they seem. The plot tentacles from the low-life antics of a group of five LA criminals into a global network of criminal enterprise and motivations that is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />The tale is told mostly from the vantage point of 'Verbal' Kint, a small time criminal who is being interrogated by the police. Kint retells a story that starts when he was unexpectedly included in a lineup that includes the other four - the \\"usual suspects\\" of the title. There is a police shakedown going on, the unraveling of which becomes the central story line of the entire film.<br /><br />Great performances, especially by Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, the one-time big operator trying to go straight and by Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, the laconic fixer-in-chief of a mysterious Bulgarian named Keyser S&ouml;ze.<br /><br />Well-written and captivating from beginning to end.
0689878451|4.0|Was the book any good? Yes. The watercolor illustrations were beautiful, the message of love creating a family, rather than blood relationships is definitely one to share with children. I do not believe that children will become homosexual from reading this. They'll probably giggle like little Olive in \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" and say, \\"That's silly!\\" Parents should not be concerned. You'll make your own decisions either way as far as purchasing this book, but nobody's going to be convinced either way on the morality of homosexuality from a posting on the internet. Heck, this is futile isn't it. Go back to fighting; don't mind me.
B00005JPDS|5.0|This is the best survival story I've ever seen and is certainly some of Will Smith's best work.     This true story made into a movie is about how real life Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith); a street pounding medical equipment salesman, faces seemingly insurmountable odds and comes out a winner.     Gardner invests the family nest egg in very high tech bone density scanners and plans to set the world on fire with his salesmanship skills to catapult his brood into wealth and prosperity. But the world does not beat a path to his door to buy his new gizmos and the Gardner family falls onto financial hard times. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton) grows weary of working double shifts while her ever optimistic husband returns home each day lugging the same two scanners under his arms unsold.     Finally, Linda flees the marriage to New York, leaving her 9-year old son Chris, Jr. (Jaden Smith) and her shell-shocked husband to fend for themselves.     In a bid to change his fortunes, Gardner applies for an internship at Dean Whitter as a stock broker. Unfortunately, the six month program has no salary and Gardner is faced with having to work for free, care for his son, and make ends meet as a single parent all at the same time.     If that weren't bad enough, things quickly go downhill from there. Gardner and his son are evicted from their apartment because they can't pay the rent, and poor dad is subsequently arrested for not paying parking tickets (for a car he no longer owns). Afterwards, the hapless pair are forced to fight for a room each day in a first-come first-served homeless shelter to keep a roof over their heads. One day when they arrive late, they're informed that the shelter had run out of space and they end up sleeping on the floor of a subway bathroom with toilet paper for a mattress.     The only means Gardner has to earn money is to keep selling the last of his bone density scanners, two of which he manages to get stolen. It's a fight for survival as he recovers his stolen property, repairs them, and sells them just in time to keep the wolves at bay. It's hard to believe that so much adversity can fall on one man, yet that's exactly what happened to the real Chris Gardner.     This movie is an inspiration to anyone who faces seemingly insurmountable odds and fights to survive. The real Chris Gardner not only beats out his competition in the internship program, but today he is a multimillionaire and owner of his own investment firm.     It's an American success story mixed with the gritty reality of human suffering, tenacity, and the struggle to survive.     If you want to watch a quality film with great actors and a great uplifting message, then you want to go see this movie and definately buy the DVD when it's released.
B000HT386M|5.0|When Adam Sandler started his career, I couldn't stand him. But now he's making fantastic movies. This movie is full of huge laughs and highly emotional scenes. I was touched. I think the promotion for this movie was terrible though. It's a lot better than it looked in the commercials.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|I did not know anything about this film when I picked it up.  I kept wondering why the characters were speaking in epigrams, which I characterized as \\"wannabe Wildisms.\\"  Then, when I read the other reviews here I discovered that this was actually based on a play of Oscar Wilde!Somehow, in the lips of these actors, they failed to scintillate.  I was horribly bored by the first half and only the pretty scenery kept me watching.  Then the plot thickened and I actually enjoyed the story.<br /><br />The main problem, which many of the other reviewers here have mentioned is the serious miscasting.  Helen Hunt, who is so great in other films was just terrible here.  She played the vulnerable aspects well but completely lacked the over-the-top charm that the character demanded.<br /><br />Likewise, Scarlett Johanson whose performances elsewhere have been lovely, just was wrong, wrong, wrong here.  She didn't even look good, and that must take some doing.<br /><br />With other actresses this might have been a really successful film.  However I suspect that the director had a hand in its failure.  I didn't mind the change of place or period; in fact I thought Amalfi in the 30's was a good choice.  But Wilde in his genius, could present something as a not-too-serious, highly mannered piece and still inject the right amount of humanity into it.  This director didn't manage to combine those two elements well.  The fun parts were with the old guys; when the tone became serious, it lost it.<br /><br />Still, if you're not expecting to see a film of the quality of Oscar Wilde's plays and are just content to pass a pleasant two hours, this might be for you.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|With out a doubt, this has to be the best sounding album I have ever had the opportunity to experience.  And that is the key word - experience.  This is not an album you casually listen to - that would be all to passive.  To get the true benefit of this album, you must emurse yourself in all it's 5.1 glory.  For get the CD only - save it for the car.  The DVD is the true gem here. <br /> <br />What George Martin and his son have done is take music that we all know by heart.  Songs that span the entire six year odyssey are all represented, but then have been remastered to give them new clarity and vibrance that only one as intimate with the Beatles can give.  This is a tremendous gift to the music loving public! <br /> <br />The first time I heard the DVD, I sat through all 81 minutes of it in shear awe - not only of the production value, but also the musicians and artists that created the raw material.  There is no doubt in my mind that John, Paul, George, and, yes, even Ringo, created the best pop-rock quartet of all time.  Their works are only enriched and improved upon by this project. <br /> <br />Do not miss any opportunity to listen to LOVE.  Pay special attention to all the George Harrison works - the originals are polished, buffed, and then given a shine that will make you wish that Harrison was still writing music.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I kind of like this CD. I don't listen to it as much anymore for some reason, but I think I'm overdue to listen to it again. One of my favorite songs on this album is \\"respect\\" which talks about how girls should act around guys and how they should not let boys push them around any time the boy thinks it's convenient for them \\"no freebies in the limosouine that's not what it's about. let 'em know just what to do give it up he won't call you respect is just a minimum, go on girl and get you some\\" Another song about not letting men push girls around that I really like is \\"can't get me down\\". Which talks about getting ready to face the day and anything that might come one's way. I love encouraging songs like that... they really help you face your problems in life. I don't like to many of the songs on here because of the swearing content but I do listen to \\"Mizundastood\\" constantly. She only says one swear word in the song but I don't mind. Otherwise I avoid songs on here that have swearing on them. I like this CD otherwise... but if you're under sixteen, I wouldn't recommend it because of the swearing. I forgot to add that another one of my favorite songs is \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\".
B000IJ6QTC|4.0|This set is great and a definite must for any Star Wars fanatic.  The casual fan probably won't be impressed though.  However, do not buy this for $150.  I was going to, but I found it at Best Buy for $70.  The tin is really cool- it opens on both sides- but it dents fairly easily.  6 movies and a flimsy (but cool) tin is not worth $150.
B00006I53S|5.0|I recently puchased this lens to fill in the gap between an EF 50mm f/1.8 II and an EF 70-300 f/4-5.6 telephoto, essentially replacing the low-grade kit lens which comes with a Digital Rebel XTI.<br /><br />The Good?<br />- Sharp, bright images in a variety of conditions.<br /><br />- Image stabalization allows crisp shots at reasonable shutter speeds, even at full zoom.  I haven't found the need for a tripod outdoors using this lens yet.<br /><br />- Just the right range for a general purpose \\"walkabout\\" lens.  For a casual nature enthusiast, or even a more dedicated one, this lens is a must have.  Great for shooting flowers, large insects, or braver wildlife.  Of course, having a good macro lens and a telephoto is a must for a serious outdoor photographer.  The 28-135 will come in handy many times though!<br /><br />- Comfortable to hold, not unduly heavy or awkward.<br /><br />The Bad? I have no major objections, but I keep seeing comments about the durability of the lens, and for the price, it could be built a bit more solidly.  A general complaint with this series of lenses- I wish that Canon packaged hoods, UV filters, and a case with the lens (even if it increased the price a bit).

0743487486|3.0|I bought this book hoping to get some advice on how to deal with kids (although my first baby isn't born  yet). I wanted to be prepared. But, the author spends SO much time telling you how NOT to treat your kids, and I feel like much of what he says is common sense. I'd like to know HOW to deal with certain situations that may arise so that I can be prepared. To compare this book with it's polar opposite:Dare to Discipline by James Dobson, I find it interesting how BOTH authors approach children from the same standpoint, of finding out the motive behind a behavior and to approach discipline from a loving and respectful standpoint. (This is one thing I like about both books.) But, the approaches are totally different. The approach presented in this book lacks the specifics that I was looking for, especially age appropriate discipline. I'd be happier with an author who wasn't as vague as this author, and not as supportive of physical restraints as Dr. Dobson.
B0000683DH|4.0|I'm foremost a Star Wars fan, with the Star Trek universe being very foreign to me. But this movie (along with Search for Spock and Voyage Home, which form the trilogy) came highly recommended by a friend, so I gave them a spin. Plus its absolutely essential for any movie buff to see Shatner's now-legendary scream of \\"Khaaannnn!!!\\"<br /><br />I liked this one. Not being a Trek fan a few small details were lost on me, but overall the movie does well referencing the episode on which it was based without being slaved to it. The Genesis Project creates a lot of moral and ethical questions with its science, exactly the type of sci-fi that Trek is best known for. Good special effects, and good acting - it's telling that the conflict between Kirk and Khan feels real despite the fact they never meet in person. \\"Khaaannnn!!!\\" drew me in. The touching finale sold me. Good stuff.<br /><br />Solid dvd, with lots of good information. Some of the bonus features come off a little dry, as they're nothing but \\"talking head\\" interviews for the most part. But again, they show you just how much more of the Trek universe was apparantly established with this film.<br /><br />So I wouldn't count myself as a Trek fan yet, but Khan definitely made me excited to check out more Trek adventures. And that works for me.

B00005JPDP|5.0|Devotedly accurate to the best-selling novel, Birkin, Eichinger and Tykwer have made the best film I can remember seeing. The music was written first and the film created around it as this was the prime way of evoking smell - but the use of building colour, absolutely stunning sets, costumes and cinematography, clever use of defining the tiniest of sounds and a stream of colour just enhances the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle(!). I didn't rate Alan Rickman until I saw this - two scenes in particular - work them out for yourself. Dustin Hoffman combines perfectly the sense of European history, dark and light humour, a huge range of emotions and gravity. Ben Wishawe is perfectly captivating! Buy this film, show it to your friends, children, parents or you may regret it. If you don't quite get the depth at first, watch it again, then keep it and as life reveals more of it's mystery, pain, love and beauty watch it again!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Relaxing sounds with a country/folk and (occasionally) a blues flavour. As usual, with music produced by MK, the sound quality is very good (perhaps, a little over-produced on this album).<br /><br />THE SONGS : They are all pretty good (2 or 3 are quite exceptional). MK (co-) penned all but 2, many have fine melodies and almost all have great lyrics.<br /><br />THE VOCALS : Whilst MK's voice, with it's gruff and slightly Dylan-esque timbre, has a certain appeal, he is not the best singer in the world (but he does OK on most tracks). When he's on form, he's pretty good - listen to 'Sailing to Philadelphia', but when he's bad, he's pretty awful (e.g. 'Brothers in Arms'). Fortunately, EH steps in to provide an almost perfect vocal foil. I'm not too familiar with her solo work but, if this album is anything to go by, she's in a class of her own. Her soloing is great (should have been more of it). I've seen reviews which imply that her contribution has been relegated to providing harmony vocals. Well I can't agree - solo vocals are about evenly shared and, sure, her harmony vocals are subtle and restrained but, without them, MK's rather laconic drawl might have become (on an album of essentially 'laid back' music) tedious and boring.<br /><br />THE PLAYING : Having 'slagged-off' MK for his dubious vocal skills, I must now try to ingratiate myself with his fans. He must be one of the best finger picking guitarists around; his playing permeates all tracks and, on some, it is just sublime (but Dire Straits it is NOT).<br /><br />A few comments about selected tracks (* denotes a favourite) :<br /><br />THIS IS US* - Upbeat 'foot-tapper', great lyrics.<br /><br />RED STAGGERWING - Sort of 'hoe-down' country feel, witty lyrics with some light-hearted sexual innuendo.<br /><br />ROLLIN' ON - The least country/folk sounding track; nice melody, fluent guitar and great vocals by EH.<br /><br />RIGHT NOW* - Not too strong on melody but I liked the 'bluesy' guitar licks (reminded me a bit of the guitar sound on some of the Eagles' early stuff).<br /><br />ALL THE ROADRUNNING* - Strong 'celtic' feel; fantastic lyrics, superb melody and great vocals.<br /><br />IF THIS IS GOODBYE* - Very poignant melody and lyrics. Very few songs get me all 'choked up' but this comes close; stunning vocals by EH.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying this album, ignore what the professional reviewers have to say (some seem to have 'lost the plot'). Check out the public reviews and then decide. It's not perfect, so I'll give it just 4-Stars.e a bit of the guitar sound on some of the Eagles' early stuff).<br /><br />ALL THE ROADRUNNING* - Strong 'celtic' feel; fantastic lyrics, superb melody and great vocals.<br /><br />IF THIS IS GOODBYE* - Very poignant melody and lyrics.

B000DN5W4I|5.0|Joe B. is, in my opinion, the top blues/rock artist at this point in time.  This DVD captures him well, but I recently saw him live in Las Vegas at a small club and his performance there was even better.  In Vegas, he started off with \\"Just Got Paid\\" by ZZ Top and never let up for the next two hours.  On this DVD, \\"Takin' the Hit\\" shows the driving force of his guitar and \\"Had to Cry Today\\" shows his \\"old school\\" influences.  (Check out his cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Tea for One\\" on his latest CD.) He handles everything from driving rock to slow blues and when he covers a song, he catches the appropriate nuances.  His tone is always aggressive but tasteful and his vocals are pretty good as well.  This is a guy who truly loves the guitar and his playing shows it in every way. I think this DVD is a must for any guitar player's collection and if you ever have a chance to catch his live act, don't pass it up - you will be mesmerized.

B000JJRIN4|1.0|This album is an insult to all of Gwen's fans.  I have been a fan of her work for as long as I can remember, and the \\"thrown together\\" noises, may easily slip through the cracks of not so musically inclined pop culture, however it is simply a marketing effort, with absolutely no structure.  The last song on the album, besides wind it up, are by far the only good songs on this record.  Hopefully she'll see a decline in album sales and realize that in order to actually sell music, you really have to TRY making some.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|This is still one of my favourite movies of all time. A true classic. Sexy Kelly whom many a young man would of dreamed about and Tom whom my wife still fantasises over.

You will watch it many times and will update the movie as i have had to do.
B000L43AN4|4.0|For the first two discs, this doesn't sound like a collection of tracks ranging from all over Waits' career that have been sitting on the butcher's floor--at least, other artists' collections of stuff that never made it onto previous albums have come across as inconsistent, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />It would seem odd that Waits could overcome such shortcomings in such a collection, for the man has had such a long and artistically varying career, but there are at least two things working in Waits' favor for _Orphans_, aside from his ungodly level of talent: first, many of these tracks are not simply ones that didn't make the final cuts of his other albums.  Waits has been a long contributor to soundtracks and variously themed albums--tributes, anthologies, etc.  So rather than be tracks that others may have thought inadequate (and rightfully so), this collection contains strong tracks that have appeared on other albums, for example his legendary version of \\"Heigh Ho\\" from _Snow White_ which was done for a Disney tribute album that had contained such talents as Sinead O'Connor, Sun Ra and others.  Also on here is \\"Poor Little Lamb,\\" a song he put together for the movie _Ironweed_.  So many of these tracks had simply not come out on a Waits-exclusive album...until now.<br /><br />Also, Waits has established himself as such an eclectic artist, starting with closing-time growls in his early work to vastly intricate and avant-garde mini-operas.  Waits pulled these stages together into a cohesive vision of him as a single artist with _Mule Variations_.  Thus, Waits established himself as an artist able to explore his whole history of sound in one album, allowing this collection to sound very cohesive, as an expression of the work of a singular artist.<br /><br />Waits also made this collection cohesive by grouping songs into tonal categories: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards.  Brawlers and Bawlers chould be pretty self-explanatory, though Bastards feels more like a disjointed collection disc than the others.  I can listen to the first two discs as though enjoying the latest recordings by Mr. Waits, but Bastards seemed to become the repository for anything that couldn't fit easily into a category.<br /><br />I will readily admit that Waits' work defines easy categorization, and so a disjointed collection like Bastards readily admits with its own title that this kind of disconnection should only help define this man's work, but it always seemed that Waits himself found ways to offer cohesive albums, whether through storylines as in _Frank's Wild Years_ or a simple tonal connection like there is among the songs on _Real Gone_.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--I will be listening to all three of these discs with pleasure again and again.  Tom Waits is perhaps one of the most unique and immediately recognizable voices that we have--a little bit Louis Armstrong in its gruff and pathos, a little bit Brecht in its mechanicism and baroque tightness, and more than a little bit stinky man at the end of the bar.  He is, perhaps, the most quintessential American artist we have today, and I would love to play everything he's done to every foreigner who thinks he knows what America is about.a disjointed collection disc than the others.

I highly recommend it to readers of historical biographies and memoirs-its a fantastic book!
B000001G1E|5.0|Very rarely has the passing of a public figure made me feel such deep emotions as I felt this Christmas day when we lost James Brown. Although I was fortunate enough to see him live and in concert before, I was looking forward to seeing him again on December 28th at a NJ venue and had been lucky enough to get second row seats, but it was not to be. I can literally separate my music listening life into two distinct periods: BEFORE and AFTER I heard JB. Once I heard him everything changed, and I couldn't look at music the same again after hearing him. What I thought was funky or groundbreaking before seemed tepid and uninspired after I heard him. I distinctly remember hearing \\"Sex Machine\\" at a party one night and the proverbial light went off. Since that time I have purchased all the JB I can get my hands on, including this collection. The music and message of JB has become ingrained in who I am over the years and has shaped so much of my appreciation for music. JB fused elements of soul, R&B and jazz to lay the foundations of what would later be known as funk music, and then managed to create what would become (in my opinion) the most memorable and definitive funk music ever recorded. But the man didn't just make good time party music; he always had something to say, whether it be unabashed pronouncements of black pride or urging kids to stay in school or away from drugs. JB's influence was so far reaching it almost seems incomprehensible; VERY few recording artists have managed to sustain careers that spanned several decades and remained relevant. His influence was felt on other continents as evidenced in Fela Kuti's music in Nigeria and the creation of Afrobeat, which Fela himself confessed was directly influenced by the rhythms present on James Brown's recordings. JB even had a hand in the early rap scene when artists like Public Enemy began sampling his music on their tracks in the mid 1980's. (And lets not forget that JB was one of the first to rap back in the early 1970's, check out \\"King Heroin\\" on this collection if you need a refresher.) The music contained on these four discs is a well chosen overview of his incredible career. As a general warning though, this probably won't be the end of your James Brown collection. I have found that his music is so infectious that I have kept buying more and more of it over the years. However, any newcomer to his music will find this collection to be an excellent place to start, and really any and every music fan should own this. I've said it before and I'll say it again: you ain't human if this doesn't move you. This past summer I was in the heart of the inner city waiting outside of a fast food restaurant in the take out line with my windows down, and blasting a live version of the JB's tearing through \\"Pass The Peas\\". I slowly turned as I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye, as three men who had been asking for change got up and began to dance. They yelled \\"GODFATHAAA!\\", and ended up coming to my window to ask what CD the song was from or if it was the radio. I'm sure everyone who has been touched by his music has a story like this, because the music of James Brown was something that brought us all together as people. Thank you for all the memories and God Bless you Godfather.early 1970's, check out \\"King Heroin\\" on this collection if you need a refresher.)

B000AMJDHY|5.0|It's really hard to have an album where each song is awesome. Panic! At The Disco managed to do just this. With their musical talent and witty lyrics, they've created a very good album. Their lyrics and music are a mind blowing combination. Their music is written for similar but slightly different interpretations. It's vague but to the point, which probably won't make any sense until you actually listen to the CD. My personal favorites are \\"But It's Better If You Do\\", \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" and \\"Camisado\\". Each song is unique. This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV is a great conclusion to what should be called the Genesis Trilogy. In \\"The Voyage Home\\" at the Federation Council the Klingons display the Genesis torpedo video. Genesis is a major topic in the two preceding movies, and these films leave off where the last one left.  <br /> <br />The \\"Voyage Home\\" is the most memorable motion picture of the series; it is unlike any other Trek adventure. Instead of Kirk's crew fighting a genetic superman or Klingon, they go back in time to the 1980's to pick up whales. On the surface (no pun intended) finding whales is a shallow (honestly, no pun intended) idea for an intelligent audiance (yes, trekkies are entilegent, and evn sofistikated). But director Leonard Nimoy does a superior job portraying how earth faces imminent destruction unless an alien probe is responded to by humpback whales. Like the original Trek episode \\"Tomorrow is Yesterday,\\" Kirk and crew travel back in time in a slingshot flight around the sun. What happens aftwerward is a hilarious adventure full of time travel gags, great one-liners, \\"colorful metaphors,\\" and puns (much better than mine). <br /> <br />Special features include an enlightening commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. This includes an acknowledgement by Nimoy of how George Lucas' success in Star Wars paved the way for Paramount to fund Star Trek films. Michael and Denise Okuda provide entertaining text commmentary, detailing how the film's studios were used afterwards by The Next Generation series. A feature called \\"Roddenberry Scrapbook\\" interviews the Trek creator's son, sharing fond memories of his father Gene. \\"Featured Artist Mark Lenard\\" is a cool interview of the late actor's wife and daughters, with their experiences of Lenard as dad and Romulan/Vulcan. Of course, you must watch \\"Kirk's Women,\\" which interviews some original episode guest stars (ironically, the best looking one was in \\"The Apple,\\" and she was Chekov's babe!)  <br />  <br />After adding Star Trek II,III, and \\"The Voyage Home\\" to your DVD collection, you can invest in these other quality Trek films: <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" (original cast) <br /> <br />NEW CAST <br />\\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" (a.k.a. 'Picard and Data vs. the Borg')  <br />\\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" (a.k.a 'Picard and Data vs. Aliens with Wrinkle Problems')  <br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" (a.k.a. 'Attack of the Picard and Data Clones')  <br />

What if your mother, Sally, dropped a bombshell on you; that she was in fact, through the revealings of a manuscript, a betrayed British spy gone dark. Her real name is Eva, driven into hiding and a alias life just as the United States enters WWII (1942). What if, to turn the burner up full, Eva tells you her story because her secret is, at the twilight of her life, being exposed; that it must lead to a fight to the death, matching wits and superb spy craft, and you, her daughter (Ruth), must play a part only you can be trusted with.<br /><br />The premise is novel-worthy. Ruth, the daugher and the first person point-of-view, was a well layered, but a shadow of her fascinating mother (so much like the entire baby boomer generation failed to match the WWII generation's accomplishments).<br /><br />As always, this author tells a very, very good story.

B000001Y2U|1.0|Alright, here goes the first intelligent low rating this album has recieved. No I'm not some christian preaching to you, I'm actually a fan of manson. I think the lyrics on this album are pretty good, but mediocre music. My main problem with this album is the fact that it is a total rip-off of david bowie. Let's look at the man himself. Manson wears contacts to make it look like he has two different colored eyes, while bowie actually has two different eyes. With Ziggy Stardust, Bowie's image became androgynous, just as manson's always has been. Now let's look at the actual albums of Ziggy and Antichrist. They both tell the story of a self-destructive unearthly rock and roll superstar. Manson's shock rock symbol even bears a strong resemblance to the Ziggy Lightning bolt. And this all comes from a man constantly preaching individualiry, while making an idol of himself, and slamming other artists for ripping him off. And then he put out mechanical animals, an exact replica of ziggy stardust, and ironically enough it's what made him truly famous. I just think it's a little hypocritical. Check out Holy Wood. It is much better lyrically and musically, and far more original. The other thing that really pisses me off is the vocal department. A lot of fans are saying his voice is underated, but i hate to say, he really can't sing. Watch the guns god and government tour and see how he really sounds. All he's basically good for are his writing skills...

B000F7CMRM|1.0|I saw this at the theater for $[...], which REALLY angered me. This had zero entertainment value to me, and I was confused about the plot...it isnt anything but political propaganda garbage with a Michael Moore type slimy feel to it.    Politically, I'm all over the map; I'm an issue-voter. This film wont appeal to anyone unless they hate President George Bush and blame him for everything wrong on the planet but FFS! Cant Hollywood make a film that doesnt have politics in it? I wouldnt like this even if I did blame Bush for AIDS, canine blindness, feline diabetes, and infant spiral-notebook injuries.    The last thing I want to see in a movie is someones personal political agenda. I havent been this mad since the movie JFK.    I cant wait for a democrat to be elected just to get the Bush-bashing to stop so I dont have to endure garbage like this (and have to pay for it to boot). Then again, when Clinton was president they never shut up about Regan.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|When 'Waiting for the world to change' starts off, you hear a soulful backing track with a wonderfully 'dry' snare drum, you can't help but think that J.M has changed styles. Indeed he has, but he changes styles on each of these wonderful tracks! His voice has taken a harder edge on some songs and a more gentle style on others, while not depending on that nasal tone that he has used to much success. Also, his guitar playing has taken more of a background role on this compilation, but with brilliantly 'tasty' solos when required. <br />All this has done has made this a more well-balanced work than his previous works, in my opinion. The range of songs go from an almost Otis Redding-ish feel on the opener, through to something like 'Gravity', which has a Peter Green-type guitar intro, and then he goes into 'The Heart of Life' with a voice reminiscent of the late Clifford T Ward.   <br />'Vulture' takes us up-tempo, and you find yourself waiting for the next treat that is sure to come. <br />I could go on and on, but there is no need-most of my fellow reviewers have been delighted-and rightly so. <br />I'll just say that it's very rare that you can say that there isn't a bad track on this CD. It's a delight to listen to, and should bring him some awards of some kind. With work like this-he sure deserves it.
0790737345|5.0|I love this movie.  That is my review.  I love the scenes in Lake Tahoe - the cinematography, the colors, the love... <br /> <br />I have one question.  Does Seth dive into the ocean at the end to kill himself, or to just enjoy the ocean. <br /> <br />Help, Please!!!
1582403589|4.0|When I first heard about a graphic novel series called The Walking Dead, I just thought that the novels would consist of a comic book writer and artist just using graphic novels as a method of expressing all their sickest, most disgusting zombie fantasies.  And I had no problem with that; that's one of the reasons I decided to read the first volume.  So you can imagine how surprised I was to discover that (Volume 1, at least) is a rather tasteful examination of society during a zombie apocalypse, not just a gore-fest that tries to disgust the reader in the most vivid ways possible.  As the introduction to the series states, the best zombie movies (or whatever) are the ones that have statements to make within the story, a sort of social significance that can be examined by looking at people in extreme situations, and The Walking Dead does that in extraordinary fashion.  The writing is deep and poignant, thanks mostly to some likable (if cliched) characters who are all surviving together in a camp outside Atlanta.  Coupled with some amazing, beautiful, even disturbing artwork, The Walking Dead is a graphic novel masterpiece that will hopefully continue its achievements throughout the series.
0618680004|5.0|Auhtor like Dawkins had been burned for more than a  thousand year but the truth can not be suppressed.  A wonderfull book.  An audio version is even better.  I really enjoyed his explanation of the root of religion.  He had answered my question for many year about why did nature develop the religious gene.
630514415X|5.0|This is one of Denzel's best performances as a loser father who accidentally kills his wife. His only hope for parole is to get his high school senior, star basketball player son to attend the college alma mater of one of the dude's that sits on his parole board. Great story that shows the greed in people's eyes and hearts when money is involved.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Okay, its pretty criminal that the ratings for this show are as low as they are.    I watched the entire first season in like a week and I was enjoying it by the first episode but hooked by the second.    The two leads in the show have great chemistry.    The episodes are mostly quite intriguing. The first season has a few weak ones but they are over in an hour (but its a 22 episode season, not every one can be a smash hit). For the most part, even the weaker episodes will keep you guessing until near the end.    I highly recommend this series.

0307346609|5.0|I dodged this book for months after my 19-yr-old son told me to read it. I have zero interest in zombie mythos. To my surprise, WORLD WAR Z turned out to be one of the best books I read this year.<br /><br />Funny and appalling in the right balance, engrossing, well-written, thought-provoking, even educational. I was beyond impressed with Brooks' erudite social and political commentary. And I found it nonpartisan. Brooks skewers all sides on an equal opportunity basis. As a writer, I was astounded by the amount of research that obviously went into this work, and as a reader, I appreciated the excellent quality of the storytelling.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps me from giving a full five stars: maybe there could have been a little more variety in the voices of those who share their stories. Some really searing moments - particularly the memories of a girl with \\"the mind of a 4-yr-old,\\" the unscrupulous rationale of the pharmaceutical exec, and a former soccer mom's dispassionate view of her old lifestyle - stand out because they depart from the hard-boiled tone, and I wished there was more of that.<br /><br />It could be argued, however, that the unanimously shell-shocked feel is more powerful than any oovy-groovy character-driven melodrama would have been. And even though it leaves some characters less textured than others, that documentary \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" tone works fantastically well throughout the book to keep up a relentlessly engaging pace.<br /><br />So what the hell, I'll give it five stars after all. And I'll be interested to see what Max Brooks writes next.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I didn't see the Superman movies which came out in the 80's and that must have really threw me off for this one.  It started out with me lost, and ended with me lost. There was very little character developement of anyone, from Lois to the big guy himself.  I grew up watching reruns of the old show and reading the comic books, so I am relatively familiar with the basic concept of Superman and not a complete novice.  Spiderman, both 1 & 2, did a much better job developing characters and moving the plot along.  This one was dead in the water, which is probably where they should have left Superman so as not to kill us with having to endure another flop like this.  <br /> <br />Special effects were great. Other than that, I'll take two & a half hours of Barney with the kids over this movie.
0307237699|5.0|I have to admit prior to reading The Audacity of Hope, I had a negative view of the government and the future for the US. After reading the book, it restored my faith in the government and hope for the future. Barack Obama is a very gifted writer who expresses his views very clearly without unnecessary jargon. He gives an insight into many topics and each chapter covers a different issue, such as Values, Foreign Policy, and Policy. It's a definite read regardless if you're a Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever. He discusses issues that affect everyone.
B00005JNTX|5.0|All I can say is, Wow.  I went into the film knowing that it been a graphic novel but not reading them.  I was amazed at the photography and editing.  The way everything in a shot is black and white except for Clive Owens' red sneakers.  All the little things really do make a difference, in the feel and look of the film.  The acting is great, let me tell you you'll never look at Elijah Wood the same way.  I've now just picked up Frank's book and can really appreciate his artwork in image and storytelling even more than if I hadn't seen the film.
0440237688|5.0|I first read this book when I was about nine, and I thought it interesting. I read it again recently, and I thought it truly inspirational and thought-provoking. It is deep and philosophical, discussing issues over society and the problems with a \\"utopia,\\" the result of a place devoid of true human emotions. I think that this is a wonderful book that will be appreciated by everyone: children, teens, and adults alike. A true classic.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Over ten years ago I made my first cd purchase. It was Loreena McKennitt's \\"Mask and the Mirror\\". I first heard of her on one of the local radio stations and immediately fell in love with Loreena's intoxicating vocals. Sixteen years later, I am still a Loreena Mckennitt fan. After the tragic passing of her fiancee in a boating accident, Loreena took several years to grieve and to collect her thoughts. A decade after \\"Book of Secrets\\", Loreena finally re-emerges with a new album called \\"An Ancient Muse\\".<br /><br />I have to admit \\"An Ancient Muse\\" didn't grab me the first time I listened to the cd. It is certainly not as strikingly beautiful as Loreena's previous albums like \\"The Visit\\", \\"Mask and the Mirror\\", and \\"Book of Secrets\\". Now that I am listening to the cd again, the music is starting to grow on me. Loreena may not be treading on any new territory with her music but I am fine with that. The fact that she has put out a new cd in a decade is good enough for me. I equate it to putting on my favorite pair of flannel pajamas, warm and comforting.<br /><br />I wasn't too terribly impressed with the first two tracks \\"Incantation\\" and \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\". They were pretty average at best. The songs weren't bad just bland. I felt that I had heard them before on Loreena's previous cds. It wasn't until the third track \\"Caravanserai\\" did the music start to get my full attention. Overall I enjoyed \\"An Ancient Muse\\". The music may not be perfect but I'll take it over the garbage that is popular nowdays. I hope it doesn't take a decade to hear new music from Loreena McKennitt.
038541627X|5.0|This is a GREAT collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov, one of the best science-fiction short-story writer ever. It contains over forty of his best works, including Nightfall and the Ugly Little Boy. The book itself is pretty big, with nice-sized font. Overall, a nice, sturdy copy of awesome short-stories. A must for an Isaac Asimov fan.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Listening to Sarah McLachlan's music is the equivalent to drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter night in your favorite pajamas and all snuggled up on the couch with a good book or movie. Sarah's music shares that same comfortable feel. After a few years on a hiatus since \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" (live cds don't count since the most, if not all of the material was previously released), \\"Afterglow\\" was the long awaited follow up to \\"Surface\\". The music picks up where \\"Surface\\" left off. The music is piano based unlike her first two albums which were sparse acoustic albums. Despite the overpolished sound, I still love listening to \\"Afterglow\\". I just love Sarah's gentle vocals and lush piano melodies. The lyrics tend to be a bit on the drippy side which makes for good fodder for sad scenes on soap operas or other tv dramas. Nevertheless Sarah McLachlan's music does resonate with the human spirit. My favorite tracks on the album has to be \\"Time\\" and \\"Perfect Girl\\". The combination of the lyrics and melodies were spot on. It is always nice to take a breather from all the dark, aggressive music and throw in Sarah McLachlan's music into my stereo from time to time.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I bought this on a whim, thinking it would be another Beatle's \\"remix\\" with the tracks digitally enhanced, crisper drumtracks, better EQ, etc., etc. I popped it in while I was cleaning the studio and, surprisingly, had to stop working, sit down between the main speakers and just listen...and stayed there for 78 minutes! The last time an album had that effect on me was Sgt. Pepper. This isn't a performance masterpiece, but it IS a masterpiece...of mixing and interpretation. It restates just how great the genius of these four guys was and how lucky they were to have been exposed to the genius of George Martin. This album is a gift from the Beatles to Mr. Martin, and vice versa...and a great gift from all of them to us. Thanks!
B00005JP9V|4.0|Alfonso Cuaron's \\"Children of Men\\" works like all stories of dystopian societies do: it plunges a future society into chaos and comments on the direction today's society is going in. In the year 2027, governments have collapsed due to a major infertility problem. It seems that, for reasons no one is sure of, women are no longer capable of bearing children, and as a result, panic and fear has gripped the world. The story takes place in London, where a newly formed military government has control over everything. This is especially true when it comes to illegal immigrants, who are rounded up on a daily basis and sent to live in battle stricken refugee camps. Watching this film was a scary experience for me; what we have is a new version of an Orwellian civilization, where a failure to cooperate can lead to harsh penalties. <br /> <br />The film begins with the news reporting the death of the world's youngest person (he was only eighteen). In an age where no new children are being born, such a loss is enough to make total strangers weep. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is quite aware of their grief, yet he can say nothing about it. Many years ago, he was an activist who rejected the government's strict regulations. But ever since the death of his young son, he's lived a humdrum life, monotonously going to work everyday carrying a cup of coffee. Only when he's kidnapped at gunpoint does his life get interesting; he's taken to a secret location and reunited with his estranged ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore). Apparently, she's now part of a terrorist group that demands equality for all immigrants. <br /> <br />She kidnapped Theo because she needs his help. Apparently, a girl from Fiji needs the proper papers in order to safely cross into a restricted area. He can use his influence on his cousin--a high-ranking British minister--to get these papers. He's initially reluctant to be a part of Julian's plans ... until he actually meets the Fijian girl. Her name is Kee (Claire-Hope Ashity), and she has a big secret: she's eight months pregnant. <br /> <br />What follows is a dangerous journey through England, pitting the characters against seemingly insurmountable odds, including raids, deception, gunfire, and death. What makes the situation more difficult is that not everyone in this film as easy to trust as one might think; a number of characters have hidden agendas, not the least of which is preparation for The Uprising, which will supposedly pave the way to a new tomorrow by overthrowing the government. Those affiliated with The Uprising want Kee's baby for themselves, if not for a safe haven, then for a way to show the world that they are capable of starting a new society. It would seem that in this bleak future, money, land, and goods are not humanity's most valuable possession. Babies are. A baby means that there's hope for the future. <br /> <br />In realizing the position Kee is in, and in understanding that danger is consistently surrounding her, Theo decides to help her himself. There are very few he can rely on for help; it seems that the only two trustworthy people are the holistic Miriam (Pam Ferris) and the philosophical stoner Jasper (Michael Caine). Soon word begins to spread about a secret development called The Human Project, which is a way to start a new society. This will be Kee's sanctuary as well as her baby's. It's only a matter of getting them both there before it's too late. <br /> <br />Most of the narrative ideas in this film are not new; if anything, they're derivative of other futuristic Anti Establishment stories, such as \\"1984,\\" \\"Escape from New York,\\" \\"V for Vendetta,\\" and \\"Mad Max.\\" However, there's an underlying optimism that makes this story unique. Even when the bombs explode, the bullets fly, and the blood spills, I couldn't help but feel that Cuaron was working towards a more positive resolution, as if to say that hope is in fact a good thing to have. I even felt that way during a long shot, in which the camera follows Theo as he runs through the rubble of a refugee camp, trying to dodge the barrage of gunfire. A man is murdered in the midst of the fighting, and a few drops of blood hit the camera lens. It was a powerful reminder of humanity's weaknesses, especially since the scene doesn't cut to a new shot. <br /> <br />Dr. Phil occasionally says that the past is gone and the future hasn't happened yet; the only time is now. Films like \\"Children of Men\\" could reinforce such a perspective, considering the future we're presented with is one to avoid at all costs. What good will come from thinking ahead towards a dark, cruel future? I think that's the point the film is trying to make, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. This is a fascinating film, filled with complex issues and difficult situations, all of which come together to form an appropriate ending.
0767802519|5.0|I saw this in 1994 in the original theather release and I whiles I remember it as being a great movie for its time I pretty much forgot all about it until last week when I was out shopping and BEST BUY had the DVD playing on one of their floor model HD Plasma TVs. What I didn't know was there was a directors extended cut for this movie. This extended version was what they were playing in the store and one scene where the little girl puts a gun to her head for a game of russian roulette blew me away. I had to buy it ASAP!<br /><br />I had no idea Natalie Portman was that little girl in The Professional. I only know of her from Star Wars and Garden State. Now I know why she became a star and understand why I loved her in the V for Vendetta movie. She was made for roles like these.<br /><br />Between Portman, Jean & Oldham the acting & chemistry is superb and they all deserve Oscars!<br /><br />ONE NOTE: The original USA release cuts out the important and exciting bits that makes this movie superb. Which is why I forgot about it to begin with because the 1994 USA release is boring and borders on being a Disney themed movie.<br /><br />The Directors Extended Cut is far better to watch. The extra minutes alone are worth the entire weight of the film. It also improves the pacing since the USA version seemed to rush thru scene to scene to get to the climax as quick as possible without dwelling on the weirdness of Mathilda's love for Leon-this version focused on the making the relationship between Leon and Mathilda seem platonic and safe and fun and Disney-like.<br /><br />The director's cut put all that on the backseat and focus on the action and story around Mathilda's training and coming of age as a young hitman. This story version is way better and more interesting to follow than watching the USA Disney version.<br /><br />I'm surprised they have not been any sequels to this movie. A sequel on the Mathilda character as a grown up would be an instant-easy-as-cake-to-do blockbuster that would inevitably spawn countless comic books, graphic novels, sitcoms, websites, action figures, and make Natalie Portman a bigger star than she is.would inevitably spawn countless comic books, graphic novels, sitcoms, websites, action figures, and make Natalie Portman a bigger star than she is.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743289412|1.0|The reviewers who complain about the overuse of cutesy phrases like \\"smuck\\" and the slow pace are right on the money.  Remember the Seinfeld episode where Jerry and his girlfriend keep saying, \\"You're schmoopy\\"?  Well the whole book is like that except King's characters are not joking.  Steven King is not F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemingway, but his stories are imaginative and well paced and his books have always been a lot of fun to read.  This is the same guy who wrote Cujo?  The Shining?  The Dark Tower?  I am half-way through this thing and for the first time I am considering not finishing a Steven King book.
B0002NRRUQ|5.0|This is one of the BEST EVER heard Live cd's. This cd is the best of Metallica like you have never heard them. The only thing I can say is its GREAT!! <br /> <br />Rock On!!
0743289412|5.0|I'm usually not a huge fan of Stephen King. I've read a few of his books and have enjoyed them to an extent, but this book has put King back on my list of must read authors. This is the beautiful story of Lisey Landon, wife of the deceased Scott Landon. The story is told through moving, emotional flashbacks of the intimate lives of Lisey and Scott and also through the bizarre yet beautiful land of Booya Moon, home of many haunting creatures. We also get to know Lisey's sisters and attach to them, particularly Amanda.  <br /> <br />Some people complain of the secret language that Scott and Lisey had which includes the sometimes overuse of \\"smuck\\" and \\"SOWISA\\", but I think they make the story all the more endearing and really allow us to enter the intimate life that they shared.  I'll admit that the language sometimes frustrated me at the beginning, but I was glad it was there when I finished the book. <br /> <br />I'd rank this in the top 3 books I have read this year. Whether you are a  King fan or not, I would recommend this book. In fact, I'd recommend it to anybody!
0553278223|5.0|This wonderfully poetic collection of loosely-connected science fiction shorts is best summed up by a quote on the jacket of a version I own, which reads, \\"Man conquered Mars, and in that instant, Mars conquered him.\\"  Bradbury describes in his 1946 novel man's future exploration and colonization of Mars, from 1999-2026.  The process isn't an easy one, to be sure, for Mars and its residents are all too aware of how Earth's inhabitants have treated their home, and wish to thwart a repeat performance on the red planet.  Bradbury's Martians break tradition from the classic aliens of comic books and B movies, however; they're much more cerebral, in every sense of the word.  Telepathy and illusionism replace lasers and ray-guns, and perhaps their most potent defense is giving the marauding Earthlings enough rope to hang themselves with.<br /><br />Infighting, pollution, censorship, and greed are but a few of means through which Bradbury's space travelers prevent themselves from realizing their missions' goals.  And those who do succeed in beginning life anew on Mars are summoned back to an apocalyptic Earth that needs human capital to wage its wars.  The Martian Chronicles illustrates beautifully but bleakly how the problems faced by a future Earth are inevitable on immaculate Mars, too, should humans gain a foothold there through routine space travel.<br /><br />Bradbury's writing is always excellent, always haunting.  He's descriptive without being wordy.  He addresses pain and longing in a poignant and beautiful way, illustrated in Chronicles in a couple of memorable chapters featuring characters who mistakenly think they've been reunited with lost loved ones on Mars.  The Martian landscape is populated by all sorts of ghosts, and it's a pleasure to read about them courtesy of Ray Bradbury.

B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Upon first listen to disc one, I didn't notice much difference between  the remastered recording and the original [[ASIN:B000001FKY Hysteria]] album -- until, that is, I played my old \\"Hysteria\\" CD. After interchanging the discs a few times in one sitting, it's apparent the remastered CD is louder, clearer and an even better listening experience.<br /><br />The four B-sides on disc one can all be found on Leppard's 1993 offering, [[ASIN:B000001E21 Retro Active]], though the versions on the \\"Hysteria\\" remastered disc are a bit rawer and edgier. \\"Tear It Down\\" (1987) certainly sounds more organic and better here than it did on [[ASIN:B000001DV2 Adrenalize]], probably due to the more organic-sounding vocals during the chorus section. \\"Ride Into the Sun\\" (1987), \\"I Wanna Be Your Hero\\" (1987) and \\"Ring of Fire\\" (1988) were each re-recorded in the early '90s for \\"Retro Active,\\" and those versions might actually be better than what they did in the late '80s; but overall, there's not much difference in sound. The B-side tunes that end disc one are nostalgic and sound good, but disc two is where the real fun begins for Def Leppard fans.<br /><br />\\"Elected,\\" a great old Alice Cooper song played live by Leppard in 1987 in Tilburg, Holland, before an enthusiastic, fist-pumping crowd, starts disc two off with a punchy, classic-rock beginning. Joe Elliot's robust voice sounds great in front of a live audience, as do the guitars and drums. It should be noted that following that unforgettable beginning to the disc, \\"Love and Affection\\" and \\"Billy's Got a Gun\\" were excellent choices to include as live tracks. Both are terrific songs that haven't been a part of Leppard's live arsenal in many years, unfortunately.  Contrary to the wild crowd response for \\"Elected,\\" the reaction to Elliott's introduction before these songs is nearly indifferent; it sounds as if they're playing in some small, smoky bar. Played live, \\"Love and Affection\\" is much rawer-sounding than what you hear on record, but the song doesn't suffer much from it. The only portion of the song that's not as clearly defined is the bold opening riff, which I love to play over and over. \\"Billy's Got a Gun\\" sounds just as foreboding live as it did on [[ASIN:B000001F2V Pyromania]], and you can hear the band hitting its stride as the song shuffles along, especially as the background vocals begin to creep in with more authority. Elliott's voice in these songs is especially right on target, with his giant rasp practically enveloping the room. Back then, before smoking and drinking got the best of his pipes, he could really hit all the high notes.<br /><br />\\"Rock of Ages,\\" also played live in Holland in 1987, is the band at its finest. The medley of classic songs in the middle, right after the guitar solo, captures a cocky band that couldn't be touched on stage. It's unfortunate that Leppard didn't play the same medley live during their giant \\"Hysteria\\" tour, but then again, the 15-minute portion of \\"Rock of Ages\\" where Elliott attempted to get the arena crowds into a frenzy was also a priceless maneuver that worked.<br /><br />The real treat of this two-disc set is the revamped versions of \\"Animal, \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me,\\" \\"Armageddon It,\\" \\"Excitable\\" and \\"Rocket.\\" It's shocking and unfortunate that these remixes were done back in 1987 and 1988 as A- and B-side singles on record, and thus, were not as widely distributed. When I first listened to each of these remixes, I was certain they were only recently recorded, mainly because they sounded so sophisticated and hip, as if they were designed for modern-day dance clubs.<br /><br />You have to hear these remixes to believe them. \\"Animal,\\" for instance, thrives on entirely deleted vocals for a soothing effect in the beginning. In each remix, portions of the music are either emphasized or de-emphasized to perhaps show off the massive layering and production work that went into the \\"Hysteria\\" recording by Mutt Lange. As another example, the \\"Armageddon It\\" remix is centered around the sugary \\"Gimme all of your lovin'\\" chorus. Sometimes the chorus is there with less guitars, one time it's non-existent, and finally, at the end, it's played how it was ultimately recorded on \\"Hysteria,\\" leading to a great culmination of mixed-up sounds.<br /><br />\\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" is cut and pasted to the point that it's an entirely new song. Not long after the memorable and exciting \\"Hit me like a bomb\\" intro (heard incessantly on MTV way back when), the giant chorus of \\"Pour Some Sugar\\" kicks in way early, a welcome occurence given the song's overplayed predictability.<br /><br />Bass guitar by itself, chiming guitars alone amid a sea of heavy drums, reverb, space-age voices and sounds - everyone's heard these songs before (love 'em or hate 'em), but no one's heard them like this. \\"Excitable\\" is as exciting as ever, especially when the metronome drums and mesmerizing guitar chimes in midway through. It's as if Lange picked out the best, most important musical parts of each song and then sliced, diced, extended and rolled them every astute way he saw fit. The \\"lunar mix\\" of \\"Rocket\\" is nearly tame compared to the already experimental version heard on \\"Hysteria.\\" Right on cue, it's over eight minutes long and contains all the bells and whistles you'd expect.<br /><br />All in all, the regimented, sometimes robotic but always tuneful songs on \\"Hysteria\\" were tailor-made for this kind of experimentation. It's a shame more people haven't heard these unique remixes. Actually, the real crime is that \\"Hysteria's\\" seven other classic songs didn't get the remix treatment.around the sugary \\"Gimme all of your lovin'\\" chorus.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I got this CD for Christmas. I've been a Beatles fanatic since I first heard them as a teen in 1963. I thought I'd heard all the Beatles songs as I have every album, CD and all the DVD's. But this album brings back so many memories, and the crispness of the soundtrack and what George Martin and his son did, is just absolutely incredible. I love this CD. It evokes memories of the first time I heard Sgt. Pepper's as friends and I around 1967 purchased Sgt. Pepper, smoked some dope and listened to the album over and over. This new CD gives me that kind of feeling to where I just want to hear it over and over and over again. I cannot wait to download it to my IPOD so I can hear it through a great pair of headphones. Anyone who loves the Beatles will just love this CD and I highly recommend it's purchase.

Good guitar playing, solid songs, and diverse. The more you listen, the more you get to like it. <br /> <br />Best cuts are Danger, Heads In Georgia, and Ride the River.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|When I heard that this movie came out, I bought the dvd as I had read the book and was interested in seeing how it would translate to the screen. But it turned out to be a big disappointment,often, they would have face shots of the actors and actresses looking dreamily into the camera or at each other for several seconds at a time. It got nauseating after a while. Some of the scenes could have used a bit of explanation and seemed rushed, some scenes just seemed stupid. For instance, in the scene where John was trying to talk to some girl and she started acting like she was psychotic or something, it was later explained that it wasn't what he said, it was what he did - he (unknowingly) was trying to steal her energy.Without getting into an argument about whether or not that's possible, why didn't she just explain to him that he was making her uncomfortable? By portraying a supposedly spiritually advanced character as being nearly schizophrenic, it really turns everyone else off from ever wanting to advance spiritually. Another example is where a couple people are staring at a plant like they're retarded or something and it's explained that they are giving their attention to the plant. I would say they were, but there was never any explaination why or what they hoped to achieve you just had the idea that they were maybe slow or something. It seemed as though their idea of heaven is to just sit there and do nothing in a primitive setting. I for one appreciate the advances of technology even if it does push the limit at times and I would never consider having to live a primitive existence without indoor plumbing, etc. as being any kind of Utopia. I feel that the material, technological, and spiritual can co- exist happily together and it is rather insulting for a film maker to imply that people in third world countries wrote the book on the one and only way to be spiritual, while the rest of the world is ignorant and evil. It did seem preachy at times. One last thing iswhere John was told to put his two first fingers together and stare at them for a while to see his energy. This is not new, my friends and I used to do it back in the '70s but here was John acting like it was some great and amazing advancement in spirituality. I won't say don't watch the movie at all, but I will say that you may want to rent it first. I enjoyed the book as far as that goes but the movie, forget it.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I've been a fan of Steven Seagal's since Above the Law came out in the late 80's.  I've enjoyed most of his American made films right up to Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds.  When Seagal severed his relationship with long-time production partner, Jules Nasso, and then Warner Brothers ended its relationship with our martial arts hero, the quality of Seagal's movies went downhill rather quickly as did his salary.  He dropped from making sixteen million a movie to a little over two million a picture.  In other words, to keep up his high standards of living, he now has to do four-to-five movies a year just to equal what he used to make on one Warner Brothers' picture.  Part of this is due to the increase in age (he's now 55) and weight (at least eighty-to-a-hundred pounds overweight for his height of 6' 4\\") and his inability to do the fighting scenes that made him famous almost twenty years ago.  Add all of the above to bad directing, terrible scripts, and poor photography, and you have an actor who's barely hanging on to his career.  I have to also say that Seagal isn't the only actor who's had to resort to making films almost entirely in Europe.  Wesley Snipes has found himself in the same boat (though he could be avoiding the IRS) and so has Sylvester Stallone (Sly, however, is making a comeback with Rocky Balboa and a fourth \\"Rambo\\" film due out this summer).  And, like many of the other people who've reviewed Attack Force, I, too, keep hoping for a really good \\"Seagal\\" film that will display his talents as they used to be in his earlier movies.  Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewers, I didn't just buy Attack Force, I also purchased Today You Die at the same time.  I should've read the reviews first, but I didn't, and now I'm stuck with two clunkers.  Stupid me!!!<br /><br />Attack Force has Steven Seagal playing Marshall Lawson, the commander of a strike-force team, somewhat like Delta Force.  At the beginning of the movie, Lawson's team is almost completely wiped out at a night meeting.  Then, a little later, three of his remaining soldiers are murdered in their hotel room by a psycho bitch high on a new type of drug that has turned her into a killing machine with abnormal strength and reflexes, not to mention a strange pupil dilation that causes her eyes to look like those of a werewolf.  Now, as it turns out, this new drug is being developed by the United States to create a superior fighting soldier.  Because of Lawson's involvement due to the death of his men, certain members of the government decide to have him eliminated so that the cat isn't let out of the bag, but it's now too late.  More people have been infected with the drug than first realized and the government has to put them down before a mass epidemic of murder starts taking place in the French countryside.  Lawson is the only man who can do it, so he's chosen to lead a new strike force.  I think this kind of sums up the plot.  I'm not entirely sure because I was somewhat confused throughout the movie.  I didn't always know who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.  Example: Was the French detective a good or bad guy?  I don't know.  I suspect that this was a plot device designed to keep the viewer on his toes so that he wouldn't fall asleep due to movie-induced boredom.  .<br /><br />I'm now trying to think of something good to say about the movie, but nothing comes to mind except that the women in the film looked beautiful and deadly.  Steven Seagal likes to surround himself with beautiful women in his movies, and I don't blame him.  After all, he was one of the producers on this film.  I wonder if he pulled another \\"Jenny McCarthy\\" with them and made each potential female star take off her blouse so that he could check out her talent as an actress.  Oh, here's the big standout about the movie.  Mr. Seagal's voice was dubbed over dozens of times during the film.  Like one of the other critics, I originally thought something was wrong with my DVD and checked the \\"Language\\" section on the menu.  Nothing wrong there.  The only thing I can think of is that after the movie was completed, the director discovered that Seagal's voice didn't come through in every scene and so it had to be dubbed in certain places.  Also, because the drug-induced villains moved so fast and looked so strange, I thought at first that maybe Attack Force was a horror movie.  I mean a French undercover cop would be faced with a killer-crazed woman with weird eyes.  He'd turn around to run away and then she'd be standing in that direction, waiting for him.  I don't know of any drug that can make a person move with the speed of light.  Not only could these people move fast, but they also had super human strength.  They could knock a person through three walls instead of just one.  That's one hard punch.  Even Bruce Lee couldn't do that!  I guess the victims had super human strength, too, because they'd get right back up and try to defend themselves against these killing machines.  If I got knocked through three walls, I'd still be lying there unconscious, or else I'd play like I was unconscious so I wouldn't get killed.  The movie was filmed almost entirely at night, which made the action extremely hard to follow.  Maybe that was for the best.  Steven Seagal does very little fighting in the movie till the very end and then it's against a beautiful babe in leather shorts.  I wish I could make a living doing that!  By the way, at the end when the new strike force goes after these voracious killers, each member is picked off one by one just like in the usual \\"teen-murder\\" flicks.  Rather than sticking close together, the strike force makes the mistake of letting each other out of sight for a few moments, thereby enabling the enemy to kill them.  The only one who acts with any common sense is Seagal's sidekick, Na-boo, who stays glued to him like a new wife, while keeping a sharp eye out for anyone trying to sneak up behind them.  That was kind of funny to watch.  I guess this is the best that we can now expect from Steven Seagal.  He'll be sixty in a few years and doing wine commercials like the late Orson Wells.  I certainly don't anticipate his future movies getting any better.  I feel like everyone else in that I should've rented this film, instead of buying the damn thing.  Of course, I bought two clunkers, instead of one, so I've really learned my lesson this time around.  I'm now marking Steven Seagal (7th Degree Black Belt in Aikido, guitar player, director, producer, writer, former Tibetan monk in a previous lifetime, former husband of Kelly Le Brock, former C.I.A. operative, and who knows what else) off of my to-buy list.

0688156819|5.0|As the titled explains, i am a huge Tim Burton fan. It was a delight to receive this book in just four days. I admire his creativity and his twisted imagination. This book makes a nice addition to my collection. I look forward to reading more books by Tim Burton in the near future.
0670034711|1.0|WHAT??? This author is incredibly selfish and I hate to sound mean, but she's pretty unevolved. She chose to leave her husband to travel the world (like college kids choose do to, dump their boyfriends to travel to Mexico for Spring Break. Why didn't she think ahead, think of her needs and wants and future desires BEFORE she got married. Silly girl) and then writes a very, very long book trying to get people to buy her book, to feel sorry for her (because she kept describing how upset her husband was and how \\"nasty\\" her divorce was. This was entirely her own doing, how could I possibly feel sorry for her??) and then find balance in our lives. This book is slated as a book to show people a \\"happier, better\\" way to live, by travelling. I'm ALL for travelling, believe me, but the author was paid to travel for the year by Penguin Books, her publisher. Gilbert wants us to travel the world to find peace and balance in our lives but who can do that? She was able to do so because her publisher paid for everything...She seemed very unevolved because she admitted that her depression came from the way she behaved in relationships and how men took advantage of her generosity, but, instead of learning from her mistakes in the way she treated men each and every chance she had, she went down the same path each time of pampering them like a mother would. She never learned her lesson but then makes a lot of money to write about it in her book, wanting us to feel sorry for her. Impossible to do so when her only problem in life is men and never learning from her mistakes. Honestly. Give me REAL problems do deal with and then I can have sympathy for her. I also swear she made up the whole \\"Richard from Texas\\" sections, what kind of nickname is \\"Groceries??\\" Please, it all sounded so highly contrived and fake. I cannot say enough about how self-centered, selfish and unevolved this woman is, so writing a book telling the readers a great way to find balance and love in this world is justsuch a slap in the face to us. Let me help you ou by summarizing this book: eat good food and not care about the calories. If you need help in life and are confused, meditate and pray. Love people in the correct way, not in the overly-generous way. There, that's the whole book. Save your money and buy a real book from a person with real troubles and real insight into life. She needs to become much more evolved in life and start thinking about real problems besides how she should act in relationships so she won't get depressed and NOT write books making us waste our hard-earned money on such trash. Get a real life Gilbert!!  <br /> <br />PS-I was tortured by listening to the unabridged audiobook. This Gilbert woman read the book aloud and read the conversations she had with the non-Americans in very non-American accents. It seemed extremely patronizing to me. She read their sentences in their broken English instead of correcting their grammar. I'm all for authenticity but the way I heard the words come out of her mouth seemed highly patronizing of these people. She's lucky enough to have found people in Italy, India and Bali to speak English with her but instead of making these highly intelligent people sound intelligent, she portrayed them as imperfect English speakers. She was almost mocking them. I couldn't believe the audacity of Gilbert to characterize her so-called best international friends by making them sound like bad English speakers. It almost sounded as if she did this in order to make herself sound smarter than they. Uggghhh.  <br /> <br />PSS - She spoke about how she stopped taking her anti-depressants in Italy-cold turkey. From what I know this is a highly dangerous practice. Weening off of anti-depressants should be supervised by a doctor and controlled by the doctor, not just stopped as Gilbert did. She made it sound like she gave up chewing her sugary gum or something. If you are in this position, DO NOT do what Gilbert did. I can't believe she didn't offer advisory warnings in her book to her readers. I hope nobody just stopped taking their tablets just as she did. Very wreckless and irresponsible of her.  <br /> <br />OK, forgive me for rambling. It's New Year's Day and difficult for me to collect my thoughts. I just can't wait to sell my copy and salvage at least some of my wasted money! LOL!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I found the story once you got into it quite absorbing. The acting okay. Its a shame that it finished so early. <br />
B000068IEU|1.0|I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why: <br /> <br />-The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it. <br /> <br />-The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them. <br /> <br />-The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made. <br /> <br />-The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness. <br /> <br />The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|I saw this film when it originally came out and it had to have been the worst horror film that I had seen in years. <br /> <br />Basically all it is is a soft core porn film with some gore thrown in. The screenplay is so weak that they had to show nudity constantly. No amount of nudity, or gore for that matter, is going to save a horror film if the screenplay is badly written. I think the only people who really like this film are underaged males who want to see naked women. <br /> <br />Besides that the characters are totally unlikeable. Maybe that was the point, but in order for a horror film to work the protaginists have to be somewhat sympathetic. This is a fact of basic story telling. Somebody should have told the people who made this film that, because it doesn't seem like they were paying attention in film school. <br /> <br />It's films like this that are making American horror films really bad. It does good at the box office so movie studios make others like them. The only good horror films coming out these days are from other countries, because they seem to understand that nudity and gore alone don't make a good horror film.  <br /> <br />If you like a good screenplay do not watch this film. <br /> <br />
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Watching this movie for the umpteenth time and yet it still remains timeless.  It's hard to believe this movie is approaching twenty years.

I have watched numerous Christmas movies and still find myself coming back to this one year after year.
B000002MY3|5.0|Ten years ago, as 1996 was coming to a close, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill had become the best-selling album of the year, spending 10 of the 12 months of 1996 in Billboard's Top 5 with 10 weeks spent at #1(not to mention first going to #1 in October of 1995 as the album started it's massive selling streak in July of that year)and having created what became the quintessential soundtrack to life. I think the primary reason Jagged Little Pill drew such a large appeal was because every human emotion was explored on the album. Sure, Morissette shows her anger in the now-classic anthem, \\"You Oughta Know,\\" in which she belts a penetrating attack on the man who dumped her for another woman. But the album's second single, \\"Hand in my Pocket,\\" showed a softer Alanis in tune with a cosmic vibe as she sang, \\"What it all comes down to my friends, is that everything is just fine, fine, fine.\\" Morissette's openness to be herself became us ten and eleven years ago, and still applies even to this day. Listeners understood both the fears and inspirations and the need to seek peace and comfort in the opening track, \\"All I Really Want,\\" the acceptance of difficulties in life from \\"You Learn,\\" the bitterness in \\"Right Through You,\\" the questioning of religion in \\"Forgiven,\\" the strive to be impressive in \\"Perfect,\\" the bliss of falling in love with \\"Head Over Feet,\\" the logic of consequential outcomes in \\"Ironic,\\" the freedom from not being the enabler in \\"Not the Doctor,\\" and so on and so forth. Morissette and producer Glen Ballard gave the world a timeless gem as they made music history. Looking ahead to five years from now, and then ten, fifteen, twenty, Jagged Little Pill will always make first timers feel cathartic again, while inspiring new generations to rebel as they wallow in self-analysis.
1400079276|3.0|Kafka on the Shore may be one of the best places to start reading Murakami's works, and is even a good work to include in a sample of modern Japanese literature. The story has an unusual set of elements to it, including fantasy, dreams, and spirituality, coupled to familiar literary devices, such as parallel and intersecting plot lines and journeys. They're used effectively most of the time, and the writing creates a decent tapestry.<br /><br />Almost immediately you're sucked into the story, and if you let yourself trust the author's premise for a few pages, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic tale. At times he seems to throw in a twist to save a stale point, but that's forgivable. The ending (which I wont give away) was a bit of a let down, although I can't say I'm surprised. I think it would have been impossible to end with the strength the book builds up from time to time.<br /><br />I found this to be a fast read, having read it over two nights of my vacation. Again, trust the author (and buy the setup), and you'll find yourself enjoying an engaging story.

B000JLTRKE|4.0|I overcame my own intentions NOT to watch this film.  We lived this tragedy such a short while ago in all the terror, reality, horror, and stunned sorrow, it seems we are imposing fiction on reality and watching watered-down films of the tragic realities, I thought perhaps to make the feelings less painful.<br /><br />I decided to watch this film and 'United 93' because I think the victims they portray and their families deserve our respect and honor.  In both instances, the families gave their blessing, even their urging, for the films to be made.<br /><br />Now I find that reading these reviews is even more painful than watching the films.<br /><br />That we, the American people, could characterize the words of men in imminent danger of dying under tons of rubble due to circumstances faced while serving their fellowman as 'idle chit chat' makes me gasp at our heartlessness and our crass insensitivity to the real heroes and their families.<br /><br />A reviewer decrying the lack of a 'goosebump factor' in a film portraying one infinitesimal personal portion of an event that changed individual's lives and the lives of Americans as a population to an amazingly huge degree, makes me wonder about the psyche of our humanity and the lack of understanding about and compassion for the pain of our fellow citizens.<br /><br />That 'no-action' could be a phrase used when describing 'pretty-close-to-reality' depictions of personal sacrifice and tragedy as two men face death buried beneath the ruins of two of American's largest buildings caused me to question the lack of empathy we feel for those around us.<br /><br />Lastly, I question how anyone who lived through the events of 09-11 aired into our homes and burned into our psyche in such tragic minute detail that millions who didn't personally know even one individual involved in this horrific event have had their lives changed forever, could feel 'boredom' while glimpsing such intimate details of two heroic survivors.<br /><br />There may have been more in the following reviews that I could have been saddened by, but my surprise and revulsion in reading just the few I did read caused me to have to stop and take a deep breath and bow my head in shame for so many of the inhabitants of this great nation.<br /><br />While my reason for finally watching this film may be difficult for some to understand, it cannot possibly be as hard to accept or rationalize as patrons who watched it for 'action', 'goose bumps', 'deep conversations', or to relieve 'boredom' when we all know the tragic details of the true circumstances being depicted.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I am a new fan of 30 seconds to Mars and i was quite impressed. I must admit even though i love Jared Leto when i heard he was the lead singer of the band I kinda had my doubts. Let's face it actors turned singers just typically dont work out. However, I really like their sound. I think they are a little bit different than anything else I've heard. They have a unique song that I love. Plus their music videos tell a story and I absolutely love that. Give the song more meaning. So I am very impressed with 30 Seconds to Mars and like every song I've heard so far. I dont think all their songs sound alike. There may be a couple of similiarities hear and there but you really have that with any band. Especially if they write their own songs.  <br /> <br />In short I would definitely buy the album. The second is better than the first in my opinion.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Upon first listen I was a little disappointed with this CD. Musically it doesn't seem up to her previous efforts and I would guess she has new supporting artists and reuses some themes from her previous works.  The lyrics also didn't hold me on first listen either. <br /> <br />Slowly I let go of my preconceptions and started listening to the music for what it is .... and I liked what I heard.  Very positive and beautiful and quite different from her previous style of lyric writing. <br /> <br />Not every track is outstanding but most are ... Highly recommended
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens to get away from the mostly useless Rebel XT kit lens. I didn't want to drop $1,000+ but at the same time I wanted decent performance. Well, I got it. <br /> <br />This lens takes gorgeous pictures with just a hint of softness at 135mm (stopping down a bit helps there) and virtually no barrel distorsion at 28mm. The f/3.5 limit is a bit annoying for low-light situations, but I don't expect f/2.8 at this price range and just use a flash when I have to. Color saturation is excellent and I haven't been able to see any chromatic aberrations at all. <br /> <br />Of course, the IS is fantastic, and I find that I can't live without it anymore. I fear I'm going to have to upgrade to an all-IS setup soon. Being able to shoot pictures at lower shutter speeds without a tripod opens up a whole new area for most amateur photographers like me. <br /> <br />The build is very professional and it just feels good. It's a large lens (diameter and length) if you're used to the 52 or 58mm glass. It looks very good on a Rebel XT and 30D. On the other hand you might find buying 72mm filters a bit more expensive. <br /> <br />Finally, auto focus is as good as most other Canon lenses - I don't use AF very much but I'm constantly surprised at the ability of this lens to focus in very low light or non-standard backgrounds. Very nice. <br /> <br />Many other lenses are recommended as an upgrade to the Canon kit glass - this is just a bit more spot on than most. The price is right and the performance cannot be beat.
0618680004|4.0|'The God Hypothesis is a scientific hypothesis about the universe...' Thus on page 2 of his book Dawkins says something already that surely he can't mean. Even some courts in the U.S., land of the feared American Taliban (see pg. 288 of Dawkins' book), have decided that creationism and intelligent design are not science. Why should Dawkins then concede what the Taliban are so eager to establish? If the Taliban, the Omars and the Teds, get us to admit that God is scientific, they will then have us teach Him along with Darwin in the schools of the West. What Dawkins means is that the idea of a creator of the universe must be approached sceptically and with all tools of analysis. But that hardly makes God a scientific idea. What are the testable equations, the observable facts? Dawkins suggests analysis of Christ's DNA and other impossible stuff. Irreducible complexity, a clever attempt by some life scientists to prove creation, is given short shrift, and is in fact indemonstrable in biology. (See my review of Michael Behe's dreadful Darwin's Black Box on the Amazon website.) Come on, Gould is right on this one, science and religion don't overlap. (See pgs. 59-60). <br /> <br />The constant Bush and Blair bashing for the involvement in Iraq grates on the nerves. Doesn't Dawkins understand that Islamic jihadists, backed primarily by Iran, have declared war on the West? Hasn't he read Melanie Phillips' Londonistan? Is he aware of the Pakistan-British airways connection in his own country? You wouldn't think so, when after exposing Israeli prejudice against Palestinians, he then remarks that maybe, just maybe, Palestinian kids are equally biased against Israelis. See pg. 257. Gee, professor, you think maybe it's the martyrdom cartoons those kids watch?  <br /> <br />Dawkins is simply unable to come to terms with the notion of radical Islam as a malevolent political and cultural force. He seems well aware of such force in American Christianity, poking fun of us colonists for having a Mormon as a possible presidential candidate. But with regard to Islam, well, that's just a religion. It's false, of course, as all religions are, but in Dawkins' world the Afghan Taliban are hardly any different from what he terms the American Taliban (all those millions of Evangelists that someday will rule us). I guess when he last visited the U.S. and A (as Borat would say) he had his hand cut off for stealing, or his eardrum pierced for listening to music. Is he serious? He should conclude that Christianity is superior to Islam, in that it fosters sciences and rationalism and freedom, and is not the possible precursor to a dark age that Islam is. There is some belated recognition of this in the form of a parable about a burka, pg. 362, but it's too little too late in the book.   <br /> <br />There's a whole chapter devoted to Dawkins' tedious notion of memes. Enough of memes already. Just as annoying, Dawkins continually lauds philosopher and fellow atheist Dan Dennett, perhaps because Dennett has made much use in his incomprehensible writings of the meme notion, such as it is. And if you don't think Dennett is incomprehensible, read his Consciousness Explained and then explain consciousness.  <br /> <br />A Brit, Dawkins thinks that A A Milne, P G Wodehouse and Douglas Adams are humorous writers. They are not (although for the sake of argument I except the Wodehouse golf stories). They are tedious in the extreme. They are as tedious as memes.        <br /> <br />A denier of multiculturalism and diversity-for-the-sake-of-diversity, Dawkins can think of no justification for we of the West to prefer libertarian democracies to theocracies and primitive tribes except that we are, well, more technically advanced and have more stuff. Thus the Amish are wrong because they don't want or have all the perks and stuff that we moderns do, and their kids suffer perhaps as much as once did unfortunate Inca kids who were tossed into volcanoes. Pg. 331. It does occur to Dawkins that some adults might choose to live their lives without all the trapping of modern Western culture, so he bases his argument on the sufferings of kids. It's not terribly convincing.           <br /> <br />Biggest weakness: No proper response to Mark Steyn's book America Alone, or Osama's Strong Horse argument. Steyn makes the case, with the appropriate demographics, that in the next few decades, only Muslims and Christian fundamentalists will reproduce in such numbers as to ensure the survival of their kind. In short, much of Europe, Asia including Russia and Japan, and Canada will have majority Muslim populations within the next half century. And why? Because their secularist native populations have been too despondent and distracted to reproduce, directly contradicting Dawkins' naive statement (Pg. 362) that the `power of science' will `satisfy the psyche.' Secularists just don't put a premium on childbearing.     <br /> <br />Finally, where is Dawkins' scathing reply to fellow Brit writer and historian Paul Johnson, a conservative Catholic, who recently quipped that Dawkins occupies Oxford University's first Chair of Atheism?   <br />
B00004XPPK|4.0|Rita Hayworth was a screen heroine of breathtaking beauty and vibrating sensation who lived a luxurious world in which her own expensive form of life was backgrounded by exotic tropical surroundings and international intrigue...<br /><br />Whether she appears on stage performing a different kind of hit record or pretending to hate her former lover as much as she loves him, Rita was uninhibitedly erotic, making more persistent men's suspicions that girls with long hair and nice figures had a turbulent nature to equal...<br /><br />Rita never said she could act, but then she rarely had to... Her movies--of which \\"Gilda\\" is perhaps the most famous--were little more than showcases for her ample charms, but the largely male audiences that cheered Rita's every picture didn't seem to mind... She was more than a favorite pinup; she was the much-married, scandal-ridden reincarnation of the movie queens of a bygone era...<br /><br />Hayworth--in complete control of Vidor's camera and of her audience-- performed dynamic moves while trying to look, and feel, too sexy... In that night, she slowly begins to peel off her long black gloves in a symbolic striptease, while rendering her suggestively sexy song \\"Put the Blame On Mame,\\" to the public, electrifying subsequently Glenn Ford, and millions of hot-blooded men around the world...<br /><br />Rita captured everything about Gilda's character... She's beautiful, she's malicious, she's suggestive, she's annoying, she's greedy, she's vengeful, and she's awfully superstitious...<br /><br />Gilda made it sound--There is a heat that one can feel and its intensity is pretty high...The movie shifts into a tremendous struggle between temptation and loyalty, jealousy and envy, suspicion and mistrust, love and desire...<br /><br />\\"Gilda\\" reunited Rita with Glenn Ford in a magical moment which had everyone wonder that haunting harmony that reflects their forbidden passion... Their chemistry was real enough, making this sensational melodrama a box-office bonanza...ional melodrama a box-office bonanza...  <br /> <br />
6305428220|4.0|Scream-play scribe Kevin Williamson's formulaic yet satisfying suspense thriller, \\"The Faculty\\" borrows from a buffet of tried and true storylines: Williamson fills his plate with plots from \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" tasty twists from his own \\"Scream\\" series, and still leaves room for heaping helpings of \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" to boot.<br /><br />Indeed, Williamson was no doubt the John Hughes of the 90's, his finger firmly on the (sometimes slashed) pulse of teenaged America.  Recognizing a can't miss recipe when he sees one - in this case the old \\"take a teen from each disillusioned demographic then unite them in a common cause\\" trick - and adding a sci-fi spin to his already patented brand of knowingly ironic self-reference, Williamson cooks up a stylistic stew with something for everyone, even though some flavors could have used a bit more seasoning.<br /><br />Elijah Wood leads the aforementioned ragtag bunch of scholastic standbys (you know 'em, you love 'em:  the jock, the cheerleader, the geek, the Ally Sheedy outsider, the genius underachiever, the new girl, etc.) in a somewhat queasy quest to save their Ohio high school from an alien takeover.<br /><br />Williamson's wink wink self-aware gimmicks work well in this setting, for he can once again mask his thematic thievery by having his own characters discuss his crimes: \\"Well how bad can stealing be if I'm admitting it?\\" asks the new Zeitgeist of Teen Angst. And so the somewhat-Sheedy outsider is a huge science fiction fan, thus she speaks eloquently of Heinlein's \\"The Puppet Masters\\" and the original \\"Body Snatchers\\" stories, saving us the trouble of calling Kevin on his references.  Neat!<br /><br />And cliched lines can't be spoken without acknowledging their triteness first.  But today's trick question is - if every new sardonic screenplay calls itself out on every cliche, then doesn't that just replace the old cliches with new ones?  Of course, some lines work on and of their own merits - as when one of the teens accuses Wood of impersonating the hero(ine) from another popular series of alien films.<br /><br />But I digress.  The real reason that all of this works so well is the person who's stirring the stolen stew - in this case erstwhile indie maestro Robert Rodriguez, of \\"El Mariachi\\" and \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" fame - adds enough spice with his deft direction as to make this picture quite palatable indeed.  It's the little moments that most directors ignore or treat as filler that Rodriguez has fun with - especially in his slo-mo depictions of disjointedness.  Watch as the librarian spookily brandishes a \\"QUIET PLEASE\\" sign as two of the teen rebellion talk strategy;  laugh as you catch a glimpse of eager-beaver students in a classroom with hands raised, signalling certain disturbances in the force.<br /><br />The gore is fun and \\"Blade\\"-like, with foamy death sequences that leaves seemingly  carbonated corpses - another cola tie in, perhaps? - and fairly decent computerized and animatronic effects of dismembered body parts seeking to reconnect.  And, as in the original body snatcher movies, Rodriguez does a great job conveying the palpable paranoia of not knowing whether your best friends and confidantes are still on your side.<br /><br />Of course, that's where this entire movie works best, on the level of saccharine allegory - because, not only as teenagers but in at later stages of life, haven't we all worried about and experienced the hurt of allies switching sides and friends defecting to join our detractors?  Well, this movie treats those back-stabbers with a healthy dose of eye-gouging in return, which can be quite therapeutic. What teen won't thrill at the sight of student stabbing teacher at face value?  And, in the end, haven't we ever stopped to consider that the word \\"alien\\" can also mean \\"outsider\\"?  So, in a way, aren't we all just aliens trying to get by?  Awwww - time for a group hug!its - as when one of the teens accuses Wood of impersonating the hero(ine) from another popular series of alien films. <br /> <br />But I digress.

0800141601|3.0|In 'First Knight' Connery has gentleness in his eyes, and embodies the best aims of the founder of the Knights of the Round Table... Arthur had his share of war... He had devoted his life to building a land of peace and justice... He looks forward to quieter days... He asks Guinevere to 'marry the king but to love the man.'<br /><br />Julia Ormond glows and smolders to fine effect as the passionate Guinevere who is confused about her feelings for the king and his first knight... Guinevere tries to convince Arthur that her will is stronger than her heart... She assures the king that she may look at him differently but not with less love...<br /><br />Richard Gere lacks the heroic stance required for such part... He is not colorful and flamboyant as Lancelot... He is simply Richard Gere... He lives by the sword, and fights for money... He is introduced as a wanderer, with no wealth, no home, no goals, just the passionate spirit that drives him on... Lancelot had never dreamed of peace or justice or knighthood... He rescues the Lady of Leonesse, and gives Arthur back his life itself...<br /><br />Ben Cross is arrogant as the powerful Prince Malagant, a former knight of the Round Table, with hatred in his heart... He dares to kidnap a lady who is almost a queen... Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses so long as he wins... He offers the king what is not 'his' to give..<br /><br />In Jerry Zucker's film there's no Merlin, no malevolent Mordred, no femme fatale, just the city of Camelot seen golden as ever, the knights brave and loyal, the battles almost breathtaking in their ferocity, and the scenic beauty so fresh, so pure, so green...
B0000069NC|4.0|Bill Evans plays with some real firepower on this CD, then lays back into some sweet ballads.  The quick, aggressive playing of Eddie Gomez and playful, dancing drums of Jack DeJohnette sit nicely with the upbeat numbers.  Bill gets to take some ballads by himself as well.  This is really some good stuff from monster performers.  It left me wanting more - unlike some of my other Bill Evans re-mastered CD's, there are no bonus cuts on this one.<br /><br />Numerous good points aside, it did surprise me that this album earned a Grammy from the Recording Academy.  Listening to this CD as a recording enthusiast was frustrating to me.  In the full band numbers, the most prominent sounds were the clicking of the bass and the stick hitting the ride cymbal.  The tone of the piano and bass were kind of buried in the background.  The state of the art in live jazz recordings was well beyond this point (listen to some of the live recordings of Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington on Ultimate 16:Jazz Cafe ASIN: B000BF0E00), so the sound quality falls short of my expectations.  Also, as wonderful a bass player as Eddie Gomez is, I don't enjoy a lot of long bass solos, especially when they are difficult to hear.  Finally, repeated listening suggests some rhythmic tugs-of-war between Evans and DeJohnette - neither one plays \\"wrong\\", but their \\"beat placements\\" (front of the beat, back of the beat) seem to diverge a lot.<br /><br />These points aside, this CD is a fine effort by Bill Evans and his band that gives a better perspective on his broad range of expression than his more subdued works.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been... It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like \\"Quo Vadis,\\" \\"Ben-Hur,\\" \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators,\\" \\"Barabbas,\\" and \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire.\\"<br /><br />Scott's \\"Gladiator\\" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time...Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier... We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving...<br /><br />One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed... He's a gruff businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right moment...<br /><br />Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters... He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor... But there's another moment between Harris and the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen that I liked very much... Harris says, \\"Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. \\" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, \\"This is a pleasant fiction.\\" I felt this short scene so sophisticated... It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this relationship...<br /><br />The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's \\" Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" had Russell Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is \\"Strength and Honor\\" is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...<br /><br />Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character... Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall...<br /><br />Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, \\"Gladiator\\" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically luxurious way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and intimate...whose motto is \\"Strength and Honor\\" is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed... <br /> <br />Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general...

0307341542|5.0|A book like this is so hard to explain and really hard to review because while I LOVED it, it might be the kind of book that only a certain kind of person can like it. The main character is a beautiful self destructive woman, the kind of heroine I personally love but am not sure others would. She's screwed up and has a horrifying relationship with her mother. She returns to her home town to report on a series of child murders and becomes involved with the investigation even as she gets sucked back into her mother and half-sister's demented worlds. This book has deep dark rich atmosphere--dark woods with secrets, heavy humid summer heat, cruel spiteful girls, references to wicked witches, tragic beautiful boys, adolescent eroticism, and always a pervading sense of evil. It's always there and I loved it, embraced it, couldn't stop reading it. Definitely worthy of a good read. Get yourself a blanket and read it on a dark winter afternoon.
B0006GANN2|4.0|The dividing line between tough cops and mad mobsters is often so slim it could be inscribed on the rim of a steel-jacketed .45 bullet...<br /><br />When Gene Hackman, as Popeye Doyle is hot on the trail of that illegal load of heroin, he lets nothing and nobody get in his way... If one stands aside from the sheer excitement of the film and examines it dispassionately, it becomes apparent that here is ruthlessness which, under normal circumstances, would be regarded as the actions of a crazy man...<br /><br />Under the arches of the elevated railroad, the Doyle character drives a car like a character gone berserk; if the number of innocent bystanders sent flying and the total of wrecked cars were calculated, it might have been cheaper and more humane to let the villains - and the heroin - escape...<br /><br />But... it's only movies... While the picture's running it is not necessary to wonder whether all this mayhem is morally right or wrong... Indeed, it would be a sorry day for the entire thriller industry, both written and screened, if ever we did!<br /><br />This is a world of fantasy into which the audience is content to follow the action for less than two hours... There are the goodies and the baddies; the policeman may act like a baddie, but he's really on the side of the angels...<br /><br />The really tough cop is a comparatively new type of cinematic character... When the gangster film was young, so were the policemen... That detective of the 1930's, might have knocked a hoodlum or two around in self-defense, but would never have been so careless as to shoot a fellow cop through being too cynical or quick on the trigger... The New York film cop, of the 1930's would not have coldly broken a mobster's jaw, as Sterling Hayden did in \\"The Godfather.\\"

B00005JLPK|4.0|'Frida' is a rich and passionate account of two celebrated Mexican artists, whose lives were bound up with major events of the 20th century-the Mexican and Russian Revolutions... The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters, an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak, love and betrayal...<br /><br />Frida and Diego are two dynamic artists of extraordinary and diverse talents... While Diego's work is more public and monumental, Frida's paintings are grotesque and intimate on a much smaller scale...<br /><br />The film chronicles Frida's audacious self-introduction to the great muralist Diego Rivera, and her physical ailments... There is pain in this woman's life, a pain she don't deserve to have, a pain no one deserves to have... There's a line in the film where Kahlo says, 'at the end of the day, we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...<br /><br />Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strong-willed female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant, sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style, longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd, and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...<br /><br />The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him, by playing practical jokes, by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino).<br /><br />But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself \\"a charming amateur.\\" She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain, anger, and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...<br /><br />London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a well-known womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush, and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...<br /><br />In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting, and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s, with its native markets, textiles, music, and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...<br /><br />Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...here is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love... <br /> <br />London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera...

B000KX0IOA|5.0|There is a sanctimonious air to the films of Sir Richard Samuel Attenborough: the earnest desire that fair play is seen to be done... Attenborough attempts to humanize his personage by exposing the widening gaps between India's two main religious communities, but he seemed to be quite forced to ignore some of the Indian characters in favor of Western ones, as some of the very important episodes of the film were seen through the eyes of two American reporters...<br /><br />Attenborough, a filmmaker who can rival David Lean for the big set piece without losing a sense of human scale, presents the political events with real dramatic impact...His big challenge was to give the film an epic quality... Still, while Attenborough's endless seas of extras testify to his ability to order crowds, his fine motion picture was seen very believable and realistic, with enough insight either into its sublimely serene hero's mind or into the complex realities of Indian history and politics...<br /><br />British actor Ben Kingsley portrays the spiritual leader with deep simplicity... Kingsley's Mahatma is amazing, so beautiful in its honesty... Kingsley burns with a strong and purer flame, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts... His wetly blazing eyes as a young lawyer in South Africa, his black hair and immense energy, gives way to the bald small modest man, in shawl, loin cloth, steel-rimmed glasses, frequently thrown in jail by the British authorities...<br /><br />Kingsley takes the qualities and details instructed by Attenborough: Gandhi's fiercely intelligent aura; Gandhi's rational and calm reaction to inflamed emotion; Gandhi's unshaken beliefs and principles; Gandhi's warm smile...<br /><br />A distinguished cast of characters surround Academy Award-Winning Ben Kingsley as Gandhi: Candice Bergen, the Life magazine American photographer whom Gandhi conveys with a sense of humor; John Gielgud, the Viceroy who decides to ignore the man in loin cloth; Edward Fox, the brutal English general who orders his troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowds; Trevor Howard, the Judge who behaves with great consideration, standing and nodding respectfully to Gandhi in the dock before taking his seat; Geraldine James, the adopted daughter, blinded by love for Ghandi; and Martin Sheen, the American reporter of the New York Times who makes Gandhi laugh: 'It would be uncivil for us to let you make the long trip for nothing.'<br /><br />\\"Gandhi\\" has a rare combination of deep character penetration and enormous epic sweep with \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" But while 'Lawrence of Arabia' is about a solitary adventurer, 'Gandhi' is a moving portrait of a character with a disarming humility, who spins cotton, walks the country roads, meditates in front of the ocean, or scoops salt from the beach... Throughout the picture, which takes place over a half century, one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions... Perhaps this is the secret of Attenborough's 'Gandhi,' that at the bottom of all the tumultuous action is a remarkable protagonist, an incredible individual about whom one cares, and feels attract to...e man in loin cloth; Edward Fox, the brutal English general who orders his troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowds; Trevor Howard, the Judge who behaves with great consideration, standing and nodding respectfully to Gandhi in the dock before taking his seat; Geraldine James, the adopted daughter, blinded by love for Ghandi; and Martin Sheen, the American reporter of the New York Times who makes Gandhi laugh: 'It would be uncivil for us to let you make the long trip for nothing.' <br /> <br />\\"Gandhi\\" has a rare combination of deep character penetration and enormous epic sweep with \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" But while 'Lawrence of Arabia' is about a solitary adventurer, 'Gandhi' is a moving portrait of a character with a disarming humility, who spins cotton, walks the country roads, meditates in front of the ocean, or scoops salt from the beach...

Something about his clowinsh face and perverted eyes captures the true absurdity of the film. <br /> <br />Olive manages to shine despite her lack of pageant attributes. <br /> <br />Greg Kinnear shines as Olive's father and Alan Arkin delivers a stellar performance as Olive's foul mouthed, drugged out grandpa. <br /> <br />I can't say enough about this film -- it was fantastic and all the actors were hilarous. <br /> <br />This is a must-see comedy for any fan of families from hell.

B000007WK4|5.0|It must have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or very, very poor personal hygiene.<br /><br />Those are the only three reasons robust enough to explain why Chris Rea is not a household name. He is a simply superb bluesman. THE BLUE CAFE is an album worth selling the coffee table for.<br /><br />Rea's writing, voice, and guitar are a three-punch knockout. Yet a highlight of BLUE CAFE is the bass of Silvan Marc and the mixing and production that bring out this amazing artist's work without letting it overpower the dozen tracks that make this CD indispensible for the blues connoiseur and highly recommended for followers of serious rock and roll.<br /><br />Highlights?  Oh, where to begin ...<br /><br />'Square Peg, Round Hole' is the way a record ought to be kicked off. If you've never heard Chris Rea before, you'll be on iTunes or Amazon before this intro track is half over. 'Since I found you' is one of the rare upbeat tunes worth risking a blues album on. Rea almost disqualifies himself from the genre with this tune, but his guitar saves the day and wins him absolution for almost crossing over to happiness.<br /><br />'Thinking of you' is almost spooky for its sketching out of lonely love sliced off from the loved one by distance.<br /><br />Then, 'Anyone Quite Like You' with its Rea signature opener:<br /><br />'Ten thousand princes<br />I've seen them all<br />I've seen them come<br />And I see them fall<br />I've watched them win<br />I've watched them lose<br />Since you've been around<br />No one gets to choose<br />Because when the game begins<br />And the time is now<br />When there is no more talking<br />Only here and now<br />There is only here and now<br />I ain't seen anything quite like you<br />Ain't been anyone quite like you'<br /><br />This is as much enthusiasm - always motivated by a single human  being who has won Rea's love - as this artist allows himself. Apart from the personal linkage of lover to lover, Rea wears an anarchic suspicion of the powerful and the polished ('Shadow of the Big Man').<br /><br />At least in his art, he inhabits a gray land where authenticity is the cardinal virtue and ostentation its opposing sin.<br /><br />Within that world, Rea's preternaturally expressive voice and his persuasive guitar eloquently narrate what it's like to live with no larger hope.<br /><br />This is blues. Sad. Occasionally wistful. Music at its most compelling, here East of Eden.icity is the cardinal virtue and ostentation its opposing sin.

B000I0QK74|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas music collections because James Taylor uses his talent for inspiring mellow sound to freshen up some otherwise ordinary American hymns and holiday music. James \\"got me\\" when he delivered \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" amidst a collage of otherwise diverse Christmas music, all delivered with his magical touch of just being James. Natale Cole singing with James was a charisma moment in this CD.
B000NA28HU|4.0|<br />Not having read the book, I went into the theater not knowing what to expect from Eragon, although the trailer did have me intrigued & was the very thing that convinced me that I needed to see this movie ...  <br /> <br />So, it was from that perspective (no preconceived notions) that I sat down to watch Eragon & ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Looking back, I can see the similarities with the Star Wars plot (& just about every other hero/heroine fantasy ever made), but that didn't mar my enjoyment one bit. <br /> <br />If you're just looking for a straight-forward fantasy movie with some great special effects, then this movie is the one.  <br /> <br />If, on the other hand, you are a \\"true fan\\" looking for an accurate portrayal of the author's original vision, then you will probably be disappointed, because there is NO WAY Hollywood can make a movie that is true to each & every fan's inner imagination/mental picture -- THAT would be impossible.
B000002JOH|5.0|I have noticed there is quite a bit of hostility among reviewers when it comes to Pantera, I can't fix that but I will try to shed some light on the subject. Pantera speaks to a group of angry, frustrated, and down right sick and tired of the \\"in crowd\\" type of individuals. Pantera cried out for individuality, and the concept of thinking for yourself. They revolted against the media notions that have been established in order to control the way we think and feel. I will not go on some trip and claim that Pantera or Phil Anselmo are deities of any sort, but I can personally attest to the fact that they had a huge impact on the shaping of my thoughts and views. They have and always will be my favorite band to listen to when things aren't perfect and I need to let out a little aggression.
B000FGGE7C|3.0|Not much more to say, the video (best PQ I've seen on Blu-Ray so far), audio (uncompressed PCM 5.1) and some cool menus make this a great disc to show off the capabilities of Blu-Ray but the movie is really, really bad.<br /><br />5 Stars for the transfer, 1 star for the actual movie.
0743298020|4.0|The book is extremely well written; the author has a way with words and sentences that you don't often find in modern literature/fiction. For that reason alone this book deserves to be read. The fact that the plot is enjoyable and mysterious is just a bonus. The book is a bit of a gothic romance/mystery and was not predictable until the very last section(s) of the book. The author was able to weave together several elements simultaneously and I didn't find any flaw in her storytelling. Others have made quite a to-do about Jane Eyre references in this book, but I don't think the book mimicked that story and I don't think it intended to. There was so much going on with the characters and the plot that focusing on the Jane Eyre element takes away from the greater story. It was just wonderful storytelling and quite hard to put down. There were some unnecessary elements, especially as they pertained to Margaret Lea - the biographer - but it is definitely worth your time if you enjoy and appreciate quality writing.

0060556501|5.0|My almost 6 year old really wanted to watch the movie but is prone to night mares so we said no. She was very interested in the story that she heard from friends and wanted to say she knew it too. We found this book and are both thrilled. It's a wonderful retelling of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. It takes less than 10 minutes to read out loud and the illustrations are fantastic, very beautiful. It's very true to the actual story, just shorter and ideal for younger kids. I'd say 4-7 old range. We highly recommend this book for the younger kids interested in Narnia but not yet ready for the longer chapter book or movie.
1932100385|5.0|STOP!!!! Before you buy ...your next bottle of CoQ10 and pay $60 or more! Before you buy... that bottle of Chromium Picolinate, to help you lose weight!! Buy this book: THE CHINA STUDY. Since university I have read everything I could get my hands on in the field of nutrition, diet and health. That's some 38 years of reading, studying, clipping, filing, cross-referencing!!! After reading THE CHINA STUDY, I felt that I had wasted thousands upon thousands of hours of studying what these authours call \\"reductionist\\" research--a specific vitamin's or, mineral's impact on mice or humans, but not the complex interactions when obtained from food sources. I now proudly feature on my nutrition-and-health shelf one text: THE CHINA STUDY. It was FUN to read. I'm convinced that, like me, if you have THE CHINA STUDY on your shelves you will need no other primer or advanced text on the subjects of diet, nutrition, health, or disease-prevention.  Almost ANYONE can understand and enjoy this. You will feel, rightfully so, that you own a prized gem. I am heartily endorsing this book. If you want to spend your money WISELY. Buy this book BEFORE you buy your next bottle of vitamins, protein supplements, amino acid pills, diet pills, mineral boosters, thermogenic boosters, ...whatever you are spending your money on to self-medicate your way to instant, optimized health. If you want to have what just might be regarded as the most authoritative reference on nutrition and optimizing your own health, then RUSH OUT to buy this book. Here's wishing you optimized health.  <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, all these no-name actors are brought together for this pilot from Joss Whedon.  Who would of thought that this failed TV series would gather enough fans to spark attention for a movie version.  This series almost spells the typical Star Wars plot with your cookie-cutted characters.  But, the stories and characters will entice you to want this series to last forever.  Humor is probably the highlight with irony spelled with physical and social mistakes.  Freud would actually appreciate this type of humor.  I love the slim-pack cases and each DVD has tons of stuff to enjoy besides the episodes.
B0000028MA|5.0|It was the summer before my freshman year of college when this album was released. I remember seeing most of these bands at Lollapalooza that same summer and understanding good and well that it was a special time for American music (also see Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Sonic Youth, Pavement, among others). This soundtrack (and movie) capture that time and place like no other. This compilation is historically signifigant, to be sure, but the music is stellar also, exemplars of the artists' impressive catalogues.

This is definitely not it for me.<br /><br />Without getting into too much detail, I was put off quickly by the incessant use of foul language, sordid sex/incest scenarios, and generally disgusting behavior in the first pages I could get through.  I was not intrugued by this, I was really put off by it and subsequently stopped reading.<br /><br />  In retrospect I should have read a few more reviews of this book.  In doing so I may have come to the conclusion that this is not the book/series/author for me.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|Very smart, funny and interesting movie. I seldom say that about any movie. The story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry who's job is to put a spin on cigarettes, improve their image, make them cool again, and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack sold.<br /><br />Nick Naylors character is brilliant. While he was \\"selling\\" the public on his ideas and views and convincing them, his own son, and everyone else that he is correct he actually sold me too with his good looks, charm, and logic.<br /><br />Everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and anyone who attempts to sell or promote it won't garner any sympathy for lagging sales. That's where the spin doctor Nick comes in to teach everyone that smoking is cool.<br /><br />Excellent movie.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Akira Kurosawa is arguably Japan's most prolific film maker. His creative inspirations have resulted in such classics as The Seven Samurai, Red Beard, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ikiru. His films have seen many remakes, including The Magnificent Seven, Last Man Standing, and A Fistful of Dollars. Star Wars characters R2D2 and C3PO are based off of Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. In a time when film was being revolutionized by such directors as Bergman and Felinni, Kurosawa soon became the third treasure of film. While Bergman explored existential philosophical elements in such films as Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal (Kurosawa would later explore existentialism in Ikiru), Kurosawa was making ready use of his own major sets, talented actors, and vast storylines that soon earned him worldwide recognition. In a career that included nearly thirty films, Kurosawa became a legend. <br /> <br />Life, however, was not always easy for the film director Francis Ford Coppola soon called The Master. Kagemusha, or the Shadow Warrior, is a testament to that.  <br /> <br />Kagemusha literally translated is Shadow Warrior. Other than a really neat title, it also means Replacement. Which is exactly what this film is, a kind of twisted Prince and the Pauper fable set in the Warring States time period in Japan. I won't go into details about the general storyline- I recommend you IMDB that or look into Amazon's own description, but I am going to attempt to remain as objective as I can be, in hopes of convincing readers to at least see the film without imposing too much of my own personal bias into the topic. <br /> <br />As was previously stated, Kagemusha is more than simply a film. To Kurosawa, it meant the return from a five year hiatus of depression and lethargy. I believe he even tried to commit suicide, though don't quote me. At this point, the seventy-four year old director was without funds, and his attempt at a comeback was easily refuted by every movie studio he approached with the screenplay for Kagemusha. After the flood of samurai and martial arts epic films in the 1960's and 70's, movie companies were burnt out on the samurai concept. Kurosawa was told the film would gross little or no money, despite the seal the film would have on it from the director who made samurai films famous. Dejected, Kurosawa seemed without any resources, until two unlikely film makers came to his rescue. Colleagues Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas loaned Kurosawa the million and a half dollars he needed to launch his film. Signing on as assitant producers, these two brought Kurosawa back into the spotlight, and can be accredited for having laid a foundational hand in helping the director regain enough prestige to soon after create two of his most well-known films, Ran and Dreams. <br /> <br />Now, the film. <br /> <br />The response from many critics on Kagemusha focuses around one summarization: is the film good? Beyond- it's wonderful. But is it one of Kurosawa's better? No. While Kagemusha is in itself a brilliantly done film, it doesn't seem to live up to the standard of other Kurosawa samurai films, such as Rashomon(Which was later remade as Hero) and Throne of Blood. Francis Ford Coppola even commented on this himself, saying it is very difficult for a director to reinvent themselves in a genre that they are familiar with. As to whether or not Kurosawa had done this with Kagemusha, Coppola had no answer. <br /> <br />What makes Kagemusha a brilliant film? To begin, the story is phenomenal. The description on the back of the DVD says it's a meditation on power, and in this respect I believe they were entirely correct. While Ran, which came after Kagemusha, deals with the ideas of power corrupting, and the results it may have on a family or kingdom, Kagemusha deals with obsession and the nature of power itself. It's entirely philosophical in approach, yet it follows the basic Kurosawa model: \\"A good film must be interesting and enjoyable.\\" Enjoyable it is, as Kurosawa's artistic eye comes out in beautiful display. When the screenplay for the film was originally rejected, Kurosawa painted watercolors of all of the scenes he envisioned. Many scenes within the film appear to be mirrored creations of those ideas, a still painting come to life. At one point in the film the protagonist suffers from a nightmare in which he is trapped in a lake of blood. The setting for this dream sequence is in a gigantic model canvas of a painting all in red. Another scene involves a messenger running through courtyards of soliders. Each new courtyard's soliders are arrayed in different colors of armor (One courtyard's men are all in deep green, while another in dark purple, and yet another in fire red); later in the film, as the troops march to war, the colors almost seem to mesh into one of Kurosawa's paintings. This technique was later used in Ran, but in a wholly original style for each of the two films. <br /> <br />That's another aspect of Kurosawa's films that make them so enjoyable- very few of the storylines have any similarities to one another. The characters are always well developed, the stories themselves original. From the crime thriller Stray Dog to the poignant scenes of Madadayo, Kurosawa always manages to keep a streak of originality in his works. Even the philosophical themes are different in each one- compare Kagemusha's reflection on power to Throne of Blood's. Both deal with the same topic; however, their approaches are entirely different. <br /> <br />What, then, made Kagemusha less of an acheivement in the eyes of critics and viewers alike? I honestly couldn't tell you. Perhaps they were expecting the epic battle sequences that Kurosawa was famous for; there is entirely nothing wrong with that. Who wouldn't want to see a colored version of the fight with the bandits from Seven Samurai, or Toshiro Mifune as Macbeth watching a forest of spears come alive? With respects to Kurosawa, however, there was purposein everything he did. A director as meticulous as The Master, especially in his later years, viewed all of the elements- sebtextual and on the surface- of his story with a close eye. People looking for the superbly epic bloody battles he was famous for would do well to view Ran or Yojimbo, and probably want to save Kagemusha for when they are in a more reflective mood. To all who refute this, I am not saying Kurosawa does not deal with war in the film. The whole movie's basic storyline focuses around war; however, it is the fighting that he lays off of. Consider why his battle sequences rarely take place in the daytime, or why they are so short (usually less than a minute in length). However, look and see why he spends nearly ten minutes simply filming a march, or another long sequence detailing the after effects of war and battle. Kagemusha, unlike Ran, does not deal with the glory of battle; rather, it reflects on the horrors of war. In many senses, Kagemusha seems to lay the foundation for Ran. Even the lead actor, who played the double in Kagemusha went on the play King Lear in Ran(You will have to forgive me, I am terrible with remembering the exact names. Ran, by the way, is King Lear set in fuedal Japan, with the three daughters changed to three princes instead. The same is true with Throne of Blood being Macbeth.) <br /> <br />Is Kagemusha worth seeing? Absolutely. By any standard it is a superb film. Is it worth buying? I thought so, but remember I am a major Kurosawa fan. People who do not enjoy foriegn films so much, or have not had good introduction to Kurosawa would be recommended to either see some of his more mainstream films, or watch with the knowledge that better Kurosawa works are out there.
B000002HEP|5.0|Kyuss are the pioneers of \\"stoner rock\\", and this recording not only represents the pinnacle of accomplishment for Kyuss, but for the whole somewhat obscure, certainly unappreciated, and ill-named genre. However, personally I would not purely categorize Kyuss as stoner rock, and Welcome to Sky Valley is just great rock, period.<br /><br />I would describe this album as down-tuned guitar distorted thick and sticky molten hot groove riff-laden badassness!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|What can i say, being a huge Beatles fan and historian -- this \\"new album\\" is great.  when putting it into your cd player for the first time, you must at first remember that this was originally intended to be a soundtrack for a stage show.  that being said -- i want to see this show!  what Martin and Son did was fantastic.  it's like you put all the Beatles albums into a multi-disc player and the 'shuffle' option malfunctions, creating a flowing, psychedelic mesh of everything you know and love from the fab four. for the die-hards, it's like playing \\"where's waldo\\" with the snippets of songs that have been masterfully pieced together.  there's only one problem with this release that i can find -- these songs never sounded like this on the albums.  no, i'm not talking about the edits and alternate versions used -- i'm talking about the actual multi-track tapes used to make it.  \\"Love\\" points out rather sharply how sorely in need of a digital remastering the Beatles original albums are. throw on a set of headphones when listening to \\"love\\" and you'll hear the difference.  it's not added effects on some songs....yup, that's just how they could sound if only they'd re-treat all the albums to a little digital \\"facelift.\\"  but i'm straying from the original point....Beatles fans, buy this album!!!!
B0000TB014|5.0|. . . just like on my ipod i like to have BOTH the shortened radio edits  AND the full album versions.  Sometimes we're in the \\"radio\\" mood or having something on the tv in the background at a party when you want constant music and a new song every 3 minutes.  Then, OTHER times we want to sit down and watch, for example, the 18 minute \\"BAD\\" like it's a short film or tv episode on DVD and go \\"hey that's cool how they can make a big work out of just a music video.\\"  Having said that, it's a marvel just that MJ is one of how many? artists who can have a compilation of all #1s and the price of this DVD very fine.  For someone who doesn't want all his videos but simply a handfull of his best, THIS what you want.  These are his best all in one place and THAT is what the purpose of a compilation is.  Most of the bad reviews are probably from fans bitter because the DVD licencers trick us by releasing things in segements and redundantly so we keep paying for the same videos repeadedly for only 3 new.  (I do wish they would just release a box set of everything but this is the way it goes.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Let me offer a somewhat different take on this DVD. One of the big reasons to get it is of course the return of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Donner did a masterful job telling the story of the first film making a very human story in terms of Superman's relationships to Jor-El, the Kents, Lois and the rest of the world. That, for the most part, is continued in this version of Superman II.  Wether you like Donner's or Lester's version depends on what your looking for in this sequel. If you like all action and little of the emotional ties, then your going to like Lester's version. But if you want more emotion and more explanation as to why things happened the way they did. Then you will like this. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting aspects of both of the films is the connection between Brando and Reeve. You might remember in the first film when Superman first got to the Fortress of Solitude. Jor-El more or less held his hand through the whole journey. \\"He was told \\"This is who you are.\\" \\"This is where you come from.\\" \\"This is why you have powers and how to use them properly.\\" By the time we get to the second film, Reeve clearly has a rebellious nature in him concerning his father and his purpose on Earth. He's not outright defiant but it's reminiscent of every parent/child relationship. Eventually Superman would have to make his own decisions about his life. Aside from the super powers, it's still a very human emotional story. <br /> <br />To those of you who are ripping on this version, please remember it's unfinished. And it will never be finished because Richard Donner will never get to work with Christopher Reeve or Marlon Brando ever again. <br /> <br />Also Donner admitted that if he had finished I and II the way he wanted. He would have gladly come back for III and IV. Think about the marvelous course correction the franchise would have taken if that came to pass. <br /> <br />He should have done Superman Returns as well in my opinion. Just has never been thesame without him.  The good guys won this time though.
0743289412|3.0|Prolific author Stephen King takes a small detour in his first \\"romantic\\" novel, although it certainly is filled with some small doses of horror and mayhem, but ultimately King's novel is a paen to love and family, to trust and devotion, to deep dark secrets.<br /><br />All the trademarks of King's novels are present:  an uncanny sense for realistic dialogue and empathic characters; a strong sense of understanding his plot and where he plans to take it, and a narrative that unfolds slowly but ultimately reaching its bittersweet conclusion.<br /><br />The book revolves around Lisey Landon, widow of one Scott Landon, a writer not unlike King, who has made a successful career with his biggest seller a horror novel.  Scott's biggest secrets however focus on his abusive childhood at the hands of a stern, mean spirited father and the terrible truth about his brother.  Also figuring in the book is a strange mysterious \\"other world\\" where Scott takes his then fiancee Lisey to, and whose existence has other, darker meanings.  Lisey's relationship with her three sisters, particularly the addled Amanda, is also a big plot device.<br /><br />I enjoyed LISEY'S STORY but it is one of the hardest King books to truly get in to.  It seems like nothing really significant happens for a long time and even when it does, throughout the first half, it seems padded and even dull.  But if you stick with it, the novel does pay off and while it's not one of my favorite King reads, it is a novel with undeniable finesse and emotional power.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I'm a writer, so I'd kill to be able to write like Alice Sebold.  This novel is a top five favorite in my library of books.  What a voice!  What a story!  Who would think that a story about a young girl being raped and murdered would, in the end, make you appreciate life?  I picked up the book and couldn't put it down until I got to the middle.  For some reason, the middle to end lagged a little for me.  I loved the ending!  I will never forget Susie Salmon.  She won't let you. <br />This author is pure talent!  I gave it a five because it is definitely one of the best books I've ever read.

0812550706|5.0|I read Ender's Game, and wow!  I was amazed! This book goes deep into human emotion and what it is.  Especially into despair and how it affects the young human body.  It is about a boy that goes by the name Ender Wiggin.  He is found to be very intelligent by the International Fleet.  He is taken from his home at a young age.  He is sent to military school in the stars.  He undergoes many trials.  The thing that I liked most about the books were the trials he underwent.  When I read certain trials I was thinking, \\"A book that actually has emotional trials as well as physical ones!\\"  Ender was burdened with a lot of stress at a very young age.  Enoug stress so that anyone who wasn't extremely emotionally and physically stong would go insane.  This book was very excellently written, with the exception of the ending.  After he wins, he just goes to sleep for a few days.  That's it. There is a very nicely written story line.  It flows very smoothly and keeps going until the end. At the end, it just stops for a few days.  Then, to make things worse, it has the pioneer ending.  I reccomend that anyone who reads this book be prepared for an excellent novel, until the end, in which case you shall have to get the sequel to Ender's Game if you want to keep reading great material. Orson is a great writer, and may he keep writing as good as he is now.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Sylvester Stallone makes his way back to the Rocky series to redeem himself after the travesty that was Rocky 5.<br /><br />It's a swan song movie, more touching and slow-moving drama than the rest, but it still packs a punch.<br /><br />The movie starts with Rocky several years after his boxing career has ended. He's living alone as a result of his wife's passing, and he uses his daily hours taking care of the needs of his restaurant, named in honor of his late wife. For Rocky, however, just getting by is not enough, just going through life is not enough. The fire still burns within.<br /><br />He slowly lets the news leak out to his son and Paulie that he'd like to fight again. Neither seems to receptive. Hell, even the Boxing Commission is against it. But then a computer generated fight in which Rocky KOs the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (played by real boxer Antonio Tarver), gets the wheels in motion for Rocky 5 (take two).<br /><br />It's a joke of a fight, nobody expects Rocky to have a chance. Everyone is counting him out, even his family. Rocky still believes, and he proves his point, and his life's motto, by telling his son that life is not about how hard one can hit; but, instead, it's about how hard one can be hit, and keep moving forward.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is a bit slow, building up the drama and tension. Eventually, however, the training montage takes place, and the actual fight ensues.<br /><br />It ends exactly as the Rocky series should end: in the ring, with power, with dignity, and with a ton of body shots.

But I watched it  again because I really had had no idea what had happened and I still didn't understand it, but I whatched a third time because despite the fact I have no patenices I realized that this movie was going to be worth all six hours I was devouting to it. And I was right. it's a complex well acted social comentary on the riged class system of England.   Now I absolutley loved this flim but if you can't put in the time to understad it don't buy it. It's a great movie and deserves the effort, but your not willing to whatch it at least twice then don't bother.

As the British versions are the only true releases of the Beatles music, this album wasn't incorporated into their discography until contracts with EMI/Apple/Capitol were sorted out in 1976.  The Beatles recorded six songs for their movie \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and released a EP (Extended Play) of just those songs in England.  Capitol, the Beatles company in America, knew they were in a bind because Americans didn't buy EPs.  As profilic as the Beatles were, they had several songs from the same period that they had not put on any album before.  Capitol just filled the second side of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" with these songs.  However, it's amazing to hear just what songs the Beatles had \\"lying\\" around.<br /><br />Some people called this \\"Sgt.Pepper Part II.\\"  That's an unfair assesment of this disc.  While there is that psychedelia of that time heavy on this album (panning in the mix, vocal and extraneous sound effects, heavy EQing and period production)---\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has some songs on it that are better than \\"Pepper.\\"  From the opening ride on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" you know it's going to be special---from the opening cymbal crash it's a good feeling type of song.  The reverbed vocals and the bus effects going from speaker to speaker are the highligh for me.  \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is up next and it's McCartney with this oddly solemn song with really good words.  Subtle flute playing highlight the song.  \\"Flying\\" is a mostly instrumental song written by all the Fabs.  Interesting and soothing, it's a pleasant and welcome distraction on this disc.  \\"Blue Jay Way\\" has Harrison drearliy going on in this organ based song.  While a bit redundant, it's always good to the hear the difference that Harrison brings to Beatle records.  \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" is pure McCartney.  Never one to shy away from the schmaltz, this is Paul's \\"When I'm 64\\" for \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"  While not as good as \\"64\\" it's still very enjoyable.  \\"I am the Walrus\\" is the spotlight of this disc.  Lennons' imagery in his lyrics have never suited his music better until now.  Inspired by a New York City police siren, Lennon wrote a song that seemingly has each verse topping the previous, showing why he's rock premier songwriter.  This song touches simply levels his contemporaries (Dylan, Jagger) can't come close to.  Now we get to Capitol's makeshift side, starting with \\"Hello Goodbye.\\"  This is Paul's word-play fun, at it's most basic level.  But because it's McCartney he backs it up with a super tune and a real good riff.  \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is another classic from Lennon and was done during the \\"Sgt Pepper\\" sessions.  Again, strong lyrics from Lennon---more introspective than \\"Walrus\\" but no less impressive.  Tremendous drumming, sound effects and excellent production (courtesy: George Martin) highlight the song as does the fade out/fade in at the end.  \\"Penny Lane\\" is another left over cut from \\"Pepper\\" and it's really defined by Dave Mason's high piccolo trumpet playing.  One could see the difference in the two writers from these 2 songs about places in their past.  Lennon's take is more ominous and dark and McCartney's is cheerful and fun.  Most people dismiss \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" as filler but I think it's one the most underrated cuts in Beatle history.  Recorded in a day, this stumbling, shuffling song makes excellent use of the clavioline (synthesizer-like instrument) to make a very endearing song.  \\"All You Need is Love\\" closes this satisfying set with really, the ode to the summer of love.  Easily singable, really catchy and most of all, something you'd want to sing.  But then again, it's what the Beatles do.very enjoyable.  \\"I am the Walrus\\" is the spotlight of this disc.

B00005JOA0|5.0|This accurate and wonderfully done version of the Tenant of Wildfell Hall, by Anne Bronte (the often forgotten Bronte sister) is long overdue to be put out on DVD. It has been available in England for a few years, now.  It is time to get more of those BBC classics onto DVD for us American PBS enthusiasts who get a glimpse of these wonderful productions and then they are gone!  And while you are at it, please also put The Mill on the Floss and Far from the Madding Crowd on DVD.  They all came out around the same time-late 90's-and were all excellent period productions and being quite true to the novels.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has written a thought provoking series of essays about cognition. He uses interesting real life stories to illuminate the workings of the human mind. I found them thought provoking and informative.<br /><br />As a physician, I was particularly interested by his description of Goldman's algorithm, which is a simple tool for doctors to determine if someone is having a heart attack. Many writers stumble when they write about medicine, but Gladwell is spot on.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized this book as a series of articles rather than a coherent whole. That may be true, but the writing is so good that it doesn't matter. Gladwell is a first rate intellect and a fine writer. You won't go wrong with this read.

B00000K3D4|5.0|\\"Labyrinth\\" has a lot going for it, direction by Jim Henson, puppeteering by Brian Henson and Frank Oz, designs by \\"The Dark Crystal\\"'s Brian Froud, script by ex-Monty Python Terry Jones and David Bowie as the bad Goblin King.  <br /> <br />Sarah has to look after her baby brother Toby, but she'd rather have her head in her fantasy plays, featuring the Labyrinth and the Goblin King. She wishes that her baby brother would be taken away, and that night, her wish comes true, thanks to the Goblin King. She soon regrets her words, but the Goblin King holds her to them. The only way to get little Toby back is to make it through the Labyrinth, a baffling place. Still, the inhabitants seem to be chatty enough, and Sarah makes a few friends along the way. Will this be enough to get to the Goblin King's castle? <br /> <br />My favorite of the puppets would be Ludo, a large, simple and friendly beast. There's a lot of ideas about, and the visuals and effects have that 1980s fantasy feel to them, which is always good. Worth a look for fans of puppetry.
B000HCO840|2.0|While not X-Men comic fans as such, we were expecting some level of continuity and closure from the previous two X-Men movies. Jean's abrupt fate disappointed us, and as we reflected back on the rest of the movie, we realised that it was full of pointless sub-plots and a lack of depth to all the characters. Nothing made us feel for the fate of the mutants before the possibility of a \\"cure\\" as the previous movies would have done. <br />What was the point of introducing Angel? Why wasn't Mystique as astonishingly evil as she was before? Why was Jean so devoid of facial expression? Why not expand on Rogue as a character instead of relegade her to the lines of \\"well she was in the first two, so I guess she has to be in this one as well, but we sure aren't going to give her any real screen time\\"?  <br />But the real disappointment was Jean's fate. What a boring way to end all that spectacle. Everything seemed to be pointing to a showdown between her and the \\"white boy\\" from Alcatraz. Would his power be enough to neutralize hers? Well ... I guess we'll never know. And we never find out what happened to him after his rescue. <br />I hope there is not another X-Men movie because we will almost certainly not watch it.
0064400018|5.0|Thirty-one years ago, I got my first hard-cover book (when you're 6, a hard-cover book like this one means a big deal ... it's a \\"grown-up\\" book!) and it was this one. I fell in love with reading and with Laura Ingalls Wilder in one big swoop. Reading it again 31 years later ~~ I am not disappointed. Since I don't have a little girl to read this to, I thought, I would read my lovely Christmas gifts from my sons this week ~~ and it's more wonderful than I have ever imagined!<br /><br />Now that I am older, I can definitely appreciate the hard work that Laura's mom, Caroline, does just to keep everything running smoothly in the Ingalls household. Even Laura doesn't sit around ~~ at the tender age of 4 going on 5, she is expected to do her chores and help her mother and older sister around the little cabin. And yes, it is a romanticized look on life in the 1870s. But who cares? Reading this little gem of a book got me on a life-long love affair with reading and history!<br /><br />If you are a mom or a young girl that is looking for something wonderful to read ~~ please start with this book and continue on with the journey with the rest of the series. Laura Ingalls Wilder is one of the nation's best storyteller and one of the best care-keeper of history. Unlike history books in school, this one is not boring at all. It just reminds you how much further along we've come since then ... when Laura's most cherished treasure is getting her little rag doll for Christmas.<br /><br />1-1-07
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am so guttered that the series has ended and the film just put it all together. If anyone wants to watch a wonderful film with sci-fi, comedy, and suspense then this film is worth it. Watched loads of Sci-fi and just wished this wasn't the end for now but heh life goes on. A must for the shelf...
B0002NRRUQ|5.0|Is the Smartpack any different from the other DVD?  I only ask because this one is $18 while the other S&M DVD is $31.
032147404X|5.0|This book was great. Tremendously informative.  Straight-at-you information.  Entertaining.  Just wonderful
076790592X|2.0|I had spoken to a few people who felt this book was very inspirational.  However, I've read more inspirational blogs on the internet than in this simple book.  I was not impressed, but instead, disappointed and bored. <br /> <br />Morrie seems like a wonderful person - but his student seems like someone who just was hard up for another story.
B000G759LW|5.0|OK...I was never a Christina Aguilera fan. Up until now, I thought her image was trashy and \\"skanky\\" and wouldn't have been caught dead buying one of her CDs, even though I liked some of her hits like \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Beautiful\\". However, I started hearing some of the singles from this album on the radio and I realized I liked what I was hearing because it was different than what she's done before. She's definitely grown up with this CD and changing her image has made me respect her music a little more. When I heard \\"Hurt\\" on the radio and burst into tears, I knew that I had to see what else was on this CD. I took a listen of all the samples on itunes and liked what I heard. I went out and bought the CD today and I absolutely love it. <br />Christina, thanks for FINALLY overcoming the tramp image, I'm glad you're in love and making REAL music for the very first time. Bravo to you...!
B000HT386M|3.0|\\"Click\\" a fluff piece fairy tale starring Adam Sandler as driven, work obsessed architect Michael Newman uses often times funny sophomoric humor in it's attempt to promote family values.<br /><br />Sandler's nice family unit headed by wife Donna played by fetching Kate Beckinsale (a fantasy in itself) and two young kids continually plays second fiddle to the pressures of work.  Sandler's sexist and demanding boss Mr. Ammer played by a cosmetically enhanced David Hasselhof has him jumping through hoops to fulfill impossible deadlines with promotion as a carrot.<br /><br />Sandler who is challenged by high tech gadgetry, pines for a universal remote which will handle all his needs.  Visiting Bed, Bath and Beyond he journeys into the dark and foreboding Beyond section where he encounters a nutty professor looking Christopher Walken playing inventor/salesman Morty.  Walken gives Sandler a mystical remote that he can uses to manage his existence.  The remote automatically updates itself based on usage patterns and is non returnable.  Sandler uses it to advance beyond all the unpleasant aspects of his life.  He achieves success in his field but in the process eschews the love of his family becoming estranged from them.<br /><br />In the end Sandler before it's too late learns a very important life lesson.
6303148352|5.0|This is the best movie ever in history!!!!!!! I saw this movie in 2000 and immediatly it became my favorite movie of all time! You Rock outloud Steven Spielberg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000007NYS|5.0|You can find this record if you look for it, in new condition for normal prices.  If you can't find it, buy it from one of these people asking $45-70.  No one who loves their sibling, New Orleans, or convertibles can fail to connect with Crescent City.  Bonnie Raitt on her best day wishes she had written \\"The Night's Too Long\\" or \\"Big Red Sun Blues.\\"  Passionate Kisses and Side of the Road are great, but only are complements to the material on this record.  See her live, buy all her records, do something to hear this woman sing some of these great songs she has written, played and, as far as any listener can tell, lived.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely loved it.  It is so different, yet is so true about beauty pageants.  But that is not the main premise of this film.<br /><br />It was the acting that really got my attention.  I couldn't believe that Olive was played by the adorable little girl from \\"Signs\\"!  Abigail Breslin has really become an excellent actress (she always has been in my opinion) and she shows it here.  She was an excellent pick for the role.<br /><br />I loved Greg Kinnear's performance as Richard.  His prior work was so-so but he had a completely different role in this movie compared to the kind of character he has played in past movies.<br /><br />Toni Collette...well where can you go wrong with her?  She's a brilliant actress who fit this role PERFECTLY.  It's no wonder she's nominated for a Golden Globe.  Though I think that Abigail should have been nominated as well.  Still, Ms. Collette deserves the honor.<br /><br />This family really put the \\"fun\\" in dysfunctional.  Alan Arkin was so funny and just great.  The movie did have its dark moments but I won't go into that since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.<br /><br />Paul Dano (Dwayne) and Steve Carell (Frank) give outstanding performances as well.<br /><br />If you like dramedies, you love this movie.  I highly recommend this wonderful movie to pretty much anyone.  You'll love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is onsale at Best Buy for $19.99 and Circuit City for $17.99 this week. Pick it up, its a steal.
B000069HK2|4.0|I have to admit, if the Used had first come out just a couple of years ago, I'd probably hate them. They came out well before my anti-emo phase, though. And I always kind of had a soft spot for them. And I could actually understand why someone would hate them. I found them annoying the first few times around. Then the single \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" came out and I was surprised that I enjoyed that one as much as I did. I later found the album cheap used (and discounted!) so I decided to pick it up. The record is quite good, although it's nothing ground-breaking. However, this group makes pop songs, and are much easier to get into than the likes of Thursday, since the music is less self-indulgent and the lyrics aren't as artistic and ambiguous. <br /> <br />The hidden track, \\"Choke Me\\" is fun though, kind of a different and more hardcore-type track from the group, and has one of my favorite bass riffs from Jeph. The record isn't perfect, and I'd probably give it a 3.5 to be exact, but there's enough saving grace here for me to round it up. The songs don't hide their melodramatics and this can either make or break things for the listener.  <br /> <br />Honestly, it's an album that's easier for me to listen to every once in awhile than many times in a row. That being said, it works for some and could include you. There is a nice energy in this album that makes it worth owning.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|After SOLARIS, lefty George Clooney gets back into science fiction. The premise: the CIA, US government and Big Oil conspire to destroy home-grown Arab efforts at democratization (in the person of the Emir who has an UNBELIEVABLY hilarious, generic speech covering all the liberal bases -- the Arabian Candidate?). Show us a single instance of home-grown Arab democratization, Georgie. (They do mention Mossadegh and the 1953 CIA-engineered coup but that's Iran, not Arabia, not the same thing at all.) Man, these losers hate the USA more than those trying to destroy us. I guess that's okay if you're a mega-star. You can get away with any crap -- who out there has the IQ to dispute you, especially if it's dosed with popcorn at the cineplex and you've paid your eleven bucks?  <br /> <br />As for the direction, very, very slick -- but cineastes will know that the director blatantly (and dishonestly) ripped off the format and style of the BBC TRAFFIC for his own crapola version, then went back to it for this one. Slick, dishonest -- not a single mention of the hated Zionist entity, etc. from our Abe Lincolnish Emir. Coincidence. The subtext: the USA is responsible for radicalizing Muslims because of its unfair monopolistic oil policies. They're just the poor victims. When loony Clooney remakes/updates Lang's M, Franz Beckmann will the hero, denied mental services for pedophilia by a callous bureaucracy.  <br /> <br />The acting and casting ARE excellent. Loony Clooney even looks like the captured, bedraggled Saddam -- without meaning to, I'm sure. This is leftist propaganda on the order of SALT OF THE EARTH (1954), very anti-Amerikan (George's spelling). Very, very complicated -- like going through a maze but ending up in a mosque. Would Clooney look good wearing a burka? Jurka. Movie star!!!!
0618680004|4.0|\\"I thank my parents for taking the view that children should be taught not so much what to think as how to think.\\" Page 327.  Something called Penn and Teller on the rear dust jacket says: \\"...if this book doesn't change the world, we're all screwed.\\"  Well, let me tell you folks, this book isn't going to change the world any more than the doofus ubiqitous tracts left by evangelicals.  Maybe the book should change the world, but simple demographics will easily blot out any of Dawkins' rays of light.  It does not take a calculator to prove that the fanatically religious folks breed at a much faster rate than the Brights do.  \\"...the knowledge that we only have one life should make it all the more precious.\\"  Expect the voice of Dawkins to be drowned out even as American public schools are being dismantled brick by brick to be replaced by cult schools and watch right ring evangelicals take a stanglehold on the courts and the federal government. Expect Penn and Teller to be right.  \\"...we're all screwed.\\"  Contains a directory of intellectually friendly organizations and a bibliography of recommended reading.  Oh, go ahead.  Request this title at your public library. Perhaps they'll buy it and it will really change someone's mind.  Who knows.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Wow, this CD/DVD set TOTALLY changed my opinion of Michael Buble. I got this set for my father reluctantly (he requested it) because I didn't really like another Michael Buble CD (title) I got him. I thought he sounded like nothing more but a Sinatra imitator. But after hearing his live performances and touching arrangements of classic songs and contemporary songs, it was clear to me that Michael Buble is an amazing performer who has come of age with his own style.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|based on true events this story is told without the typical hollywood hero <br />winning the war on his own, the cast is with out a major star but does not need one, its the story that carries you along, this dvd is one of the few <br />that are home theatre demonstration dvd's re the soundtrack, if you own or <br />are able to view this dvd with a decent subwoofer setup, then you are in for a treat, not overdone with explosions, but enough at the appropiate time <br />to give the sub a good workout, try and listen to the DTS5.1 version if you <br />can,
B000002H70|5.0|My sister was way into The Cure in her high school days.  Being her sibling, I had to rebel in some way.  I always teased her about her love of The Cure (and The Smiths), but in secret, I actually liked these bands a lot.  While I love The Smiths more, The Cure is still quite good.  This is probably my favorite album of theirs.  It came on the heels of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, their most commercially successful album.  People were surprised by such a bleak, melancholy followup.  When will people learn that money doesn't make you happy, especially if you're Robert Smith?  This album has an epic quality about it, with many of the songs reaching the 8 or 9 minute mark.  My favorite song has to be The Same Deep Waters as You and the opening track, Plainsong.  I used Plainsong once in a student film, and a girl said to me \\"why did you use such an upbeat song for your film?\\".  I shudder to think what she would consider downbeat.  I usually reach for this album when I want some Cure music.  I find it bleak and melancholy for sure, but I find it relaxing and sweet at the same time, like someone shares my pain....
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Come on Ladies. You can't possibly tell me that after seeing the portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Matthew McFayden that you are not ready to eat this man alive!  Were Mr. Darcy to look at me the way he did Lizzy, I would die a happy woman.  I want a sequel! Guess I'll just have to keep viewing it (7 times already) or at least FF to the good parts. Na,  every scene between the two is to die for. Get this DVD & enjoy. (And I'm a fan of Colin Firth)
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This bizzotch has a million albums out (more or less) and all of them are successful so does she even need my five cents? Well, sure. Because this CD is all that and so much more. Something something totally inspired her because normally, how boring is Christmas music? Exactly. It doesn't help that I'm a Jew but still. But here's the thing, the songs are such interesting arrangements it could be any album. The Joni Mitchell song, \\"River\\" is the best song I've ever heard 10,000 times because that's how many times I've played it. Don't listen to it if you don't like to cry. And...here's the good news:anyone can listen to it. My eighty year old father in law loved it (as much as he can love anything made after 1940) and my 14 year old neice loved it too! By this CD or I'll kill you.

0553573403|2.0|Having been a fan of the fantasy/sci-fi genre for many years, I was looking for a new series to keep me entranced for awhile. After having to grind my way through the 800 or so pages this book encompasses, I have decided this series is not for me, and I have moved on to other titles.<br /><br />While AGOT has a well woven plot with many sub-plots that show much promise of intrigue, those promises are completely lost due to the necessity of the author to describe every bit of unneeded minutia to a burdensome level, which completely ruins the pacing. His fixation on describing what every single character is wearing at every waking moment is particularly overwhelming.<br /><br />Another thing that I found detrimental to my enjoyment of the book was the sheer volume of characters of importance. Does any book really need a 25 page genealogical appendix of who is who?  Apparently, this one does (and includes one). I appreciate the author's effort to provide detail, but good God man, he should have found an editor that had the cajones to force him to cut this book down to 350 pages.<br /><br />If you like every detail spelled out in excrutiating fashion, you may enjoy this book. Personally, I prefer some things left to the reader's mind to fill in. Two stars for the 350 pages of substance hidden in the rest.
B000I0QK74|1.0|Purchased this as a Christmas present.  Disappointing.  Not James Taylor at his best.
B000EQ47HC|4.0|This refers to the Tom Scholz remaster cd released in 2006 WITHOUT the bonus track. <br /> <br />OK , you know the songs and the history (the Record company rushed Tom and he's never been happy with it, it sounds like a demo , etc.) <br /> <br />NOW... the version I listened to all these years was the first LP pressing-orange Epic label- and my point is -CD's WILL NEVER SOUND LIKE LP's !!!!!  <br />The process which differentiates it is called EQ (at 100 hz -bass control in your stereo, and 10 KHz- treble control) and LIMITING (really hard compression)-all of this necessary to squeeze the 80 db s/N ratio of  a master tape into a piece of plastic... <br /> <br /> so GET OVER IT!!!   <br /> <br />CD's are pressed from NON EQ'd nor limited stereo mixes (nowadays the limiting is done in the recording process - it's called unity gain and it's everywhere and it destroys any kind of dynamics, but , that , my dear Petete, is another story!) <br /> <br />And since I've been listening to an artificially EQ'd version all these years, I'd have never thought it was this flat originally!! <br /> <br />The thing is that I thought Tom was going to tweak the final result , but the CD sounds midrangey and flat, with NONE of the sheer brilliance and dynamics of the first album- maybe recording in a 24 track tape with signal paths all the way to Southern Slobovia and back , and in OTHER studios than his own really affected it. <br /> <br />So , there is my rant- the first Boston Self Titled LP remaster makes it sound wonderful and jumps at you, you can hear things you never could distinguish, but this one is the opposite-it IS clean , but it sounds like it was recorded in a cassette 4 track (and I've recorded stuff in 4-track  which sounds better than this ;=P ) <br /> <br />Maybe, instead of having a \\"flat as a pancake\\" master , they could at least tweak with it , JUST A BIT!!! <br /> <br />Also , one very annoying thing- one of the reasons I will ALWAYS miss LPs is the Artwork -no comparison to the gatefold cover on the LP- and the fact that the LP included a cool lyric sleeve , WHICH IS TOTALLY ABSENT FROM THIS REMASTER- I'd have preferred it rather than the blahblahblah corporate blurb about some guy's bar mitsbah gift -who cares????? So... NO LYRICS INCLUDED!!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I wholeheartedely and unappoligetically love Wilco.  I love ever album that they have ever made, and even love the DVD's that they have released.  I also do not consider myself a pretentious intellectual with an indier than thou mentality.  I love all kinds of music, but Wilco just happens to be my favorite band, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is my favorite album. <br /> <br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was released four years ago and I still listen to it all the time.  There is not a weak or wasted moment on the entire album.  YHF starts off with possibly the bleakest song in the Wilco catalogue, the haunting and poetic I Am Tring to Break Your Heart.  Right from the get go, if your a fan of Wilco's earlier material you might be turned off by the noise and production techniques on this album.  I Am Trying to Break Your Heart features plenty of noise and dissonance to go along with the haunting lyrics.  I urge you to give it a chance and listen to it a few times, because the material is complex and it takes time to sink in.    <br /> <br />From there the album lightens up, with songs that are catchy and warm, even a bit romantic.  The most surprising part of this album is that it is incredibly catchy despite all the noise and dissonance in the production.  Heavy Metal Drummer is a nostalgic tune about getting started in rock and roll, Ashes of American Flags is a slow and touching ballad with a great soundscape.   <br /> <br />Overall I feel that this album is a classic and the best album to come along so far this decade.  Some have critcized the production by claiming that it takes away from the songs and is distracting.  I feel completely opposite.  I think that the noise and production enhance the songs.  As Jay Bennett said about the production \\"we didn't want to make just a bunch of folk songs, we wanted something more.\\"  So I recommend this to Wilco fans and fans of groups like Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and Brian Eno.  But I urge you to give it a chance, even if you struggle with it in the beginning.

0307346609|5.0|I picked up this book given Entertainment Weekly's rave reviews as well as the many positive reviews from fans of the genre (like me) on Amazon. I was not disappointed. I was impressed by two things in particular. First, Mr. Brooks' ability to immediately get you connected to the many characters that present their stories. I wished their had been more vignettes in the center of the story, of the outbreak in suburbia, survival within vast armies of undead, and the flight out of the cities. But the desire for more indicates just how well-written those presented were. Secondly, the author did a fantastic job of architecting logical reasons why the disease would spread, how governments would react, and how - once you understand your enemy - how to fight it. Towards the end of the book, I was not as gripped - there was a loss of tension once recovery began. But all in all, a welcome addition to the genre. This would certainly make a great 3 part, six hour miniseries.
B000LB4DWO|4.0|Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.<br /><br />The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.<br /><br />The Plot, in Short:<br />Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.<br /><br />Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.<br /><br />Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.<br /><br />However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as \\"love to hate.\\" It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series \\"Smallville,\\" and not the traditional Superman I remember.<br /><br />Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.<br /><br />Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for \\"Why the World No Longer Needs Superman.\\" She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.<br /><br />Perry White isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.<br /><br />A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Superman Returns.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

0783225482|4.0|Death Becomes her is a really dark and sometimes riotous look at beauty and fame.  Streep and Hawn are perfectly matched as rivals destined to remain so forever thanks to an hillarious turn by Isabella Rossellini who holds the key to eternal life and beauty.

B000BYA5GO|3.0|While I do like Nicolas Cage as an actor, I didn't think this movie deserved the critical praise it has received.  The movie cost about $40 million to make and only did $24 million in U.S. box office (but $62 million world wide), so I think the public got it about right.  What is the problem with the movie?  Well, first of all, and there are exceptions to this, if the story is mostly told in narration and the movie is used to illustrate the narration, it usually means the screenplay has real problems.  And that is certainly true here.  It would be incoherent without the Nicolas Cage voice over.<br /><br />Another big problem with the movie is that it not only has a point of view, and not only has that point of view brightly attached to its sleeve, I felt like I was viewing a propaganda film against the arms trade.  Yes, it is a film against the arms trade, and that is fine (if you want to make a film about that), but it doesn't try to be balanced in any way.  It is really a smear of arms and arms dealers by loading them up - particularly Cage's character (Yuri Orlov) - with all kinds of reptilian and decadent traits; almost inhuman.  After all, how could you sell weapons to people who were going to use them against civilians unless you were a monster?  Never mind, that in the key scene in the movie the weapons we see used on a woman and child are machetes, which can be made anywhere out of any kind of steel you can put an edge on and attach a handle to.<br /><br />Look, I am not arguing FOR the arms trade, just against the way it is portrayed in this movie.  It probably is corrupt and surreal.  However, they point out that this story is based on actual events.  Except that when you watch the extra features we learn that the Ukrainian the story is based on lived in Italy, not the U.S. and he got off because of a loophole in Italian law rather than being protected by corrupt officials in the U.S. government who used him to keep the fingerprints off of some deals.  Now, that may well be done, I don't know.  But real events showing such transactions were not shown in this film.<br /><br />Still, the movie has some pretty funny scenes (funny in a very dark way).  However, there is real violence - beginning with the powerful opening montage (done in computer graphics) of the life of a bullet for an AK-47 from its being made in Russia until it is used in Africa.  There is also some very sexual scenes and depictions of drug use - again to show how the arms trade saps the humanity out of those who practice it.  Pretty heavy handed depictions, too.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in another film blasting blood diamonds, the weapons trade, and the major world governments -  but particularly the character of Americans, hey this is a movie for you.Now, that may well be done, I don't know.

0684859106|5.0|Although I have yet to make any of the cakes in this book, I have made almost all of the cookies and other baked goods and loved the results!  If your looking for some easy and interesting cookies recipes that you won't find in any other cookbooks, look no further.  Think:  Chocolate Drop Cookies with Heath Bars, Vanilla Chips and Pecans (these are a hit in my house).  And even basic-sounding classic recipes (like iced molasses cookies) turn out nicely and are bursting with a lot more flavor than batches from similar recipes. <br /> <br />I do think this book works best for the moderately experienced baker (I say this is \\"easy baking\\" with a few years of experience baking pro), but I think those with little or no experience can find the tips in the beginning helpful (READ THE ITNRO BEFORE BAKING!!!!) and with a little patience can nail the recipes after a couple of tries. <br /> <br />This book's great for those with decent baking equipment, the desire to buy and use quality ingredients, and who enjoy lots of flavor from delightful little servings!
B000ICM5VW|3.0|The picture and sound on this HD DVD is excellent. If you want to show off your HD TV & player to someone, this would be a good disc to flip through. Sadly, it was wasted on a movie that could have been made to run in less than half the 3+ hours that it does. Nearly every scene is excruciatingly long and drawn out. The 5-star ratings are baffling to me, but I suppose it is worth having it in your collection.

1582701709|4.0|I read several of the comments and reviews and wanted to address some who have reached the conclusion that the Law of Attraction does not work based on either their own personal experience trying it or their observations of others. Clearly the Law of Attraction is not a cure all to the many ills of the world. We are all imperfect beings who are hopefully striving for perfection in character, spirituality and knowledge of ourselves. So, as one commenter stated, bad things will continue to happen to good people and even to people who live according to the Law of Attraction. But the truth of your beliefs are always tested. One of the most profound stories in the film is of \\"The Miracle Man,\\" whom by all accounts should not have been able to breathe or walk again on his own, but did so and he says because of his thoughts. So believing and adhering to the Law of Attraction is not meant to free you from having bad stuff happen. But, as in the case of \\"The Miracle Man,\\" it gives you the tool to visualize, then create a different reality for yourself if you don't like the one the universe has tossed your way. Each of the speakers featured talked about the sufferings that had endured, whether it was abuse, homelessness or whatever. And it is important to remember that it was during those moments of suffering that they imployed the Law of Attraction, not after their success. I hope that even those who are most discouraged will simply try again.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|When Darryl Zanuck announced that he intended to produce a film version of John Steinbeck's Depression-era novel, Grapes of Wrath, the industry was stunned... They were all the more surprised when the resultant film, directed by John Ford, proved to be one of Hollywood's finest achievement...<br /><br />This story of a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers who leave the oppressive poverty of the Dust Bowl in hope of finding a better life in Californnia was told with all of Ford's considerable artistry, and it featured compelling performances by Jane Darwell as the matriarch of the clan and Henry Fonda as the son who is driven to radicalism by the intolerable conditions that grind his family down...<br /><br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a superb motion picture which could scarcely be improved upon...

The rest is just too much factual information that one can get by reading a history book or reading wikipedia. There is also a lot of political mumbo jumbo that tries to simplify a very complex political problem. <br /> <br />One really gains little insight into Mandela the human being . If you want to learn about Mandela the politician then this book is for you. I also did not like the narration by Glover. It was difficult to understand his accent and he spoke in a very unusual manner. I have a collection of over a hundred audio books, mostly non-fiction and this narration ranks among the least 'listenable'.

The Body was a medical documentary directed by Roy Battersby and produced by Tony Garnett in 1970.

B000FGGE5Y|3.0|For its feat of nearly managing to balance out its hindrances with its strengths, \\"Ultraviolet\\" is a passable display of action that is worth a watch if nothing else is on-hand.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is back in her assigned element as an individual part of an outcasted, afflicted \\"race\\", fighting her own war in a future full of shiny buildings, katanas, and incredibly capable motorcycles.<br /><br />The storyline, though it's often held back to make way for action sequences, alludes to (if not outright retelling) the persecution of Jews during WWII, in a version where an illness sees the afflictees mislabeled as \\"vampires\\", precluding as nationwide genocide. Summed up in the final moments of the film, a message of anti-discrimination is made clear...lest we fear the wrath of Violet's sword.<br /><br />The action sequences, though obviously bootleggers of nifty \\"Matrix\\" moves, are nonetheless polished and hard-hitting, mixing swordplay with gunplay as violet battles superhuman storm troopers, before fleeing to lengthy chase-sequences on a building-scaling motorcycle.<br /><br />While the contained enviroments in which most of the action takes place are fairly without my complaint, the graphics quickly lose power when Violet is tooling through the city on her chopper, as nearly every part of the environment is clearly part of the CGI - a ultra-bright jungle of glass and metal.<br /><br />Once the action goes back indoors, however, it's almost flaming swords and shredding cyborgs in stylish fashion.<br /><br />Nobody's acting stands out in particular, but that's hardly the focus of the film - for a summer blockbuster, \\"Ultraviolet\\" is an adequate title that won't dissapoint expectations that aren't placed too high.

B00005JPDJ|5.0|My husband and I are weekly movie goers; this results in our viewing of almost every movie released to the big screen during the year. This was by far the best romantic comedy I saw all year long, I even saw it twice! Although I'm not a huge fan of Cameron Diaz the true stars of the movie are Kate Winslet and Jude Law, also quite easy on the eyes. The story is refreshingly different from the recent drones of scripts coming from Hollywood this past year which have made me question my occupation, perhaps I should become a scriptwriter; they are apparently accepting any written word this year!  The soundtrack was fantastic; I have already preordered my copy. The only dissapointment is the studios late release of the soundtrack which should have been simultaneous with the movie release. I'm not normally a fan of Jack Black but this movie made me want to take him home, he was both humorous and adorable. In addition to THE HOLIDAY another must see movie of the year is LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. If THE HOLIDAY is still playing in theatres in your area don't miss seeing it on the big screen.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The movies themselves don't need an introduction but for the few out there who have never seen these imaginative sci-fi films, here are brief recaps (SPOILERS):<br /><br />Alien (1979) *****<br /><br />Ridley Scott's classic is considered by many to be the best in the series (although some will argue \\"Aliens\\" is equally good). The film takes place in a massive space craft called \\"The Nostromo\\". The unsuspecting crew members receive a distress signal from a nearby planet named \\"LV-426\\", and decide to investigate. Upon landing, 3 crew members; Lambert, Kane and Dallas, venture off into the planets bleak, barren atmosphere where Kane, is attacked by a \\"face-hugging\\" spider-like creature which attaches itself to his face. Although he is in need of medical attention, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is hesitant in letting them back inside. Science Officer Ash, disregards Ripley's concerns and let's them in. And so the fun begins as the \\"face-hugger\\" dies and a silent, omni-potent killer quickly develops inside the unwary victim's chest, waiting for the right moment to make its grand entrance and to wreak havoc on board \\"The Nostromo\\".<br /><br />\\"Alien\\" is one of the best science-fiction films ever made. The acting from the ensemble cast is first-rate as is the script, direction and the film's pace is virtually flawless. Even during scenes in which nothing much is happening, the dialogue and interaction among the cast is crucial to the films plot. In other words, there is not a single scene that isn't relevant to the film.<br /><br />Aliens (1986) *****<br /><br />James Cameron's epic sequel has Ripley being rescued 57 years after the events of the first film. Ripley's story of her alien encounter is met with skepticism since the \\"LV-426\\" has been colonized and the colonists have never come across any alien life-forms in the 20 years they have been on the planet but when communication from the Colony is lost, Ripley is asked by Carter Burke, if she can return to the \\"LV-426\\" alongside several Colonial Marines. Ripley turns them down at first but soon realizes that these creatures must be destroyed. In order for this to happen, she has to go back. Ripley is assured by Burke that their mission is to annihilate the aliens. Once there, they discover a desolate planet in ruins and one survivor; a young girl named \\"Newt\\" who Ripley takes under her wing but their struggle for survival is made even more difficult when Burke's egomaniacal plot is exposed and the hordes of vicious, blood-thirsty aliens come out to play.<br /><br />This sci-fi classic offers non-stop action, outstanding performances (Weaver and Bill Paxton are especially delightful) and the climactic finale is riveting. Definitely one of the best sequels ever made.<br /><br />Alien 3 (1992) **<br />Alien 3 - Expanded Cut (2003) ***<br /><br />The third installment opens with Ripley and her crew in cyro-sleep inside their ship. A \\"face-hugger\\" is among them and causes a disruption aboard the spacecraft. They are ejected from the vessel and crash land on \\"The Fiorina 161\\", a maximum security prison inhabited by violent, all-male inmates. Ripley survives the ordeal but so did a facehugger and by using a new host, an alien is born. Despite being in a maximum correctional facility, there are no weapons available, so Ripley and the convicts have no means of protection against the ever evolving species. When Ripley comes face to face with the alien invader, she discovers there is more at stake then she originally thought.<br /><br />\\"Alien 3\\" is not on the same level as it's predecessors but on its own, it's a decent thriller that delivers the goods despite too much talk and unlikable characters. Like all the films featured here, \\"Alien 3\\" is presented in both a \\"Theatrical\\" and \\"Expanded\\" version. The latter has over 30 minutes of restored footage which changes a couple of key elements of the plot (theatrical) and it flows much better. In my opinion, it is vastly superior to the numbing theatrical version and renders it obsolete.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection (1997) ** 1/2<br /><br />\\"Resurrection\\" takes place 200 years after the episodes of \\"Alien 3\\". Lieutenant Ripley is dead. Using her alien-contaminated DNA, a team of scientists decide to create a Ripley clone in an attempt to reconstruct the alien species. After cloning a near perfect \\"impregnated\\" Ripley, they extract the alien from inside her for studying and decide to keep the Ripley clone for further testing. The new Ripley has several unusual characteristics; abnormal strength, concentrated acid for blood, and she appears to have a close kinship to her alien offspring. The aliens, on the other hand, are kept within securely built confinements, constantly being scrutinized by the scientists. These new breed of aliens are more intelligent and when left alone, they execute their escape plan. It is up to Ripley and the crew of the newly arrived \\"Betty\\", which includes Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) and the fearless Johner (Ron Pearlman), to try to destroy the blood-thirsty predators that are roaming within the ship.<br /><br />Despite having some ridiculous plot twists, the performances in \\"Resurrection\\" are up to par and the film delivers the gory goods. There are plenty of gruesome deaths, state-of-the-art visual effects and the aliens themselves are impressive, especially the \\"Queen\\" (her birth sequence is one of the film's highlights) but it's clearly evident at this point that the franchise has run out of steam and fresh ideas. The debate can continue which is better, \\"Alien 3\\" or \\"Resurrection\\" (my pick is \\"Alien 3\\" - Expanded Cut but only by a hair) however \\"Resurrection\\" moves at a much faster pace but despite a high body count and numerous slimy beasts parading before our eyes, nothing can mask the films flaws. Overall, it is a silly movie.<br /><br />This exquisitely packaged box set includes 9 DVD's in total; the 4 films, each with it's own bonus DVD and the 9th DVD includes even more bonus material. Each film is presented in Widescreen format in both a \\"Theatrical\\" version and an \\"Extended\\" version with \\"deleted\\" scenes restored and Audio Commentary. The films are given impeccable treatment in picture and sound. If that weren't enough, a booklet is also enclosed.

0192802631|4.0|I recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion. It wasn't originally within my reading plans for the year, but I was inspired to read it by both The Lake House and the recent Pride and Prejudice film.<br /><br />Jane Austen's work is notable for reflecting on the class structure of its times. Written in the early 1800s, at the time of the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England's upper classes are well structured, with rules in place to dictate exactly who has greater stature, and constricting how discourse occurs, and how romance should proceed. In Persuasion, the main character Anne Elliot finds herself ruing the decision she made some 8 years previously, that saw her send away the man she loved, because her family saw that the man had little stature. Well, he went off to fight in the Wars, and has come back, as many have come back, with greatly changed riches and improved stature. Anne finds herself still in love with the man in question, and over time the poor man finds that he has not changed his thoughts either, and they persuade themselves to re-unite, and marry, finally.<br /><br />Some of what's observed, herein, is how the rules of society are changing to accommodate the newly-rich...and how Austen distinguishes between \\"gentlemen\\" (those who act as good people) and those with stature, but then doesn't allow her characters to be guided towards the gentlemen so easily. In today's terms, we would think Anne Elliot foolish for turning her back on love because her parent says the man is not a good match, because of stature, but these things happen even today. So, I think in this respect that the novel remains a good reflection on how poorly people navigate through the minefields of love, and how poorly people can themselves fare when they don't act according to their own true wishes.<br /><br />This was Austen's last completed novel, as I understand it. It was a little more adult in terms of how it handled its themes, and it surprised me with some of its skill.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|An emotionally charged movie reminding us that we cannot truly know ourselves without first coming to grips with our past.  A young Jewish man searching for his roots in the old country encounters an old man who has tried to deny his own roots.  Both find a separate peace in their quest. A great story with great significance.
B000FL7CAK|3.0|Although it is written on the package that this series is closed captioned, the closed caption option does not work.  (The French and Spanish subtitles worked fine though!)  It was not user error, as I generally watch DVDs with the closed caption on.  I went on-line to see if there was any trick that I should be trying to get the closed captioning to work, but only found other people who also could not get the closed captioning to work.  If you need closed captioning, do not buy this series.
0743298020|5.0|Amazing author. Amazing book. I am listening to the audiobook version of this story and I actually don't mind driving the hour to work since it is so fully engrossing. I recommend \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" to everyone who enjoys excellent writing and a fun romp of a story.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|In all honesty, I thought this album was a step back for Il Divo, not their best work. That said, I believe these guys could do a recording of the \\"Flying Purple People Eater\\" and it would sound phenomenal. These voices (especially Carlos) are unbelievably powerful and is something that a discriminating ear will not tire of quickly.<br /><br />As they've been together for a while now, I'm constantly amazed at the people who come into my office of all ages and hear the music in the background and say, \\"Oh! Il Divo! I love those guys!\\" This CD does give a full range of listening pleasure, from mellow and soothing to powerful and moving.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Il Divo CD, at least not yet, maybe it will grow on me, but it is still one that I will listen to often. Like their Christmas collection, my big complaint here is that it is limited to only ten songs.
B00004XPPB|5.0|An adaptation of the real life story of a family that gave their all to bring down a major organized crime family.  It is not just the law enforcement officers who paid but their families who had to live in fear with absent members unable to support them.  A moving, dramatic, and intense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Pacino and Depp are a perfect match for their roles and their talent shines.  Impressive.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|I don't find this CD to be quite as gripping overall as their prior release, but it's a good follow-up.  The formula is the same, and almost sounds too familiar (i.e. repeated).  But, if you liked the last one, you will like this.  I just hope the next one demonstrates a little more evolution of their musical ability.
B00062RCBW|4.0|This DVD set is an excellent TNG collection, featuring all episodes and extras from each season.  The extras are great, with extensive behind-the-scenes looks as well as cast interviews.  I reccommend this for any Trekkie/Trekker!  The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars, is because a few of the DVDs tended to have image skips (the bottom half of the screen would jump).  At first, I thought it was my DVD player, but using it on on another player did the same thing.  Thank goodness the occurrences were very few and far between.  Most of the times, starting the episode/scene over again seemed to help.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Best written and acted science fiction television show ever. That this was allowed to go off the air (while Fox continues to allow all kinds of junk to be renewed) is a shame. Buy this together with the movie \\"Serenity.\\"
0192833383|5.0|as an avid reader of classics and mysteries, I am highly impressed with Collin's work here. the sensitivity towards the Indians and woman is a nice change from other authors in his time.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I only just discovered this band for myself, after hearing Bat Country on the radio.  I really liked the uniqueness of their sound and harmonies in that song, but I feel that the rest of the CD does not deviate enough from that formula to stay interesting throughout.  There's little doubt that this band has talent, but I question their diversity, even within their own genre of music.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|My husband and I saw the movie trailer for Serenity advertised on tv and decided to go see it in the theater.  We thoroughly enjoyed the movie not just from a scifi perspective, but also the character development and the creativity employed in their language and culture.  The message regarding the dangers of an oppressive government and the power of freely available information was interesting as well.  After receiving the DVD off our Amazon Wish List and checking out the bonus material, I wasn't at all surprised to see that Joss Whedon was the mind behind the project and we were thrilled to learn that there was a related tv series called Firefly for which we have purchased the DVDs.  Being a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, it makes perfect sense that this other brain child of Whedon's would be just as captivating.  Although I'll definitely miss some of the characters that were killed off, I hope we'll see this cast again in future projects!
B000ION79Y|1.0|Add my disappointment to that of the others posted here. Bad dubbing, poor quality film and even wounds that jump from one side to the other(in the late fight scene between Seagal and one of the druggie women, he slashes her down the left side of her chest, then the scene jumps and the wound is on the right side, then back again in next cut...pathetic! Stephen looks old and chubby and needs a facial...I'll go back to the 'old' movies...love those old Seagal movies. He needs to retire...and work out. <br /> <br />Doc
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Though I do not own AFI's last CD, I read many good things about it, and heard numerous songs from it.  I liked their past hits enough to take a chance and buy this CD, and I don't regret it.  This band exhibits enough diversity to keep each song sounding fresh, and nothing sounds regurgitated from their past hits, which seems rare these days.
B000002KFJ|5.0|In 1975 ,after 5 classics albums Black Sabbath decided to continue and record the crushingly violent metalfest Sabotage despite problems with Uk's record label. Sabotage displays a mixture between the heaviness from the first 3 albums , with the dynamism of their last two albums. From the heavy doom of \\"Hole in the Sky\\" , to the palm-muted violent proto-thrash of \\"Symptom of the Universe\\", to pop-synch oriented rock of \\"I'm going insane(Radio)\\".  This album , although it didn't sell like their previous albums ( change of musical tastes), still remains as one of the best albums from the Ozzy-era Black Sabbath.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|this album is very good, it really isn't just another greatest hits album because they did something with it. they created it into something more fun to listen to then songs that most likly you already have, i didn't know what to expect when i listened to say track 14, i thought it would be tomorow never knows but it really was within you without you, very well done, i highly reccomend it. (sorry for spelling errors)
B0000062FN|5.0|I never get tired of this album. The band is as tight as can be and they sound like they are loving every second of it.  Santana plays from the bottom of his toes -- every note is earned.  After listening to this, if you aren't grinning like an idiot, you must not like music.
0743298020|4.0|I had heard great things about this novel, both from friends and on NPR.  I sprang to it as soon as I could after Christmas.  And now I'm very ambivalent. <br /> <br />The book starts off with a delicious description of a woman's life as an antiquarian bookseller working with her father.  Her quiet world of booklovers, book trading, cataloging and the occasional sale were most pleasant. That pulled me in so quickly I didn't even realize I was getting into a gothic mystery until it was too late.  <br /> <br />Now, I am not a huge fan of gothic mysteries and this is almost a parody of the gothic mystery: mists on the moors, ghosts, secretive servants, madness, death and veiled references to Unspeakable Acts as well as frequent explicit references to Jayne Eyre, Wuthering Heights - they're all here.  At times I almost laughed as yet another gothic element was introduced.  Further, Vida Winter (storyteller extraordinaire) makes such incredibly bombastic pronouncements on Truth and Life that I almost tossed it aside in annoyance. <br /> <br />But the telling of the stories was so well done I just couldn't put the book down.  It was enthralling, even when I was irritated by the protagonist's dithering.  I really wanted to know what was happening at Angelfield, I really cared about those characters, I was upset when bad things happened to them (and a lot of bad things happen to a lot of people) and I was almost sad to be finished with the novel.  It is all tied together at the end, but there are pieces to Vida Winter's life you wish you knew (even if they aren't really part of the main story line). <br /> <br />I guess at the end, I'd compare it to some of the better genre fiction in which, at the end, you may not have a deeper understanding of the human condition, but you sure had a lot of fun getting there!
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Second disc is a great addition.  The remastering is noticeable throughout both discs.  If you loved this album back in 1987, this is a wonderful remastered, deluxe version.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable to watch. It is a very different dragon movie that holds the old myths and bases a totally new story line. It is based in the future and the world is taken over by dragons. Great special effects and great story line!! I recommend this movie to anyone that loves dragon movies!!!
B000059T00|5.0|Blind Faith's self-titled CD is a great album which proves that while guitarist Eric Clapton and vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist Steve Winwood (one of the great singers/instrumentalists of all time) bring out the best in others, others also bring out the best in them. The instrumental interplay between them, bassist Ric Grech, and drummer Ginger Baker is nothing short of amazing, and the songs are outstanding, with highlights being \\"Had To Cry Today\\", \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\", \\"Presence Of The Lord\\" (a Clapton composition), and \\"Sea Of Joy.\\" The belief among the surviving members (Grech died in 1990) that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes BLIND FAITH an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B00005A46U|4.0|Originally released in 1970, this was the UK progressive / Canterbury band's second album. This is like maybe the fourth Caravan CD I've ever heard. Not an artist I'll listen to all the time, but I do tend to like their epics very much so. Tracks here I found to be most inspiring were the jamming opener title cut \\"If I Could Do It All Over Again...\\", the folk progressive piece \\"With An Ear To The Ground\\" and the fourteen minute \\"Can't Be Long Now\\". Keep in mind their epics are usually quite brilliant. Plus, this CD reissue has seven bonus tunes tagged on. Another reason to add this title to your want list.
B000002J6H|5.0|I don't think there's an instrument with strings Stephen Stills can't play. What people should know before buying this album is that the \\"guests\\" are given full rein while Stills plays rhythm guitar. His effort on Go Back Home is more impressive than the estimable Clapton soloing. <br /> <br />The editorial review is incomprehensible, unless you think Teach Your Children is rock 'n' roll music. The combination of Stephen Stills and Neil Young is  incendiary dual lead guitar playing, but if you can play a guitar, your left to choose between Stills' virtuosity and Young's raw emotion. Or not. <br /> <br />Oh. And next time you want to listen to a Graham Nash protest mewl, try \\"For What It's Worth\\" instead. Seriously, this is idiotic commentary from Amazon.
B000I5X80G|3.0|We anticipated live footage and were immensely dissapointed by the photos flashing at us and kept thinking this was just the intro!!!!????....give me a break!  The music is classic Neil Young but I'm sure he played more than 6 songs at this show and I see by other reviews that he certainly did.  Where's the rest?  I'll play the CD again as it's great music but this could have been so much better!
0307237699|1.0|This book is nothing more than an obvious attempt at riding the political fence.  Obama has dozens of idealistic views such as empathy for all and health care for everyone -- yet no plans or even realisitic ideas as to the implication of these ideals.  This book is 350+ pages of fluff and should be read by no one, it is clearly attempting to appeal to everyone while making no solid stance of its own, and is hence a complete waste of money and time.
B000059Z8J|5.0|What Star Wars did for science fiction and fantasy films, Superman did for comic book films. In fact, Christopher Nolan (director of Batman Begins) frequently credits Superman with how to do comic book films correctly.  He wanted his own film to be on that level.<br /><br /> I was seven-years-old when I went and watched the movie.  As a young kid, I was a huge fan of the old Adventures of Superman, and ignorantly, that's what I thought I was going to see: a movie with all the characters from the television show.  I still recall walking out of the theater absolutely dumbfounded by such a fantastic film that made Superman come alive.  It was the flying scenes that captivated me.  It looked so real to me, especially compared to the dated effects of the television show.<br /><br />Thankfully, an unknown actor, Christopher Reeve, was chosen to play the part.  In the extra features Richard Donner cites that Reeve immersed himself in the part and even made his body move in such a way that you felt he was flying, even though he was strapped into a harness.<br /><br />As I've stated in my Smallville reviews, the thing that makes Superman so compelling is that Clark Kent is his disguise, and Superman is who he really is.  Most heroes have it the other way around.  Reeve also recognized that to pull off a realistic disguise, he'd have to act much differently as Clark Kent.  Crediting Cary Grant as the man he borrowed his \\"nerdy\\" persona, Reeve successfully creates two separate identities.  It's believable that nobody would ever suspect the nerdy, bumbling, and clumsy Clark Kent was being the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Other performances in this film are very good.  Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, even though he decided to give Luthor a decidedly humorous spin.  I still like Michael Rosenbaum's depiction the best from Smallville, but these are two different eras.  Ned Beatty is hilarious as Luthor's bumbling henchman, Otis.<br /><br />It's also great to see Jackie Cooper after all of these years (from the Our Gang) to take on the role of Perry White.  He's great in the role as well, giving White a fiesty side.<br /><br />Margot Kidder also does a good job as Lois Lane.  I had to admit that she was a pleasant surprise.  Considering the women she beat out for the role such as Lesly Ann-Warren and Cindy Williams, it speaks highly to her interpretation of the character.<br /><br />It's nearly an hour before Superman finally shows up, but when he does, it's a scene that even by today's standards still takes your breath away as he flies up to catch the falling Lois Lane with one hand and then catching the helicopter in the other.<br /><br />You simply can't mention the greatness of this film without talking about the timeless music of John Williams.  The opening credits that start with one of Williams' signature pieces simply speaks to the power and grandeur of this cinematic masterpiece.  Donner still recalls vividly of being literally speechless and feeling the hairs on his body stand up when he first heard John Williams' rendition.<br /><br />If you're going to do a comic book movie, you have to know the character.  Unfortunately, most people who attempt to do comic book films don't know the character, and the characters are only shadows of who they truly are.  The first four Batman films are a testament to this.  Sam Raimi is an avid Spider-Man reader, and Christopher Nolan has also been a Batman reader for quite some time.  Richard Donner also immersed himself in the world of Superman to make sure that he made a film that stayed true to the character.<br /><br />Superman is the hero that all other heroes are compared to.  There is no other hero who retains such a mystique and grandeur of goodness and justice.  Unlike Batman who is driven by vengeance or even Spider-Man who is driven by guilt and responibility, Superman is driven by a sense of trying to make the world as a whole a better place.<br /><br />Superman transcends the comic book world to be an American hero as well, as he embodies all the things that we, as Americans, hold nearest and dearest to ourselves.  This film gives us that Superman.>Superman transcends the comic book world to be an American hero as well, as he embodies all the things that we, as Americans, hold nearest and dearest to ourselves.  This film gives us that Superman.  <br /> <br />
B00005JOLI|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie.  I'd read the book three times.  Of all the movies I have seen where I first read the book, this one is the worst.  I was so disappointed at the hack job and injustice the movie industry did to this story.  If you haven't read the book then this movie might be interesting.  I advise all those who haven't read \\"Eragon\\", GET THE BOOK! Don't rely on the movie to amaze you.  So much is missing in this movie.  I am a huge fan of Jeremy Irons and his acting if fine, but he does not embody the character of Brom.  And what's up with Arya?  She looks more like an indian princess with feathers in her hair instead of the strong, dark elf that she is in the book.  Believe me, your time and money will be better spent reading the book instead of going to see this movie.
B00003CXCD|5.0|We still see posters from this movie around Rome so we felt we should see it.  It was a classic in its time.  Fun to see the sites where they filmed this movie.  It's not like Rome is changing or anything (although there did seem to be less traffic in the movie).
B000GCFO0I|3.0|This film meanders for a while in its attempts at spookiness and possibly also trying to satisfy video game fans--though I must admit that this movie convinced me that playing the game would be nothing more than playing _Resident Evil_ with another title.  The images at times are indeed spooky, though the mystery itself lingers for a while in appearing to be a typical movie of good vs. evil.<br /><br />What peaked my interest about this movie is that the mystery ISN'T typical, but takes an intriguing and well thought-out turn...but the film takes about an hour to get to that turn, and by that time I was already considering popping the DVD out of my player.  The film fortunately doesn't follow the bad horror-movie formula of taking forever to get to the creepy stuff, but it doesn't really present its most interesting aspects soon enough and could alienate viewers who might get a lot out of this by simmering too long in an appearance of plain-old horror.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a young mother (Rose) taking her adopted daughter (Sharon) to Silent Hill, West Virginia, because Sharon has been sleepwalking regularly and naming that town, though she has no memory of any of this.  At Silent Hill, Rose gets into an accident when a mysterious girl crosses her path.  When she wakes, Sharon is gone, but one of her drawings is left behind as a clue...and so Rose wanders into Silent Hill, a haunted town with a secret...<br /><br />It sounds as though the rest of the film would follow a typical horror-film plot: evil things prove to reside in Silent Hill and try to keep Rose from Sharon, but her devotion to her daughter triumphs in the end.<br /><br />The above is true in spirit, but exactly what is 'evil' in this movie becomes a pertinent question, as well as what proper justice is, as Silent Hill proves to have a more complex secret than most horror movies will care to explore.  Even Rose's devotion as a mother has its own price, but as I said before, its most interesting aspects don't present themselves until the second hour.  For what this film does by the end, I would give 4 stars, but its misguided beginning hour knocks the movie down a star in my estimation.<br /><br />Well worth a watch...just don't put too much stock in the first hour.<br /><br />A sad moment of this movie was to find out that Alice Krige does indeed age--Krige was the SCORCHING hot horror chick of the 80's with _Ghost Story_, and then to re-emerge as the Borg Queen in _Star Trek: First Contact_--that made ME want to be assimilated.  No doubt, she looked great for a woman in her early 50's, and she was by no means playing a sex symbol (which, let's face it, would have been creepy, since she was a puritanical religious leader), but still...to see her showing signs of age is just another reminder of my own mortality.st interesting aspects don't present themselves until the second hour.

B00005JJX8|5.0|Just watched this for the first time.  It's a good movie.  In fact it is as old as me!!  I love the way they filmed back then.  And of course Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are beautiful people.
B000HKWCOA|5.0|I enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series.  Enterprise started before I had my PVR and was either on at a time I was unable to watch it or I never made time.  I watched one episode of Star Trek the Next Generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some Star Trek episodes again.  Rather than watch episodes I've already seen, Enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br />As far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews, if you're paranoid, the internet isn't for you.  Keep your private things private, and not on networked computers.  Hopefully Amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|Good mix of her greatest songs.  Although it is hard because I think all her songs are great.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I recently read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged for the first time and found this version of The Fountainhead to be the best old movie I've seen.  Granted, I don't watch a tremendous number of old movies, but I really enjoyed and recommend this movie.
B00011F5DK|5.0|After reading all the positive reviews on this game, I decided to ask for it for Christmas.  I am so glad I did.  I have played this game with my husband and two of my three kids ages 4 1/2 and 7.  Easy to learn yet challenging and fun to play.  A definitive must have for your game closet.
0738702994|5.0|When I first heard that Llewellyn was putting out a deck titled after itself, I thought the concept sounded a little too gimmicky.  Once I saw it, however, I reconsidered.  The deck is based on Welsh mythology, in honor of the publisher's founder's Welsh roots, and is actually very artistically attractive and usable.    The first thing you will notice when you open this box set is that some extra bells and whistles have been put into the packaging.  Anyone who has bought any of Llewellyn's recently published box sets will now be familiar with the standard inclusion of a paperback companion book, white card box, and sheer black bag.  For their namesake deck they went a step further.  The card box is decorated with a red dragon motif that matches the card backs and the bag is the fancy gold bag with beads you see in the picture.    Luckily, Llewellyn didn't stop at pretty packaging.  Ferguson did a superb job, particularly on the major arcana.  The structure of the majors and minors follows the Rider-Waite convention.  Titles, suits and court cards are the same or only altered slightly, with the exception of the substitution of The Horned One for The Devil card.  The imagery, however, often departs from the RWS counterparts.  Each major shows a figure or scene from Welsh mythology, which is identified at the top of the card.  They are done in very detailed and atmospheric water-color paints.  These are beautiful cards, and the computer scans I've seen do not do them justice. Some of the scenes are fairly close to the RWS illustrations.  Gwydion as The Magician, for example, is pictured in a pose very close to the RWS Magician.  Others have been changed drastically.  For example, Temperance has moved underwater, where a water nymph tends to her sacred well.  The Universe is represented by an austere, starlit view of the mountain Cadair Idris.  The dancing woman of the R-W card is honored by the faint image of a spirit woman against the snow.    After the luscious majors, the minors were a bit dissatisfying.  The mythological theme of the majors is not carried over into the minors. Ferguson explains in the companion book that mythology is the realm of the majors, while the minors represent ordinary life.  This seems reasonable to me, but I'm less convinced by her assertion that the minors should be \\"minor art in comparison to the trumps.\\"  The art is still nice, but definitely looks second-rate when viewed side-by-side with the trumps. There is not only less detail on the minors, but the style is also slightly changed.  Whereas the majors all have soft lines, the minors are line drawings colored with water-color.  I do not find the visible line drawings particularly appealing, but this is a matter of personal preference.  The illustrations are RWS derived, but include a few changes.  I particularly noticed that quite a few cards (the 5 of Swords, the 8 of Cups and several others) depicted women where RWS has a male figure.    As well as keywords for upright and reversed interpretations of each card, the companion book gives a decent short introduction to tarot, and includes enough about the myths associated with each trump to help people unfamiliar with Welsh mythology understand the card.  Ferguson also includes a description of the traditional images found on each trump card.  Clearly, Llewellyn was trying to make a deck that would be both usable by complete beginners and innovative enough to appeal to more experienced readers and collectors.  The result is quite successful.

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd is a masterpiece for the ears. It is full of sonic booms and bangs that travel from speaker to speaker like a crazy train. The album is for music listeners who appreciate the avant-garde, minimalism and ambience. Guitars, synthesizers, drums, bass and the most hi-tech equipment of the day were used to construct this rock music milestone.  <br /> In 1972, Roger Waters, the bassist for the group, was feeling life was going by too fast for him and he wanted to slow down and analyze it. So he broke it down into key themes for this new album: First, there is the human lifetime which is the umbrella for the album. Appropriately, a heartbeat starts off the opening track \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\", created by the bass drums of Nick Mason, the drummer and percussionist. The track segues into \\"On the Run\\" which incorporates many of the sounds the listener hears throughout the album: Footsteps, clocks, airplanes landing and so forth which grabs the audience by their ears. The song shows the maniac pace that life takes us on, and how humans are always on the run, traveling from place to place. Life goes by and according to Waters people are preconditioned by our parents and society to think that life starts when our higher education is finished and when we are out on our own. This is not the case, life begins as soon as we are born, and that is the theme of the song \\"Time\\": `You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today./And then one day you find ten years have got behind you./No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.'. Waters shows that time waits for no one and if you don't live life to the fullest, it will just waste away. <br /> \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" includes an instrumental piece with guitarist David Gilmour on the lap pedal, keyboardist Richard Wright's piano work and an improvisational vocal by session vocalist Clare Torry. Torry scats throughout the song. Scat singing is a jazz term, meaning that the vocalist just improvises over music with humming and what not. The song can be interpreted as a song about death, even though there are many interpretations. The vocal highs and lows match the musical flow in the background, showing the successes and depressions we all go through in life; Torry's voice speeds up, her volume increases, and then she slows down after the climax.  <br /> \\"Money\\" is a song about the good and bad sides to our dead presidents. You can get everything you want if you can afford it, but what happens when greed claims us and we want a share of what someone else has? Money makes the world go `round, it fulfills our dreams and desires usually, but the question is whether it makes us truly happy or not. Material possessions can only last so long, and the evil thing about money is that it always drives us to get more. Listeners should think that Waters wants us to remember what is really important with one of the last lines in the song: `Money is the root of all evil today'.  <br /> Next song: \\"Us and Them\\". This song, like \\"Great Gig\\", can be translated many different ways. The feeling of Us and Them is universal for humans: teenagers and their parents, natives and immigrants, countries at war, the rich and the poor, outcasts and insiders, weirdoes and the \\"normal\\" people; you can fill in the blanks. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is full of wah-wah guitar, \\"Brain Damage\\" is a song about insanity and \\"Eclipse\\" wraps up the album saying that whatever we do is pointless because life ends: `All that's to come/and everything under the sun is in tune/but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.'. Therefore, the end of life coincides with this line which concludes Waters' album-length theme of the human lifetime. <br />        Throughout the album, voices can be heard by numerous people that the band interviewed with random questions. There are answers to questions involving violence, brutality and death. The subliminal voices in the background featured give a wholenew type of element different from other albums I have heard, and I think it makes DSOTM richer and more alive.  <br />        DSOTM is a personal favorite of mine that I can listen to over and over again. However, I do not consider it to be Pink Floyd's best; that title belongs to Animals from 1977. Animals is a biting satire created by Waters on human society, broken up into the categories of dogs, pigs and sheep, as an allusion to George Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals is raw and dirtier, something I feel DSOTM lacks. DSOTM is one of those rare and flawless albums, but sometimes it's that flaw that can also make an album great, and that album is Animals. Why did I talk about Dark Side and not Animals? Well for those music lovers new to Pink Floyd, I recommend you start with Dark Side and then branch out to the Floyd's albums before and after.  <br />        And to my fellow Pink Floyd fans, matching Dark Side of the Moon against The Wizard of Oz does not work; I have tried it. There is a rumor on the internet that if you turn off the volume on the movie and start the album at the beginning of the movie (there are debates as to when to exactly start the music), the music will coincide almost perfectly with the movie. <br />        Now sit back with your headphones and speakers, (I highly recommend listening to Dark Side in the dark) relax, and zone out. <br />
B000H7JCG4|5.0|<br />I am really glad they finally put this dvd set on dvd.  I used to watch this show back in the nineties and the cast still thought it was the eighties.  Of course I really liked the show when they were still in highschool than when they left to graduate from highschool the show should have ended there in my opinion.
B000F0UUT6|1.0|I purchased the 10th Aniversary set of P&P for my father for Christmas 2006 as a replacement to his VHS set, as one of the tapes has tracking problems. Imagine my dissapointment when we began to watch the DVD, and the color was almost completely washed out. Nowhere near the rich color of the VHS version. The image looked squished also, and the people were abnormally long and skinny, it was torture to look at. Not only that, but every 5-10 minutes the action would freeze, then jump ahead. I did notice, in the bonus video, that the interviews were normal color, but the segments of the movie shown were still washed out. I have returned the DVD set, and am afraid to purchase one of the other DVD versions for fear that they will have the same problems. I am agonized over this, as I have seen the VHS version with my father dozens of times, and we are both totally dissapointed
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Despite any shared feelings, 9-11 was a different experience for each individual who read, watched or in any way participated in it.  In order to connect to this movie, we have to be able to find something that resonates with what it meant to us. Oliver Stone maybe was not as successful as we, would like. Or was he? I am not sure WE know what it meant to us. It is difficult to capture the sense of this or any other complexly incomprehensible event in a feature length movie,  particularly in a film done only a few years after the towers fell...there has been insufficient time and distance.  If we watch WTC in the hopes of coming to a comfortable understanding and resolution, we will be disappointed.  If we see it as part of the process of negotiating the inconsistencies of life, it met its goal.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is a Christmas Classic with great actors: Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven. The story centers on a Bishop (David), his wife, Julia (Loretta), and an angel (Cary).  The Bishop is praying for a Cathedral to be built with a rich lady's money and is consumed with getting it built.  He pays little attention to his wife anymore.  Although he loves her, she is kinda getting lost in the shuffle.  Cary comes in as an answer to the Bishop's prayer and to try to set things back on the right path.<br /><br />Definitely a classic, this story is set at Christmas time and defines the things that are really of value.  It sends a message about appreciating what you have, the value in friendships, looking behind things for meaning, sensitivity to people's feelings, love, having fun, and the real meaning of christmas.  There are wonderful performances by fantastic actors.  This is a great movie to have and a great movie to give as a gift.

1591396190|5.0|I recently read, \\"Blue Ocean Strategy \\" How to create uncontested market space and make the competition irrelevant\\" by Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne. The title really tells it all. The book talks about creating uncontested market space on the theory that contested market space is very difficult to make money on. It is now one of my favourite books.<br /><br />There is no such thing as riskless strategy. Strategy always has to involve both opportunity and risk but the present playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favour of tools and analytical frameworks exceeded in existing businesses. As long as this remains true, existing businesses will continue to dominate companiesâ(tm) strategic agenda even if it is a business imperative for creating new initiatives and takes on a new urgency.<br /><br />One thing that I like about the book is that it uses multiple examples of companies who have revolutionized the industry that they are in by creating brand new markets and brand new spaces. For example, they talk about the automobile business moving from the Model T to General Motors, to small fuel efficient Japanese cars to the Chrysler mini-van, etc.<br /><br />One of the most interesting stories was about the Japanese hair cut that used to cost $40 to $50 and included everything from a shoulder and scalp massage to shampoo, etc., but generally took an hour and subjected the customers to long waits. When a chain of barber shops went into Japan offering no appointments and traditional haircutting like we are accustomed to in North America, the chain thrived in a big way.<br /><br />This example explains part of what the book proposes. The key is to look at what is really being offered and look at what parts you can dramatically improve. Often you can end up with lower costs while at the same time adding more value to the customer. In the case of the barbershop, they were able to reduce the cost by not having to spend as long on each customer, not serving tea, etc. While at the same time, reducing the customers waiting time which is an important commodity. The customers were not valuing the extras as much as they were valuing having their hair cut.c. While at the same time, reducing the customers waiting time which is an important commodity.

B000J103PC|4.0|I loved this movie, but please note that it is quite different than the book!  Originally I was disappointed with the changes (I expected to see the book on screen), but in the end enjoyed the movie for what it is! <br /> <br />Grab your girlfriends and enjoy!
0618680004|4.0|I found Dawkins' book riveting and persuasive, going far beyond the book's unfortunate title. Dawkins certainly raises the level of consciousness of all of us (in accordance with natural selection), for which I am grateful. However, I caution those who are completely bought into the view of one man to be mindful there are contemporaries of Dawkins with views just as enlightened. Indeed, they understand how research in areas such as cosmology, origins of life, and embryology yield far more mystery than understanding. So while they may be no friends of 'creationists', some are more careful not to promote dogma as they are cognizant their views are also subject to invalidation. <br /> <br />As a case in point, I will turn to Simon Conway Morris, Professor of Evolutionary Paleobiology at the University of Cambridge, to elucidate a slightly \\"alternative\\" view that speaks for itself (as I could not state his points better).  The following excerpt is from his 2003 book (yes, 2003) titled \\"Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe\\" (pp. 315-316), which I highly recommend for those interested in research on origins of life and the theory of evolutionary convergence:  \\"The pronouncements of the ultra-Darwinists can shake with a religious fervor. Richard Dawkins is arguably England's most pious atheist. Their texts ring with high-minded rhetoric and dire warnings - not the least of the unmitigated evils of religion - all to reveal the path of simplicity and straight thinking. More than one commentator has noted that ultra-Darwinism has pretensions to a secular religion, but it may be noted that, however heartfelt the practitioners' feelings, it is also without religious or metaphysical foundations. Notwithstanding the quasi-religious enthusiasms of ultra-Darwinists, their own understanding of theology is a combination of ignorance and derision, philosophically limp, drawing on clichés, and happily fuelled by the idiocies of the so-called scientific creationists.It seldom seems to strike the ultra-Darwinists that theology might have its own richness and subtleties, and might - strange thought - actually tell us things about the world that are not only to our real advantage, but will never be revealed by science. In depicting the religious instinct as a mixture of irrational fundamentalism and wish-fulfillment they seem to be simply unaware that theology is not the domain of pop-eyed flat-earthers.   So does this matter?... As a day-to-day activity science is highly pragmatic, but it also makes such wider claims to describe the world as it is. But to assume that science itself can produce or verify the truths upon which it depends is, as many have pointed out, simply circular.  On this basis and as a human activity science is ultimately imperilled (sic).  The discoveries of science, as is also widely acknowledged, are not short of ethical and moral implications.\\" <br />
B000E6GBV2|5.0|I love this entire cd and played it non-stop for the first month.  Nothing else went into my truck cd player.  The cd has a nice variety of styles of songs.  Most groups sound alike on the surface, meaning pushing from track 1, 2, 3 etc the songs sound very similar or the \\"sound\\" of the band is present.  These songs are fairly different, and yet it flows very nicely.  Highly recommended.
B00005JNS0|5.0|\\"Cars\\" is a slickly-produced, delightful animated movie.  The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.  This is great family entertainment!
B00005JLKN|4.0|After reading the book, it was good to see how the movie complimented it nicely. However, if it was a movie all on its own, it would have had a little bit of loose ends on some parts. <br /> <br />The good things: <br /> <br />Great acting. The characters truly play the parts. The troubled lives are shown very nicely. <br /> <br />Good plot. A killer who picks out families and plans their deaths. An FBI agent who turns to a killer for advice. A murderer who is controlled by a fictitious painting. Its great. <br /> <br />Good ending. Issues resolved. A good start for the next movie... <br /> <br />Number of characters. There were many, but all of them accounted for and easy to keep up with. <br /> <br />Bad things: <br /> <br />Elaboration. The murderer (Dolarhyde) had a horrible childhood. Only about 30 seconds of his childhood are played in his mind. Not much idea of how troubled he really was. <br /> <br />Overall, a great movie if you like forensics. Recommended on its own. Even more recommended if youve read the book. <br />
B000HCO83Q|4.0|\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" introduces some provocative ideas and leaves us almost convinced that this will be the last X-Men movie for a long time. Mutants and humans are living in relative harmony, with Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), aka Beast, serving as Secretary of Mutant Affairs to a sympathetic U.S. President. The peace is shattered when a pharmaceutical company announces that it can produce a \\"cure\\" for the mutant-X gene, allowing Mutants to become normal homo sapiens if they so choose. The Mutant community is divided over whether this is a good thing, and assurances are given that the \\"cure\\" is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is discovered alive but no longer able to suppress the violence of her powers. Magneto (Ian McKellan) uses the \\"cure\\" controversy to incite Mutants against humans and plans to destroy the source of the drug.<br /><br />\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" incorporates some elements from the X-Men comic that we haven't' seen before in the movies, such as the Danger Room and the Dark Phoenix storyline. New characters are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Angel (Ben Foster), and Beast. Beast comes off pretty well. He, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Magneto are the most developed characters, leaving the others to come and go in the periphery. There is too little of Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), as always. The debate over whether or not Mutants should take the \\"cure\\" is interesting. But the film's view of using the \\"cure\\" as a weapon is morally confused. Perhaps that is deliberate, but it's unsatisfying. I rate \\"X3\\" the same as the previous films in terms of story, characters, and action. But this film's themes are a little more contentious.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): There are 24 deleted scenes available with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. There are 2 trailers for X3, Trailer A (1 ½ min) and Trailer B (2 ½ min), along with trailers for other films. There are 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn is conversational and often joking. It takes us through the story with some technical details and comments on structure. The 2nd audio commentary by producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Ralph Winter is more informative, addressing visual effects, locations, tone, story, actors, elements from the comic books, and other technical issues. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.There are 2 audio commentaries.

B000JU7NCE|1.0|As a musician I hate to see it when one of my all time favorite bands is up their just going through the motions, unfortunalty this is one of those moments and this DVD does an admirable job of capturing the train wreck. Smith rarely if ever pushes his voice during these performances, fat finger stumbles over notes during the intro of If Only Tonight We Could Sleep as well as playing half heartedly through some of their greatest songs.  Drummer Jason Cooper has to count off the beginning of almost every song as well as count off the breaks during the middle sections which is annoying and manages to fall a whole beat behind coming out of drum rolls and transitions not to mention how dead his kit sounds, hey change the heads and tune that thing!!! I won't even talk about how bad Simon Gallops bass tone is.  Former band member Perry Bamonte complained that on the last tour the band sounded like a horrible Cure cover band, I couldn't agree more! Every song on this is played too slowly, tempos drag and limp along like a wounded buffalo, it's embarassing!!! The mix is horrible and both Robert and Porl's guitar tones are way too thin and wimpy. Don't waste your money on this travesty, buy the Trilogy DVD or a nice used VHS copy of Show and <br />pretend this release didn't happen, it's a stain.
B000JLTR8G|4.0|Notable for one of the first big payday screenplay in the industry for Paul Schrader before his success w/ Taxi Driver, nuanced and sensitive to things Japanese - due in large part to brother Leonard, who was a devotee of the country and its culture, who did the original treatment and was uncredited (And again in Mishima, over which the brothers broke.). <br /> <br />A remarkable fusion of noir sensibility (not to forget Towne) and yakuza ethos, The Yakuza is an effective action picture possessing tremendous emotional range and depth, and the emotions on-screen are supple and powerful. You don't expect tenderness of this kind in this genre: between parents and child, lovers, husband and wife, ultimately friends, the tidal affects of bonds and obligation. The regard of the film toward its object is fairly loving - compare to such later projects as the Michael Douglas vehicle, Ridley Scott's Black Rain with its rampant machismo imperialism and condescending xenophobia. <br /> <br />Mitchum has never been better or more world weary. And you understand why Ken Takakura is the Clint Eastwood of Japan. An unlikely pairing, and an odd buddy pairing picture of two men a world apart bonded by perverse fate, There are at least two love stories and a fight set-piece that can compare to anything in Tarantino. <br /> <br />Dave Grusin did the score, Pollack directs. What a class act.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have a bunch of Beatles albums, and have heard all of the songs.  But I love this fresh take on the music.  The remix doesn't go to far, but still adds a fresh but oddly familiar twist to the music.  As I listened to the album, I imagined the Fab 4 recording it this way the first time.
055358202X|5.0|I have to say I was surprised to discover how good this book really is. When it came out, I made the mistake of reading the reviews of the other readers and giving them too much weight. A decision that I now regret. That had kept me from picking up this book for a while. Finally, when I had some free time on my hands, I decided to give it a try and am sure glad that I did.  <br /> <br />The storyline is still very creative and kept me engrossed the whole length of the book. The details are important and original and make the world richer and livelier. The characters are well-developed and Mr. Martin makes you feel as if you know these characters personally. Just look at the variety of the characters and their colorfulness.  <br /> <br />Sure, this particular book does not have as much action and adventure as the three earlier volumes did; but that is because Mr. Martin is letting the storyline develop naturally instead of forcing it. There is always a peace after the wars and a lull before the storms. However, he has set the stage dexterously: Highgarden and Casterly Rock are going to be at each other's throats in no time; Ironborne are poised to launch a major assault; Stannis is sharpening his sword and Dornishmen their spears; and to top it off the Dragnons and the Wights are ready to make a big comeback to Westeros.  <br /> <br />You have to keep in mind that this series is about entire Westeros and perhaps the surrounding lands too; and not just about the characters and the houses whose stories were detalied in the earlier books. Sure, there were hardly any significant events involving Stannis, Northenmen, Night's Watch and Daenerys Targaryen; but let us not forget all the characters and houses we got acquainted with in The Feast of Crows; that were barely mentioned and then left out in the earlier books.  <br /> <br />The Dornishmen: it's Prince Nymeros Martell, his daughter Arianne and the dangerous Darkstar; The Lords of the Vale; The Ironborne and their culture. What many posit as this book's low point-it's description of \\"minor\\" characters and inclusion of subplots-is anything but. I would call it it's high point. It allows us to see Westeros and the surrounding lands as never before.  <br /> <br />We learn about the Faceless Men of Braavosi and about Braavos, the history of the ancient freehold of Valyria, the lives of the commonfolks of Westeros, the Faith of Westeros and it's role in the lives of Westerosi, the role of the minor knights and the lords in the politics of the realm, the world of outlaws and sailors. Some may choose not to dwell upon it, but I say it makes the world of Mr. Martin that much more thicker, deeper and grander.  <br /> <br />To add to it, there are some new characters created with incredible potential. The Euron Crow's Eye and the new High Septon: these two are bound to play influential role in the coming events. Victarion also shows much potential as a possible hero. And Darkstar! That man is going to set so many fires that even dragons will look on in amazement. I think he was the most promising character to come out of Dorne and this book, a handsome, skilled and dangerous Knight, ready to start major rukus all by himself.  <br /> <br />With all of that, there were a couple of minor disagreements I had. Brienne's chapters could have been cut by many pages and without loosing her part in the story. But moreover, the idea of a *Prophecy* in the end chapters disheartened me. The concept of *Prophecy* is so old and tiresome and used in so many fantasy epics and stories, that it just does not feel right in the work that is so original. I hope Mr. Martin will let the *Prophecy* come to naught.  <br /> <br />However, Mr. Martin has not been given proper credit by many reviewers here. This a very fine work of art and you will not understand till you read it yourself. Don't make the mistake that I made and mentioned earlier: of relying on other reviewers. Buy it as soon as possible: you are in for one great ride.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000004CYT|4.0|I'm one of those Beethoven fanatics who has all the period recordings of Beethoven's nine symphonies, or most of them anyway. I've got Norrington, Gardiner, Bruggen, the Hanover Band and Hogwood. Between the five, I could assemble a definitive \\"period\\" set. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but Hogwood and his forces could hold their own over the course of the nine. I enjoyed symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 & 7.<br /><br />If you are looking for one good set, with solid sound at a great price, this is it. Nevertheless, the Hanover Band recordings on Nimbus, originally won me over. Before them, the modern orchestra frankly bored me with their Beethoven, and I hadn`t heard the other period specialists yet.<br /><br />My favorites ~<br /><br />*The Hanover Band<br /><br />*Franz Bruggen and the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century<br /><br />*Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music<br /><br />*John Elliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique<br /><br />*Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players
B000ICL3KG|5.0|One might think a movie about global warming would be boring, but An Inconvenient Truth is quite the opposite. Al Gore does an incredible job presenting hard, indisputable evidence for global warming. He not only discusses the science behind it, he also discusses the ramifications it can have on our society if we do not act.<br /><br />I also liked how he tied in some personal information about his life. It gives the viewer a better sense of how pasionate Mr Gore really is about the environment. I would have liked to have seen a little more discussion about what we as citizens can do, but overall, a must-see, captivating film. After you see it, you won't be asking whether or not global warming is real, but rather you will be asking what we are doing to stop it.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"The Weather Makers\\" by Tim Flannery
B00000DRA9|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim because I remembered loving that first scene as a kid with the clouds and the Limahl song at the beginning of the movie.  I remember there being more music in the movie but I was surprised to discover that every track on this CD is magical, and often times inspirationally uplifting as well as touchingly sad in a beautiful nostalgic way.  If you ever believed that the world was a truly magical place, this is the soundtrack for you because it will remind you of how you felt, and maybe make you believe again.  Rarely do many days go by that I don't play these wonderful tracks.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|John Mayer changed things up with his latest CD, \\"Continuum\\". Instead of the more upbeat, energetic songs from his previous CDs, Continuum is much more relaxing and soulful. The songs are very calming to listen to, but a few of the tracks can be a little too slow, such as \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\". Some of my favorite songs are \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\", \\"Gravity\\", and \\"In Repair\\". If you like upbeat and exciting music, this CD might not be for you, but if you like soulful and powerful music, you will love this CD.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I'll keep this nice and short for those of you who just want to know if this movie is for you. Silent Hill is one of those rare kinds of horror movies that will actually spook you. The death effects and atmosphere are disturbing, not just gory. Essentially, it's a horror movie with a point to make, focusing on the evils man can create while trying to fight evil. If you like to be scared by horror movies, and you get sick of all the boring \\"ohh he's chasing me with a knife-OOPS! I tripped!\\" storylines and you just want a movie that'll creep you out like you haven't been since you were a kid, I strongly recommend purchasing this film. I've watched it six times; it definitely will be worth it on the dollars spent/hours entertained ratio.
0743454537|3.0|i'm giving this 3 stars because i, like most the reviews i've read, liked the whole book until the ending.  i teach 4th grade and it seemed like something one of my students would have done.  she might as well have the main character wake up from a bad dream.  that's how bad the ending was.
0312323867|5.0|I loved \\"something borrowed\\" but thought that Rachel's \\"I'm a good girl who's conflicted\\" got old. By the end of \\"borrowed\\", I wasn't going to be as quick to judge cheaters, but I didn't think Rachel was fully in the right with the way she handled everything. Something Blue is Darcy's (infinitely more interesting) story. While some reviewers thought her transformation was so sudden-it was a long time coming and interventions can cause change. Something Blue is really a great followup, companion, whatever.

B000002UAX|3.0|Barely a year after the triumph of SGT. PEPPER'S and their subsequent numerous Top 40 singles, the unparalleled and cohesive unit that was the Beatles lay in total disarray. Cooperation and co-inspiration between band members had given way to backbiting and blatant avoidance. This sad turn of events was unintentionally chronicled in the double-record set known as the WHITE ALBUM.<br /><br />These recordings are not so much the Beatles as they are John and friends, Paul with backup, etc. Quality on the WHITE ALBUM varies widely. The excellence of \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Long, Long, Long,\\" Blackbird,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" is offset by throwaway trivialities like \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" \\"Martha My Dear,\\" \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey.\\"<br /><br />John Lennon comes off worst here, for several reasons. Because some were busily parsing his songs for hidden meanings, John responded by creating nonsensical lyrics for many of his WHITE ALBUM contributions. \\"Glass Onion,\\" \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun,\\" \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and others are the result of his ill-advised playfulness. The inclusion of Yoko Ono in the chorus of \\"Bungalow Bill\\" was as much in error as was the chorister who kept singing \\"Buffalo\\" instead of \\"Bungalow.\\" \\"Revolution #9,\\" Lennon's Opus Dopus, defies description even as it defines drugged-out excess.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's Dylanesque storytelling (\\"Rocky Raccoon\\") makes his schmaltzy side (\\"Honey Pie\\") that much more of an enigma. George Harrison's few efforts are fairly consistent and clearly demonstrate his too-long overlooked talents. Ringo's \\"Goodnight\\" lullabye lies in stark contrast to the jarring \\"Revolution #9\\" aural nightmare that directly precedes it.<br /><br />And as for dreams, the WHITE ALBUM sessions are an eyes-wide-open indicator that the Beatles dream would soon be over.

B000I0RR7Q|5.0|I agree that any review of an HD DVD disk should include an opinion as to its technical quality, if possible comparing it to the regular DVD release.  For the Casablanca HD DVD, I found the following opinion in the online magazine Perfect Vision, a high end technologically oriented magazine: \\"Casablanca is the film to see as the black-and-white showcase of hi-def.  The setting of Morocco and Rick's Café Americain jump from the screen in breathtaking crystal clarity.\\"

B000J3EEBY|3.0|I liked the music, but wish there were more songs with more long spacey rythyms.  I still like Loreena's music.  A good effort - those who like Celtic sounds or other McKennitt music will like this album.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|The main part of the story is about two NYC police officers who are trapped in ruble and are rescued.  It would not do justice for the 9-11 victims to tell every story of everybody that died or survived on that day.  That is probably 6000 individual stories (survivors and people who died).  All of their stories deserved to be told, and hopefully somebody somewhere is creating a website or a book to do just that.  Some of them would be interesting enough to be made in a movie, but most likely they would better served by being made into a book that can be read one story at a time without any time boundness and dramatization that are required of movies. <br /> <br />As for this movie, it did the job is was designed to do.  Is it a movie I would watch over and over again?  No.  Is it a movie I would recommend to others to see? Yes. <br /> <br />As for me, I went into the movie without having been exposed to the news coverage of the events day in and day out.  I did not know how I would react seeing the dramatization of the \\"evils\\" of that day.  I was glad that the movie did not focus on the dramatization of the airplanes crashing into the WTC.  It was just shown on a TV in the background.  I am also glad that it had zero coverage of the Muslims preparing for the day or whatever.  They do not deserve the film time. <br /> <br />The movie told the story that it was designed to tell, and it did it very well.  I feel sorry for the reviewers who are so exposed to hollywood dramatization that they cannot handle or accept true reality.  The movie is the truth, not TV hollywood. <br /> <br />Oh, the marine person was not just thrown in.  He was the man who found them, and the film did a very good job of showing his personality and his dedication to his task.  Everyone portrayed in that film is a real life hero, not a hollywood actor.  They deserved to be treated as such.
B000002GYR|5.0|\\"Sittin' on the windowsill, blowin' my horn/Nobody's up except the moon and me/And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree/And all that you left me was a melody.\\"<br /><br />Tom Waits would become a musical genius, definitely one of the most influential singer/songwriters of the twentieth century.  Listening to CLOSING TIME, then reflecting back upon the following decades, it's easy to see why: beautiful lyrics, interesting melodies, and a personality that shines through in voice and words.  The arrangements are simple enough (Waits plus an instrument, and a small backup band), but the music is more than a sum of its parts.  Maybe it's cliche, but I don't care: CLOSING TIME is a classic record, a true masterpiece.  By blending jazz, rock, and country into one flawless sound, Waits created songs that will last well beyond his own lifetime.  This is one of those records that, if you are a music lover, you must have in your collection.
1582701709|1.0|I think a book like this, which makes some really big claims, should, roughly, do the following: <br /> <br />1) Present it's premise clearly <br />2) Since it's a self-help book explain clearly what you need to do <br />3) Provide compelling evidence that it's ideas work <br />4) Be credible. <br /> <br />The book does a decent job of explaining its premise, which is that everything in your life is the result of the law of attraction.  I quote, \\"the law of attraction says like attracts like, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you.\\"  In other words, think good thoughts and good things will come to you and if you think bad thoughts then bad things come to you.  I've simplified this a bit but not a whole lot as the concept isn't rocket science. <br /> <br />Now, does this book explain clearly what you need to do?  Actually, for a self-help book it does a very poor job of this.  How do you control your thoughts?  What kinds of practices and thinking produce the best results?  The author and contributors basically tell you a bunch of stories about how \\"so and so did something and you can too by changing your thinking\\".   <br /> <br />And that's it for the \\"how to\\" part of the book.  There isn't any. <br /> <br />Now, if I wanted to prove something worked from a scientific perspective it would seem to be easy to test this stuff out.  You take two groups of people, teach one the secret, let the other go on with their lives and see what happens.  In theory those that know the Secret would be happier and more successful than the control group.  It might not be perfect but it'd be a whole lot better than what we get in this book.  But, of course, you'd have to have an actual methodology to test. <br /> <br />Instead the authors cite numerous anecdotes of how the Secret worked.  One person's cancer went away.  Another individual walks after a brutal accident.  Still another finds romance.  That's all fine and perhaps it's evidence but it's not proof.  Cancer can be misdiagnosed.  How many people who were injured like the \\"Miracle Man\\" never walked again despite the best attitude and trying the approach perfectly?  The problem with anecdotes is that it's easy to start with a result, work backward and assume the conclusion.  It's also very easy with anecdotes to only present the ones that make your case and ignore those that don't (when someone dies of cancer while practicing the secret for instance).  It's just not good enough to use anecdotes for large claims like those made in this book. <br /> <br />The following quote struck a nerve. <br /> <br />\\"People hold that for awhile, and they're really a champion at it.  They say, `I'm fired up, I saw this program and I'm going to change my life.'   And yet the results aren't showing.  Beneath the surface it's just about ready to break through but the person will look just at the surface results and say, `This stuff doesn't work.' And you know what?  The universe says, \\"your wish is my command,\\" <br /> <br />I thought it was interesting that the universe instantly manifest failure but isn't quite so fast with success.  In fact, a cynical individual might conclude that what they are really saying is, \\"when this program works it's because the secret always works, but, on the off chance it doesn't work, well, that's your fault.\\"  An even more cynical person might think, \\"gosh, I wonder what would help a person who failed?  Maybe, a seminar with Bob Proctor would be just the thing to get them over the top?\\" <br /> <br />Lastly, is the Secret credible?  On the one hand, I think a lot can be said for the idea that if you change your thinking you'd change your life.  In many ways that seems obvious to me.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, if the secret actually was true, especially at the scope claimed by the book it would mean that everything that's happened is the result of your thinking.  So, when a child dies of pneumonia, well, it's because they brought pneumonia into their lives.  Michael J. Fox, not only did you bring Parkinson's into your life but change your thinking and it will go away.  Obviously these things aren't true and they obliterate, in my opinion, any credibility in the book. <br /> <br />Not only does the book go too far but most (I'd argue nearly all) of the contributors aren't credible.  On a topic of this scope: the ability to 100% change your life and the world in an incredible fashion, does anyone really think you couldn't find psychologists, top flight scientists, therapists and thousands of mainstream individuals to support it, if it worked?  Wouldn't there be tons of research instead of anecdotes?  Instead we get a Feng Shui Master, a chiropractor, motivational speakers (err trainers), a metaphysicist, etc. combined with a half dozen anecdotal stories.  So the most powerful like changing idea ever and you get it from the crew in this book presented in this fashion?  I don't think so!  <br /> <br />If this idea really worked, at anything other than giving material to self-help speakers and generating repeat students, it just wouldn't be found here.  The book wouldn't even have to be written because we'd all already know it and be practicing it.  Remember, this is not a new idea, it's been around for a very long time, and it's been the topic of literally thousands of seminars and hundreds of books. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I'm not opposed to the idea on a small scale but this book just goes way too far and I'm left with the feeling that all that's really going on is a bunch of people trying to get their name out and get you to pay for their seminars. <br />
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits is a musical genius--you only have to listen to RAIN DOGS to figure that one out.  In this world of synthisized music, where the lyrics are all trite and the instrumentation predictable and dull, RAIN DOGS cut to the very core of the music fan in all of us.  It is a raw, scorching album made by a man who has something to say--even if he's not entirely sure what that is.<br /><br />RAIN DOGS is a masterpiece not just in lyric and melody, but also diversity.  There are tender ballads (\\"Time,\\" if you really want to use the word \\"tender\\" to describe it) alongside raucous stompers (\\"Cemetery Polka\\").  \\"Hang Down Your Head\\" and \\"Downtown Train\\" are both genuine rock tunes (the former is one of my favorite Waits tunes of all time; the latter is one of his most popular, thanks to Rod Stewart).  And it's a wonder \\"Blind Love\\" hasn't been re-made into a country hit.<br /><br />RAIN DOGS is an album where a dark, haunting atmosphere (\\"Sane, sane, they're all insane/The fireman's blind, the conductor's lame\\") lingers next to a sense of lazy hopelessness (\\"16 men on a dead man's chest/And I've been drinking from a broken cup/2 pairs of pants and a mohair vest/I'm full of bourbon I can't get up\\"), which in turn stands beside a sense of heartbroken hope (\\"Hang down your head for sorrow/Hang down your head for me/Hang down your head tomorrow/Hang down your head Marie\\").  This is a true, genuine classic--just one of many by Tom Waits.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Right off, this is not a collection or remix of Beatle \\"Love Songs\\".  Anyone expecting a repackage or an addendum to the 1977 \\"Love Songs\\" album will immediately scratch their head in confusion.  George Martin's current offering is definitely a \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" of Beatle renderings and as such should have been titled along the lines of \\"Magical\\" versus \\"Love\\".  That's not to speculate what Martin envisioned for this CD.  It's definitely a Millenium-fresh mix of songs that expresses our \\"Love\\" of the Beatles, nevertheless, it is not a collection of the Beatle's love songs.  That being said, the audio quality is spectacular, the choice of songs \\"refreshing\\" and the lead-in, lead-out fades \\"groovy\\".  Face it, there is but only so much material available for a band that is immortal, but no longer releasing new material.  For the Beatles to continue their legacy, albums such as this need to incorporate new ideas that incorporate the songs with which the Beatles have left us.  Love provides just that.  As such, this is a must have for any Beatle fan.  I would like to think that this album would also transcend the generation gap and offer an opening for today's culture to enter the magical world of the Beatles.
B00000IGGA|5.0|MULE VARIATIONS is possibly my favorite over-all Waits record.  It's hard to argue with RAIN DOGS and CLOSING TIME, of course, but MULE is a much more mature record than the other two.  It is a record that revolves primarily around a blues sound, but incorporates elements from so many other musical genres, it's hard to classify just what kind of music this is (a trademark of Waits).  \\"Hold On,\\" for example, could easily be a country hit, as with \\"House Where Nobody Lives.\\"  \\"Come On Up To the House\\" is surely a gospel number; \\"Get Behind the Mule\\" is roots blues; \\"What's He Building In There?\\" is a spoken-word recitation that chills to the very bone; and \\"Filipino Box Spring Hog\\" is...well, it's unique.<br /><br />MULE is also a delight lyrically, offering such touching tributes as \\"It's got to be a chocolate Jesus/Make me feel good inside.\\"  \\"Georgia Lee\\" is a touching story-song of murder in the South; \\"Picture in a Frame\\" is an ode to a love long-lost (\\"I'm gonna love you 'til the wheels fall off/Oh, yeah\\"); \\"Cold Water\\" is a bluesy look at a homeless rambler (\\"I look 47 but I'm 24/Well they shoo'd me away from here the other time before\\"); and \\"Pony\\" is a truly touching tune about a wayward traveler (\\"I hope my pony knows the way back home.\\"  MULE VARIATIONS is yet another sonic, lyrical classic by Tom Waits, one of music's true geniuses.
0316172324|5.0|This book was so captivating that I don't even feel like I even blinked once while reading it! I'm still digesting all the thought-altering information, but my \\"thin slicing\\" of the book would be that our amazing, innate, and instantaneous gift of \\"knowing\\" rewards us with lightning speed insights, whose explanations can leave us at a loss for words. This book does an excellent job at explaining not only the process behind this split-second thinking, but also how we can train ourselves to maximize the usefulness and minimize the dangers of our uncanny cerebral powers. I think my thinking will never be the same!
B000001FTJ|5.0|You've heard nothing like SWORDFISHTROMBONES, unless you've listened to other Waits records.  This is the one that truly kicked off his evolution into \\"musical genius\\" territory.  The lyrics are still similar to what came before, but the sonic landscape is brand new.  Diverse instrumentation and melodic structure give way to an album that defies categorization.<br /><br />From bluesy romps \\"Down, Down, Down\\", to country ballads \\"In the Neighborhood,\\" to caberet maladies \\"Underground,\\" SWORDFISHTROMBONES has it all.  The title track is a disturbing ballad of a soldier returning from war (a similar theme reappears in other songs).  \\"Frank's Wild Years\\" is a recitation about a young man apparently driven insane by his wife's Chihuahua.\\"  Overall, this album features a highly-disturbing lyric--yet the listern comes away with a sense of awe, even hope.  Maybe it is a musical hope--hope that other artists will take a lesson or two from the Tom Waits handbook, and learn the value of being unique.  Tom Waits certain has.
B0000VD04M|5.0|What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be - Much better than I expected, and I expected a lot.<br /><br />Presenting the Ed Wood story in glorious black-and-white certainly gives it a more authentic feel, but even more than that, Johnny Depp's performance as Mr. Edward D. Wood Jr. is top-notch.  As I watched the film, I really felt I could understand the humanity behind the most infamous low-budget, five-day-shooting-schedule pieces of cinematic flop to ever grace God's green Earth.<br /><br />You see, when I first saw an Ed Wood directed movie, I thought, \\"My gosh, what idiot is responsible for all this mess on the screen?\\"  But this wonderfully produced Ed Wood biography changed my entire outlook completely.  I now understand why the films Ed Wood made turned out so bad.  He was so motivated to produce the next Citizen Kane that he lost patience, and he didn't put in the necessary effort to refine his presentation to accepted standards.  Instead of classifying Ed as an idiot now, I classify him as a guy who just wanted to do so much in so little time that he was unable to view his films with an objective eye.<br /><br />I don't think there's a more fun way to learn about the making of Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space than watching this historic 1994 picture.  But both Plan 9 and Bride don't have quite the story behind them that the less-popular yet more controversial transvestite-film Glen or Glenda has.  I'm telling you, the man Ed Wood has a very strange history - definitely worth taking a look at - which is the main reason I'd encourage anyone over the age of 18 to see this funny and touching biography of one of the worst writer/producer/directors of all time.
B000002GXS|5.0|The title track is in the vein of early Springsteen, while other tunes pay homage to jazz and blues greats.  Yet THE HEART OF SATURDAY NIGHT stands as pure Tom Waits: a lyrical masterpiece of honesty and true-to-life storytelling.<br /><br />The characters are all down-on-their-luck castaways, as per Waits's usual lineup, but this time there's a self-conscious hope about them.  \\"This'll be the Saturday you're reaching your peak,\\" Waits consoles.  And: \\"I never heard the melody until I needed the song...I never spoke I love you until I cursed you in vain.\\"  There's hope for the present, and hope for the future: \\"I'm leavin' my family, leavin' my friends/My body's at home but my heart's in the wind/And the clouds are like headlines on a new front-page sky/Shiver me timbers, I'm a-sailin' away.\\"  Is is this anxious hopefulness underling these songs that makes HEART a standout, even in Waits's usually-depressing catalogue.  Still...I wouldn't make this the soundtrack at your next wedding.
0689865384|4.0|My daughter received this trilogy for Christmas (along with about 20 other books, can't keep enough for her) and it peeked my interest so I decided to read it. <br /> <br />I found the series so interesting that I read all three books, in the same amount of days.  It is engaging, thought provoking, and will keep the reader wanting more. <br /> <br />The third book was my least favorite.  Compared to the first two, I expected, wanted more.  With that said, it is still a very good book, just not as powerful as the first two.  For me, it didn't give me the same connection with Tally as the other two.  The others books just seemed to have a stronger personal outlook through Tally's eyes than the third. <br /> <br />Again, excellent series and definitely worth the great adventure it will take you on.  So, you are probably wondering where the BUT comes in.  I had just finished reading the series on New Years Eve day.  And yes, I love the SciFi channel and their yearly Twilight Zone marathon....I admit it.  It was this morning while watching it that an episode came on.  The whole premise for the book was laid on in that episode right down to \\"transformations\\", \\"uglies\\", and \\"pretties\\", and even \\"rebellion\\".  For me, it kind of took the \\"originality\\" out of the series.  It was merely just an expansion of ideas put out there by Rod Serling's Twilight Zone.  Imagine my disappointment!   <br /> <br />The trilogy I give 4 stars because it was excellently written, and it expanded on a concept plainly laid out in the Twilight Zone, but I could not give it 5 stars, because it now lacked originality and the series lost its \\"uniqueness\\" and isn't that what this series is truly about:  finding your own \\"specialness\\"?
B000002GY9|4.0|Much of Waits's early music could be described as \\"gritty.\\"  This is because it was hard-luck, true-to-life music about people as real as you or I, who just happened to have a narrator to tell the story of their lives.  This is honest music--there aren't always happy endings, the good guys don't always when...and sometimes, there aren't any good guys at all.<br /><br />The X-rated rap \\"Pasties & a G-String\\" is alone worth the price of admission, but there are other songs that stand among the best in Waits's extensive catalogue: namely, the beautiful \\"Tom Traubert's Blues,\\" and the witty \\"The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)\\".  These three songs hold up the rest of the album.  Not that anything on here is bad--good heavens, no.  It's all worth listening to repeatedly.  I would listen to it in small doses, though--sometimes, that's the best way to take the truth.
0345475674|3.0|Robert Harris's \\"Imperium\\" is one of the finest historical fiction novels that I have ever read.  So it was with some anticipation that I picked his his earlier novel, \\"Pompeii\\".  This novel had all the ingredients to be successful.  The destruction of Pompeii, details on the Roman system of aqueducts and the presence of Pliny the Elder.  Who could ask for more? <br /> <br />But in the end, I was reminded of Tony Curtis' performance in the movie Spartacus.  You could put Curtis in a Roman toga and give him leather sandals but in the end it was the Bronx born Tony Curtis speaking his lines on the screen.  This novel has all the superficial trappings of good historical fiction but in the end, there was a contemporary sensibility that ruined this book.  It is as though modern characters were taken back two thousand years and inhabit the bodies of ancient Romans.  Not recommended.
B000002GWJ|4.0|On first listen (as with many Waits records), BLUE VALENTINE comes off as overly complicated, a mixture of various instruments and lyrics telling rather depressing stories, including the one about a prostitute begging a former lover for money, or the one about a crippled boy's dreams, or the one about a girl lost in the big city who gets taken advantage of.  All of it told in that menacing growl, a voice that seems to demand that you NOT listen to these stories, that they are real and thus too disturbing for you.<br /><br />But that's just the point: the songs on this album ARE disturbing at times--but at the same time, there's poetic irony and satire that almost makes you laugh.  Romeo may be bleeding, \\"but not so's you'd notice.\\"  And good ol' Santa Claus is \\"drunk in the ski room.\\"  There's also some vague, hesitant tenderness: \\"Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve/You'll be a woman when I catch you/As you fall in love with me.\\"  Waits's cast of characters is, as always, dragged from the trenches of real life, and their stories unfold as would yours or mine, if we happened to find ourselves in their situations.  Hopefully, we'd have someone as talented as Waits to tell our tales.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Buy it and give it out, great movie, showing the urgency of the situation and laying the basis for hope.
B000001FSR|5.0|FRANK'S WILD YEARS (title taken from a SWORDFISHTROMBONES tune) is a record of sound.  No kiddin' Sherlock, you say; it's a music record.  Please note, I didn't say it was a record of \\"music.\\"  I mean, yes, this is a musical record--but the emphasis, as with it's two predecessors SWORDFISHTROMBONES and RAIN DOGS, it upon sonic diversity.<br /><br />I guess WILD YEARS is a polka record.  It does tell the story of a young accordian player from the butt-end of nowhere (\\"Rainville.  Hardly ever did, though.  Rain, that is.  It was nowhere.\\") bent on making the big time (\\"I'm goin' straight up to the top, oh yeah, up where the air is fresh and clean\\").  He hits a lot of potholes along the way (\\"It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight\\"), eventually crashing and burning (\\"It was a train that took me away from here/But a train can't bring me home\\").  And we are just listeners along for the ride, reveling in Waits's ever-expanding experimentation with what all he can do with a few instruments, some lyrics, and his haunting, gravelly voice.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|This isn't ever going to be worthy of repeated plays like the original albums, but as a stunt it's very good. This is actually an extension of what George Martin did when he mixed the stereo versions of the later lps without the Beatles in the studio - he made choices that differ in some cases so much from the mono versions that the Beatles handcrafted themselves that it amounts to interference with their intentions (listen to the mono \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" and you'll be as struck as they were themselves hearing them years later). There is no complete mono \\"Abbey\\" or \\"Let It Be\\", but every other album the mono is decisively superior.  <br /> <br />The really exciting thing about this release is hearing some demos and backing tracks (and everything) in perfect sound (though cut to ribbons and blended) - no doubt and hopefully preparing the way for a remaster series. Ideal would be stereo versions that restore the artistic choices the Beatles themselves made on the mono versions; but as this is unlikely hopefully they will issue both the mono and stereo. <br /> <br />The one thing Martin added that was great by the way - Ringo's \\"I've got blisters on my fingers\\" at the end of \\"Helter Skelter\\". It's not on the mono. Almost everything else however...maybe \\"Love\\" got it out of his system once and for all. <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen took a hiatus from her band No Doubt to record a solo album in the style that she wanted to.  The album, LOVE, ANGEL, MUSIC, BABY became one of the best selling albums of 2004 (it went triple platinum) and ended up being a breakout hit.  The album had six singles released from it all charting the pop charts including \\"What You Waiting For\\" (#47), \\"Rich Girl\\" featuring Eve(#7), \\"Hollaback Girl\\" (#1), \\"Cool\\" (#13), \\"Luxurious (#21), and \\"Crash\\" (#49).  It is a rare feat to have six singles from one album and all of them make some dent into the Billboard Hot 100.  With six great singles you would expect Stefani to have hit harder than her sophomore effort THE SWEET ESCAPE does.  Sure, THE SWEET ESCAPE is good for a couple of more hit singles, particularly the odd but catchy \\"Wind It Up\\", but THE SWEET ESCAPE is missing something that LOVE, ANGEL, MUSIC, BABY had that made it more than just an \\"all over the place\\" pop album.  To Gwen's credit, to follow up such a scattered, yet great pop record like her debut, it is an arduous task, but you can't help but feel that some of THE SWEET ESCAPE is more like the leftovers of what wasn't put on LOVE, ANGEL, MUSIC, BABY.<br /><br />The album opens up oddly but strongly with crazy SOUND OF MUSIC sampling single \\"Wind It Up\\", another production masterpiece by production duo The Neptunes. No one can deny the talent behind the duo (\\"Drop It Like Its Hot\\" and \\"Hollaback Girl\\" both were #1 hits), but occasionally their idiosyncratic productions are a bit over the top.  \\"Wind It Up\\" is on the brink of this, but it is so incredibly dumb and catchy that it turns out to endear the audience rather than alienate them.  The true show stealer is by our favorite \\"konvict\\" Akon who produces and guests on the exceptional title track, which would've been well recieved on LOVE, ANGEL, MUSIC, BABY.  It feels a more genuine track than even first single \\"Wind It Up\\", and should prove to do pretty well on the charts.  While Akon's performance is minimal, it is just enough to be a tasteful enhancement of the great track that has an inherent R&B/ dance-pop feel.<br /><br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" doesn't quite live up to either \\"Wind It Up\\" or \\"The Sweet Escape\\" but it is a solid track.  Also, the attitude that Stefani has sells the song, despite the fact that it is kind of silly. Gwen sings so intently:  \\"I'm just an orange county girl\\" and even more surprisingly drops the \\"f\\" bomb.  You get the feeling maybe she is trying a bit too hard. \\"Early Winter\\" is the \\"Cool\\" of this album, though it isn't as strong. The production is vintage 80s and the track itself would make for a nice single beyond the songstress's normally overwrought singles. Though it is an enjoyable track in every facet, it isn't as enjoyable as the proceeding, manic \\"Now That You Got It\\" produced by master \\"rap\\" producer Swizz Beatz. \\"Now That You Got It\\" is another \\"manic\\", non-sensical song that really is nothing more than a novelty song.  You think about it and it is a song that most likely will never be performed again by another artist or anyone else in the future. However, it is a track that makes you bob your head and shake your head as you listen to it and just maybe that is the true purpose of novelty songs.<br /><br />\\"4 In The Morning\\" is another song that channels the greatness of the 1980s. It is the second \\"Cool\\" of THE SWEET ESCAPE, and it might just be a bit better than \\"Early Winter\\".  It does help to balance out the novelty tracks, though neither \\"4 In The Morning\\" or \\"Early Winter\\" prove to be as fun as the manic \\"Wind It Up\\", the danceable \\"Sweet Escape\\", or the incredibly silly \\"Now That You Got It\\".<br /><br />\\"Yummy\\" is another Neptunes production with the \\"skeletal\\" drums and a few occasional synth lines lacing the production. It isn't terrible, but it is a bit of an annoying number more than anything else.  \\"Flourescent\\" proves to be a strong enough track, again playing into Gwen's 80's sound tendencies. It doesn't stun by any means, but it is minimally average. \\"Brakin' Up\\" features more whacky production by The Neptunes.  While the Neptunes are always a great addition to any album, it seems as of late they have lost some of their \\"oomph\\" as top notch producers--\\"Anything\\" on Jay-Z's KINGDOM COME didn't stand out among the rest abd \\"Green Light\\" off Beyonce's B'DAY was so-so.  They're still great, but again on Gwen's second album it makes you wonder if the Neptunes should've just let \\"Hollaback Girl's\\" greatness stand along without trying to do more.<br /><br />\\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" is definitely another production experiment, only Tony Kanal is responsible for this one.  It is just as corny as anything else of The Sweet Escape, and Gwen's rapping may be just a bit over the top. What truly makes this track the joke that it is is the use of the circus theme/melody and using it to say:  \\"don't get it twisted/ don't get clever/ this is the most craziest s**t ever\\".  Travesty? yes! However, you hate it so much that you find yourself singing it and it drives you crazy. \\"U Started It\\" proves to be another Neptunes endeavor, though this one is more tame than any of the others featured on this album.  The background vocals used are great hear and the chorus is rather catchy without being overly-crazy. The closure \\"Wonderful Life\\" is produced by Nellee Hooper and proves to be a dance-club track.  It is average and by the time you reach it you are glad you are at the conclusion of the album.<br /><br />Overall, Gwen failed to best or even stay consistent with the greatness of LOVE, ANGEL, MUSIC, BABY, but THE SWEET ESCAPE does have its strong moments. Unfortunately, the main problem with THE SWEET ESCAPE is the fact that there is too much to asorb; it's all over the place. 3 stars.doesn't stun by any means, but it is minimally average. \\"Brakin' Up\\" features more whacky production by The Neptunes.

0618680004|5.0|There are two main points in this book: <br /> <br />1. The case that can be made for the existence of a conscious, intelligent being who made the universe, is aware of our thoughts and feelings, and at least occasionally intervenes in our daily lives in a tangible way is so weak that it merits no more respect that a belief in the existence of elves. <br /> <br />2. That the harm done by people who think they are acting as agents of a supernatural being on the whole greatly outweighs whatever good they might do. The harm is considerable: severe restrictions on promising medical research and the reproductive rights of women, the routine degradation and abuse of girls and women in faith-based societies, physical attacks on gay people, not to mention faith-based terrorism and hot wars all over the  planet. It was young men high on God, not atheists, who flew those planes on 9/11, and President Bush is reported to have told people in private that God told him to invade Iraq. It is Dawkins's assessment that the damage done by all this is so enormous that it outweighs the good that people of faith sometimes do as a consequence of their beliefs. <br /> <br />Dawkins makes his case in a careful, articulate tone. Despite what you may have heard, he is never shrill, and although sometimes his frustration that people continue to believe preposterous things and to act on them with terrible consequences for flesh-and-blood human beings comes through, he is hardly the \\"fundamentalist\\" atheist you find in media coverage.  <br /> <br />What I find interesting is that attacks on Dawkins, here in reviews and in much of the media, are rarely honest criticisms of his ideas. Most of the hostile reviews here contain statements that make it obvious that the reviewer either has not read his book or did not comprehend it if he/she did.  <br /> <br />I was a white child in America's Southern Bible belt. Attacks on Dr Martin Luther King, Jr were rarely attacks on the case he was trying to make:  black people ought to have access to polling stations, decent schools and housing, job opportunities, and a color-blind justice system. Middle-class white people, even in the segregationist South, couldn't find a way to argue against any of that that didn't make them sound exactly like the illiterate red-necks in white sheets they looked down on.   <br /> <br />So they found it easier to simply demonize Dr King. They claimed he was a drunk or a Communist working as a Soviet agent and trying to destroy America from within or some such nonsense. Satan -- this was the Bible Belt after all --  usually made a guest appearance, too. <br /> <br />It is far easier, and requires a lot less mental effort, to either create a straw man version of your adversary's views or to simply dismiss what he has to say because he is simply evil.  <br /> <br />If you disagree with Dawkins, fine. But at least take the trouble to understand his arguments before you attack his conclusions -- or him.

B000HCO83G|3.0|'X-men,' I thought reading reviews, would be like a high-tech sci-fi \\"Calvin Ball\\".  That is I thought the evolution of the movie's rules and causality would change by whim.  Instead, we get a \\"rock/ paper/ scissors\\" approach.  Each superhero has their own connecting powers, like one has fire and another has ice.  In this installment, the mutants find there is a cure for their powers, which some make into a crusade, others a curse.  There is a societal divide; one that breaks out with signs and protestors, but, unfortunately, like real life, it is too often resolved with violence.  (Will this be the fate of stem cell research, and was this something they had in mind for the movie's theme?)  Anyway, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Phoenix (Famke Jensen) have a consequential love affair that has global--or at least environmental--consequences.  The visual effects throughout are stunning and Storm (played skillfully by Halle Berry) and others give us capable performances for the plot's urgency.  Stately figures like Magneto (Ian McKlellen) and Sir Henry (Kelsey Grammer) give some weightiness to the story's edge.  Interesting and eye-popping, 'X-Men- The Last Stand' is impressive--even for a \\"newbie\\" like me.  Storm leaves us with words to live by at slain Professor X's funeral, \\"We live in an age of darkness--a world full of hate, fear, and intolerance. In every age there are those who try to fight it.\\" In 'X-Men- The Last Stand' they do it in style.
0060516402|3.0|Simply put, this is good but not nearly as impactful as \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|Woah!  The remastering here is simply some of the best I've heard EVER!  The improvements are striking!!!  You would not believe that some of these recordings are a good 20+ years old!  Finally, someone gets those Survivor songs right!  Previous \\"best of\\" releases by both Volcano/BMG Heritage ('Ultimate Survivor', 2004) and Sony BMG ('The Best Of', 2006) have left me wanting more from \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\" and \\"Burning Heart\\".  While these recent masters have improved over the original releases on CD, the mastering jobs still have left these songs sounding rather flat with little depth and punch.  They had more potential.<br /><br />Thanks to the wonderful mastering courtesy of Capitol Records, the sound on these songs on this release is AMAZING!  Listen to those opening guitar riffs in \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\", and you won't believe that this song was released in 1982.  It's the best I've heard these songs sound ever!  Thank you to Capitol for yet again another brilliant upgrade.<br /><br />Then we have \\"Hearts On Fire\\" by John Cafferty.  I would have never guessed that this recording is 20 years old by playing this CD.  It's as punchy and clean as any recording from 2006.  The song rumbles and shakes with it's kicking drums and underlying bass.  Again, I cannot stress how amazing this sounds!  It's like a wall of sound coming at you!  I never imagined that it could be this great!<br /><br />The late James Brown features with his 1986 hit, \\"Living In America\\", which benefits wonderfully from the sonic upgrade.  The underlying bass line has never been more present.  Again, the recording is crisp and full.  In fact, the music on the entire disc has never sounded better than on this release.  I'm still puzzled as to how these tracks were tweaked so well.  I highly recommend this disc for anyone looking for sound that goes leaps beyond any previous releases and for music that shines in a whole new dimension.
0060930187|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite novels of all time. I could honestly reread it over and over (and I have) and never get bored. It's written to believably, so hauntingly true, that it leaves you thinking maybe Miss Plath came in, stole your diary, and published it. I hate to spoil anything, but I will say anyone who is a perfectionist MUST READ THIS!
6305627401|5.0|When this movie went in theatres I actually didn't see it because a friend of mine said it was just a bad musical and not as good as the show. When I saw the movie on dvd, I thought it was brilliant though and hilarious and have idea why any fan wouldn't love it. Critics surprisingly did as well. Well eventhough I think Roger Ebert is the only person who actually only gave it **1/2. The movie was even nominated for best song \\"Blame Canada\\" which Robin Williams sang at the oscars.<br /><br />  Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny see a Canadian movie with tons of curses. When they repeat everything from the movie their parents go nuts, especially Kyle's mom. She wants to start a war with Canana and have the 2 stars from the movie executed. When their blood spills Satin and his lover....Sadam will rise and take over mankind. It's up to the late Kenny \\"who died lighting a fart on fire\\" to warn his friends of what will happen.<br /><br />  The movie is full of clever jokes, funny songs and the usual great South Park dark humor. I have no idea why Trey Parker and Matt Stone haven't made a second film yet. I mean it's been 7 1/2 years since this film came out. I'd love to see a new film with their newer characters like Timmeh, Jimmy and Butters. Plus they can now have Bin-Laden as Satin's new gay lover lol. I'm sure they could have fun with Bush as well eventhough he is an easy target. Although they did get some kicks on him alreday with their short lived series \\"That's My Bush\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first heard of the series after I saw the Movie. I must admit that the Movie left me wanting more, and a colleague at work told me about Firefly, I have recently purchased the movie and the series, and loved it. It's a shame that they have not created more seasons as I would definatley watch the series on a regular basis, not to mention purchasing the DVD's  <br /> <br />Will Firefly ever be redeemed I wonder..../ But then sometimes miracles can happen. <br /> <br />I highly reccommend this series
1401302378|4.0|I feel that the premise of this book, that market fragmentation is becoming profitable (due in part to new technology like the internet), is a rather obvious one.  I've had the same thought (poorly articulated compared to Chris Anderson's book) in response to the growing number of channels on my local cable television, the decline in specific consumer targeting in mainstream movies, an increase in prominence of so called \\"indie rock,\\" and even fragmentation of brands in the industry I work in (beer) and others.  I liked this book very much, but the appeal of this book is not in the profundity of the theory, but in the readability and pertinence of the examples Mr. Anderson utilizes.<br /><br />The background he provides, from market studies and interviews with leading executives, provides a great and topical read.  His ideas are well articulated and entertaining.  For me, this book was reminiscent of Freakonomics or The Tipping Point.  I found the writing engaging and the examples quite entertaining.<br /><br />As an aside, I also felt quite fortunate to be walked through some of the \\"best of the internet\\" by a true insider.  Some of the websites and services Mr. Anderson utilizes in reinforcing his theory are wonderful, and new to me.  Bloglines, Launchcast, and others are great additions to my on-line life.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I can't say Donner's version is better, but that's only because I've been brainwashed by the Richard Lester version that I viewed countless times since its original release.  One thing's for sure, the film lends clarity to why the crystal containing the supervillains is so near the Earth. It also shows that Lois Lane is no dumb brunette, and that I & II are really the same movie since little time has passed since Lex's attempted land grab and the release of the supervillains.   <br /> <br />The movie also shows that the real reason Kal-El must give up his powers is that in order to live the life of a mortal he has to BE a mortal and not because a Kryptonian and an Earthling can't be together.  He must relinquish his position of savior, the reason his Father sent him to Earth. Remember he tells Kal-El \\"they're a great people.... they just need someone to show them the way.\\"   <br /> <br />Donner is definitely correct (in talking about Brando's missing scenes), reasoning that Suzannah York would answer Kal-El's question of love just doesn't work.  The Fortress of Solitude was for Father and Son to find the answers together.  After all, the son becomes the father and the father becomes the son. Yet, there are some touching scenes Lester filmed that are lost in this version.  <br /> <br />The final contact between Jor-El and Kal-El is at once touching and sad knowing that Jor-El's words become prophetic.  Thank God Brando's scenes weren't lost.  The one negative is that the Bully scene in the finale doesn't work well because it seems as though time travel would have eliminated the event, a slimmer cut of this scene might have worked better. Thank God they still had William's music score too.
B0002S947K|5.0|I haven't heard anything this rich in about 10 years [since Martin Sexton].  Sounds like?  Richie Havens on acoustic guitar meets Ben Harper [for soul] and Elton John [for gospel], but with a lighter touch and extremely deft textures of guitars, keyboards, and even some horns.  Great rhythms, both mellow and dance-able.  Ray's vocals are thick and mellow, warm and full of soul.  The man has a very deceptively gentle touch on the surface, but the power of the music and lyrics get right to the heart.  Could have been made circa 1971, feels like that era.  Good from start to finish, the whole damn thing is mesmerizing.
B000002L7V|3.0|I think everyone across the board would agree that \\"Holy Diver\\" was a masterpiece from beginning to end. Yet, if cracks were starting to show on \\"Last in Line\\" it could be argued that it had fallen apart on \\"Sacred Heart\\". It's not that its that bad of a record, its just that it doesn't possess the intensity of his previous works. <br /> <br />With the exception of a few tracks, i.e. \\"King of Rock n' Roll\\" and \\"Another Lie\\", Dio is not singing with the same intensity that grabs you in songs like \\"Holy Diver\\" and \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\". Rather, most of his efforts are pretty bland and it is really a waste for a singer of his caliber. Other problems also dominate the record--Vivian Campbells play-by-number approach on the record, mediocre songs that go on too long without any really catchy melody, and boring lyrics. <br /> <br />Despite these weaknesses I think you should give it a chance. \\"King of Rock n' Roll\\" is an intense rocker and \\"Another Lie\\" is Dio at his finest. There is even a suprise in \\"Rock n' Roll Children\\" with its haunting keyboards to accentuate the melody. Although Dio didn't truly use this technique to great effect on this record, the experiment started here was definitely perfected on \\"Dream Evil\\". Besides that, most of the other songs on here like \\"Shoot Shoot\\" are just plain filler that aren't worth the price of the album.   <br /> <br />It is clear on this record that both Vivian and Dio had run out of creative steam and it was time to move on. Luckily the marriage ended here and Craig Goldie would come along to give Dio a serious shot in the arm on the follow up \\"Dream Evil\\". If you want to purchase another good Dio record I would advise getting that one and listening to this record once to see which songs are worth downloading. <br /> <br />
0743298020|5.0|I had high hopes for this novel, after reading several reviews.  But they weren't quite high enough!  This story surpassed all my expectations, and I was very sorry to reach the last page. I never wanted it to end, and found myself trying to slow my pace of reading, in order to make it last longer.  I even made myself take breaks and leave the house.  I just can't let go!  These characters will stay with me for some time.<br /><br />If you truly love books - the smell, the feel, the stiffness of a new spine, or the limberness of an old classic - you will find a new love here.  Diane Settlefield:  please write your next one as quick as possible!  I am ready and waiting!!!
0345409671|5.0|Now, I'm a huge fan of anything Anne Rice (minus the romantic novels) but the Vampire Chronicles are my favorite. I love how she thrusts us into this world and makes us fall in love with Louis and Claudia in book one while at the same time despising Lestat. In book two she does a 180 and we instantly love Lestat and hate Louis for how weak he is and how pathetic. We loathe Claudia for how manipulative she can be. Lestat becomes our god (of sorts) our Brat Prince.<br /><br />Well the Brat Prince is about the meet the Prince of princes. The Dealer of Darkness, Satan himself is recruiting and Lestat seems the perfect cantidate. Memnoch follows Lestat and reels him in.<br /><br />Now in a world of spirits where time is no big thing, Lestat must decide whether or not to accept the Devils offer. Here we fall in loove with lestat again. We sympathise with the Devil. We hear his story. We chase after the unexplained. And good and evil is confronted....and Lestat is privy to it all.<br /><br />Great read. Never before has Anne Rice so entrapped her audience in her world. This might make you reconsider your own beliefs if they're not solidly founded.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Ok, I skipped the broadway show (even though I was offered tickets--twice) and I held off seeing this till it came out on DVD. I'm now sorry I waited, despite knowing the general story I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. The songs were upbeat and not too long (in general I dislike musicals) and the story was very well put together and the acting exceptional, in my opinion. Friends trying to figure out their lives and accept each other, warts and all, find that shared experience and hardship can form a bond akin to family. While the premise of low-rent was central to the story, anyone who lives in new york knows that the apartments these struggling artist have in the movie are ridiculous. That aside, it was stylized a bit much, but that seems to be usual with musicals. This movie was so watchable it was almost mesmerizing, and even a bit touching at times. If you like musicals, stories about artists, believe in bohemian ideals, see the world as us against them, or even just enjoy a good story of \\"we're all just people\\", you will probably enjoy this movie. If it's not your usual cup of tea, give it a shot anyway, I did and am glad.
0385495323|4.0|The book delivers on the promise inherent in its title. Dr. Singh traces cryptography from Ceaser's time (the Ceaser Cipher) to what lies in the future of this science: Quantum Cryptography. The material is presented in an engaging manner, and mathematical terms, when used, are first explained for the layman. To me, this was a very interesting read. For instance, I knew that the folks at Bletchley Park -- Turing, et al. -- were instrumental in cracking the Enigma, Germany's substitution and transposition cipher machine. However, I was not aware that they built upon the work of the Polish Biuro Szyfrow, especially one Martin Rejewski in particular (unexplicably, when Churchill formed Bletchley Park, Rejewski was absent from it.) Those practicing in the field of cryptography and security, will be absolutely fascinated with the chapters involving the breakthrough on public key cryptography by Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle. Their discovery had to wait until Rivest, Shamir and Adleman could come up with the RSA algorithm for factoring large primes to make public key cryptography feasible. Phil Zimmermann's aggregation of public key cryptography and RSA into PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is also detailed, as is his struggle against the FBI, NSA, and the RSA corporation. Other rich details in the book include the use of the an American Indian dialect of Navajo to perform ciphering that proved to be unbreakable during WW II (this particular use of Navajo was also made into a movie starring Nicholas Cage -- Windtalkers.) I would recommend this book for anyone that has an interest in cryptography; it is eminently readable.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Jonny Depp is so off base on this one...LOL.. It is hard to believe it is the same man that plays Captian Jack so well.  Weird like the original, but isn't scary and creepy like that one. <br />My son LOVES it and likes to try to do the Ompa dance
B000J103YI|5.0|I just had to purchase the soundtrack after seeing the movie.  Jennifer's voice brought tears to my eyes and goosebumps all over my body!!!   For those of you have not yet seen the movie or purchased the CD please do so and I promise you will not be disappointed.

1594200823|2.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long book with the relevant content of an essay.  After wringing as much as possible from the topic, Michael Pollan adds dozens of pages on his personal experience with a meal.  This violates a time-honored elementary school writing lesson: Don't write about yourself because no one cares.  Read The Botany of Desire and skip this sequel.
B00005JNX0|4.0|This was good, but I thought it was gonna be better.. seems kinds short also...
B00005JKJA|5.0|(4.5/5 stars)  Even though I find David Lynch's work stylish, bizarre and enjoyable, I have never really found it to reveal considerable intelligence. Much of it (\\"Twin Peaks,\\" \\"Blue Velvet,\\" \\"Wild At Heart\\") appears to be a drug-induced, post-modern façade, behind which very little substance is hidden. It is usually entertaining for a while, but it ultimately grows tiresome. Then he writes and directs \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" which shocks me with its complexity. Here he marries his penchant for peculiarity with a serious plot, and the result is a film replete with twists, turns and enough suspense to hold anyone's interest. Given enough time, plenty of people could write a similarly interwoven tale, yet the brilliance of this film is that Lynch is able to incorporate his inimitable panache that belies its intricacies. He was very deserving of all the accolades he reaped as a result of this film. Discussion of the plot is best reserved for those who have seen the film, so it would be remiss of me to reveal any of it here. I just hope it is not too much to say that Naomi Watts does an outstanding job playing the distinctly different characters involved; her performance during the audition really had me riveted. It is great to see the great Ann Miller back on the screen again too, and look for composer Angelo Badalamenti spitting out espresso in a bit part as well.
B00005JNQS|3.0|I wasn't that thrilled w/ it but the kids seemed to like it... The best part was Robin Williams and Amanda Bynes
B0002EXH5E|4.0|I get so tired of seeing this album torn to shreds when it gets mentioned in reviews for other Megadeth works so I'm going to give it the support it deserves here.  No, this album is NOT 'Rust in Peace' or 'Youthanasia.'  But Dave wisely chose to title it 'Risk' for being the sort of album it was.  Having listened to both 'Risk' and its predecessor 'Cryptic Writings' many times over the past several years, I find 'Risk' to be better than 'Cryptic Writings' by a long shot.  For one thing, it goes back to many of the larger political/life issues Megadeth is famous for rather than the more personal issues approached in C.W.  BREADLINE is an amazing song, albeit not really metal, and it definitely fills an important niche in Dave's career of bringing to light problems society likes to ignore.  And I'LL BE THERE is perhaps my favorite \\"love\\" song in all of metal.  It's intense and definitely not too slow.  And when the speed kicks in at the changeover from TIME: THE BEGINNING to TIME: THE END, whew!  This is an album that has to grow on the listener.  It's not as immediately recognizable as Megadeth from the instrumentation - although I really like some of the vocal tricks Dave tried with his voice on this.  But it's not a bad album, either, and given time, the majority of the tracks really grow on the listener. <br /> <br />Note: If you are REALLY into Thrash/Speed and don't care about anything else, you still won't like this album.  But if you like decent metal with intelligible and intelligent lyrics, give 'Risk' a shot.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|My kids LOVE Trains and we have the book.  They love it and watch it all year long.  The love when the train is on the ice.  Great animation.
B00005JMEW|1.0|After watching about 25 minutes of this movie, I'd had enough and asked my friend to please stop the DVD. I felt like I was going to vomit, my reaction was so visceral to the goings on. <br /> <br />There is something deeply disturbed in the minds of the people who created this; it's not even the overblown violence that's most disturbing here but the total lack of morality of any of the characters. Violence is met with violence. In the first 25 minutes, you get to see (SPOILER WARNING): <br /> <br />- a pregnant woman shot in the head at close range <br />- a four-year-old girl witness her mother's death by knife <br />- a coma victim (pimped out by a hospital orderly) nearly raped <br /> <br />I can't believe people want to watch this stuff in their precious leisure time!  <br /> <br />I also detect a contempt for America in this film. That is, the trappings of American life (e.g., the house in the 'burbs, a yellow school bus dropping a child off at home) are just a veneer and just below the surface we're all itching to get our ya-yas out on each other via martial arts training. <br /> <br />Finally, I find it interesting that Mel Gibson is taken to task for his ultra-violent films (none of which I've seen - he's no friend of mine), yet Mr. Tarrantino gets a pass! \\"Well, it's stylized violence\\" Yeah? Not so stylized that this reviewer can walk away from it without disturbing images haunting me for who knows how long. <br /> <br />
B0000C9JFO|4.0|I loved this movie... it captures the essence of what it's like to live abroad and what it's like to move back home.  It shows all the changes a student goes through when leaving all the comforts of home.  Audrey Tautou's role is quite small though so don't buy it just to see her- or you'll be disappointed.  Still a great film though!
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|I love Porcupine Tree. I find their music stimulating and unique. I own quite a bit of their stuff. This album is very interesting and it gets four stars for creativity and some nice guitar work.<br /><br />Having said that, unless you are a rabid collector of PT works, you may want to purchase the Stars Die compilation as the 12 minute mix on it is more or less the highlight of this album (the mix on Stars Die is a modified version of Voyage 1). I often find myself admiring the Stars Die mix, but I will rarely stick this entire cd in my stereo. However, if you want to purchase it to support the band (lord knows that too many horrible \\"artists\\" are supported these days), you can't go wrong either, as this cd can be obtained for a reasonable price.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Like almost everyone else, I was introduced to Damien Rice by the movie Closer and I felt like the soundtrack made the movie.  I listen to this album a lot in shuffle with David Gray, John Mayer, and Jack Johnson, and think he fits in well with this group of real singer/songwriters.  I look forward to getting all of his future albums as they come out.

0618680004|5.0|It's about time someone said it: belief in god is delusional.  It's as delusional as believing in the Easter Bunny.   In a world gone nuts with religious accommodation it's refreshing to hear Dawkins' reasoned voice reminding us that religion deserves no special place in our thinking, and should be subjected to the same rational and skeptical examination as any other hypothesis.   We don't swallow stories about Santa Claus, hook, line, and sinker, and our gods shouldn't be any different. <br /> <br />I've always enjoyed reading books by Richard Dawkins.  He's one of the most lucid, intelligent writers of the century, able to convey difficult concepts in an intuitively pleasant and understandable style.  Never one to muddy the water with uncertainty where there's little doubt, Dawkins is an out-spoken atheist who believes religion is not only intellectually indefensible, but often morally reprehensible.  I applaud Dawkins for writing this book.  As he points out, we live in a world that affords all sorts of special privileges to \\"faith,\\" as if calling it \\"faith\\" justifies suspension of critical thinking.  <br /> <br />One of Dawkins' more controversial arguments is that religious indoctrination amounts to child abuse.  In his ethical framework it's just wrong to cut off a child's questioning intellect, and/or terrorize them with stories of hateful gods that condemn questioning minds to endless hell.   He'd also propose (I think) state interference to protect children from the ignorance and superstition of their parents.  It's a radical idea, or is it? <br /> <br />Dawkins heaps particular (and well-deserved) scorn on \\"liberal\\" religious thinkers like Gould who, although they don't accept the Bible literally, provide the framework for giving fundamentalism public acceptance and respect.  Although I enjoy Gould's scientific writing I find his views on religion to be poorly thought out.  Dawkins' point of view is much more in line with my own. <br /> <br />This book could be considered the atheist's handbook, complete with short descriptions and rebuttals of various arguments for god's existence, including those provide by Thomas Aquinas, the ontological argument, and other a priori \\"proofs.\\"  [As an aside, I'd like to nominate the phrase \\"a priori proof\\" as oxymoronic.]  Equally obliterated by Dawkins are various arguments from beauty, testimonials based on personal experience, arguments from scripture, faith based on statements from admired religious scientists and the granddaddy of them all, Pascal's wager. <br /> <br />Although Dawkins writes to an international audience he clearly has America on his mind.  The US is (sadly) the most religious of any western civilization, and we, more than any other civilized western society, are burdened by the god delusion.  This is highly ironic given America's secular birth.  One can only shake one's head in bewilderment at a country that was founded by men like Jefferson but is now led by men and women of superstitious and inferior intellectual capacity.  One of Dawkins' objectives in this book is to put to rest the persistent assertion that America is a Christian nation founded on Biblical Law.  We are nothing of the sort.  We are a secular nation founded on secular law, currently under attack by fanatical fundamentalists bent on re-writing history and turning America into a fundamentalist theocracy.     <br /> <br />Dawkins brilliantly argues that there is almost certainly no god, and ironically he does this by turning the tables on the creationists.  Creationists argue wrongly that evolution can't happen for the same reason that a fully formed 747 doesn't jump out of the junk yard; it's too improbable.  The problem with that argument is that evolution doesn't work by random chance alone.  It also involves selection, and selection isn't random.  If we keep saying that often enough, is there any chance the creationists will finally hear and understand? <br /> <br />Dawkins argues that evolution is the only known process capable of producing a living, thinking, and intelligent being.  Yet evolution cannot produce a god (at least not one that created the universe) since it requires a universe in which to operate. But if god wasn't created by evolution he must exist by pure chance.   However, God is far, far more complex than a 747, so his chance existence must be infinitely less probable than the 747-out-of-a-junkyard that anti-evolutionists argue is too improbable to consider. <br /> <br />Ergo, God probably does not exist. <br /> <br />This is a long book that covers lots of information, and space doesn't allow a complete summary.  Suffice it to say Dawkins covers such disparate subjects as the Darwinian roots of religion while giving a highly readable and informative argument to the effect that religion itself offers little advantage to society, and is, instead, a by-product of a real adaptation (for example, the need for children to believe what they are told).   <br /> <br />While dismissing religion as evolutionarily unnecessary byproduct of something else, Dawkins explores the Darwinian roots of morality, why we are good, and where our sense of good comes from.  He makes the convincing argument that our moral sense has a Darwinian origin, and that we don't need god to explain why people have a sense of good and evil.   <br /> <br />Christianity isn't the only religion in the world, of course, but its deleterious effects cause the most harm in western civilizations like Great Britain and the US.  In discussing the source of morality, Dawkins dissects the Bible, showing that it teaches horrific acts of immoral behavior and that, rather than getting our morality from the Bible, we have actually learned a higher sense of morality that causes us (even most - but not all - fundamentalists) to distance ourselves from the Bible's worst and bloodiest parts.  Then he shows that the New Testament isn't much better. <br /> <br />Many of us hope for a world with no gods or religion.  Perhaps that day will come.  If it does, it will be in part because of men like Dawkins.  Is it too much to ask that every American politician read this book, and every American, too?  Probably, but it's not too much to hope for.
1400082773|3.0|This is a beautiful book.  <br />I wanted to learn more about his life as a law student, how and when he met his wife Michelle, and to see a photo or two of his extended family.  <br />But what really upset me is that Senator Obama puts teachers in the working class. Teachers are NOT in the working class!!!! Not only must they meet increasingly burdensome requirements (as if teachers are the source of every ill in the public school system), but they are required to earn master's degrees just to keep their licenses! And his state, Illinois, has some of the most burdensome requirements for teachers anywhere in the U.S. As an organizer who worked alongside teachers, I am really disappointed to see that he's one of those politicians who degrade teachers.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|If you love Christmas-themed movies and romantic comedies, this offers you the best of both.  Add a star-studded cast, glorious scenery, excellent writing, and you have a real holiday treat.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is at her most vulnerable as the office worker desperately in love with a co-worker who has bedded her for three years yet announces his engagement to another co-worker at the annual Christmas party.  Cameron Diaz, never a favorite of mine, does an excellent job of portraying the wealthy Beverly Hills woman who owns her own production company that delivers all those \\"Coming Attractions\\" for movie publicity.  Alas, her love life is centered on a two-timing hunk.<br /><br />When both women feel they can't take it any more, they find each other through an internet house-swapping site.  Iris (Winslet) swaps her picture-perfect English cottage in the charming village of Surrey for Amanda's (Diaz) ultra-plush Beverly Hills mansion.  Both are enthralled with the change of scenery and adapt in varying degrees to their new situations.  Enter Graham (Jude Law) who unaware his sister Iris has up and gone, romances Amanda though he does hide a very big part of his life from her.  On the American side, Miles (Jack Black, thankfully toned down) a colleague of Amanda's comes looking for her and finds Iris.  Eli Wallach gives a beautiful performance as Iris' befuddled Beverly Hills neighbor and introduces her to Hanukah celebrations.<br /><br />Love is in the air and although no one will be surprised at the happily-ever-after ending, you'll enjoy immensely the thrill of getting there.
0783219695|5.0|Apollo 13 was a classic when it first debuted in 1995. A very well-told and riveting tale of what happened on that ill-fated (in terms of reaching the moon) Apollo mission in April 1970. Excellent performances by Tom Hanks (big surprise there, given his two Oscars), Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who is scrubbed from the mission by a nervous nellie doctor that my good friend met recently, Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert, the astronaut who replaces Mattingly, and Bill Paxton as Fred Haise. Also by Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, the flight director. The story is well known, so I won't belabor it. I will say that it's worth someone checking out if they've not already seen the movie, even if they've heard about it. A different take on the space program from ``The Right Stuff.''
0385335482|5.0|This book had me in stitches laughing throughout the chapters.  It was light, breezy, and hillarious.  The main character is so outlandish, but adorable to the point where you can't help but root for her.  I highly recommend this book if you want something non-thought provoking, easy to read, and quick to read.
0307341542|2.0|While I did like the characters in this book and agree that it was nice to read something that featured a mundane main character, I have to agree that the ending was predictable from the early on(and I mean very early on).  That kinda killed the suspense....that being said though, I did finish it. If you are looking for a quick read for a weekend, then pick this one up.  Just don't expect any unpredictable twists and turns.
0812550706|1.0|First the good and interesting: The whole subplot with Ender's siblings was much better than the rest of the novel, the descriptiona and use of zero gravity, and the use of the ansible was interesting, although deritive (PLEASE read Urusla K. Le Guin novels if your going to read Ender's Game and think the ansible is original). <br /> <br />The rest: This is an aweful book.  Poorly written- there are narrative paragraphs that read right into a charcters personal thoughts or dialogue.   <br /> <br />The Worst:  Why the hell is the bulk of this book spent on kids playing laster tag, when they will eventually be flying ships in battle?  There is no correlation given whatsoever.  The points about leadership and Ender's internal dialogue are very intersting and worthwhile, however this book is terrible.  Terribly written (as noted above) and the rest is way too completly unrealistic in the way that young children speak and react and think.  Also, what the hell is with the semi-kiddie porn - multiple descriptions of Ender and other young children naked and wet and showering - what the hell?  Orsen Scott Card is one of those crazy homophobes, I think he's got some obvious issues there.  However, its great if this book gets people to read, also the people who think that this book has bad language: you people are idiots, please kill yourself as you are so delsional and such a threat to society and human culture that you should not be allowed to live. <br /> <br />-------SPOILERS------------- <br /> <br />Ok this is why this book really sucked for me:  Why and how the hell are they having Ender remote controlling the spacecraft that are fighting the Buggers with real humans at the scene of the battle in real spaceships??  How does this make any sense???  Why aren't ALL the spaceships remote controlled?  Why risk human life at all??  It does not make any sense.  It is so stupid and I am really angry that this won the nebula and hugo (not the first time I've been disappointed bythose award winners) And I am really angry I wasted time on this bad book, I could have been reading a Heinlein novel instead of this stupid bad book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Seeing this play is perhaps the most exciting moment of my life of enjoying live theatre.  We all know the story of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and this is the music that explains why one witch is good while the other is \\"evil\\" (really, she's just a misunderstood animal rights activist).  The songs are just perfect, and there is never a dry eye when Glinda and Elphaba sing \\"For Good\\" which is perfect.  Even if you've not seen the play, you will enjoy this music for sure.
B000003CMD|5.0|Brothers and Sisters is one of the all-time best records!    I've been a fan since the beginning so I know my ABB. The previous reviews seem to be about the album's content which I won't dispute except to add that brother Richard Betts was an integral part of the band and can't be separated from their legacy. He influenced a generation of guitar players and has contributed some of the most amazing guitar solos in recording history. I just want to be clear that while some may have felt he stood somewhat in the shadow of brother Duane, I believe he certainly stands on his own as a great musician, singer and songwriter responsible for many of the Allman Brothers Band's best tunes and most memorable guitar lines.    What I mainly want to comment on here is the Remastered version of Brothers and Sisters. I was sorely disappointed in the sound quality as compared to the record album. Unfortunately, they \\"cleaned it up\\" to the detriment of the music. Here are the specific problems I spotted. The worst offense is the amount of emphasis inflicted on the vocals: it makes brother Gregg's vocal too bright and clean sounding (when he had probably just smoked an entire pack of cigs prior to cutting each track to get some more gravel in his voice as Cat Stevens used to do), and the same vocal-tinkering makes Dickey sound like a 12 year old boy, unlike the LP which is an accurate recording of how their voices sounded.    The other problems I have with this Remaster is the snare drum and cymbals are also sonically enhanced to the point of causing ear fatigue ... it stresses me out, man! The LP was mellower AND you could hear the tambourine. Also I miss the beautiful rumble of Chuck Leavell's honkytonk piano ... now all sparkly clean (and sounding more like a toy) on this Remaster. Finally, some of the rhythm guitars on this CD Remaster sound a bit Disco for my taste (with that bright top end): the LP guitars were perfect, however. Shocking difference.    Apparently Johnny Sandlin isa darn good record producer and I think he should have been consulted for this Remaster! It reminds me of the poor remastering job done on another great, early '70s album, Relayer, by YES. Like Brothers and Sisters, they turned an album I was used to listening to from the '70s into a '90s-sounding album. Why? You could hear everything fine the way it was ... unless your ears don't work anymore. These great albums are from their time and they should be celebrated as such. This particular era was the best for music in my opinion, it had a particular sound, and there is no disgrace in that whatsoever. Mastering engineers need to learn about preserving \\"the vibe\\" of an album instead of always trying to \\"correct\\" things that don't need correcting! \\"Flat\\" sound always gives the proper balance, unless the whole point of the reissue is to put a different spin on the music. Then it should be marketed as such. Maybe the ABB can revisit this mastering process for the digital 24-bit release and create an Ultimate Version before the master tapes completely lose their dynamics. Please consider restoring the album's vibe, guys. It deserves as much.    But for the surface noise, I'm happy with the LP version, though I may still have to track down a pre-Remastered edition of this great album for archival. The casual or new listener may not mind the sonic \\"enhancements\\" offered in the Remastered version, especially if it is bound for a sound-crusher like an iPod, but those who are already familiar with this album might be a bit surprised with the new take on things. I would like to dedicate this review to brother Berry Oakley ... it's wonderful to hear him one last time.    Update: I managed to find a Gold Disc and it sounded righteous. There is no comparison. Too bad they are so hard to find (and so expensive) because that's THE ONE.
B000924MCQ|4.0|Cedric Klapisch's 2002 film L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE (\\"The Spanish Apartment\\") is the story of Xavier (Roman Duris), a French student studying in Barcelona for a year, and his wacky adventures with his international flatmates. As this reviewer himself has lived in similar international settings from the last several years, including a stint with a couple of crazy Frenchman in Spain, I found this film a generally authentic and entertaining portrayal of European student exchange life.<br /><br />These young people are brought together by the European Union's ERASMUS programme, which has moved EU students around for university education since the mid-1970s (it's therefore curious that such a film took so long to appear). Beyond its simple story of a young man discovering himself in foreign surroundings, there is also a strong commentary on the benefits -- and risks -- of the movement towards a common European identity. The French title literally means \\"The Spanish Inn\\", but it also has the idiomatic meaning of \\"potluck\\". Each of the residents of Xavier's flat contributes a very different side of Western Europe. Wendy (Kelly Reilly) is from England, Lars from Denmark, Isabelle (Cecile de France) from Belgium, Alessando (Federico D'Anna) from Italy, and Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat) from Germany. The only native Spaniard is Soledad (Cristina Brondo), who gets perhaps less attention than she should have.<br /><br />Generally the film is positive towards European integration. When Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) comes to visit, he embarasses her with his puerile national sterotypes -- e.g. \\"Germans are Nazis\\", \\"Italians are slovenly\\" -- suggesting that those who live in an international milieu are more enlightened. Hints at the dangers of common approaches towards integration arise when some students claim that Catalans should give up their language and speak a larger one just for the sake of European unity. It is notable that all foreigners in the film learn Spanish, never Catalan.<br /><br />Beyond the larger issues of world politics, the film explores the difficulties of maintaining long-distance relationships, as Xavier can't make it work with his Parisian girlfriend Martine. His is also unsure of how to relate with women in this expat world of free love, seducing a married woman entrusted to him to show around the city. Martine's is only a background role in the film, but as she is played by Audrey Tatou, hot on the heels of the hit AMELIE, Tatou featured heavily in the film's publicity.<br /><br />Why four stars? This is a thought-provoking film that I would recommend for anyone interested in the issue of European integration, but it just doesn't feel like any sort of unequivocal masterpiece. One notable problem is the age of the protagonist. Xavier is going to Barcelona for postgraduate studies and is already 24-25 years old at this point. However, his actions and his naivete are that of someone four or so years younger. Some scenes also seem insufficiently linked to the film's themes, as that showed while Xavier's roommate recounts how her flamenco teacher tried to seduce her.<br /><br />The 2005 sequel to the film, LES POUPEES RUSEES (\\"Russian Dolls\\") is better still. In spite of its imperfections, check out L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE as well as the follow-up.never Catalan. <br /> <br />Beyond the larger issues of world politics, the film explores the difficulties of maintaining long-distance relationships, as Xavier can't make it work with his Parisian girlfriend Martine.

0930289528|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is one of the best pieces of work I've read in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal library! This book / movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie and book. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years. The message is clear, \\"People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people!\\"<br /><br />Dr. Matthew J.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Others have given the plot synopsis, so I won't do it here.  I think the best thing about this movie (aside from the amazing cast) is that it shows a side of 19th-century British life we don't usually see, particularly not from Jane Austen, George Eliot, etc.  I really liked that we were able to see both the upper, middle and lower classes interact in \\"North & South\\".  It is set in mid-19th century industrial England, and the main setting is a dirty city (contrasted, of course, to Margaret's beautiful country home from whence she comes) that is a main center for the cotton industry.  We see what these workers lives were like, the horrible conditions they worked in.  (It might just make you appreciate your own boss a little more--at least they can't legally beat you up!)  While Thornton's certainly not as noble as Darcy, I got over my initial dislike of him quickly, and by the time he is staring out the window whispering \\"Look back.  Look back at me.\\", you really can't help but like him.  I think one of the best characters was Mrs. Thornton.  She played the matriarch of her son's empire perfectly--and yet, the motherly side of her shows through just as perfectly.  The music is beautiful, too.  For those concerned with content, there is a scene where one man beats another (some blood is shown) and there is mild swearing.  If you're a fan of period pieces, you have to see this one!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, and I confess that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ended up watching it start to finish after my son went to sleep the day after Christmas.  From the visuals to the soundtrack, an outstanding movie.<br /><br />The storyline revolves around the redemption of a self-absorbed race car as he gets stuck in the town of Radiator Springs.  While serving a community service sentence for speeding, he finds love and happiness amongst a cast of unlikely characters.<br /><br />I'd rank this up there with Toy Story.
0307237699|5.0|Mr. Obama is that rare Progressive with a positive agenda and some novel ideas (rather than a wrecking ball) as the preferred tools to end the mean-spirited stalemate in the American political process. He is excruciatingly honest, level headed and clear-headed, which are not always virtues in American politics.<br /><br />The program outlined in \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is audacious only in its honesty, clarity, and simplicity. It is to make a renewed appeal to the basic values shared by all Americans, and to use this appeal as a kind of \\" reverse patriotic English,\\" or \\"reverse moral wedge\\" that will begin the process of driving us back together rather than continuing to drive us further apart. Obama's hope is that this mid-course correction will at least reverse, if not end, the deadlock and dysfunction in the political process.<br /><br />Obama's \\"audacious hope\\" is that such \\"super patriotic appeals\\" to heed the call to deeper shared American values can be used to forge and reinvigorate virtually non-existent cross-party alliances. The compromises thus forged would serve to detoxify and render functional an otherwise hopelessly deadlocked and a thoroughly dysfunctional, American political process. It is a process that Obama recognizes to be more concerned about the proper spin of rhetoric, the earning of and spending of political capital, political correctness, triangulation, avoiding high negatives, keeping the opposition on the defensive, raising truck loads of unholy money, and getting out the base vote, than about solving a very scary backlog of steadily accumulating national problems.<br /><br /> The Obama hope rests on a thin and illusive premise that a difference does in fact exist between our deeply held and shared values and the narrow political interests that keeps us apart. His theory is that once an enlightened group of the American electorate recognizes that the values that bind us are stronger than those that are driving us apart, then the nation will wake up to the fact that these deeper values are the last hope to bringing us back together, and thus they will willingly join in a larger crusade to end the national division and dysfunction. It is a very interesting but shaky premise to say the least. But it is one that sells well in an election year, and oddly I agree with the author that no matter how shaky it is, we have no choice but to try it. After all, what else is there?<br /><br />Although the Obama tune has the right beat and is played in the right key, especially for a political season, the disconnect that makes his approach seem almost naïve, is a failure to recognize that in the American political process, it is not so much the values themselves that seem to matter, as it is the use to which they are being put and the particular interests they serve. As Obama knows better than most of us, what we find in the American body politic, is that the shared values that lie on the common substrate that he speaks so eloquently of, are the very ones that are being twisted and bent to serve the will of both the legitimate and the illegitimate interests of the various competing groups and subgroups.<br /><br />In fact, it would not be much of an exaggeration to say that it is peculiarly American that, since the founding of the nation itself, most of the national conversation has been, and continues to be about how these much cherished values are interpreted and used, rather than about the moral legitimacy of the claims made against them, and the interests those claims most often serve.<br /><br />No one, including Obama wants to raise the ugly issue of how since the nation's founding, our cherished values have always been, and continue to be, used to defend both morally legitimate and morally illegitimate interests. In every instance, it has been \\"the interests behind our values\\" and \\"not the values per se\\" that has been the hidden subject of our national moral \\"tug of war.\\"<br /><br />Some how as a nation, we must come to admit that some interests are morally illegitimate -- even if deeply held by a majority of the people -- and others are not. Otherwise, how can we continue to pin our hopes (audacious or otherwise) on the pretense that illegitimate and legitimate interests have equal claims on our national values and resources, and then not expect dysfunction and division to be the ultimate corrupting result?<br /><br />It seems that the moral disconnect in the Obama theory is failing to recognize this very point: That while there is indeed a common set of shared American values, it is precisely this set that is being challenged through differential interpretation and used to promote different and usually opposing interests -- some of which are morally legitimate, others of which are morally suspect, and a few at times which are even morally reprehensible. It is these \\"competing interests,\\" rather than their moral legitimacy, that seems to matter most to even the select group of Americans to which his appeal is being made. Failing to recognize that this difference has had, and will continue to have a corrupting effect on the American political process, is not in itself a viable program, but very much another wish-fulfilling mirage.<br /><br />Thus, it is reasonable to ask: Is Obama's plan just more of the same old wine of self-serving and self-fulfilling prophesy in a new bottle? Or is it new wine in the same old bottle? Only the Presidential campaign will tell.<br /><br />Despite this, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is the most honest and the clearest analysis of the contemporary American political scene in this century; the book thus deserves five stars.
0071359168|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone working in an ad agency or a marketing discipline. The fundamental point of the book, positioning is not about the product vs. the competition. Is is what the customers think about the product vs. what they think about the competition.

B000BT97AO|5.0|This is a stunning, gorgeous, mind-blowing movie.<br /><br />It seems criticisms of this movie are stemming from two basic complaints: first, that the story is unoriginal/derivative; and second, that the movie is all visuals, no plot. The first complaint misses the point completely. The whole point of the story is that it is ARCHETYPAL. It deals with fundamental human issues of identity, growth, dark and light, good and evil. To complain that an archetypal story is unoriginal is like complaining that an apple doesn't taste like an orange. To have completely unrelated expectations is to be disappointed.<br /><br />The second complaint is once again an issue of erroneous expectations. A distinction must be made between film as pure entertainment and film as pure art. These two genres sometimes co-exist, of course, and there is a spectrum in between. Yes, this is a visual movie. It is self-consciously a movie intended to display film-making as a visual art, which it first and foremost is. When appreciating a painting, is the central issue the painter's choice of subject matter? No, it is technique, execution, mood, effect. Who decided film is only successful or worthy if the plot entertains us sufficiently? Seems to me that is rather a shallow, provincial and self-absorbed viewpoint.<br /><br />For goodness' sake, leave your expectations and preconceptions at the door and just accept this movie offering at face value. Complaining about what it isn't (and isn't meant to be) is pointless and a waste of everybody's time. Watch it and appreciate it for what it is: a classic, archetypal story beautifully retold in an exemplary display of film-making as a visual art form.
0446677450|4.0|After reading Rich Dad, I haven't become a better investor, I wouldn't know what to do with real estate, and my chances of success in the stock market are about the same as my chances of success in the game of roulette. Yet I found the advice given to me in this book to be invaluable. <br /> <br />I've noticed that many people giving this book a bad review point out that Kiyosaki \\"tells you what to do without telling you how to do it\\". These people are missing the point... Rich Dad isn't a step-by-step how-to book on making money; it's a book about getting into the correct financial mindset. The gist of this book is that traditional methods of making a living (getting a formal education and a secure job) aren't the smartest ways of making money. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also points out the importance of getting a \\"financial education\\", which is very different from the formal educations most of us recieve. As a college student studying engineering and previously indoctrinated with the \\"poor dad\\" mentality, Kiyosaki's advice has had a profound impact on the type of knowledge I will be seeking in the years to come. Again, reading this book hasn't made me a smarter investor, but it has given me a good idea of what I'll have to do in order to become one. I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a good starting point for their financial future.
B00005JPAJ|4.0|I hate to rain on anyone's parade but I found \\"Babel\\" to be over-hyped.  The cast is excellent and the concept intriguing.  Yet, somehow it doesn't quite make it.<br /><br />The essence of the film is that even very small actions can have consequences in other parts of the world.  A Japanese man visiting Morocco on a hunting trip leaves his gun with his guide.  The guide then sells the gun to a goat herder who, in turn, allows his children to carry it to shoot jackals.  The gun, however, is used for another purpose which, ultimately, has consequences in the US and Mexico.<br /><br />The concept is undoubtedly interesting.  Individuals are often unaware of the ultimate consequences of their actions.  The world is truly interconnected.<br /><br />Although the plot is compelling and the acting first rate, the film is not so rewarding.  I suspect that I had the film \\"Crash\\" in mind when I saw \\"Babel\\".  I thus had very high expectations.  \\"Babel\\" is certainly no \\"Crash\\".  Nonetheless, see the film.  It is certainly worth seeing.  Perhaps few films would rate well in comparison with \\"Crash\\".  My expectations were probably set unrealistically high.
B00005NTNU|5.0|Dirty Harry - doesn't discuss his feelings (archetype of the Stoic Warrior) and at the end of the day if you are a scumbag you'll get a 240 grain .44 Magnum bullet in your brain pan. I liked the part in \\"Sudden Impact\\" when his then mistress (Sondra Locke), main squeeze on the film, asks at the end about her rights when she was being raped and brutalized by the pond scum and Harry Calahan lets her go and pinpoints the murders on the main perp in the film that he just killed with his .44 Automag. I would have done the same thing. She was a decent, trusting, naive, girl and the perps in the film raped her, sent her sister into a nuthouse (raped too), and made her life a living hell until such time she exorcised her demons, meaning blowing them away. Justice - frontier style!<br /><br />I like Harry's independent attitude and strength. Relentless, tough and doesn't give a wit about some low-life's \\"rights\\". I especially liked it when he quips back to the politician cops with his trademark contempt. Liberals must shift in their seats when they see these films.<br /><br />Sudden Impact was my favorite with the newly introduced .44 Automag (now reproduced by Wildey firearms) and the restaurant scene when the hoods put a gun to his favorite waitress' head and he says, \\"Go ahead, make my day...\\" with his cold blue eyes and the .44 mag at the perps head. The elevator scene was also priceless.
0393061434|3.0|The book was a pleasant enough diversion of a day or so and allowed me to fondly hark back to the mid 1980's and my Apple II.  But the book suffers from too much repetition, too little information, and a serious lack of editing.  While reading I often paused to wonder if anyone actually did any editing of the manuscript or even read the final product before publication.  Grammatical errors abound, some sentences seem to make absolutely no sense, and then there is the incessant repeating of statements made only a few sentences or paragraphs above (as I just did).  It was, for the most part, a fun book, but I would strongly suggest Mr. Wozniak tweak the source quite a bit before releasing version 2.0.
0743289412|1.0|As a formerly Stephen King fan I can't believe that some people actually gave this giant bore 5 stars. I wasted my money and time to buy and actually read thru this junk. From the made-up words to the disjointed story line, unbelievable characters (another story about a rich suffering writer), and make-believe or real \\"other\\" worlds (didn't we get that many times before from S. King) - this is a disaster! And please, Mr. King, spare us your political views (page 401), who really cares how much you hate the president. <br />This is the last book I will ever buy and/or read from this writer.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I cannot think of a movie in which so many different stories are told at once other then this one.  The father trying to relate to his son the only way he knows how. The son denying what he has inherited from his father.  They finally coming to term with each other and accepting each other.  Loved it, watch it over and over again.
B00005JOCU|5.0|Some great performances animate a beautifully directed musical.  Jamie Foxx perhaps wasn't up to the part, but the part was itself underwritten, to the point that Curtis has to play evil personified, more and more controlling, like James Mason in CAUGHT, and his gradual ownership of Deena is presented with the looming shadows Gregg Toland gave to Orson Welles in CITIZEN KANE.  It's a one dimensional role; at first we get an idea that Curtis is an activist with Marxist ideas on liberating black music by seizing the means of production (\\"We're black owned,\\" he shouts out to rioting Detroit troublemakers, who veer away, appeased), but we later find out he doesn't really care about \\"blackness\\" per se, only his own vision of blackness as something that sells to white people.  At first his redeeming virtue seems to be his love for Deena, later we find out the real reason he focussed on her--a crass one to be sure.  Foxx didn't really have much to play with here, and his only great moments are being the straight man for Jennifer Hudson in her big show stopper (for it's harder to react to every impassioned cry another makes than to be the one acting) and his discovery, at the final curtain, of the real parentage of Magic.  His attraction to Effie at the beginning is never dramatized; we don't know if he loves her, or only enjoys her company sexually, or was it just part of his Machiavellian master plan?  This is a case where we will have to wait for the DVD commentary to let us know what Foxx himself was thinking when making all those smirky faces.<br /><br />In contrast Eddie Murphy just runs away with the whole show.  He plays the part with echoes of his own impersonation of James Brown, and watching James Early collapse on stage, fanned back to life by the Dreamettes, was painfully eerie in the days that followed that real-life death of Brown; but there are more and more Marvin Gaye shadings thrown into the mix, right down to that colorful knitted workingman's cap he wears when CC writes him a \\"political\\" number called \\"Patience\\" (which isn't up to the level of a real Marvin Gaye tune, but it's different enough from the rest of CC's glitz to stand out.  Beyonce is also convincing, except when aging, for you never feel that somehow she's too old to play Cleopatra the way Curtis wants her to.  Loved seeing John Lithgow playing some sort of insider Hollywood Joel Schumacher director, with the fellow from TV's THE OFFICE as his screenwriter boy-toy.<br /><br />But most of all the picture gets handed over to Jennifer Hudson, as the hard luck kid Effie White.  Condon coaches Hudson to a pretty amazing dramatic turn, it's hard to believe she hasn't always been an actress, and only in a few minor scenes does his control slip, and she turns vacant or panicky.  Can she really act?  Hard to say, but she's enormously powerful at times, and her big number is really the knockout everyone says it is.  (Beyonce gets her own big number later on, a more contemporary MOR track called \\"Listen,\\" filmed in one big closeup, couldn't have taken one twentieth of the rehearsal time of \\"Not Going,\\" but it's almost as interesting filmically.)  The movie is designed like a perfectly polished machine to break you down, then I suppose to build you back to a partial reassembly of yourself in Act Two, but something in the machinery crumbles and we never really do get that resolution we've been longing for.<br /><br />Like, all through the movie, CC's been just as venal as Curtis, and all of a sudden he snaps and joins the opposition?

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I read Al Gore's \\"Earth in the Balance: Ecology & the Human Spirit\\" when he was vice president.  It brought environmental issues to the fore that are extremely important.  In this video, I believe he transcends the political issues that he has as a former Democratic presidential nominee and makes a genuine effort to reach beyond the boundaries of our political parties to show that this is a human problem that affects all of us.  Yes, I've read some of the reviews here and heard repeatedly by political foes of the Kyoto accord that remain unconvinced that what the Earth now experiences is merely a routine cycle of heating and cooling.  Quite frankly, this \\"ostrich syndrome\\" is most unfortunate.  This is an issue that members of both parties should care about.  The increase in hurricanes and their fury should give pause to all who live in coastal areas, myself here in eastern North Carolina.  I think that there are SO many things happening on the planet that Gore is persuasive and convincing.  Those not ready to act really cannot see the forest for the trees.<br /><br />In this video, Gore strikes a good balance between education and making a video that's entertaining enough that you can sit through it for several hours.  The graphics, clips and animation are extremely helpful.  Yes, there is some background on Al Gore that is more biographical than issue oriented; but it sometimes takes a name to sell a cause.  Gore is putting his name solidly on the line.  I appreciate his courage.  I would have dearly enjoyed seeing if he could have made positive changes as president, but that will have to wait.  I'm mindful of his emphasis on chaos theory from \\"Earth in the Balance\\" where things build and build and then the effects happen very suddenly.  I hope we don't wait for further calamity before we find the resolve to protect this beautiful Earth we have been given.  The video's excellent.  Enjoy!
B000002KZA|5.0|This album remains one of my favourites in the dM catalogue.   <br /> <br />With this album the band pretty much leave behind the purely pop-oriented songs of their early days, and instead transition fully into a unique industrial sound with a more experimental feel.  (Here I mean industrial in its true sense with sampled metallic sounds, etc.)  Brilliant use of sampled sounds accented by instruments such as metallaphones keep the songs fresh and interesting.  The album's tracks really do have a unique vibrancy and texture to them.   <br /> <br />While \\"Everything Counts\\" is indeed a classic, my favourites on this album are the darker tracks:  Pipeline, Shame, Two Minute Warning, and The Landscape is Changing (the latter two of which are under-rated rare compositions of Alan Wilder). <br /> <br />The lyrics of the album give it a somewhat young and naive feel, intermixed with a sense of injustice.  In this way, the raw sentiments behind the lyrics match the interesting and sometimes erratic feeling of the instrumentation.  <br /> <br />The album cover and title bring together the blue-collar, industrial theme of the album, a marked improvement over dM's somewhat unfocused previous album \\"A Broken Frame\\".
B000HA4WT8|3.0|After getting involved in a car accident racing the school jock, Southern boy Sean Boswell is sent to live with his father in Tokyo. The conditions of the move are that he stay away from cars and stay out of trouble, otherwise he'll be sent back to America and go to jail. So of course his first day in school Sean winds up racing the nephew of a member of the Japanese mafia over a girl he has no business talking to. Pretty soon Sean is racing every day and learning how to \\"drift\\" a style of driving that involves sharp turns and dangerous curves. With tons of car racing, dangerous men involved in illegal activities, and a beautiful girl caught between the bad boy and the clueless outsider, 3 Fast 3 Furious is indeed a wild ride.<br /><br />I liked both of the previous Fast and the Furious movies, so I thought I would like this one. It was okay, but not great. Sean's pathetic attempt at a Southern accent was hard to tolerate and a disgrace to genuine Southerners. Bow Wow's role as the funny guy who can't help but get into trouble was one of the more redeeming parts of the film along with the character of Han, who takes Sean under his wing and teaches him to drift. Overall, this movie was okay. It's pretty entertaining and fast-paced, but it's nowhere near as good as the other movies in the series.
B0006GAI6O|3.0|I would have loved to have seen Meryl Streep in the role of wife in this movie.  Susan Sarandon was such a hag when she came on the scene and the resolution of the problem was a great disappointment.  Meryl Streep as she was in the Devil Wore Prada would have added the correct amount of glamour to make one sympathetic to the solution.  Susan has no humor or glamour.  In her bugeyed way she is an Iron Maiden much in the same way as Hillary Clinton. It was really creepy when Richard had to throw it all in for her. And the daughter was obnoxious as well.    Richard Gere is quite amazing.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|When I first saw the previews for the Lake House I thought the plot was completely implausible and that there was no way I could possibly enjoy such a far-fetched romance. I was wrong. Sandra Bullock plays an overworked doctor at a busy Chicago hospital who finds solace on her time off by visiting her lake house. Keanu Reeves plays an architect whose father build the lakehouse, and who lives in it at the same time as Bullock, though two years earlier. The two correspond through letters placed in the mailbox and develop an affection for each other that transcends time. After awhile they begin to make plans to meet each other in Reeves' future and Bullock's present, but their plans just keep falling through. They begin to wonder if time is a barrier that they can't overcome.<br /><br />So while the two-year time difference may seem like it would make the love story hard to follow, it completely makes sense within the context of this film. These two people are living completely different lives and the only thing they have in common is this house, which for both of them is a source of solace and peace in their otherwise hectic lives. The way they fall in love is completely believable and I couldn't help but hope that they would be able to overcome the distance that time placed between them and find a way to be together in the present. Even if you don't typically like love stories, I'd suggest giving the Lake House a try. I was skeptical, but I'm glad that I gave it a chance.
B000002UA0|1.0|Here's what happens when a bunch of unstable dolts from the Old Country get together and smoke banana peels and fistfulls of catnip. And the chin-droolers who call this art are the same saps who blog angry entries about there not being a Criterion version of \\"Reefer Madness,\\" their irony valve dried up like a used condom in the Tenderloin on a sunny day. So yeah, pass the granola and don your fruit stripe sarong, but I just gotta tell ya, if you're smoking anything through a pipe as morning is about to break like a rotten egg all over the sky, it's probably crack. What is this otherwise? Gut instinct tells me it's a concept album about a satanic astrophysician who collects wind-up chimes while journeying to the land at the bottom of the Sun with a wild pack of gnomes strapped to his back. See what I mean? I'd rather dig boogers out of my nostrils with a razor-riddled shoehorn than listen to this one more time.
1573226521|3.0|This enjoyable novel follows a young English traveler, Richard, as he seeks a rumored paradise away from the throngs of tourists. The personal interactions and Richard's slow descent into emotional instability make a great counterpart to the beautifully described island. Missing the romantic elements of the movie based on this book, it still managed to keep this reader interested to the end. Though there are elements of this book that lack punch, and the end was anticlimactic, this is an author I will look for in the future and a read I recommend.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|All I can say is this: if you have not seen this movie on Blu Ray, then you have not really seen this movie. Its just not the quality of the picture, but the movie itself has so mnay new parts not in the DVD version that I watched, that the movie itself is like your watching it for the first time.  <br /> <br />Blu-Ray picture and sound is an experience. This is an action flick and it has constant battles and colors to fill your senses. I would say it is the best blu ray film available to date! This one will show you what Blu-Ray is all about.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Hogwash and psuedo-science. If man and his machines are truly the cause of today's global warming, then who was responsible for the previous times in earth's history for the cycles of warming and cooling?  How do these same so called experts explain the warming caused by undersea volcanoes and increased solar radiation?  As long as earth has existed, it has gone through cycles of heating and cooling, and most of it before man, aerosols, and SUV's were ever around.  Yes, take care of the earth, but a life without technology is foolish, if not impossible.  If Al Gore is so worried about global warming, tell him to fly commercial air instead of private jets, which is truly a huge waste of fuel and increase of hydrocarbons.
B000JJ4GW0|4.0|As a die-hard U2 fan, I really liked this compilation.  The live performances are amazing, and according to SPIN magazine, U2 is in the top five \\"Must See Live\\" Bands.  I agree.  I think they did a really great job, mixing up music videos, live performances and encapsulating, 25 years of gems from a truly amazing rock journey. It is true, some songs were left out...but this dvd is about more than the music. It's fun to see them as young kids, to modern day activists.  As a single mother, music is one thing my 17 year old son and I still enjoy together and connect with.  This dvd forms yet another bridge between the generations. These guys continually produce music with a message, and that is in part why, these Irish boys, have become legends.
B00005JPCA|4.0|It was risky making Daniel Craig, reknowned for his roughness in his roles, the new James Bond.  A wise move, nonetheless, since the franchise needed a bit of sprucing up and our hero was quickly beoming a cliche. However, I do hope that some of the old Bond comes back in the next installment.  It's his rakishly unique charm that distiguishes him from any other action hero and made us fall in love with him the first place.     Lucky for us, Daniel Craig has the ability to pull it off.  Let's just hope the writers do him justice.  Maybe, while we're at it, we might also see Moneypenny and Q in the making.    As for the movie itself, definitely plenty of physicality and action.  Some of it a bit too stylized, but it is eye-catching and Craig pulls it off in stride.  For every bond movie, there's usually two bond girls.  The first bond girl was striking, though short-lived.  The second, played by Eva Green, would not have been my choice.  Good actress, acttractive but not gorgeous.  French women seem to have that Je ne se quois.  She just doesn't.  Mads Mikkelson is not convincingly notorious or sarcastic enough to be a James Bond villian, but then again, this is Bond's first mission so we'll give him a break.    Good film. Requires you to put aside your image of old Bond for a while to allow Daniel Craig's chance to build him up.  Recommend it.
1594200653|5.0|In contradiction of an earlier review this book is a \\"page turner\\", I read this book fascinated and eager to find out what happens next. It is extremely well written and very accessible to the 'general reader'. It will give you new perspectives on events and movements that you kind of know about and will certainly help you to understand the contemporary world better.
0307237699|4.0|While I'm not one to write book reviews, I thought enough of this book to write one for it. I enjoy reading non-fiction, and this book was no exception. It let the reader know the Senator's views on many subjects, subjects that are not easily looked upon in a \\"for or against\\" kind of way (as most subject matter SHOULD BE in politics). I found parts of this book to be somewhat dry, but for the most part it was an enjoyable read. I have  also read Senator Obama's \\"Dreams from my Father\\" and found that one enjoyable as well, but it is much more of an autobiography than this book, which is more of a \\"user's guide to Barack Obama\\".
B00004RJDA|2.0|I had heard so many good things about this movie, but I didn't like it.  The filming and scenery were lovely, but overall I thought the story was just not a great story - mainly because the character Julia Roberts played was so self-centered and rude, according to her mood.  I had real trouble believing in any real basis for the attraction of the two main characters, especially after Julia Roberts' character had an extremely unjust and childish tantrum that rendered her character almost revolting.  At the end of the movie, I wished Hugh Grant's character had hooked up with the \\"nice\\" blind date, who seemed a far better person and fit.
B00003CWTI|1.0|... so I'll just make this one brief without hyperventilating: \\"Magnolia\\" is an overwritten movie with under-developed characters. Reviewers comparing Anderson to Robert Altman should remember that even Altman stumbled with \\"Brewster McCloud\\" after the success of \\"M*A*S*H\\" for the same reasons. There's no magic here -- the movie is just plain excessive, and too indulgent for its own good.
B00008RWRN|5.0|If you're looking for the best PCM CD version of Machine Head available - this is it. The CD layer on this hybrid SACD is vastly superior to the anniversary 2 CD remaster (which is superior to the original CD release). It sounds very natural and hi-res, exactly what I'd expect the master tape to sound like. On previous versions, including the original vinyl, the mix was all jumbled with the instruments all seemingly jammed on top of each other. On this DSD remix and remaster, the instruments and vocals are all in their own space, and the soundstage has depth, plus the bass is stronger and more defined. The price, at the time of this writing, is astronomical, so I'd recommend buying from one of the Amazon Market sellers or go to Amazon UK.
B0002OERI0|5.0|\\"IT'S NOT PUNK\\", \\"STOP CALLING IT PUNK\\"...  whaa...  whaaa...  you cry babies.  Who cares what you call it, it's a great record with great songs that makes you think. Maybe all those crying about it not being punk are the \\"American Idiots\\" and just don't get it.  Oh, sorry, did I offend you?  Did I offend all of America? Did I speak my mind like this album does? If that's not punk, I don't know what is then...  sue me...
B00000DGRX|5.0|A hybrid SACD version is also available here on Amazon. It will play on standard CD players as well as SACD players, and the standard CD layer sounds even better than this anniversary edition. I have both since I want the best sounding Machine Head available and the second disc of Roger Glover remixes in this anniversary edition. This is a good sounding remaster of the original album, but it can't hold a candle to the hybrid remaster.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|Sad sad that Mann drops the ball on the writing in this movie. Most know the guy can direct visual - this film is eye popping in its various locations and the shots are framed with beautiful detail. Too bad that Mann losses interest in the writting of characters. Gone is the dark humor of the series, the real sense of friendship you can feel between the two main leads, and the sense of dread you have when all the odds seem stacked against the good guys.  <br />At least the small lady parts are handled well - Gong Li even brings a sense power and grace to the cliched Femme Fatal / Lost soul part she is stuck with and the camera loves her beauty.  Strange how the \\"Tubbs\\" character shows intelligence while the \\"Sonny\\" character is almost a complete bore.  Give credit to Jamie on making something out of nothing - even if the director has him introduce his lady to the Bad Guy, One of the all time Stupid Moves an Undercover Agent could ever do!   <br />The movie than losses all sense of wrapping up its plot lines (who is the leak, what happens to the main villian, ???) so it can focus on the love life of the 2 main leads?  Mann only has one exciting action scene and even that comes no where near the shoot-out of all shoot-outs that him filmed in \\"Heat\\".  Lets hope Mann gets some \\"no people\\" around him and a script manager so he get back on his game and make a crime drama worthy of his visual talents.
B00005JPCA|3.0|I have been a long time Bond fan since I can remember. I have read all the novels, seen all the films, and read about Ian Fleming and a lot of articles about the subject. After Ian Fleming's death other authors were hired to write Bond novels namely: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner and Raymond Benson.     This is actually the second film entitled \\"Casino Royale.\\" The first one was a James Bond spoof that starred David Niven.     After all the hype, I must say that the second \\"Casino Royale\\" is an above average action film (but if you have to see only one action film this year you will be better off with \\"The Departed\\").     Daniel Craig is a good actor. I have seen him in \\"Road to Perdition,\\" \\"The Mother,\\" and \\"Munich\\" among others. However, Craig's Bond is far from Ian Fleming's Bond in the novels and the early Sean Connery films which had Ian Fleming's seal of approval.     What's good about Craig's Bond is that it was stripped off a lot of complicated and fantastic plots as well as unrealistic sets that plagued the last Pierce Brosnan film (Although I consider Pierce Brosnan as arguably the best Bond after Sean Connery). The sets of \\"Die Another Day\\" became too fantastic and distracting from the story and the character build-up. I think its a mistake to let technological advancement and elaborate sets to overcome a film's story and character.     A lot of Bond fans complain that Daniel Craig doesn't look a bit like the 007 in the novels. This is accurate in the sense that Bond had dark hair...\\"with a comma of hair falling over his brow.\\" In fact, Ian Fleming wrote in his novels \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Moonraker\\" that James Bond resembled musician-actor Hoagy Carmichael with a scar down one cheek.    Also, Daniel Craig's recurring beefcake display was also distracting and unnecessary. As to the costume, the film focused more on Craig's muscle shirts than the traditional impeccable suits, jackets and shirts which traditional British Eaton and Oxford educated chaps, like Bond, normally wear. Ian Fleming was so precise as to write that Bond preferred fine Sea Island cotton for his shirts. Also, James Bond plays Baccarat NOT poker. The writers must have been overly influenced by the recent rash of Vegas style Texas Hold' em on television.    Although Craig's acting in the the torture scene highlighted his ability, he lacked the tradmark Bond charm. There was no presence when he walked into the room. He could have been mistaken for the bad guy who get's killed in the first 15 minutes of a Bond flick. Also, Craig's Bond seemed to lack the distinct class and breeding the gentleman MI6 operative was known for. But this might be attributed to the fact that this was supposed to be James Bond's debut in both book and film.     Speaking of MI6, the film's MI6 operatives seemed like blundering idiots who do not know what they were doing unlike those in the novel and the previous films. Looking back, the early Ian Fleming novels were written right after World War II & it is unlikely that MI6 would have chosen those types working for British Intelligence (CIA and KGB office and field operatives in \\"The Good Shepherd\\" were far more credible).     Daniel Craig was able to emote the spy's calousness but lacked the depth of facial expression to tell you what was happening to him. I would have preferred Pierce Brosnan's portrayal in this area. He was still good for another Bond film. But if the producers wanted to replace him I would have preferred Clive Owen. But that's just my personal opinion. My opinion might be shaded by my belief in tradition especially when it comes to pop culture male role models. I believe that certain actors are fit to play certain roles which include looks as criteria as shallow as it may sound. Otherwise, I would agree that Daniel Craig will make a better \\"Superman\\" instead of newcomer Brandon Routh because the former is a better actor.    Although, making Bond too hi-tech becomes distracting, this film had so little gadgets that it was not fun anymore (unless you consider Craig's too prominantly displayed Sony Viao as a \\"hi-tech\\" gadget. This is probably the commercial effect of Sony Pictures' getting this franchise. But much as I love Sony products their after sales service sucks! FYI). A miniature defibrilator in the glove compartment of the Aston Martin was the gadget highlight of the movie. Although, the novels do not emphasize the gadgets, I believe they had their share of secret weapons without going overboard like in \\"Moonraker\\" (the film not the book) and \\"Die Another Day.\\" Noticeably, \\"Q\\" is missing.     Characterwise, Bond isn't the type who would say \\"I love you.\\" The only time I recall Bond saying those words was in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" (book and film) to the only woman he ever married - Contessa Teresa \\"Tracy\\" Di Vicenzo played in the film by the unforgettable Diana Rigg (\\"The Avengers\\") to George Lazenby's Bond. I guess Daniel Craig had to say it to compensate for his inability to emote what the character would have felt at that particular scene. But it could also be that Bond becomes less emotionally attach as he gets older and more experinced. Eva Green, although very beautiful, looked too much like Bond Girl No. 99 Sophie Marceau (\\"The World is Not Enough\\") and unfortunately but understandably lacked the latter's acting experience which is not a whole lot to begin with.    Overall, I was a bit disappointed. I heard people (especially women) say it's the best Bond film ever. I respectfully disagree. The novels speak for themselves. \\"Casino Royale\\" (the second film) although has its entertainment strengths, could not measure up to Sean Connery's \\"Dr. No,\\" \\"From Russia with Love\\" and \\"Goldfinger\\" taking into consideration that most of these films were made in the 60's. Pierce Brosnan's first (\\"Goldeneye\\") was probably the best Bond film after them. Although good acting accolades also go to Timothy Dalton in \\"Living Daylights.\\"    Although\\"Casino Royale\\" was a fresh break from the last tech diluted \\"Die Another Day.\\" I do not think I would like to see more of the same. Althought Craig's \\"The world will know you scratched my balls\\" dialogue was funny, I will always miss Sean Connery's more \\"intelligent\\" and \\"gentlemanly\\" quips. \\"...I think he got the point...\\" (Connery to Domino after shooting Vargas with a harpoon in \\"Thunderball\\").
0525476881|5.0|Colin Singleton is a high school graduate for only a day when his girlfriend, Katherine, dumps him. Wallowing in self-pity, Colin becomes obsessed with what went wrong. But rather than concentrating on his own character, he channels his energy into constructing a formula that will predict what people will be dumpers and dumpees. Perhaps he's concerned because he's just been dumped for the 19th time, all by girls named Katherine. <br /> <br />The protagonist doesn't have too much time to retreat into himself before his Lebanese sidekick, Hassan, appears and proposes a road trip. The two confer with skeptical parents and are quickly off in Colin's car. They have no idea where they're headed, but it's not too long before they stop to visit the gravesite of a famous figure in world history. There, in a small Tennessee town, they meet Lindsey, a tour guide at the facility and her mother, Hollis, owner of the local factory. <br /> <br />As with Green's hugely successful Looking for Alaska, the author creates highly developed and likable main characters. Hassan is everything that Colin is not: crudely spoken, unmotivated and ready for adventure. The young Singleton has always pushed himself to live up to his promise as a prodigy. Filling his head with useless trivia and extensive knowledge of obscure languages, it's little wonder that he has never stopped to ask himself why he will only see girls named Katherine. Hassan is there to tell him when his digressions are boring, when he's taking his obsessions too far and when he needs to break out of his comfort zone and take a chance. <br /> <br />While the book is told in the third-person point of view, Green's narration echoes the thinking patterns of his main character. Through the course of the book there are dozens of footnotes, often with random tidbits of the kind that occupy his protagonist's head. Rounding out the short book is an appendix of notes and formulas that expound upon Colin's life and work. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended for young adults, although adult readers will also appreciate this irreverent, cerebral and funny story.
1401201911|5.0|Alternate history for the Man of Steel and the rest of the DC universe.  Blue Boy lands in Russia and grows up to become Stalin's paragon of the Soviet regime. Wonderful to see how this change affects Lois Lane, Luthor, the Bat and Female Wonder.  The last two are über tragic figures at their best.  By the way, so is Lois.  After Stalin, SM is pretty much in charge of trying to bring order to the World as Luthor's decadent US and Brainac challenge him with alternate plans.  Great ending, as you realize its irony. Experience the Superman myth in a different way.
032147404X|4.0|This book is filled with great tips for getting better photos out of your digital SLR camera.  Although targeted at an audience new to digital photography, there's something for everyone here and it's nice to have all these tips consolidated into an easy to read book.  Even though I've been using my digital SLR for about three years now, I still found many things of interest in this book. <br /> <br />The author also has a nice sense of humor, e.g., \\"Now I can push the shutter again and again, and in my head I just see a smiley face instead.  Why?  Because I'm insane.\\"  ;-) <br /> <br />A fun quick read.
1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick is a great read and more!  Taking the idea of stickiness introduced by Malcolm Gladwell in The Tipping Point, authors Heath and Heath have produced more than a great read.  They've developed a workshop approach that helps the reader understand what makes things stick and then begin to see how to craft their own stickiness!  Packed with captivating stories that make the point, Made to Stick is a very engaging read with plenty to chew on.
B000J103X4|3.0|at the top of this review, i should be fair by saying that the album is pretty much a banger...even the filler material is better than most of the stuff that winds up on other artists' albums...so far, i know the reader wonders where the 3-star rating came from, right? read on to find out how a 5-star project loses two stars... <br /> <br />this album is touted as a dre-free project, which is nothing less than a lie...the album is named after dr. dre...the tracks are dr. dre inspired...i cannot be convinced that the producers got together and produced these tracks with no intent of recreating the \\"good doctor's\\" sound...(strike one star) <br /> <br />game makes reference to dre, doctor dre, the good doctor, the d-r-e, etc. no less than 40 times across the cd...only 3 tracks manage to escape the onslaught of name dropping...those must be the dre-free tracks... <br /> <br />request for clarification: is it considered biting to reproduce an act's production style, vocal style, mimic his voice to the point that the average listener cannot distinguish the difference, usurp the legacy of a hip hop group of which there is no affiliation other than hometown...the youngest member of nwa (ice cube) is about 10 years older than game? <br /> <br />this dude is all over snoop dogg's sack (and i'm not talking about the chronic sack either)...i may just be behind on current events, but last i checked, bloods and crips were not openly that chummy...i don't remember snoop and suge knight all over each other when snoop was on death row... <br /> <br />oh yeah...i ain't forgot that effeminate title track...in his own words, game might need to \\"check his kotex\\"...i don't know if a married man caught by his wife in bed with another man would have rendered a more heartfelt apology...why he gotta sound like he's crying on the track? and why he gotta drag busta into it? and why the song gotta be on the album? go by the guy's house and say that stuff in person...that way you can deny ever saying it...(strike another star) <br /> <br />compared to competing product, this cd is a definite to have...but if you really want the real, might i suggest a genuine NWA/Ice Cube/Snoop Dogg/Dr. Dre/Eazy E cd?
B000ICM5IK|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the Rocky franchise. I own all the DVDs and all the soundtracks. This is a cheap stunt and a ripoff, just like the movie.<br /><br />Bill Conti is genius. His original soundtrack to the first Rocky film is unparalleled. Only Rocky II expands on that original soundtrack. The other 4 movies either dimsiss him completely or recycle what he has already recorded. Unfortunately, the entire Rocky Balboa movie is recycled Bill Conti music from the first film. It's way overplayed in the movie with no apparent regard to the scenes the compositions are tacked on to. The script is pointless and recycled as well. Not even the training scene is uplifting enough. As a director, Stallone is no John G. Avildsen (the original Rocky director).<br /><br />THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK OF AN ORIGINAL MOVIE. IT IS A NON-ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK TO A NON-ORIGINAL MOVIE. The music is all from the other Rocky movies, mostly mediocre pop. If you want Conti's best contribution to Rocky, get the newly remastered soundtrack of the original film. And pick up Rocky II if you want even more along those lines. But this CD, like the film, is all marketing-driven recycled material we already bought before. Conti should have been paid to do an entirely new soundtrack. I would have bought it. Stallone ripped us all off with the Rocky Balboa film. Recycled script. Recycled music. I prayed that maybe Rocky would at least die in the ring for a powerful twist on the saga. But no, he kills off Adrian before the movie even starts... for what? So he doesn't have to pay Talia Shire to be in it? Stallone, I think a lot of us respect Rocky more than you seem to.
B00005JPDY|4.0|Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate who enters the world of clandestine intelligence with the best of intentions, only to be overwhelmed by it.  This movie is long but does not lose one's interest.  We see how Edward Wilson is slowly transformed from an dedicated college graduate eager to help the O.S.S. againt Nazism to a determined C.I.A. case officer determined to stop communism to an emotionless cold warrior who will put the well-being of the country and his beliefs above his own family.<br /><br />This is an interesting film.  Violence is down-played, people expecting another Bourne Identity or James Bond movie will be disappointed (as some of these reviews show).  It should be pointed out that The Good Shepherd is not meant to be an action film, but instead a drama film, a film that is oriented around the development of the Edward Wilson.  We are made to understand why he does what he does, why he feels as he feels.  I give this film a definite thumbs-up and predict Matt Damon will be nominated for an oscar for his performance.
0316172324|2.0|Gladwell spends half the book telling you how we are capable of making incredible, enlightened deductions in an instant thanks to our subconscious. He leaves you hoping the next half of the book will tell you how to harness and refine those deductions so you can use them in everyday life and decision making processes. Instead he goes on to reveal how we override our initial intuitions with conscious thought, and interestingly, vice versa. He ends by giving examples of how we make errors in judgment by relying on our intuition too much. So what was the point? Not the treatment on the subject I was hoping to receive. Basically he says the subconscious is capable of powerful things. Great. Now buy a book that talks more about how to use it to your advantage.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Considering that there had been the departure of the founding half of Evanescence since 'Fallen' was released, I wasn't sure what to expect of 'The Open Door' or whether it would be able to compare with 'Fallen'.  I also thought 'What if Call me when your sober is the ONLY good song on this?' <br /> <br />But then I listened to it.   <br />About 15 times. <br />In a row.   <br /> <br />And it is just amazing!  This album, while certainly not a carbon copy of 'Fallen', has an intense emotional energy in each and every song, not just one or two.  There is a song that could speak to each feeling, emotion, or unacknowledged thought that most people have or experience.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  If you like 'Call me when your sober' you will enjoy every song on this album.  Well worth the purchase!
0307346609|4.0|This is one of the smarter and more unusual zombie novels you will ever read. Max Brooks has created a zombie mythology for an apocalyptic future where a plague of walking dead decimate the earth. There are historic figures, famous battles, customized weapons, and unique language. This world is wide open for further embellishment should Mr. Brooks or others decide to explore it.     There is no main character for you to identify with or become attached to. Each section has a different narrator, speaking about his or her specific experience in the zombie war. I was skeptical at first, but this device actually works. Of course, some narratives are better than others, and there were several that I wish had been expanded further. I particularly enjoyed the accounts of the female pilot who has to parachute in the middle of zombie territory, the young Japanese man who is trapped in an infested highrise, and the wandering submarine crew.    Some sections got bogged down with extraneous detail--elaborate descriptions of goverment agencies and histories of various regions. While I understand this was an attempt to add background and context, it often slowed the momentum of the story.    Surprisingly, there were long stretches without zombies. However, when they did appear it was worth the wait. Rather than pummeling us with zombie carnage, Mr. Brooks parceled it out in effectively creepy amounts. That's the hallmark of good suspense; leave 'em breathlessly wanting more.    All in all, this was an interesting new spin on the zombie novel and I applaud Mr. Brooks' effort. Without a main character, however, it beats me how they will make this into a movie.
B000J3OTSM|3.0|i saw this with my kids and had low expectations. this is not the first tough guy meets upper class girl and fall in love thru dancing movie. having said that, we all were pleasantly surprised. Channing Tatum is solid & appealing in the main role and the story packs enough action and momentum to keep it going. has some rough language and violence (thus PG-13 rating)
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The first time I saw this film was in 1982 at a very low point in my life. It had just started showing on the TV when I turned it on. In fact I was sitting in an empty apartment with the only furniture being a black and white TV (my roomate moved and stole everything while I was out.)  <br /> <br />By the end of this story I was completely moved, a changed person. That was the best Christmas I have ever had, though I was homeless and pennyless I discovered something eternal that guided me onward. I will always cherish that experience. Christmas isn't tinsel and wrapped gifts or shopping malls and parties.  Thank you Mr. Capra for capturing the true meaning of Christmas. If you've never seen this movie you will be wonderfully suprised.
B000J103PC|4.0|I was torn between giving The Devil Wears Prada three or four stars as I found it very entertaining but admit to it being no stupendous work of art. An obvious point in its favor is the performance Meryl Streep who is infinitely believable and entirely owns her character. I say this as a person who knows nothing about fashion and nothing about Anna Wintour who may or may not the person Streep's character is a reflection of. Regardless of the veracity of the portrayal, Streep's work is absolutely amazing. With Anne Hathaway, she's an absolute doll for whom most men will find it impossible to turn away. She's quite charming and this contributes significantly to one's enjoyment of the movie. Independently though, I stand for any venture which accurately depicts what it is like to work with women. Yes, bosses like this one are highly unusual, but pretending that they don't exist is to embrace lies over truth.
0618680004|3.0|Whether you are an atheist or a theist this book should interest you.  The title is perhaps a little misleading, nevertheless, in that one may assume the book argues against \\"The God Hypothesis\\" in general.  Surprisingly, the author's arguments are based upon a strictly Darwinian point of view.  To Dawkins' credit, his expertise is in the field of genetics; however, there are far more scientific perspectives to consider in refuting the possibility of a God than biology alone. (Physics, chemistry, astronomy, and other important fields are simply not given sufficient attention in this text, and applying a Darwinian perspective to non-physical phenomena is quite limiting.)<br /><br />Keeping my theories and beliefs to myself, I would simply contend that this book does not provide a thorough scientific analysis as to the possible existence of a supernatural being, and thus falls short of expectations.
B0000636NQ|5.0|I saw Ten Years After live in a small club called \\"The Bank\\" in Torrance, CA, circa 1968, at which time their live act consisted of what is captured here on Undead.  I was totally blown away and immediately went out to get the LP.  TYA was in a blues/jazz mode at this stage, and although they went on to be a mega superstar act in the later years of their career (I saw them live 4 times thereafter), their style changed somewhat as they began selling more records (mass popularity in the music biz usually requires a less esoteric style for the masses).  <br />     Undead captures the band at their purest apogee of intensity and finesse, when jazz and the blues more than rock 'n roll characterized their musicianship.  Undead is especially noteworthy for some great bass soloing by Leo Lyons and some jazzy Hammond soloing by keyboardist Chick Churchill.  Their later stuff concentrated on Alvin almost exclusively as the band's soloist, as demonstrated by TYA's recent Live At The Fillmore East CD, which although excellent, features Alvin's guitar pyrotechnics exclusively and which relegates Leo and Chick into the background.   <br />     Alvin at the time of the late sixties and early seventies was revered as one of the great guitar gods, right up there with Clapton, Page, Beck, and Hendrix. Many contemporary music critics tend to denigrate his style nowadays, characterizing him as all speed and no style.  Undead (and Live At The Fillmore East) prove them all wrong, from my estimation, as only a cursory listein to \\"I May Be Wrong But I Won't Be Wrong Always\\" or \\"Woodchopper's Ball\\" off of Undead will otherwise prove.  Absolute jaw-dropping work that his contemporaties in Guitar Olympus would not have been able to duplicate, dare they even have tried. <br />     My only regret with Undead is that they brought out this version with the bonus tracks after I had already purchased the original CD, the latter of which contained only the same tracks as the LP.  Is this some sort of insidious packaging conspiracy on the part of the recording industry, or what? <br />     Bottom-line:  this is one of the greatest live rock recordings of all time, bar none. <br />
B0007TKNL0|3.0|While this film did many things right, it fatally messed up the most important part of the musical: the Phantom. I honestly don't know what the producers were thinking when they cast Gerald Butler. I was so upset when I first saw the Phantom. When I saw him, I thought: \\"he's sexy!\\" Wait: he's sexy? The Phantom is not supposed to be hot, he's supposed to be grotesque and horribly deformed. And his voice in the movie was horrible, it sounded like he was either growling or yelling through all of his songs. But it wasn't solely Butler's fault. I really hated the way the Phantom was created to be a mere man. In the stage version, the Phantom is somewhat of a mystical being. We don't understand how he makes Carlotta's voice croak or how he makes the chandelier fall. He just does it. It made the Phantom one of the most engaging characters to be in theatre. Besides the Phantom, though, I thought they did the film well. It was visually stunning, and they brought out strong performances in Emmy Rossum and the women who played Madame Giry. This film is recommended, but I strongly advise to see it on stage. That is the truly haunting version.
B000002GGU|5.0|Yup, it was summer of 1984 (not '69). And this album pretty much had one hit after another. \\"It's Only Love\\" with Tina Turner rocks your socks off. Even the ballads are cool. Prior to this, \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" was all I really knew of Bryan Adams. But this album is the pinnacle of his career. And always will be, for 10 good reasons: the songs.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I was certainly skeptical about this project, especially having bought into the Yellow Submarine SONGTRACK record. Some nice mixes, but they were pretty much just selling me the same thing I already have ( although I have to admit it is good to finally have a great sounding mix of Hey Bulldog!) Upon hearing about this record and the idea of mixing parts of songs like She's So Heavy with Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, or mixing Drive My Car with Taxman, or Good Night with Octopuses Garden, well it made me more than a little nervous about how the results would fare. Still I'm a Beatles fan and so naturally and dutifully I bought the thing, but not with the greatest of expectations.  <br /> <br />And then I heard it.  <br /> <br />WOW! Amazing! Fantastic! Superb! I couldn't believe how well this mishmash of tune tinkering actually works! It's incredible! Not only has Sir George Martin given a new polish to these old songs, he's taken them apart and reassembled them into something almost entirely different, giving new life and depth to them. It's a thrill ride through a soundscape of the old and the new. Some of it is so good and different enough that they should be released as singles. Drive my Car/Taxman/What You're Doing would be a great single. It works so well it sounds like it was always meant to be. Lady Madonna has never been my favorite Beatles song, but the way it's done here is wonderful. Another single release. There are so many fabulous Fab songs and sounds it's as if it is a newly discovered recording of songs you've heard, but only partially, as if in a dream. Or maybe the whole thing is just a dream? It's a good one if it is.  <br />There have been people over the years debating the subject of the fifth Beatle, but I've never doubted that George Martin is the fifth Beatle. With this release it should be made official. Hand that man a mop-top wig and a pair of Beatle boots please.
B00004TJWE|5.0|This album is like a revelation- it concided at the same time as piper and sgt peppers(within the same year or so-atleast from the recording sessions) snd in my humble opinion is better than Barrets and the beatles own masterpieces- this is beautifully recorded tripped out and has the distinction of being the first \\"rock opera\\". Fantastic songwriting and a great narrative makes this truly unique- hearing this now i cant believe how great it sounds. If you like 60s pysche and  catchy but quirky british invasion styled tunes this is a must own. My version has bonus tracks which are great but this album is best listened in its original form- its a headphone masterpiece- i cant stress how well produced this is. Put simply if you dig the beatles floyd love \\"satanic era\\" stones and other summer of love styled albums this is essential- perhaps more so than any other 60s record.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This is for all the natural born mystics out there. You know who you are. The unexplainable lives in your heart, but it can't be expressed in just words. Loreena has the gift to be able to combine music and poetry to make you soar and say, \\"Yes! That's it! That's what I've been trying to express!\\" She is truly our mystical queen.
0618551050|5.0|When reading such accounts as \\"The Elegant Universe\\", or watching such programs on the Science Channel, I couldn't help but notice one of the topics of this book. No where could I detect an actual underlying theory! Yes, it is postulated that strings and branes exist and that they have certain properties, but what is the theory? It to me would be like watching a program about Einstein's formula E=mc^2 and then it going on about how this new theory claims mass to be energy and that this M-Theory (in this case Mass-Theory) is sure to lead to the final understanding of nature. But that is not the theory, that is the result of a theory. The actually theory is that there is no preferred reference frame and that light speed is constant to all observers. From the accounts I have seen of String Theory, all I see is \\"this is the result of the theory\\", \\"Fermions=Bosons=Strings\\", and no actual theory. Of course I didn't take this observation too seriously until Smolin showed that this observation is quite valid, since it's true! He explains that there was an underlying principle of strings that made it a beautiful theory, but that principle turned out not to be fully accurate, as he explains in his book. He also turns to M-Theory and how it is in the same situation as string theory. Neither of these \\"theories\\" are actual developed theories with developed principles.  <br /> <br />One criticism Smolin has towards the String Theory community is that one of the great appeals to the theory is its mathematical elegance. I myself have heard accounts from even the great Steven Weinberg saying that the mathematics is so beautiful, String Theory has to be right. Smolin suggests that this does not represent a powerful case as he talks about an early theory of particle physics called SU(5). He and many others thought that it most certainly would be correct, and they even were able to devise an experiment to test it! It of course failed, but it was beautiful! <br /> <br />However, the main theme of Smolin's book is not that String Theory is bad. He explains how he worked on the theory himself. His main problem is how String Theory has dominated the field of physics and how difficult it is for new ideas to emerge. It is not even that a dominating theory of physics (like how the described Modified Newtonian Dynamics is not taken as seriously as the dominant theory of Dark Matter) is bad, it's that the dominating String Theory has given no convincing reason to be on top. He explains how he is afraid that String Theory's dominance will choke out many other genuine ideas, and he makes a convincing case. <br /> <br />After reading this book, my main concern with String Theory is how much of it is based off of conjecture. There's not even mathematical proof that String Theory gives finite answers, it is only conjectured. You will read that there are many conjectured results about String Theory that are just taken to be true, but not proved. For a theory that is 99.9% mathematical, this is not good standing. There's a famous example of where simple data and intuition can be very misleading. It has to do with functions approximating the distribution of prime numbers. There were two functions that did this approximation, the log integral function, Li(x) (too complicated to be able to write out here), and another function, pi(x) (Where I believe pi(x)=x/ln(x)). Looking at charts and graphs comparing these two functions, it seemed quite obvious that Li(x) is a far better approximation than pi(x), and so it was widely believed to be true. However, it was proven (I believe by Littlewood) that there are an infinite number of places where the accuracy between the two switch. As in there are an infinite number of places where pi(x) becomes more accurate than Li(x), and where Li(x) then becomes more accurate again than pi(x). However, the first switch happens way down the number line, on the order of 10^50, or something like that. If we allowed ourselves to believe that Li(x) was always better than pi(x) because we could not find a counter example as our computers generated more and more digits, we would have been deceived for a very long time. The beauty of mathematical proof is that it can confirm a conjecture, and it seems as if the conjectures of String Theory should first be proven mathematically before counting them as true, no matter how convincing they may be.
B000002KDG|5.0|Rust Never Sleeps was Neil Young's answer to the Punk/New Wave movement that was then making its appearance in the late '70s. It was his claim that he was still relevant. The new wave was to wash out singer-songwriters like his friends Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as dozens of other '70s heavyweights, many to live out their careers on their former glory.<br /><br />Rust Never Sleeps not only made Young relevant, it helped draw his music to a new generation of future alt-rock types who looked upon him as an inspiration.<br /><br />The songwriting is excellent through out, perhaps Welfare Mothers and Sedan Delivery being the weakest but make up by a harder rocking tempo and Young's singing. The first side of slower introspective songs grip the listener. Young has that uncanny ability to make the listener sometimes think he's parroting their thoughts as well, a rare talent few songwriters can maintain throughout their career.<br /><br />The highlights, for me at least, are Thrasher, Ride My Llama and Powderfinger, legend having it that the last song was written for Lynyrd Skynyrd to record [whether true or not others can comment].<br /><br />It's an essential record and probably one of the top twenty-five or so rock albums ever made. Simply outstanding.
B000641Z90|4.0|I am a huge Phil Collins fan. I have lots of his music and DVD's. I recently purchased his \\"Finally...The First Farewell Tour\\" DVD and I was a little disappointed. As I tried to figure out why I was not totally satisfied with this DVD, I realized it was simply because I have seen the \\"Live and Loose in Paris\\" DVD that Phil Collins released in 1997. Although both DVD's feature many of the same great tunes, the Live and Loose is much more energetic than Finally. The circular stage on the Live and Loose DVD will give you much more exposure to the explosive energy Phil Collins and his band are capable of delivering. You are certain to enjoy this DVD, but if you don't already own Live and Loose in Paris, buy it before you buy this one. You won't be sorry.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have nothing but praise for this documentary series.  It provides a comprehensive view of the Second World War in scope and clarity that will be difficult to match for quite some time.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love Gerard Butler.  The film is less cheesy than the stage opera, which is good.  It's a great version and I highly recommend it.
B0000256VK|5.0|This is one of those albums that stand the test of time and merits repeated listening decades after its release.<br /><br />Roxy Music's \\"Avalon\\" joins Steely Dan's \\"Aja\\" as a timeless pop classic. Whereas \\"Aja\\" invoked the laid-back cool of clubbing and hot-tubbing in late 70s southern California, \\"Avalon\\" invokes the dawn of \\"Cool Britannia\\" but just on the cusp of the New Romantics proclamation of the Thatcher years. These aural landscapes were revolutionary at the time, and a break from Roxy Music's discordant power pop past: the logical culmination of Manifesto's \\"Dance Away\\" expanded to a whole album. Themes are of the usual ones of \\"Dance with a Stranger\\" as the  nouvelle riche of the City meet decadent Aristos, all trying to snaffle up all the leggy pretty young things that make their way to London a la Liz (Julie Christie) in \\"Billy Liar.\\" \\"Flesh\\" indeed.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|The kill off two main vital characters from the last two films, cram in too many new characters, rely on CGI effects too much, and leave it with a dumb ending. I do not know weather to give it 2 or 2.5 stars, because it is watchable, but not something that I would really like to watch again. I would not recomend this unless you are a diehard fan.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Why was this movie called Miami Vice and \\"loosely\\" based on the tv series? Other than the names of the characters and the fact that they're cops, there was no resemblance at all to the beloved show. The plot was slow and hard to follow, the scenes were mainly dark and it was hard to tell who was where and doing what. I finally had to adjust the contrast on the tv so that everything was a weird color but I could finally tell what was going on. There were a few action scenes but they came so late in the movie that I didn't really care at that point if the main characters lived or died.  <br /> <br />I guess I'll have to get out my copy of Bad Boys if I want to see an action movie that has great chemistry between the actors. Colin Farell and Jamie Foxx's characters fell well short of the mark.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|<br /> <br />The Brown Bunny is a radiant metaphorical film about the nebulous landscape of intimacy. <br /> <br />The camera follows Bud Clay - a man of indeterminate age whose demeanor is heavily  imbued with sadness and insecurity - as he travels cross-country to reach California. <br /> <br />Melancholy, haunting music, and smoldering, impressionistic images of cityscapes and  countryscapes during the dusk and nightfall convey to viewers the tangled emotions Clay is  tormented with as he finds his way to California. <br /> <br />The further Bud drives forward towards California, into the future, the further back in time  Bud's mind and emotions travel as he relives painful memories of a young woman he once  loved; Bud is nostalgically reliving the same cross-country journey he once had with the young  woman in his memory, reliving all the emotions and twists and turns. <br /> <br />Brief, tenuous encounters with three lonely, alienated women (who represent different aspects  of the woman he loved) further confuse Bud and hinder his ability to escape memories that  plunge him into a synthesized, emotionally arresting knot of anger and impassiveness and  resentment and emotionless. <br /> <br />After Bud reaches California and enters a hotel room he once shared with the woman he  loved, we realize that Bud has been trying to break free of her memory by diminishing her and  her love: he has been trying to delegitimize her life and her love for him, and he has even  emasculated himself in order to justify his anger and resentment and confusedness towards  her, and to justify eliminating her memory. <br /> <br />But in the afterglow, we know that Bud will never eliminate her memory, she will always be in his mind, his past actions (or lack thereof) will infinitely haunt him, the sum total of their acts will engulf him, and his mind will circuitously evolve around his memory in the same manner that the sun rises and the roads turn and the sun sets - ad infinitum. <br/> <br />Magnificiant cinematography and use of desaturated colours, haunting soundtrack score  (Come Wander With Me, The Dying Song [which should have been played in the film]),  flawless acting and direction by Vincent Gallo, courageous choice by Chloë Sevigny; this film  is the pinnacle artpiece of Gallo's career and oneof the most underrated, underappreciated, and misunderstood films of the 21st century. <br />
0307237699|5.0|It is refreshing to find a politician who offers more than the usual sound bite double-speak.  Barack Obama's book covers the vision of America's Founders, an overview of the history that brought us to where we are today and well thought out opinions on where we should go from here.  Obama is unflinchingly honest in appraising the strengths and weaknesses of both Democrats and Republicans.  His chapter on politics is an eye-opening depiction of the reasons why too many politicians fail the voters.  I highly recommend this book for both liberals and conservatives.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I loved this film. The writting, story, special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original. I recomend this film to any fan of the genre.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|<br />I really like this CD. I don't know what everyone else's critism is about this fine product. It is magnificent singing, beautiful, pure, gentle, and full of grace, and even though it is not entirely celtic music, all the performers are Celtic: Hence the name, Celtic Woman. <br /> <br />Personally, my favorite songs are all sung by Orla: Siulil A Run, Harry's game, and Isle of Inisfree. The collaborated songs are great, too.  <br /> <br />I really think that if you order this cd, you will love it, and if you don't, it's simply not your taste.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I own few films on DVD, but this and Before Sunrise are two I keep and will watch again. I will preface this with saying that I can understand how some people will be bored, not because this is a boring film, but because many are accustomed to Hollywood effects and schmaltz.<br /><br />In our American culture of pathologizing and medicating all forms of unhappiness, Botox injections, obsessing with appearing \\"perfect\\" and spending more time communicating with absent people via mobile devices and online, Jesse and Celine's characters seem more authentic than many actual people because, flawed, vulnerable, awkward and broken, they still connect and make no effort to conceal who they are.<br /><br />Julie Delpy is stunning as Celine and full of very human contradictions. She is both graceful and awkward, idealistic and jaded, anti-pollution yet smokes, responsible and a dreamer. Many of the qualities we loved about her in Before Sunrise are still there; she didn't outgrow them but grew into them realizing that the struggles, observations and hopes that can make one emotional is what makes life beautiful. She laughs about all Parisians being unhappy, yet we get a sense that there is an allure in a romantic, intelligent brooding. She takes action by working for an organization similar to Greenpeace removing her from the category of whiner. Ethan Hawke is convincing as the smitten American; we see both the free spirit he once was along with his current, settled on the surface self.<br /><br />The cinematography is fabulous. It's not as romantic as Before Sunrise and has fewer \\"distractions\\" like the drunken poet and old fortune teller (except for the barbecue party in Celine's courtyard towards the end which was very enchanting), but still is full of Parisian charms and beautiful scenes.<br /><br />They are constantly on the move, turning corners, the clock also moving forward as they try and go back. It's an impossible feat to capture the past in real time outside of a book written by Jesse, so we are not allowed to get too comfortable. The slowly setting sun made me anxious and Celine keeps pointing out that he needs to catch his plane. Towards the end when they are walking up Celine's large and tall spiral stairway we get a sense of them rising above time, and they are both quiet as if aware that something big is about to happen.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have written, you can feel as though you are witnessing something real. It's a place on screen that takes you to a beautiful place inside and leaves you aching for more, from them, and in your own life.e not allowed to get too comfortable.

B00005NTJM|4.0|A worthy addition to the music library of any fan of late 60's British Rock. At the time, Mick Abrahms was a guitarist on par or better than his peers. (Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Pete Townsend, Robin Trower, Jeff Beck, etc...). Oh sure, Ian Anderson is heard on this disk, but clearly, Abrahm's star shines far brighter here. If you enjoy 12-bar blues, you will clearly find Abrahm's contribution worthy. Just order \\"This Was\\", and you will not be disappointed...
B00003CX8J|5.0|No need to go over too much or to spoil anything, because other reviewers have probably already done that. Fast paced, well shot, great acting, wonderful story, and wonderful direction. Recomended.
1400082773|5.0|Attracted by the Barack buzz, I picked up this book last holiday season, but didn't have an opportunity to read it until this holiday season.  I found it to be honest, inspiring, and overall, provoking.  Obama offers a straight-forward account of his life as the product of a biracial union as well as a child of a single parent.  From descriptions of the childhood with his warm, wise grandparents at the beginning of the book to his trip to his father's Kenyan home, this book is both charming and serious at the same time.  When writing about his post-undergraduate, pre-law school work as a community organizer, Obama demonstrates his knowledge and love for Illinois at the deepest level.  This book is a great choice for anyone who wants to read an account of community organizing or a political autobiography, but I would recommend this book to anyone because of its broad appeal to human nature.
0446310786|4.0|In her unique classic Harper Lee depicts the Southern Society of the 1930s through the eyes and words of Scout. Jean-Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is a six-year old girl who hates school but loves to read. She is a tomboy who enjoys playing with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, while avoiding every lady-like behavior. Atticus, Jem's and Scout's father is an unusually moralistic lawyer who raises his children with modernity and devotion. It is only after the trial of the \\"mockingbird\\" that Scout and Jem come to realize the meaning behind Atticus' teachings. They transgress the innocence and simplicity of childhood and view the surrounding world and individuals with deeper realization and understanding. To Kill a Mockingbird explores virtue and vice as they coexist both on personal levels and in the larger social realm and as they relate to surrounding influences. Although a bit preachy (applying and imploring a plethora of unrealistic idealizations) Mockingbird remains a beautifully written novel entwining a powerful yet touching theme.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies ever made, and this edition of it is incredible. I already owned the 25th anniversary edition on DVD, but I didn't think twice about upgrading to this edition and I'm glad I did. The extras are amazing! There are several commentaries which are all great, especially the Stallone one. My favorite special feature is the three part \\"In the Ring\\" featurette. It's more than an hour of all the actors, producers, and the director reflecting back on the making of the movie and reminiscing about it. It's really interesting. I know a lot of people have complained about the fact that DVDs keep being re-released, but in this case the new version is so great that it is well worth the $20 it costs. No true Rocky fan should be without this 2-disc special edition.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The characters are a somewhat complex and you do have to infer some things which explains some of the so-so reviews here. I think the family members were a perfect mixed bag of eccentrics along with innocent and unassuming Olive. There are some moments where I laughed out loud on the airplane with my headphones on. Also there were some sticky social situations that had me squirming. This is a quirky off color comedy which reveals some really important life outlooks and biases. I could watch this film again and again. Toni Collette stole the show.
B000I6BLKE|4.0|This album will always hold a special place in my heart as it was one of the very first albums that I possessed all those years back. This together with Foreigner's \\"4\\" was the reason why I decided to pick up the guitar and to learn to love and adopt music as a hobby. I basically wanted to sound like Neil Schon and Mick Jones for years after. When my cassettes wore out and I decided to get cds, these 2 where among the very first albums that I got replaced. Now, this album comes remastered for a better, cleaned up although not the best sound I've heard on other remastered albums and the mini-lp replica sleeve very faithfully recreates the original vinyl sleeve design.  In addition, we get all the lyrics in English and Japanese, a tiny sticker, a 12-page full colour booklet and 4 bonus tracks.  The best tracks here are \\"Don't Stop Believing\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\", \\"Stone in Love\\", \\"Still They Ride\\" and \\"Open Arms.\\" That's half the album already and the other tracks are decent as well except perhaps for the 2 weakest tracks, \\"Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Lay it Down.\\" The 4 bonus tracks consist of the B-side of the \\"Still They Ride\\" single and 3 live tracks from a Houston concert in 1981.  The Journey sound is a thing of beauty; the Steve Perry vocals and Neil Schon guitar sound are so unique that you just know you're listening to a Journey tune after the first few measures. It was only when I started learning the guitar that I truly appreciated just how great a guitarist Neil Schon was. His high speed, great technique modal scalar work is still awesome to behold after all these years. One of the greatest albums of the 80s and very highly recommended.
1596912367|5.0|figured out the ending since I've been reading in this genre for so long but I didn't.  I read Restless and Forgetfulness both within a s space of a month.  I think both offer what is best about the genre and the complex games played and the human toll from these games. Both books compare well with LeCarre and if you like thoughtful character driven novels about \\"ghosts\\" you could do much worse.
015603008X|5.0|For the past 25 years I have bought this book for every teenager I have gotten to know. They have all thanked me for it. It is such a touching, wonderfully written story. In our world today we consistently witness the horror that results from the mistreatment and bullying of those who don't fit in. This is an engrossing tale of what it is like for those who are mentally disadvantaged, a tale of wonder, a tale of hope, a tale of real humanity. Please buy it and give it to young people you know. It is a story that is important for them to read.
0375701427|3.0|It's hard to fathom why \\"American Pastoral\\" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1998.  But hey, maybe it was slim pickins that year and Roth's almost-but-not-quite a great book was the best one out there.  Anyway, the committee didn't ask for my opinion (they rarely do ...) so I'll use this forum to share a few of my thoughts instead.<br /><br />\\"American Pastoral\\" gets off to a promising enough start, but just when the book manages to work up a good head of steam the whole thing falls to pieces.  It's the same case with the life of the protagonist, Seymour \\"the Swede\\" Levov.  Seymour is a decent enough guy, but his idyllic existence implodes when his daughter Merry bombs the local post office, killing a doctor in the process.  Merry becomes a fugitive, and the Swede spends the rest of the book trying to figure out where he went wrong.<br /><br />What goes wrong with this book is that the last 200 or so pages are a repetitive and turgid self-conservation inside the head of the Swede.  That's all well and good if psychotherapy is your cup of tea.  But don't crack this one open if you're expecting interesting character development, a compelling plot, or a vestige of satisfaction from reading it through to the end.  Roth's long-winded style is also a bit grating, but mostly because so little ground is covered, despite the generous investment in ink.<br /><br />Devotees of Philip Roth will probably enjoy the best-selling \\"American Pastoral\\" as much as they do his other well known works.  I think it's an acquired taste.  Michener and King sold zillions of books by sticking to their knitting.  It's the same with Roth.  But be warned that commercial success doesn't always correlate with great literature.
B000I5YVDE|4.0|Love 'em or hate 'em at least for a brief moment in the mid-90s this was the band on everybody's lips.  Musicians and those who have some understanding of music would probably agree that the band's ego is probably a lot bigger than its talent but one cannot deny the quality of some of the tracks here and indeed, many of the tracks here most probably represent the best work that Oasis have ever done anyway.  \\"Wonderwall\\" is a deceptively simple and yet musically interesting piece to play as a guitarist and will probably go down as a classic single over the years.  Other not so brilliant but still interesting tracks include: \\"Champagne Supernova\\", the album's opus, \\"Hello\\", \\"Roll With It\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", \\"Hey Now!\\" and \\"She's Electric\\" which is practically the whole album anyway.  This is why this album could very well be a greatest hits compilation of the band and this is also why anyone looking for Oasis' best album need look no further.  The sleeve design and the remastered sound make this a treat for fans as well.  Recommended.
044022165X|4.0|The author expertly crafts the complex stuggles of a law school student graduating and passing his bar exam and then taking on his first cases.  The book has incredible one liner humor that stopped me im my reading tracks and had me laugh out loud. The characters inthis book are colorful and you want to know whats going to happen to them. The reason why I didnt concluse with giving this a 5 rating is that , the author too hurriedly sums it all up at the end and leaves the reader, me, with a sense of 'C'mon -- is that all you're gonna give me as your audience here!' So thats the disappointment. This author is supposed to do better than this and it fails in that way.
B000AYEI5Y|1.0|Some deluded person with bad hearing compared James Blunt to Tori Amos. Hardly. He was lucky with 'Beautiful'. Listen closely- that sucks too! The ramblings of an emotionally desperate middle school student. I rue the day she made eye contact with James. This album is like hummingbird nectar- lotsa sugar but no substance. I hate that I was tricked into buying it. I hate that James Blunt took 80 minutes of my life that I will never recover. I was so hopeful when I bought it. Bottom line: Melodramatic lyrics coupled with uninspired music. Skip it.
0307237699|1.0|More idealistic, idiotic blathering. Wants to increase PROGRAMS( Please people whenever you see that word realize that great expense and failure is coming!)that have not worked, cost enormous amounts of money, will never work due to the nature of programs and have lead to this nations decline. <br /> Social programs don't work due to the fact that they are impersonal and require no responsibility on the part of the recipient and therefore there is no gratitude on the part of the recipient and engenders a sense of entitlement.  <br />Of course we have not learned from history therefore we will continue to make the same mistakes. People are so easily wooed by well-meaning but misguided politicians like Mr. Obama. They are like pied-pipers. People are entranced and follow along. Why? Because it SOUNDS SO GOOD. We get all righteous and do goody when we hear the pipers flowery words. They sound good but they are actually immoral. They always end up hurting the people they were designed to help and usually does so for many generations. Warning! Warning! Obama for president! Disaster waits. The only problem is the realization of the disasters of some presidents sometimes takes decades to realize. You have been warned. Impending disaster.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I have never been a huge KISS fan from the get go, but I've learned to respect them for what they've done and who they are. In and about the time I was really starting to get into listening and playing music, I though that they sucked for the most part. I was into bands like the Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden etc and Kiss never really did anything for me back then. However looking back, I probably never really gave them a chance. As time passed I began to revisit their older stuff and to my surprise, I really liked what I heard coming from my speakers. The 80's and 90's had some high points, but it's the early years that really paint the true picture of what these guys were about and I personally found this out some 20 years later. I guess you could say the their first full reunion tour was a coming out party for me *lol*.<br /><br />Sure Gene and Paul are businessmen and yes they looked at this as both being a way to get rich and a way to express themselves both musically and lyrically. From the moment they started out, they had a plan and followed it with the a passion. No one should ever say anything bad about that as they had a dream and they've lived that dream. They were at one time basically laughed at, however they had a vision and they worked at their craft and took on the world and it's would be critics. KISS is or was one of the worlds biggest bands and most recognizable names. They had achieved what they sought out to do and I see nothing wrong with that. They worked their butts off to show the world and probably themselves just what they could do or become. They delivered live shows that absolutely blew their audience away and their reputation and following, insert KISS ARMY here, was built on that. Make no mistake here, KISS was never the most talented band in the world, nor the best selling act ever, however they were not as untalented or as crappy as some people would have you believe. The musicianship is pretty darn good all around here so they get props from me.<br /><br />KISS are what they are and they are masters at what they do. They deliver great live shows time after time and they have a very good collection of albums that contain some really good tunes that have stood the test of time. They are business men who in the end have given us a good days work for many years!<br /><br />This DVD contains what really is KISS at it's zenith. The first disc shows us just how raw they really were when they started out. It has lots of bad notes and really funny imagery that is somewhat hilarious at times. As the disc gets further in, you can see that they are indeed getting better and are really starting to define who they are and what they could be. The second disc is really KISS at it's best!! They had found their way and were working it for all it was worth. All in all great stuff for any KISS  fan or even the casual fan like myself who over time has grown to respect what these guys were all about!<br /><br />Easily a 5 star rating here!!here so they get props from me.

B00006RAKP|5.0|The song list speaks for itself on this double CD set.  I won't get into the debate of concept albums versus complilations, other than to say that a CD set like this is perfect for filling up that iPod or other listening device with certified hits that easily withstand the assault of the \\"random\\" play function.<br /><br />True fans of Sir Elton probably have all of these hits in one media or another, but this collection puts them together admirably.
B00013RC8O|1.0|This is a poor excuse of a movie. The actors are less than right for these rolls. I will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash....
B00006CXSS|5.0|This box set is incredible with extra bits. This mini series is set in WWII follwing the true story of Easy Company an airborne unit traveling throughout the allied campaign in Europe. This series is amazing and includes a sixth bonus disc with extra content. The box it comes in is amazing it is metal and very well put together. If you love war films this is something you must buy. It is well worth the money <br />
B000J103YI|5.0|When you have a movie like `Dreamgirls' that flourishes with its musical numbers then you know the soundtrack is going to reinvent the movie experience right in your own living room.  Thus, this is a soundtrack that is worth owning.  With Jennifer Hudson's brilliant vocals on tracks like `Love You I Do' and `I Am Changing' not to mention the stunner `And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' she cements herself as the album highlight.  Beyonce, a girl I feel is largely overrated, blows me away with `Listen' and has invested in me new respect and admiration for her talent.  The contrast between Jennifer's `One Night Only' and Beyonce's is fun and then there are Eddie Murphy's contributions that are just wonderful!  This is a great album that is sure to make the fan happy, boasting some of the best R&B cuts in recent years.  Finally a Hollywood musical is all more about the singing and less about the star power (that's not to say these talents aren't stars, they truly shine, but it's about time they cast actors with vocals instead of popularity!)
1401907717|5.0|One of my new year's resolutions is to work my way through this book without stopping, from January 1st to December 31st. This is one resolution I won't have to talk myself into keeping!<br /><br /> Since buying this one, I have given it to at least one friend and probably will pass it on again. I keep it on my nightstand and read a message every morning before getting out of bed. It's such a great way to start the day off with a positive spin, instead of immediately jumping into the day's problems (real or imagined) and getting yourself all worked up. I am one of those people who sometimes forgets to ask for angelic assistance when I should, so for me this book is a great way to redirect my focus and ask for help each morning. As mentioned by other reviewers, each message is wonderfully warm and uplifting, like getting a hug from one of your angels. Also included on each page is an affirmation or prayer for the day. Usually these are brief, to the point, and easy to remember, which means that you can reflect on them during quiet moments throughout your day, or whenever you need reassurance that your angels are nearby. The messages are a quick and easy read, but bring such healing and reassurance! You can read them in their numbered order or just open at random, and achieve the same goal. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it is non-denominational. Where there is a mention of God, it is very neautral and not at all judgemental. You do not need to be a Christian - or practice any particular religion for that matter - to benefit from the messages of the angels; she makes it clear that the angels' assistance and love is for everyone, no matter what your spiritual beliefs or situation. This means you could give this book to almost anyone and not be afraid of offending them, or that they will not understand the message.<br /><br />This book was well worth my money! As I said earlier, I would not hesitate to pass it on to loved ones who need a Divine boost. It comes highly recommended. If you love angels, or even if you are just going through a rough time, you will not be disappointed.. It comes highly recommended. If you love angels, or even if you are just going through a rough time, you will not be disappointed.
6304698623|5.0|I remember as a young kid watching this and many other movies like it and loving them, and now that I'm older my wife has decided we should revisit them (most of which she herself hasn't ever seen) and see if that stack up as adult entertainment.  This one surely does for its as enchanting as it is engrossing, and with a very talented cast of youngsters it stands out as a very well acted children's film.   <br /> <br />As Sara, Liesel Matthews does a wonderful job portraying a young sense of maturity as she gets left in a private boarding school while her father is away at war.  The school is run with an iron fist by Miss Minchen (Eleanor Bron), in fact such an iron fist that it had me wondering if anyone could really be that cruel to a child.  Sara bucks Minchen authority, but it's not till ill gotten word arrives regarding Sara's father that Minchen pulls out all the tricks, taking everything Sara owns and putting her in the attic with the servant girl Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester).   <br /> <br />The story is sad at times, even downright depressing, but it all works out in the end as all children's movies generally do, and it's one that you can enjoy as a family, not one you suffer through for the sake of your kids.
B000003C2S|4.0|This is Deaths 3rd cd and while it is quite good, it hasnt aged as well as other releases (leprosy,ITP ect..). The lyrics are quite basic as i believe Chuck was trying to branch out a little here. Talking about subjects like Abortion, Preachers and degenerates. Not Satanic or ghoulish. but musically it is really good. Especially \\"Altering the Future\\",\\"Low Life\\" and the title track.<br /><br />He had a new backing band again on this release.<br /><br />Great for its time, but still not scratching the surface of what future Death cds would offer.
B00005JOCU|4.0|I can honestly say that I have never been in a theater where so many people were cheering and whistling and giving shout-outs to the actors in my life, and while at times it was entertaining in itself, and at one point down right comical, I've decided that I never want to sit through that again.  I'm the type of guy that likes to watch my movies in silence, so I can get everything the first time and not have to watch it again because I missed a whole scene because the idiot in front of me decided to get out his lighter (serious, that happened).  THAT aside, `Dreamgirls' was a great experience.  While not as great as the hype would suggest, I've learned that to almost always be true and thus forgo the hype when walking through the cinema doors.   <br /> <br />`Dreamgirls' chronicles the careers of Supremes knockoffs `The Dreams', Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Effie (Jennifer Hudson).  Singing together for years they have strived to make it to the top, and one night after singing in a competition and catching the ear of aspiring producer Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) they get their big break singing backup for superstar James `Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy).  Effie immediately stands out as the backbone and spokesperson of the group, giving Curtis a hard time about the mere fact they are singing backup.  Her persistence both pays off and in a way breaks her down as Curtis decides to make them stars, moving Deena to the front of the band and in a way moving Effie out completely. <br /> <br />The movie succeeds to sheer brilliance when its female costars are acting through song, Hudson earning her soon to be Oscar with her gut wrenching `And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' while Beyonce blew me away with her equally powerful `Listen' which gave me Goosebumps.  The film has everything going for it, and while it's not perfect, it's not too far off either.  I still feel that some past musicals (`Chicago' & `Moulin Rouge' come to mind) are better films,but what makes `Dreamgirls' so outstanding is that they got the feeling, the singing and the actins spot on.  Unlike say `Chicago', `Dreamgirls' doesn't have ONE bad note in the singing department.   <br /> <br />This film is one of the better cast films I've ever seen, every acting playing their role to perfection.  Eddie Murphy gave a career best here, Beyonce underplayed splendidly (it was nice to see her not try to be the center of attention, and so for me in a lot of ways she stood out), Anika Noni Rose does wonderfully as the naïve member of the group, Danny Glover is great here as is Keith Robinson, and while I'm not a Foxx fan I will admit that he fit nicly here.  The real star though was newcomer Jennifer Hudson who can not only sing circles around the rest of the cast but is such a talented actress, and for her first role, I mean come on.  If you can't se the talent then you're utterly blind.
B000AU9UYM|2.0|This movie is a futuristic Bat-Man, unlike the original, which took place in a 1930s big city. Gotham is futuristic and Batman's new gizmos are also, including the new Batmobile, which I thought was the biggest flop. The original Batmobile at least looked somewhat good, this one is some sort of an army \\"tank\\" vehicle that looks like a kid's radio toy -- bulky, with huge wheels and plain ugly. The first half of this film is visually pleasing, as Christopher Nolan no doubt can do (the opening scenes of a Tibetan-like snowy landscape is stunning). But then the novelty wears off and the second half is boring due to endless explosions, fires, fighting, and typical action sequences, where the camera moves so fast, you can't even see what's going on. This movie turned out to be one of the usual Hollywood action-packed films that constantly throw one-second action footage in your face, decreasing still further your attention span. I fast forwarded the end of the movie. It was interesting to see Katie Holmes on screen, but I though she was the weakest character -- she was too cutesy for her role as a serious DA prosecutor. Give me a break. With her big brown eyes, she looks like she wouldn't hurt a fly and she is in a role trying to send criminals to prisons. The themes presented in this movie are not original at all -- the idea of whether sacrificing some people for the benefit of all is morally justified, about who you are on the inside vs the outside, and the eastern philosophy of mastering yourself. Just some good old ideas which are given one more round in this movie. When is there going to be a worthwhile movie that will make you think for yourself? <br />
B000J10ERO|1.0|I think this is the most boring movie that I saw this year!  And then again, maybe it suffered because I saw \\"Casino Royale\\" in the same day.  Bond = Action! Superman Returns &lt;> Action!  Maybe I've become jaded, but I expect action from a superhero movie.  Look at Batman Begins, X-Men: The Last Stand, My Super Ex-Girlfriend.  They all had action.  This movie has none.  And he is supposed to be Superman.  The greatest hero of all.  The writing is dull.  The characters are dull.  The acting is dull.  Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey are brilliant actors, but there was nothing for them to do in this movie.  Truly sad.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|This may well have been a documentary of marine life, but to make a movie, it requires you have a plot. A definite purpose to the story. There WAS NO STORY! The lead character shed no blood, saw no action, except for the sex with his girlfriend, and the only time he fired his weapon was during TARGET PRACTICE! There, now you know the entire jist of the movie and you were not bored to death for two hours like I was!

B000JSI7DK|2.0|Whats the meaning of buying the Blu ray if there are no extras, especially for older movies. <br />The same old marketing trick is on again. They will first publish plain movies (again) on BD, then they will publish director cuts, then collectors editions, then special editions etc. etc. <br />I will not buy any BDs just because they are plain BD copies. Consumers should demand more content in BDs.

1597371416|5.0|I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.<br /><br />This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.<br /><br />I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book.

B00008G6V6|5.0|This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film.
B000J103PC|5.0|Anne Hathaway can carry a movie, but Golden Globe winner Meryl Streep can clean and jerk it to bell ringing, knee slapping heights. This is the best chemistry between protagonist and antagonist since the game warden met Bugs Bunny in his office (\\"I'm game.\\")<br /><br />The journey begins as a coming of age, Gee, what will I do, angst driven plot typical for the genre but expertly executed and finds the most likeable of characters, Ms. Hathaway's 20ish Andrea Sachs, pitted against the hard driving Miranda Priestly, the editor of a large fashion mag, whom Ms. Streep plays as a careerist with blinders. Her mission is to dictate trends that filter down to even the drabbest of outfits, much like the one Andrea sports during a fitting. Miranda hires Andrea to the great surprise of her other assistant, played with proper comical paranoia by Golden Glober Emily Blunt, who dismisses Andrea as an unfashionable outcast, ill-prepared for the onslaught which is Priestly.<br /><br />The tide turns, however, and a fable is born when Andrea finds her soul usurped and her choice of career justified by the success she seems to enjoy and the challenges she seems to meet, all to the consternation of her boyfriend and her former wardrobe. The fable turns to involve Andrea's boyfriend and her in house ally played by a suddenly-I'm-gay Stanley Tucci, and we're in for a treat when she and Miranda bare their souls. And there's no funnier scene in a picture this year than Miranda dispensing with her bag and coat in a series of edits that sent me roaring with tears.<br /><br />\\"The Devil\\" may be a chick flick, but I'm a 49 year old married man who digs a good story with a series of themes that anyone can relate to, and a set of characters so well drawn that, well, Bugs would be proud.
B000002WE9|3.0|This concert album was recorded live March 20, 1974 in Memphis.  It was Elvis' fifth live album, not counting albums that were partially live.  The entire concert is not on this CD, but the whole concert has recently been released on a different CD.  I would call this an average Elvis concert.  There are several songs that have been on too many concert albums; like \\"See See Rider\\", \\"I Got a Woman\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"An American Trilogy\\" and of course \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\".  The highlights of this CD are the gospel songs, which always brought out the best in Elvis.  He performed three of them this time around; \\"How Great Thou Art\\" (always a powerful performance), \\"Help Me\\" (he had recently recorded this song, this is the first live recording) and \\"Why Me Lord\\" (first recording of this song, J.D. Sumner sings the verses and Elvis sings the chorus).  This album also includes Elvis' first recording of \\"Let Me Be There\\", which was Olivia Newton-John's first big hit.  I might mention that the Loggins & Messina hit \\"Your Mama Don't Dance\\" is part of the \\"Rock and Roll Medley\\", but the King only sings a tiny portion of that song.  One final thing worth mentioning; the piano player plays the intro to \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" and Elvis sings \\"Blueberry Hill\\" instead, just to be funny (he does soon switch over to \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\").  If you really want this concert on CD, you'll probably want the complete show instead of this one, but that is an expensive import.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I never thought there was any need for this alternate part of Superman II.  Richard Donner's alternate version of Superman II contains too much Brando and not enough action.  Donner's cut does show more of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor but I think Marlon Brando's footage is unnecessary.  I preferred having Susannah York talking to Superman than Brando.  I think it is better talking to your mother about affairs of the heart than the father.  But where's that great action scenes when the villains destroy that small town?  It is also unforgivable to change any part of that great fight scene in Metropolis between Superman and the villains.  I don't care who directed the scene, it is my all time favorite fight scenes in movie history. Donner's cut of the climax of the Foretress of Solitude is boring.  These scenes should have been part of DVD extras to Superman II.  If you want to put a Superman movie back together, recut Superman IV for it to make sense.  They should have left well enough alone.
B0000009NH|4.0|Hunky Dory takes Bowie's sexual ambiguity and runs with it.  He hasn't completely donned the entertainer's mask yet; there are flashes of humanity, like \\"Kooks\\" (a touching song for his son) on the breathlessly eclectic whirlwind.  Bowie tips his hat to forefathers Lou Reed (\\"Queen Bitch\\") and Andy Warhol (\\"Andy Warhol\\"), while \\"Changes\\" and \\"Oh, You Pretty Things\\" herald the coming of a confused, flamboyant post-hippie style glitter.<br /><br />This version of the CD features four bonus tracks.  \\"Bombers\\" is a previously unreleased song recorded at the same sessions as this album.  \\"The Supermen\\" was on Bowie's previous album; the version here was re-recorded at the Hunky Dory sessions.  There is also a demo version of \\"Quicksand\\" and an alternate mix of \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\".

B000002952|5.0|This is the sound of a brilliant career reaching its apex. Unless Gloria Estefan surprises us with a turn no one could anticipate, MI TIERRA will go down as the best music she ever produced.<br /><br />That's no small statement, since Ms. Estefan has been wowing fans with one top-selling album after another from back in the days of the Miami Sound Machine.<br /><br />I first came to know Gloria as a Latin singer while I was living in Latin America. Only subsequently did I become fully exposed to her English-language pop persona.  Though Gloria was only two when her family emigrated to the US from Cuba and is therefore fully bilingual and bicultural, my opinion has always been that she excels when performing in Spanish.<br /><br />MI TIERRA may well prove the point.<br /><br />Backed up by rhythm and sound of astonishing consistency, Gloria sings a dozen winners (that's twelve out of twelve) on this CD despite some daring and unconventional moves ('Montuno' and 'Tradici&oacute;n').<br /><br />Surprisingly, her opening gambit ('Con los a&ntilde;os que me quedan') got the lion's share of this album's air time in spite of it not being the strongest piece of the puzzle. The gem among the dozen is 'Mi Tierra', which I believe to be the most poignant musical statement of the emigrant's dilemma ever peformed. There is a moment  in this song when, amidst the nostalgic description of old Habana's streets and alleys, Ms. Estefan asks, 'Can I ever go back there? ... *Yo no s&eacute;*' (= 'I don't know'). The three-syllable staccato of her ambiguous reply touches every emigrant's secret knowledge that you can never truly go back to where you came from. Her unexpected response to a self-posed question leaps out and grabs you by the throat. It is one of Gloria's finest moments and a hypothetical pickle that events in her native land may soon give her an opportunity to confirm or refute.<br /><br />'No hay mal que por bien no venga' projects the Latin American spunk and survivability that make it a region to grow old in with a smile.<br /><br />Estefan has never had the pure horsepower of Latin stalwarts like, say, the late Celia Cruz. But whatever she has lacked in natural talent has been more than compensated by the class, consistency, and good public citizenship that she has exercised now into the stage of mature motherhood.<br /><br />I hope she exceeds MI TIERRA. But I can't imagine it happening.as never had the pure horsepower of Latin stalwarts like, say, the late Celia Cruz.

B000003TA4|5.0|Why Kurt Cobain is a Hero <br /> <br />1. He killed 80s rock and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br />2. At the 1992 VMAs, he challenged MTV, refusing to play \\"Teen Spirit,\\" prefering \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"New Poopie\\" as better songs to perform for the MTV audiences (then likely 12-25 year olds, now 8-11 year olds). They settled on \\"Lithium\\" (a great song in its own right, lyrical and vocal art). He played the opening to \\"Rape Me\\" to spook MTV Executives, and quickly changed while MTV briefly went off air.  <br /> <br />3. He made a hit single named after girl's deoderant <br /> <br />4. The Rolling Stone names him one of the greatest guitarists ever, even though he only uses power chords. I can play Nirvana songs <br /> <br />5. Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" was released a month before \\"Nevermind,\\" but didn't start selling oodles of units until a month after \\"Nevermind\\"'s release, during the \\"Teen Spirit\\" craze.  <br /> <br />6. He played almost all B-Side songs in his Unplugged set, which is haled as the best Unplugged ever done, and one of the best live performances in the 90s, and in 20th Century music <br /> <br />7. He  burned out as a Martyr instead of fading out like a tool <br /> <br />8. \\"Teen Spirit\\" was spun some 60 times a week on the average American radio station <br /> <br />9. \\"Nevermind\\" started the alternative movement, dragging lesser known bands like Dinosaur Jr, Mudhoney, the Meat Puppets and the Melvins closer to the mainstream. <br /> <br />10. Nevermind was named by WBCN in Boston as the 6th best rock album of all time. It does not have one bad note on it. It truly is the best album of the 90s, and the 80s for that matter. Kurt Cobain flipped off everyone who bought this album, and still sold CDs. He might have sold out, but his punky rebellion is not lost in this album.
055358202X|4.0|Yes, I know this isn't the second book but, from what I can see, it really is the beginning of Act 2 of this series. We are transitioning from the first story arc - The initial game of thrones between those aspiring to the iron throne to something new.   <br /> <br />Second acts are hard to write and don't always get executed properly. Those who would argue that Martin is in need of an editor may well be right, I have to say, sometimes I wondered where the book was going. However, I also realize that is part of the problem in discussing the current situation in westeros. The key players have largely died or exhausted themselves in an orgy of violence that has left the whole country desolate and starving. Add to this an impending winter and something freaky over the wall and things look pretty bleak for the common folk. If one is looking for major plot shifts, you probably arent going to find them here.  <br /> <br />What you find is an attempt to write a story about the bleak aftermath of a major war where the key parties care more about their own pride and power than they do about their subjects. I was impressed with the attempt and plan to pick up the next book but I cant give this a 5 star review for many of the problems others speak of here.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Director Oliver Stone's perhaps most ambitious and controversial work is laden with an all-star cast, including Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Jack Lemon, Ed Asner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland and Walter Matthau among others. Stone seemingly makes a big deal of this film, and the film captures a grandiose nature intended for such a big moment in American history. Like it or hate it, and there are many reviewers on both sides of this fence, this film is engrossing, fascinating, and captivating in terms of its production. The director doesn't seemingly leave any rock unturned without some type of explanation into what happened before, during and after the assassination of JFK. While many may disagree with the theories depicted in the film, the larger question that the film seemingly asks about not only JFK, but America is \\"What if?\\" What if things that were presented after the assassination weren't as crystal clear as we had thought they were? JFK certainly brings to the forefront an important day in American history, and questions the nature of what is real and what is illusion, and, for these reasons, I feel as though this is a film that everyone should see.  <br /> <br />Kevin Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is outstanding, and he illustrates the very essence of a man who questions why Kennedy died that day in Dallas. While his investigation is momentous in its own right, it also is not a popular one in the public eye. After the assassination, he takes apart piece by piece not only those who might have been present or implicated in some way to that event, but reconstructs the entire time frame beforehand leading up to the assassination. He only manages to make some head way when he begins to \\"ruffle some feathers\\", such as an investigation into the CIA, FBI and even those in Congress. He also is able to reconstruct a time table for the whereabouts of Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Garrisonworks tirelessly and laboriously to the point where it not only affects the support of those around him, but also his family life. As the man obsessed with discovering the truth, Garrison puts it best when talking with reporters, \\"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.\\"  <br /> <br />Garrison is able to get to question some key figures in this case, such as Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), David Ferry (Kevin Bacon), and a man who goes by the name \\"X\\" (Donald Sutherland). Garrison asserts that things aren't as clear as they should be, and that his staff needs to think on a different level if they want evidence to build this case. Motives for why others would have wanted to kill JFK are questioned, and eventually he is able to get a case against Clay Shaw as being an accessory to the president's murder.  <br /> <br />The film seemingly questions many different theories about what could have actually happened that day. For instance, Garrison questions over how 3 shots could have been fired in 6 seconds. He also excavates the shoddy job of investigation immediately after the president was killed. Oswald's role in the crime is debated, whether he could have been a decoy or fall guy for someone else, and Garrison questions some of the testimonies of the witnesses immediately following the shooting, namely Oswald's wife.  <br /> <br />The film also depicts the violent and tumultuous times that were the 1960s, and equates them with JFK's assassination. Not only was JFK targeted, but other leaders such as Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were killed during this era. The chaos and disorder and ultimate disbelief that were experienced by Americans during this time period are a statement as to how our outlooks can change in a relatively brief time when facing difficulties and painful moments.  <br /> <br />Oliver Stone's film, as daring and controversial as it is, is quite an engrossing and powerful epic. The larger than life quality of the film is only minimized by thesignificant event it is investigating, and losing our president on that day was certainly a shocking tragedy to Americans. JFK is one of those rare movies that should be seen by everyone, whether you agree with its theories or not.
B00003CXD0|5.0|This is simply the best comedy of all time! Dustin Hoffman is spectacular in this movie, why he didnt win an oscar I'll never know. I totally fell in love with Jessica Lange in this movie,she is brilliant and stunning. This is one of those movies when the script was right,they had the right cast,the right crew, everything. I would recommend this movie to everybody! I do have one question when the heck are we gonna get a better edition of it like those so called special or collectors editions with special features like interviews and maybe bloopers or something!!?
B00004T0PZ|5.0|this is a symphonic work composed by a jazz artist in the american symphonic tradition of charles ives and aaron copeland. where most symphonic composers include folk songs within their compositions, coleman in his skies includes references from his own previous work, most recognizibly is the theme from dancing in your head.    he makes evident he's a jazz artist by playing his alto, the first time in the composition, in the aptly entitled, the artist in america.    place in space is the quintessential theme for all space travel, actual and cinematic.    the men who live in the white house is a piece for solo alto sax, a tribute to the holders of america's highest office, metaphorically: a position high as the sky, one more american sky.    this is a marvelous piece of work, a great accomplishment. would that this symphonic work were performed more in concert halls.

This book was AWESOME!  It was a quick, easy read that was packed with information.  I learned more than I needed too, but enough to feel comfortable with teaching the basics.  This book is a must for any teacher or even anyone interested in the art of Comics.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a dysfunctional family drama that follows the trials and tribulations of six family members as they trek cross-country in their crumbling VW bus in an attempt to get the youngest, Olive, to a Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.<br /><br />Perhaps the most endearing thing about Little Miss Sunshine isn't it's intimate look inside the slightly twisted hearts of its six main characters.  It isn't the off-kilter comedy of its road-trip plot.  It isn't even the almost flawless acting of young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the precocious young girl with dreams of being a beauty pageant winner.<br /><br />No, what makes this movie truly unique is how it takes what could be a rote plot contrivance (Will she win the pageant?) and turns it on its head (SHOULD she win the pageant?).  By the time the family reaches the end of their difficult journey (having endured mechanical failures, an uncomfortably close experience with death, and even the saving grace of pornographic magazines) they are moving on auto-pilot, doggedly moving ahead simply because that has been their purpose.  When they reach the pageant, though, instead of a moving moment of self-redemption, it serves as a grotesque reminder that sometimes dreams are less important than the reasons those dreams exist in the first place.<br /><br />This movie is, after all, about people who have failed.  Greg Kinnear plays with exquisite desperation the patriarch, Richard, a failed motivational speaker (and, no, the irony isn't lost on him).  Dwayne is a typically-rebellious young teen who follows the teachings of Nietzsche and has sworn to a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force fighter pilot.  Alan Arkin is the foul-mouthed, drug-addicted grandfather, searching for his own version of contentment in his life's twilight years.  Toni Collette is absolutely perfect as the mother, Sheryl, who has made this frazzled family the locus of her own frazzled life.  And Steve Carell shines, cast against type as the once-eminent Proust scholar, Frank, who is attempting to recover after losing his lover, his job, and his will to keep on living.<br /><br />Given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.  Never does the film indulge in the kind of shameless self-congratulatory lesson-learning that dysfunctional family comedies are so rife with these days.  We are treated, instead, to a tender and yet unflinching look at these people and how they struggle.  This is, quite obviously, a family of losers (in whatever way you want to define that word), but -- as we are shown in the final scenes -- in a world that is sickeningly obsessed with winning, being a loser is nothing to be ashamed of.e Carell shines, cast against type as the once-eminent Proust scholar, Frank, who is attempting to recover after losing his lover, his job, and his will to keep on living. <br /> <br />Given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.

B00005TQKQ|5.0|By virtue of transferring V8 tape to DV, I became aware of the image quality before and after head cleaning.  After cleaning, the video was considerably better, clearer and with better color quality even though the tapes were 15 years old.  Cleaning the tape heads was extremely easy and well worth the very reasonable price.  Buy one and use it.  You'll like the results.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|It was with this movie that I found out that Johnny Depp was such an adept actor. He has acted in my movies and they are all very different characters that he has played previously. I enjoyed this movie because it gave a whole new spin on the old version of the movie. I really liked and enjoyed the new spin with new music and a new Willy Wonka character. You will really enjoy this version. It is for the whole family!!!
0441009425|4.0|A fine rampaging space opera.  It operates on a large scale with a complex plot, but it easily grabbed and held my attention throughout.<br /><br />There are flaws: it starts with three distinct narrative strands which are separated in both space and time, which makes for a confusing beginning, especially as there are also lots of references to non-shared past events.  Additionally, the characters sometimes seem to know too much about the plot: at the end they make rather too many correct assumptions about what is happening, when there are many other options.<br /><br />But the book has a brisk pace and the central characters, while unsympathetic, are at least interesting.  (The secondary characters, including Sylveste's wife, can be a little tedious.)  Overall, good readable fun.
B000002UTY|5.0|Originally released in 1969, this was QMS'S second album. This is what some might call REAL late '60's 'acid rock'. Some of the guitar playing on this lp is the best I've heard in sometime. First six tracks center around their cover of Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love?\\". Completely caught me off guard. Also dug \\"Mona\\" and the thirteen minute \\"Calvary\\". Was fortunate enough to catch the only two still-living Quicksilver members (Gary Duncan and David Freiberg) recently as opener for a revived line-up of Jefferson Starship. Ironically enough, their hour-plus set started and ended with them playing Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love?\\". Essential.
0515142247|1.0|One overly generous star because that's the least I'm allowed to assign this awful novel.  I read \\"Killing Floor\\" and, because it was his first novel, I excused the errors and cliches and detailed ad nauseum descriptions of bullet weights, velocities and trajectories. I gave Mr. Child a second chance and began reading his \\"Die Trying\\".  Bad decision.  Errors galore in \\"Die Trying\\".  I still have another 30 pages to read and I am trying, trying hard, to finish them.  Hate to quit a book once I begin and I've never given up this late in a novel.   <br /> <br />Mr. Child has a favorite line that begins, \\"Some kind of . . .\\".  He fills the pages with this expression.  Super hero Reacher spots an armored vehicle moving thru Montana's mountainous forest (quite a trick, actually) and he says, \\"Some kind of Personnel Carrier\\".  Heroine Holly has a glowing character, so Child writes, \\"Some kind of radiant energy\\".  Some kind of this and some kind of that.  He uses that line on page after page.   <br /> <br />Errors are rampant.  An M16A2 rifle, Mr. Child writes, fires three-round bursts, each round taking one fifth of a second.  So he explains that the entire three-round sequence takes one point five seconds.  Okay, he's a novelist and not a mathemetician but someone at Jove Books ought to be able to multiply one fifth of a second times three and come up with an answer somewhere below a second and a half.   <br /> <br />Some kind of a terrible book.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Directed by Terry Gilliam, The Brothers Grimm is a feast for the eyes as well as an intriguing story of two con artists (the brothers) who go to a village expecting to fleece the peasants only to find that the curse is real and they have no idea how to free the village girls.  <br /> <br />The French, who now rule this part of Germany, have decided the Grimm brothers will get to the bottom of the curse or die trying and maybe die anyway depending on the mood of the ruler and the torturer. The Grimms are desperate to solve the puzzle -- and try to pull the threads of stories together to figure out what is going on. They're helped by a women shunned by the villagers but whose sister was taken and who is looking for her father.  <br /> <br />There are tons of fairy tales in the piece and its fun trying to pick them out of the background and the foreground story as everyone flails around trying to find a way to get the village girls back, avoid death by anyone and everyone and get out of this predicament alive. <br /> <br />There's adventure, comedy, drama, daring do, and high jinx and over the top acting. But it's fun and time well spent if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours.
B00005JPGM|4.0|An intense searing drama based on the stuff of real life, Blood Diamond is just as compelling and powerful now as it would have been at least 20 years ago or more--that's at least how long the rank corruption in the diamond trade has been going on (probably much, much longer than 20 years). From South Africa to Sierra Leone--the setting for this film--to Antwerp to your local high-priced jeweler, diamonds have been and still are gems born out of nightmares.<br /><br />People kill for gold and do the same for diamonds. Here, in Sierra Leone--show to be just as potent a source for them as South Africa--children are brainwashed and taught to wield and shoot automatic weapons at anyone and everyone their commanding officer tells them to kill. Here we find Leonardo di Caprio, sporting a pitch-perfect South African accent, as Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler who ultimately lets his heart command him rather than his greed, and also Solomon Vandy, a Sierra Leone native (Djimon Hounsou in a great performance) whose son has been kidnapped by the bloodthirsty rebel militia and who himself finds a very large pink diamond, worth millions. And here we also find Maddie Bowen, an American female journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, whose own sense of humanity is tested in the face of horrendous events<br /><br />While a lot of the above may sound cliched, the combination of outstanding performances (Di Caprio has by now come so far from both Gangs of New York and Titanic that it is truly remarkable) and the unrelentingly brutal violence of greed-based corrupted life essentially blows away the possibility of a trite piece of work. The director, Edward Zwick, has crafted a powerful film that hits home like very few other cinematic works this season.<br /><br />In the film, the Van de Kaap diamond collective--all too obviously standing in for the De Boers organization (the largest diamond trading outfit in the world)--is shown to be totally complacent regarding the horrifying atrocities committed in the name of freedom but really centered on the lust for wealth diamonds represent.<br /><br />While it is true that the ending does bleed into the melodramatic, the shocking reality of the truth of what has gone before dispels this. This is a film that everyone should see...and that should make you stop and think, if nothing else, before buying an engagement ring or any other diamond-based piece of jewelry.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.atrocities committed in the name of freedom but really centered on the lust for wealth diamonds represent. <br /> <br />While it is true that the ending does bleed into the melodramatic, the shocking reality of the truth of what has gone before dispels this.

B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a great movie for a rainy, cold night at home. You'll laugh, sit on the edge of your seat, and sing along with the outstanding music!<br /><br />The music is one of the best parts of this movie. The storyline is good, as well. The acting is super.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B000002ARV|5.0|And it is one of my all time favorites!!!!!! <br />I got it when Wherehouse music was going out of business-all the cassettes were 1/2 off.  I got it just because I had \\"heard of\\" Johnny Winter.  So I drove home with about 7 tapes and listened to this one and then the next........  A week later I was thinking of the songs on it and have been a fan since.  Its got that vibe that great records have.  I was floored by the slide work.I love this album.  It is unlike his other albums as he is avid blues player.  But on this album and another he lets go and rocks with the best.  Give this one a chance and see what you think. <br />
1570428654|5.0|I laughed until I cried with this tape set!<br /><br />I mistakenly listened (at bedtime) to David Sedaris read his own material. I stayed up half the night - unable to turn it off.<br /><br />Mr. Sedaris is dry, witty, and has a unique approach to making the \\"everyday\\" into something special.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the content, but this one is worthy of a listen.

B000F5GNX8|2.0|Like hanging out with a generous drug dealer, \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" sounds like it might be fun at first but midstride turns uncomfortable, disappointing and a bit embarrassing for all participating parties. Other than the ADD-intensive screenwriter's affinity for tangents that lead back to nowhere and leave the actors dancing in place, Val Kilmer is definitely the worst offender here, looking genuinely perturbed that he has to spend time away from his ostrich ranch to earn a decent buck. I have to interject for a moment: Why is it that Kilmer's face has gotten so damn puffy, like human blowfish John Travolta and Will Shatner? For that matter, do you recall how puffed up Jerry Lewis' face got after he underwent neurostimulation? Like a flesh-filled watermelon! Downey just looks like he's in pain, and hell, I don't know from personal experience, but I can imagine the reality he must have been forced to endure might have felt like coming out into sunlight on full blast after living in a hermetically sealed box. Michelle Monaghan is a vision to behold, but, in an award-repelling role, quickly reveals herself to be nothing more than a purty package who's been studying the acting skills of Joan Van Ark from \\"Knots Landing.\\"
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I'll skip all the plot details, etc. that have been covered ad nauseum.  This is a fun horror movie with a decent plot (for a horror movie) and some great overall spookiness.  I actually found it to be a little haunting by the time it was over; I wanted to see it again within the first week. <br /> <br />If you're a casual enjoyer of horror films like I am, then this is probably a movie for you!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Since I am not big fan of the \\"indie\\" movie boom, I have, in the past, missed out on a number of good movies when they were in their theatrical releases. The newly released drama / comedy `Little Miss Sunshine' falls into that category for me. I missed it in the theatre and decided to take a chance on it when it came out on DVD. About halfway though the movie, I thought to myself that I had made the right decision not to shell out the money to see it in a theatre. However the last twenty minutes of the film simply blew me away, and made the entire first half of the movie worth watching. <br /> <br />`Little Miss Sunshine' is the story of Olive, a cute but dumpy seven year old, obsessed with beauty pageants. Olive's immediate and extended family put the D in dysfunctional. Her father (Greg Kinnear) is a wanna be motivational speaker, her brother Dwayne is a Nietzsche disciple who has taken a vow of silence to escape his family's insanity, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) has a heroine habit, her uncle (Steve Carell) is on suicide watch, and her mother is struggling just to keep herself together. Through a series of events she and her entire family are forced to pack themselves into an old VW bus and head to California so she can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. What ensues is a collection of funny, awkward, and downright hilarious moments as each family member attemps to put aside their own problems to help little Olive's dream come true. <br /> <br />I will admit, as a whole this movie will not appeal to everyone, and half way though many will begin to wonder if the rest of the movie is worth sitting though. Trust me it is. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie contain some of the most truly funny moments I have seen in a film in a long time. If you are offended by rough language, then you should think twice before buying or renting this movie, the F word is used quite often, and I know some may find that objectionable. If you think you can handle the language, then you should check this one out, it is definitely worth your time. <br /> <br />
B000KZ3BWE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and downloaded it on Amazon's Unbox. It was just as shocking both times that I saw it. People have taken issue with how the movie presented its facts and figures. The truth is that Science is not something so simple that you can read a magazine and know all there is about a topic. Al Gore has done his best, via this medium, to present the case that Global Warming is a fact and not a theory. Errors were made, but the overwhelming consensus by scientists who have seen the film is that it gives the best presentation to the public that can be given. Al Gore presented the information in a way that most of us can easily understand and the errors were minor and did not detract from the overall truth of his messege. <br /> <br />I keep hearing about the so-called Oregon Petiton, where thousands of scientists rejected the Kyoto Agreement. This petition was circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which specilizes in biochemistry, diagnostic medicine, nutrition, preventive medicine and the molecular biology of aging. These sciences have nothing, whatsoever, to do with sciences that research global warming. Sciences that do include: physics, geophysics, climatology, meteorology, oceanography, and environmental science. No verification was made of any of the signatories credentials, so you could claim to be anything and the OISM would let it stand. In fact, many of the signatories were linked to companies like Exxon and their public mouthpieces that try to head-off the environmentalist movement. <br /> <br />People are alarmed that taking action against global warming will have disasterous effect upon our economy and stall the advances of technology. Given that the technology already exists that can reverse much of the causes of global warming, there is little evidence that the naysayer's claims are true. People made similar claims in the 1800s about how devastating it would be if we abolished slavery in the US. The economic suffering it would cause, etc. Well, here we are, over 140 years later and I doubt if you could find anyone today who would say that abolishing slavery was a bad thing. <br /> <br />Al Gore wasn't making the case that we should abandon our cars and live in mud huts. He wants us all to take the steps we have available that can save our way of life, so that future generations have a world they can live in.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|In the 1980's I was a huge fan of the `Miami Vice' television series. In spite of the fact that I have seen every episode ever produced, at least twice, I have managed to grow up, keep a job and find a wife. When I heard that they were finally going to make a big screen version, you may have guessed that I was quite excited. Imagine my disappointment when what was actually released bared absolutely no resemblance to the television series that spawned an entire genre. The motion picture release of `Miami Vice' simply borrows the names of the original characters and the music video style and \\"re-imagines\\" them in modern day Miami.    Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are the best undercover vice cops on the force, and due to an undetermined leak inside the Justice Department, they are called in to assist the FBI in brining down a group of domestic terrorists. As the detectives and their team begin to infiltrate the seamy underbelly of the organization they soon realize that they have an opportunity to fry a much bigger fish in the person of an international drug and arms broker. Unfortunately, with bigger rewards there must also be greater risks, and so our hero's find themselves on the ragged edge of the law without a net, and very little margin for error.    In my opinion, the plot of the film borrows heavily (very heavily) from one of the television episodes titled \\"Smugglers Blues\\" which co-starred Glen Frey (The Eagles) who had a hit song at the time with the same title. Had this movie simply carried a different title, I think it would have done far better than it has, both critically and in overall viewer ship. With the title, came an overabundance of expectations which writer/director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Heat, The Insider, Collateral)had no intention of living up to. In spite of the visually stunning look of the film, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent (rumor has it that the shoot was not a pleasant place to be withall of the egos vying for screen time), and the story itself seems to bog down too often, leading up to the explosive climax one has come to expect from a Mann directed film. Although the run time for the unrated directors cut is listed at 140 minutes, it feels quite a bit longer. I think it's because, for several stretches of the movie, it just feels like nothing actually happens. I wanted to like it, I tried to like, but I just didn't like it. I would try it before you buy it.
B0006J28L4|5.0|El Haj Malik El Shabazz is a personal hero of mine; a man I admire and consider to be a truly great human being.  This might not be anything out of the ordinary were it not for the fact that I am a 45 year old white man with a now deceased Italian Mother who said \\"he never said anything I didn't agree with\\".  The Power Of Truth in the words one speaks is an awesome thing.  Upon reading the Autobiography Of Malcolm X in the early 1980's I really couldn't relate to it or understand it until the Spike Lee Movie brought it to life for me in 1992.  As I watched with great interest on the screen what seemed to be even more removed from what I had read in the book I began to realize that I was ignorant of the facts of the Man's life thanks to the media in this country who had only shown me the Pre-Mecca Malcolm, bombarding we paranoid whites with \\"hate speech\\" sound bites on black-and-white film, while at the same time totally ignoring the wonderful and inspiring transformation Malcolm underwent on his 1964 trip to The Holy Land.  As I see it, what makes a man great is his capacity for positive change at any cost when the end goal is the welfare of ALL people.  I'm quite sure at his most basic human level, like all of us Malcolm desired to live a long life, but like others before and after he chose the more dangerous and eventually fatal path of exposing to the world the ugliness of American Racism.  We were preaching to South Africa, Cuba and the Belgian Congo about the righteousness of our way of life while we were treating our African American citizens like sub-humans.  After all, all Malcolm was asking for was American Justice for his People, and like others he paid the ultimate price for it, but his legacy vindicates his efforts.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|The central challenge to all actors is to create characters that the audience can relate to, and that are believable.  There is a spectrum of difficulty, depending on the character.  Jerry Seinfeld playing Jerry Seinfeld in \\"Seinfeld\\" is on the simple end of the spectrum.  No disrespect is intended here, as \\"Seinfeld\\" is probably my favorite TV show of all time.<br /><br />The characters played by Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers lie on the difficult end of the spectrum.  These parts should come with warnings for actors.  Let's start with the character of Bree (Huffman).  She is asked to play a man, who is in the midst of a transgender procedure.  So, fundamentally, she plays a man playing a woman, who becomes a woman.  In addition to her own issues, she finds some serious baggage in the form of a 17 year old son she never knew about.  This son is in trouble with the law when they meet.  She will go on a journey to California with this boy.  Along the way, she will have her possessions stolen, deal with a high-maintenance child, face humiliation at the hands of her parents, and all the time carry the secret that she is the boy's father.<br /><br />Then there is the Toby character (Zegers).  Toby is on the wrong side of the law, is a prostitute, is bisexual at best, and abuses drugs.  His mother committed suicide (he found her body), and his stepfather molested him.  He goes on this cross-country journey with a woman he believes to be a missionary, then learns that she is a he, then learns that she/he is his dad.<br /><br />Whew!  These parts demand virtuoso acting, and this certain to polarize script demands sensitive directing.  Huffman and Zegers were absolutely incredible.  We saw Bree's struggle with her her demons, and her struggle to adjust to parenting.  In one scene, Toby has run from her, and her grief is palpable.  It is a poignant and difficult scene.  Huffman plays this character as always on the brink of boiling over, struggling to maintain control and her own sanity, and never quite comfortable.  Toby has some great moments.  The scene where we learn that his stepfather molested him is incredibly tense and likely to arouse anger when you watch it.  His shock and anger when Bree's secrets are revealed is very real.  My favorite part of his performance is how he showed shame.  In one scene, he turns a homosexual trick with a stranger at a truck stop.  He and Bree needed money, and tricks and dope peddling are the only ways he knows how to make money.  Far from being cynical and all business, he was ashamed.  At the end of the movie, we see his shame in his \\"acting\\" career.  What made Zegers' performance brilliant is how incredibly understated it all was.  No tearing at clothing and screaming to the heavens.  Zegers communicated his shame and self-loathing with just a look.  Wow.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked that Huffman should have won an Oscar for this performance.  The Oscar that year went to Reese Witherspoon for her portrayal of June Carter in \\"Walk The Line\\".  Reese's performance was extraordinary, but Felicity started with a higher degree of difficulty.  Oscars aside, she and husband William H. Macy (Executive Producer) should rightly be proud of this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  This would be an excellent film to show to acting students for discussion.er quite comfortable.

B000056HE9|5.0|Although dating from 1947, this film is in no way \\"dated.\\"  It is sweet, funny, and ultimately moving in its limning of the meaning of Christmas.  It's hard to believe that the cast could be bettered.  Cary Grant could, of course, capture an audience by reciting a telephone book, but here he's not just reciting anything.  He's completely convincing in his portrayal of the angel Dudley.  His co-stars, Loretta Young and David Niven, are equally convincing in their roles, and there are no weak links in the supporting cast, although I cannot resist noting the special pleasures provided by Monty Woolley and Elsa Lanchester.  And a real salute goes to the young actress (I'm sorry I don't know her name) who appears as Debbie.  I usually have an urge to strangle most child actors and actresses, but not this one.  She's utterly natural and believable, and she deserves large kudos.  (The boys in the snowball fight are also good, but their appearance is too brief to be singled out more.)  This film has become a Christmas classic, and one viewing shows why the distinction is fully deserved.
B00006AG5N|2.0|I love all of these songs, and I was really hoping this would be my \\"one stop\\" Elvis CD,  but I must say this CD was mastered poorly. It sounds tinny and hollow to me.  It seems they put \\"the King\\" front and center, and left the band behind.  His voice is clear and loud, but the music is way in the background, and in some places you can barely hear the band.  I'm no re-master expert, but I can tell when something sounds out of proportion.  Pass on this one.  I would not recommend.  <br />
0596009208|5.0|This is an excellent book.  I used this book in conjunction with the free online Java tutorials provided by Sun Microsystems.  The book introduced me the concepts, and the tutorials solidified them while giving me added breadth and depth.  I was a complete noob to Java prior to reading this book.  My background:  I had taken a class in C and one in C++ as well as read a book on C++.  The way the book is presented is excellent for visual learners (like me).  I'm now reading Head First Design Patterns; also very interesting.
B000HC2LIK|3.0|Since the first time that I saw it, I have found the 'Directors Cut' of this movie to be boring, tedious and barely worth the 3 stars that I am giving it.  <br />  The only reason I care about this movie at all is because I grew up with the original theatrical release, and it had a profund effect on me. <br /> <br />  This movie is more than just sci-fi, the original voice over provides volumes of insight into the Deckard character. It sucks you into his world and leaves you breathless with the rooftop climax. As a young man, I was inspired by the poetry of Rutger Hauers death scene.  <br /> <br />To remove the narration is unbelievable to me. Especially that last moment on the rooftop, C'mon - That gave me chills!! <br /> <br />I absolutely cannot wait for the theatrical release of this movie to DVD, I have been waiting for 7 years! <br />
0792163710|5.0|Well, how d'ya like that?  George Stevens directs what's probably, arguably, maybe the greatest western ever and it's rated third among his movies over at that great big internet database of movies, trailing both his wartime comedy about the housing shortage in the nation's capital - The More the Merrier (1943) - and the Irene Dunne vehicle about an immigrant Norwegian family, I Remember Mama (1948).  At least SHANE (1953) leads what some have called the greatest action flick of all time, 1939's Gunga Din.<br /><br /> If you accept the definition of a classic movie as one you can return to again and again and continue to find something new, then SHANE fits the bill.  I've watched this movie so many times, it's such a part of the movie culture, I find it hard to believe any movie lover hasn't seen this one.  You don't have to love it, or even like it, but it's about as essential as they come.<br /><br /> The movie, of course, is about the mysterious stranger, Shane, who interrupts his drifting long enough to protect an embattled group of farmers from the murderous ways of the local cattle baron.  Since I figure I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here I'll strongly urge you, if you haven't seen SHANE for a while, to get your hands on 2000 Paramount reissue.  The images and sound have been cleaned up, and you're almost guaranteed to see something new.  Even the George Stevens, Jr. and Ivan Moffat commentary track is worth a listen.  I hadn't realized George Stevens had intended to cast Montgomery Clift and William Holden for the parts played by Alan Ladd and Van Heflin.<br /><br />  The first couple of times I watched this I was tremendously impressed with Jack Palance as the villain, the other wandering stranger, this one in black.  I still think, in this one, he's one of the greatest screen villains ever.  Later viewings brought out the `eternal triangle' (Ivan Moffat's phrase) between the farmer (Heflin,) his wife (Jean Arthur, in her last big screen role,) and Shane.  This time around, after swimming through a sea of cattle barons vs. squatter movies, I was impressed by the relatively sympathetic treatment Stevens gives to the bewhiskered, nasty Rufus Ryker, played with great presence by veteran nasty Emile Meyer.  This is a multi-layered and textured movie that doesn't hedge its bets by making the bad guy totally bad.  And it's one that's influenced movie makers from Sam Peckinpah to Clint Eastwood.  A lot of it has to do with Stevens' treatment of violence.  When you watch this pay special attention to the last scene Elisha Cook's in, the one with Jack Palance and the muddy streets.  That realistic treatment of violence hadn't been seen before, and it changed the way you made westerns.  For some movies five stars isn't enough, and SHANE definitely falls in that category.e,) and Shane.

B000ERU5EK|5.0|Bought this CD from Tower as they were closing their doors forever.  If I had paid full retail price it would've been WELL worth it...which is more than I can say for most of the CDs I've purchased in my lifetime!  Every single song on here was great or at least very good.  A great CD to throw in and listen to or select as a whole on the comp.  I don't always like all the 'mixes' out these days, sometimes they're so repetitive you want to tear your eyes out, but these are mindnumbingly good.  Can't wait to see what else they do.
B000J10ERO|4.0|This wasn't some mindless CGI movie. This movie has a lot of heart and depth and great character development and with some touch of comedy thanks to Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey. The only problem was that there wasn't enough action or much of a villian in the movie. At first, Kate Bosworth and Brandon Rough i think were miscast because their so so young. But they carried the movie perfectly. God! Hollywood needs to make more movies like this that have a lot of heart and warmth and emotion. Superman Returns was comedic but wasn't over the top like Fantastic Four. Fantastic Four which was so stupid and dreadful. Fantastic Four was like watching a National Lampoon's meets American Pie.  movie.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Gwen Stefani is an artist that never fails to come across as an original, talented and succesful. When she was singing \\"Don't Speak\\", we all kept quiet and listened and when she was sampling \\"If I Was a Rich Man\\" into her duet with Eve on her solo debut \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\", we all liked it. She also started her own fashion line, which is anything but conventional. However, she always maintained herself as a stylish, gifted performer and trendsetter, who is not very likely to fail. So, here comes \\"The Sweet Escape\\", Stefani's sophomore effort.<br />The question is, has she gone too far? Of course the album is all over the place, blending a dozen music genres into a signature blend of (for the most part) good music that will be greatly appreciated on your favorite CD shelf. It starts off with \\"Wind It Up\\", a tribute to Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The Sound of Music\\". It samples the song \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" from the musical, and works on many levels, just like \\"Rich Girl\\" did. However, as the song begins to draw to its end and Gwen starts yodeling a little too much, you feel tempted to dispose it as generic pop, a crowd-pleaser. However, with the second track of the album comes sweet satisfaction. \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is a song as good as anything Gwen has ever done before. It is both mellow and club-friendly, both eclectic and out-of-control (thanks to its producer, Akon, who even has a cameo here) and manages to set the tone for the entire album. Weirdly, all the best songs are similair to \\"The Sweet Escape\\" - the wonderful ballad \\"Early Winter\\" showcases Stefani's considerable talents, Madonna-esque \\"4 In The Morning\\" is pretty amazing and \\"Fluorescent\\" is also a good moment. These hip, yet somehow mellow songs are something that was merely suggested on \\"L.A.M.B.\\" (\\"Cool\\"), but is the direction Gwen Stefani should keep going into.<br />That being said, there are some not-as-flattering tracks on this album. It is well-known Stefani likes to experiment, she doesn't follow maps and goes with the flow. That has a lot of good results (let's mention \\"The Sweet Escape\\" again), however, there are tracks that are so out there with hooks, basses and annoying choruses that make your finger hit the \\"skip\\" button without your mind's consent. \\"Breaking Up\\" has no concept whatsoever, \\"U Started It\\" is a listenable filler and \\"Now That You Got It\\" simply sucks. There are some risky songs, too, but Gwen somehow manages to pull it off (\\"Yummy\\" isn't bad at all and \\"Orange County Girl\\" is very enjoyable, despite it being majorly weird).<br />The consensus is that it will be hard for Gwen Stefani to do somethi ng that we will completely dislike. Her charisma, good sense of colaborators and experience will always make sure she pulls it off. He sophomore album is a good album that will provide catharsis.

0743289412|4.0|I'm surprised to see the number of bad reviews of this latest King novel.  No, it's not The Stand, but folks, nothing ever will be.  And it's not quite like anything King has written to date... but not far off the mark.  Yes, it IS a love story; but it's also pure, fantastic King at his finest with the other-world-ness.  The \\"made up words\\" didn't distract me at all.  Go with the flow, folks.  Strap it on, as they say.  I'm very confused by the review indicating \\"he hates the prez\\" - how strange.  A reviewer really sensitive about the subject i guess; it was one line from one character.  Who cares??  Nope; not his best, but definitely another great read from The King.

B000002UB3|5.0|ABBEY ROAD represents the Beatles' last original recordings.  One may say that the record could have been the follow-up to SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND or a continuum to similiar creative tinkerings that occurred on the WHITE ALBUM. Despite the personal frictions between band members, the music always came first, and listeners can hear that with the band's musical experimentation and innovation that occurred while recording this album.<br /><br />Each of the individual band member's contributions shine throughout the album as they had done from the beginning of their musical journey.  And one can see that George Harrison's songs were the most exceptional, \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and \\"Something,\\" which were later covered by prominent singers like Frank Sinatra.  John, always in his unpredictable and \\"cheeky\\" ways, churned out poetic oddities, such as \\"Sun King,\\" \\"Mean Mr. Mustard,\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" as well as raunchy rock and roll tracks, \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\"  Always in his playful manner, Ringo sings the somewhat reminiscent of Yellow-Submarine\\",\\"Octopus's Garden,\\" while Paul sings his heart out with \\"Oh! Darling\\" an R&B-like ditty.  And to finalize the the album, the band ends with the aggressive guitar driven \\"Carry Weight\\" and the abrupt \\"Her Majesty.\\"<br /><br />Overall, ABBEY ROAD has a timeless quality as with other latter Beatles recordings.  The songs do not sound dated and locked within its particular time period, which was the late 1960s.  That is one of the reasons while the Beatles' music never goes out of style.

0061007137|5.0|Although the details of Mr. Archer's personal life rival the plots of his novels - from near bankruptcy, to Britain's political inner circles, to prison cell - none of it gets in the way of his well-deserved reputation as an outstanding storyteller.<br /><br />Next to \\"Kane & Abel\\" and \\"As the Crow Flies\\" this book is among my three favorites from Archer and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Set in the summer of 1966 with Lyndon Johnson in the White House, Harold Wilson at #10 Downing, and Leonid Brezhnev in the Kremlin, \\"A Matter of Honor\\" pits a most resourceful but unlikely British protagonist, Adam Scott, against an equally resourceful Soviet antagonist, Alexander Romanov.<br /><br />When Adam's father, a disgraced military officer, dies, he leaves to his only son the princely sum of 500 pounds and two letters.  The first is a missive from Adam's father, explaining the events that led to his resignation from the military, the circumstances that led to his possession of the second letter, and an expression of confidence that his son would conduct himself honorably should he decide to open the second letter and pursue whatever secrets it might contain.  When Scott's curiosity gets the best of him, he opens the second letter and finds that it is from a now-dead elite member of Hitler's Third Reich - a man that Scott's father had been assigned to guard during the Nuremberg trials.<br /><br />As one might guess, it is this second letter that proves to be the crux of the story.  It leads Scott to a bank vault, deep beneath the streets of Zurich, containing an obscure work of Russian art - an icon - smuggled out of the country during the downfall of Czar Nikolai II.  At the same time, the Kremlin has learned that this painting contains a secret that could forever shift the balance of power from West to East at the height of the cold war.  Romanov, a rising KGB star, is tasked with finding the icon and returning it to the Motherland so its embedded secret can be unveiled to the world.  While Romanov is not told the nature of the secret, he knows only that its contents must be acted on within 30 days and the clock is ticking.<br /><br />The ensuing chase reveals that Mr. Scott's will to survive and ability to think on his feet are indeed a match for the best the KGB has to offer.  It also presents an opportunity for Scott to restore his father's - and his family's - honor.  Hence, the name of the book.<br /><br />Archer gives us an outstanding plot that is authentically placed amidst the political tensions of the mid-1960s.  I enjoyed every moment of this book.  The characters are nicely developed, the cheetah-like pace kept me turning the pages until well into the night, and the story had an ending that while rather predictable, was highly satisfying nonetheless.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good political thriller from the world as it was 40 years ago, along with a healthy dose of Mr. Archer's formidable imagination, don't pass up this book.Romanov is not told the nature of the secret, he knows only that its contents must be acted on within 30 days and the clock is ticking.

B00005K3NY|5.0|I read somewhere that there is an estimated 12 to 15 per cent of the world's population that have been born with some sort of natural psychic--or \\"psi\\"-- abilities. That's a whopping 720 million people at most. However the day to day abilities of  most of these people are pretty lame compared to the small number of people in this movie who are super-psychics who have gained  extraordinary telepathic and telekinetic abilities as the result of a birth defect due to a badly tested sleeping pill inadvertently given to pregnant mothers before they were born;<br /><br />Daryl Revoc (played by a young Michael Ironside) tries to lead the scanners against the world, but finds opposition in a pair of scanners, one of which happens to be Revoc's brother. In some ways, Scanners is a bit of a cheesy sci-fi soap opera as Cronenberg unfortunately didn't have a big budget nor much time to write a better screenplay;  due to a quirk in the way Canadian films were made, Cronenberg had only two weeks for pre-production and to come up with a script. When Scanners went into production the script wasn't even finished; some may say that it shows, but I disagree. Despite some minor flaws, Scanners is a cult classic with some truly fascinating, and shocking, special effects that makes for a mind blowing ending. This is a great sci-fi film, but the DVD is somewhat lacking in \\"special features.\\" A commentary by Cronenberg and Michael Ironside would have  made the DVD perfect.

1400079179|5.0|It is sad that so may evaluate it for its controversial philosophical content rather than its monumental literary value. Five stars if there ever was one. Probably never before has a book worked up so much controversy fact vs. fiction.<br /><br />A similar book - what happens when the political infighting that goes on when a pope is elected turns to murder - is Lucien Gregoire's `Murder in the Vatican'- real life murder. Gregoire presents compelling evidence that two Opus Dei bishops, who later rose to high rank, orchestrated the murder of the 33 day pope because he threatened to the destroy the validity of the Old Testament. As a young seminarian, Albino Luciani (John Paul 1st) had written an article in his school newspaper which reached all of Europe. In his article, the boy Luciani called upon nations to live up to their copyright laws and place a warning on the Old Testament, \\"This is a work of fiction. Keep away from children.\\" No one is going to walk away from Gregoire's book without the absolute conviction that the Old Testament is a nothing more than a fairytale. In the case of Brown's masterpiece, the least they will walk away with is the tantalizing question, fact or fiction?  Bravo, Master Brown, the first great book of the new millennium. If you get Gregoire's book get the 2010 edition (link above) rather than the partial older editions. Buy these books together - free shipping.

B000J103PC|2.0|This movie annoyed me to no end.  Let me count the ways.  One, Meryl Streep's character was so over-the-top obnoxious that any link to reality was instantly lost for me.  Get me the unpublished manuscript of the new Harry Potter book in 4 hours??  Give me a break.  Insist on getting home from Miami when bad storms are preventing all flights?  Absurd.  Two, Streep's performance was grating, irritating, and lousy.  I hated her interpretation of the Miranda role.  Just one false note after another.  A parody, not a performance.  Three, Miranda would NEVER hire Andy - someone with zero experience in fashion - to be her assistant.  Totally unbelievable.  Fourth, nobody would put up with such abuse for more than a couple of weeks.  It's ridiculous to think anyone would subject themselves to it for a WHOLE YEAR.  Fifth, Stanley Tucci's character - so mean and condescending to Andy at first - suddenly makes a 180 degree turn and helps turn her into a fashion goddess?  Again, it would never happen.  I could go on, but I won't.  Suffice it to say the film is a bust (and has barely any laughs at all).

Although most of Rod's surprising duet choices have worked for me, I didn't really care for the Makin' Whoopee duet with Elton John.

B0002S94BG|5.0|Usually when I review an album, I will make detailed observations on the music, meaning, impact, and production.  For this, I'm just going to review the production of the re-master of the ten songs of the original album. <br /> <br />Like most Buckley fans, I purchased Grace and after falling in love sought out everything I could get my hands on.  So in response to those who may complain about Jeff's mother and Columbia records exploiting Buckley fans for more money, I feel the quality of the mixes and bonus materials easily warrant the additional expenditure. <br /> <br />As to the mix itself, I do feel that it is mostly superior to the original.  All the instrumentation is clearer without sounding artificially boosted.  The background noises that hide behind most of the songs have been brought out without sounding too compressed.  It's much easier to hear and visualize what is going on in the mix.  The drums and bass feel like they have been mixed MUCH better and sound a lot more like a solid platform for Jeff's voice and guitar.  There are a few moments when it feels like Jeff's voice is a touch harsh or perhaps the slightest bit of clipping on the cymbals, but it could also be in my listening chain (laptop through Presonus interface through M-Audio BX8 studio monitors).  I keep hearing things out of this mix that feel like they were added to the original recording but when I listen to my old copy I find they are just much better mixed.  It may have been Mr. Wallace's relative inexperience with a project of this scope, but I can assure you it is not simply a copy of the original disc run through a multiband compressor and jacked up 10 dB to the point of clipping. <br /> <br />So yeah if you loved the original, you probably have scratches all over the disc like I do and owe it to yourself to pick up this copy.  Well worth the $23.
1559408855|5.0|This film forms an interesting counterpoint to Luchino Visconti's \\"Death in Venice.\\" Like Visconti, Pier Paolo Pasolini was a communist, a homosexual, and a master of the visual flamboyance that has become a hallmark of Italian cinema in everything from giallo (Dario Argento, Mario Bava) to \\"spaghetti\\" westerns (particularly Sergio Leone, Italy's greatest director). <br />But where \\"Death in Venice\\" comes perilously close to NAMBLA propaganda, \\"Salo\\" has a completely different agenda. \\"Salo\\" is a cautionary tale, a warning about the perilous course western civilization seems to have embarked on as early as the eighteenth century (the age of de Sade), and a course we seem powerless to avert. If Armageddon is right around the corner, we can't say we haven't been warned. <br />The movie critic for my hometown paper called \\"Salo\\" unwatchable. Perhaps the fact that I was able to watch this movie almost without flinching shows how desensitized violence in the media is making me. Of course that's the point of the movie. Although based on a novel by the Marquis de Sade, the setting is Nazi-occupied Italy during World War II and the characters are all decadent aristocrats who have become so deadened by the atrocities they've helped perpetrate that the only way they can still feel is by inflicting pain on others. Their aim is to break their victims down, make them as desensitized and dehumanized as their tormentors. <br />In deference perhaps to Nazi eugenics theory, all the young men and women chosen for their experiment are near-perfect beauties. (Indeed, one lucky girl is rejected for having bad teeth). If the boys seem genuinely innocent, the girls were all apparently played by German and Italian porno starlets: they're all quite beautiful, but they all have that used-up look like they're used to this sort of treatment. Ironically, the more beautiful the girl the more cruel the torture. <br />The amazing thing about this movie is that no matter how hard they try, the Fascist captors never succeed completely in dehumanizing either their accomplices, their victims, or even themselves. The chief fascist forms an apparently genuine romantic connection with one of his male victims, who seems to reciprocate. Two of the girls form a tender lesbian relationship. One of the young guards forms an attachment to a black servant girl, for which both pay with their lives. And finally, one of the hideous old courtesans kept around to entertain the malefactors throws herself from the balcony after witnessing the final execution of the victims. <br />This is not to say that \\"Salo\\" represents the \\"triumph of the human spirit.\\" This is not \\"Schindler's List.\\" What it does say is that in spite of the capacity of evil in every one of us, there is also a capacity for good, and no matter how brutalized or dehumanized we become there's always a small spark of humanity within. There's a hope--a small, fragile hope, but hope nonetheless. <br />The ending of this film is stunning. While the remaining victims are tortured and executed outside, the fascist officials watch safely from their rooms while listening to a broadcast of the poetry of Ezra Pound (an American poet who openly collaborated with the fascists) followed by the haunting music of Carl Orff--what better music for a scene like that? <br />But then one of the young guards changes the channel to some swing music and asks his (male) partner to dance. While they dance he asks him what his girl friend's name is. <br />This movie speaks volumes about the human condition. Angels or devils--we can be either, or both, but the choice is still ours.
B000000OPZ|5.0|After casting about early after leaving Purple in a fairly non spectacular effort with Northwinds Coverdale begat Whitesnake. Which put forth a number of very British blues based hard rock style albums. They sold out tours in the UK and Europe and still lost money. So like they say - go west young man!<br /><br />This album is the fruits of a concerted effort to break the US market. It might be sneered at for thos reasons and often is by a still at times bitter UK press. But let's face it - the recording is power drenched, the band and production sound light years ahead of most other releases of the time and this album is noteworthy not only for the blistering feel of the tracks but also for the blend of ballads and rockers. With his wonderful set of pipes and great backing band Coverdale can attack stuff like Here I Go Again and Is This Love yet still happily turn around and crank serious wattage with the likes of Children of the Night, Bad Boys and the plaintive Crying in the Rain - a power ballad with the emphasis on the power and a tune above the norm for this style of song.<br /><br />And that's without mentioning Still of the Night. Seriously, a strong so strong that it blitzed just about every other hard rock track doing the rounds from other contemporary bands. A flagship tune and there ain't no doubt - a track any band would be proud to have in it's armoury with which to lay waste to their audience with.<br /><br />The downsides here are a) a slight reservation about the deliverate commercialism of the project  b) perhaps a few too many ballads - sometimes affected by what territory your in as the tracklisting was not always fixed in concrete with this album and c) there isn't really a part c gripe! Overall this is a great hard rock album that crossed over to massive mainstream success. The riffs are pounding and insistent as are the drums and Coverdale is in fine voice throughout and the entire package reeks of professionalism. Even if the actual players on the album didn't get to fully enjoy the success of the album due to Coverdales revolving door policy regarding bandmatesplayers on the album didn't get to fully enjoy the success of the album due to Coverdales revolving door policy regarding bandmates

B00005JOCU|5.0|Historically, many of the films called 'musicals' suffer from one of two basic tragic flaws. They tend to either miss the boat on either 1) good dramatic satisfaction - emphasizing the score and lyrics that make use of a flimsy 'story line' to create a venue for the songs to be performed, or 2) mundane, unmemorable music overlaying a really solid dramatic story. The most famous classical American Broadway shows of the 40's and 50's are some prime examples of the first situation (Guys and Dolls, Oklahoma, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, The King and I, etc.) and - understanding that many will disagree with me - Les Miserables (Les Miz) is a great example of the second. It is, in my experience, unusual to find a musical that delivers both solid drama where the music is a part of the developing story itself - not just a musically scored way of telling the story. In the new film of Dreamgirls I found myself experiencing what I always hoped a great musical could be. I haven't felt myself so genuinely engaged in and emotionally involved with a musical since the live Broadway revival of \\"Showboat\\" - another important exception to the two basic flaws mentioned above. There have been, of course, other musicals that I found both dramatically satisfying and musically inspired (West Side Story is another that comes to mind), but they have been few and far between.<br /><br />In fact, it was a half-hour or so into the movie before any dramatic lines were sung - before that, the music was the music - performed as performances. The film transitioned itself, nearly seamlessly, from then on, into a musical drama. The music - either as stage-performance numbers or as dramatically delivered musical dialog is absolutely riveting! I expect the CD will sell quite well.<br /><br />I had seen a live stage production of this show in San Francisco nearly 20 years ago and, frankly, I found this film a lot more satisfying!

0618680004|5.0|I've been listening to the audio version of this book, as read by the author.  I find it ironic that another reviewer claims that Dawkins is not qualified to speak on matters of theology when, indeed, many people of a religious nature find themselves to be qualified to speak on matters of science (sex education, equal rights for women and gays, and evolution).  His arguments are concise and to the point.  Why DOES religion get special protections, even when it seeks to make money hand over fist, or violate hate speech laws?  Free thinkers will enjoy this book; it asks a lot of questions that beg to be answered - some are uncomfortable, granted, but it is that space between what we think we know and what is real that we should seek to cross.

B000FS9FCG|3.0|One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, \\"V for Vendetta,\\" was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard \\"Big Brother\\" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.   <br /> <br />Much of what made \\"V\\" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.   <br /> <br />The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the \\"Matrix\\" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push \\"V\\" into the class of great action movies.  \\"V\\" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.   <br /> <br />For visual appeal, \\"V\\" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like \\"Van Helsing,\\" \\"Hulk,\\" or the \\"Matrix\\" sequels, \\"V\\" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  \\"V\\" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.  This isn't a bad movie by any means - we're not talking \\"Speed 2\\" or \\"Dune\\" - but it is a disappointment when the high expectations aren't met.
B000E5KJGQ|3.0|I Recently purchased the toshiba HD-DVD player and this movie along with Phantom of the Opera. The Quality of this HD DVD was a real disappointment. Phantom looked great and FMJ not so good. Part of this reason is that older films usually never look as good (older film stock, degredation etc.) however, I did comparisions with the DVD release and the HD DVD only looked marginally better.   The HD DVD is in the HD widescreen format while the DVD is 4:3. <br /> <br />This does not mean that the widesceen version has more of the picture. In fact the opposite is true. The 4:3 DVD version shows the entire film negative while the Widescreen is cropped at the top and bottom. The effect is similar to zooming in the picture on a  widescreen TV from 4:3 to zoom 1.  When doing this with the DVD version the improvement of the HD DVD was obvious (as one would expect when zooming any picture) but apart from this (and slightly better sound quailty than the DVD) there is no reason to purchase this if you own the DVD. <br /> <br />As for the film itself, it is a masterpiece that stands up over time. The combat scenes showing the confusion of urban fighting are extremely well executed.

B0009P42S2|1.0|I've seen quite a bit of Anime, both good and bad, but this one does not deserve to even be called Anime.  It appears to copy all the worst characteristics of modern US tradigital (2D/3D) formulaic animation techniques, and is similarly bad-- devoid of the plot intricacies, interesting characters and expressive character designs usually associated with Anime.  While there are plenty of interesting steam mechanisms, that's about all it has going for it-- any sophistication ends there.  The plot is simplistic, the \\"science\\" too laughable to even make decent fantasy, the character designs typical US stereotype-mannekin-formula and the personalities unengaging.  The whole thing seems designed by draftsmen or accountants rather than creative artists, just like recent US produced fare.  Would likely appeal only to the undiscerning youngest of kids. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this, just about anything out there in Anime is better.
B0002X1JKU|5.0|Ben Graham is the intellectual patriarch of the value school of investing, and \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" is recommended reading by no less than Warren Buffett himself.    You should read it.  Graham's original work is now more than 30 years old, so an updated version makes sense, but... frankly Jason Zweig is a nitwit, a point which he amply demonstrates in his commentary.   <br /> <br />When Graham points out that there are, infrequently, circumstances in which an intelligent investor will conclude that an investment in bonds is likely to provide a higher rate of return than an investment in the stock market, Zweig completely misses the point.  Graham compares the bond yield available in the early 1970's to the return he expects to get in the future from the Dow Jones or the S&P 500, which he computes using the then current dividend yield and an estimate of the annual rate of increase in that dividend, and then compares the two.  If the bond yield is greater than the expected return from stocks, the bond will make you more money, simple as that.  Yet Zweig \\"explains\\" that what Graham means is that bonds might do better in the short term, and of course people don't live forever, so that the answer somehow depends on how far into the future you are thinking. <br /> <br />In another example, Graham argues against owning gold as an investor because the return over many many years is far worse than that of common stocks, yet Zweig \\"corrects\\" Graham on this point, as long as gold is only 2% of your total portfolio and is held in a mutual fund to avoid storage fees.  If that doesn't seem like gibberish to you, think harder. <br /> <br />For yet a third example, Zweig discusses various apostiori \\"systems\\" which have been developed by applying random techniques to old data and picking the one (out of thousands) that would have worked best in the past, including the appropriately named \\"foolish four\\" proposed by the Motley Fool.  While he quite correctly points out that these are hogwash, he also confesses to us that he has recommended them to friends and family as recently as the turn of the century.  This would be forgivable for a novice, but he claims to have been a value investor since 1987.  If he didn't get it after 13 years, why would you think he gets it now? <br /> <br />I like this edition over the unadulterated Graham not despite Zweig's shortcomings, but because of them.  The value added is precisely that you see the real deal side by side with the baloney masquerading as the real thing.  The process of identifying where Zweig goes wrong should be useful for the reader as an exercise in avoiding common pitfalls, and for the wonderful self test that it provides: if you can't find his mistakes, you probably don't understand value investing as well as you would like to.
B00006RAKP|4.0|GREATEST HITS 1970-2002 lacks three essential Elton John singles: the number one smash \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" the top ten hit \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love,\\" and the Princess Diana tribute and another number one record, \\"Candle In The Wind '97.\\"   <br /> <br />Two other big songs do not appear on this collection, albeit duets: \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" with Dionne Warwick and others, and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" with George Michael. <br /> <br />If you don't mind missing any of those songs, GREATEST HITS 1970-2002 comprises the rest of Elton John's biggest hits.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I purchased this 60th Anniversary edition because my old Republic Home Video DVD was scratched from watching it every year. <br />Contrary to what the earlier reviewer says, this edition actually is restored and looks better than the older Republic edition. In the beginning credits, which look like Christmas card panels, the old edition has numerous scratches and dirt and the new edition is nice and cleaned up and the picture is sharper and looks much better. <br />Paramount has been re-releasing old titles w/ new cover artwork which is the same dvd as the old ones, but on this title, they actually improved on the old edition. <br /> <br />Buy it for next Christmas and all the ones after! <br />
0452286751|5.0|This book is an eye opener. Read it slowly and over again to get the fullest benefit. It lays out the case for individualism without equivocating in a story that is rich with plot and characters that you will feel compelled to compare in real life (unfortunately, the most comparable characters are the \\"weak\\" ones such as Peter Keating, Toohey, etc.)
630463949X|5.0|I had originally made a VHS tape from TV several years ago. It recently gave up the ability to play any longer..worn out. I decided to find a copy on  the net and of course came to Amazon. The DVD came and I was surprised to find that the quality was excellent and included scenes I had not seen before. Now, I will spend the upcoming years trying to wear out the DVD. This is the best of Fleetwood Mac..and I have all their albums on vinyl. I am 66 years old........:-)
B000001GY9|3.0|The interpretation of the symphonies is fine.  The recording quality in some of the music is slightly dead.  I don't think it was an orchestral problem, just a mechanical problem.
6304712944|5.0|You like medieval stories and tragic love dramas? Music that makes your spirit soar and knights in shining armor? You've come to the right place. Nothing like it anywhere...
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of Lost just further confirms to me that Lost is one of the best, most original shows to come along in a long time. The episodes themselves are great, and the bonus features help answer (at least to some degree) some of the questions and plot twists that abound on this show. Well worth the money.
1592402038|4.0|This book was helpful. Only drawback is that it is written in novel form so it is difficult to use as a reference.
0060776757|5.0|This book is a must have for the die hard U2 fan. It's also great for those who follow rock and roll history. The layout is spectacular. When you're done reading the book you can leave out as a coffee table item. The rotation of dialogue between the members of the band gives it a wonderful balance of differing perspectives. Bono's perspective gives the reader a soft soap opera (I mean this as a compliment)reading experience, whereas the Edge's perspective satisfies the techy attributes of the band's development. Adam's and Larry's perspective offer the reader a combination of Bono and the Edge's style with Larry saying as little as possible. I imagine Larry to be a most private individual and Adam to possess the spirit of one that takes his life experiences to the limit. I enjoyed learning about all of these men. Bono is exactly my age and I couldn't help but compare what I was doing to what they were doing during the same period. It's a truly amazing parrallel. It's a great book.
B000002WPI|5.0|this should be part of every rap lover's collection
B000GPIPVU|4.0|An excellent follow up to \\"Trouble\\" though some songs sounded vaguely reminiscent.  In total, an excellent follow up, if not as groundbreaking as his first.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|EXCELLENT BUY. TO BE  ABLE TO GET THESE MOVIES ON DVD. NOW YOU CAN GET THE ENTIRE SET ON DVD AND IT IS EASIER TO TRANSPORT. MY SON WAS VERY HAPPY AS HIS TV IS HIS COMPUTER!!!
B000F1IQMS|2.0|i  thought it was going to be like a book page turner, however, Iwas disapointed. <br />Ido not recomend this video
B000002ADT|5.0|I used to have this recording on a vinyl record and enjoyed it very much, but I hadn't heard it since that record got scratchy and was discarded many years ago.  The stereo sound on this CD is excellent, and it includes a second version of Flamenco Sketches which was not on the record.  I think these selections are some of the best Miles Davis had ever recorded.  I enjoyed both Bill Evan's liner notes and his delicate touch on the piano.  Cannonball Adderly is amazing, and Miles Davis playing is thoughtful and creative as usual.  If you appreciate good jazz, you will love this CD.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I bought this CD mainly for track 16 \\"You Raise Me Up\\" because I heard it on the web and really liked it. I realized that track 2 was another favorite of mine \\"May It Be\\" off  the Lord Of The Rings. sung by Lisa Kelly. You will find this CD will relax you epically with track 15 \\"The Soft Goodbye.\\" I enjoy this CD an I am sure you will to epically after a hard day at work. Wonderful fiddle playing by Máiréad  Nesbitt and good conducting by David Downes also  good vocals from: Chloe, Meav and Órla...Wonderful CD get one, you won't regret it.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Well its just simply an amazing CD. . . I love the band Nightwish and probably my favorite song on there is I Wish I had an Angel
B00005S6K8|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and I would buy from the seller again and again.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Once you have the season on dvd it is hard not to keep watching them over and over again.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Much of the second season was strong taking us from survivalist story at the end of Season 1 to the adversarial story of Season 2.  We meet more others, more survivors of the crash, more questions.  All in all I love this season for the questions it answered and for the episode by episode tension it created.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|\\"THE LAKE HOUSE\\" is one of my most beloved DVD's.<br /><br />This is a true love story and one that the viewer can lose themeselves in.<br /><br />I have watched it at least a dozen times since I received the DVD.<br /><br />There is just something magical about this film.<br /><br />If you need to see a love that waits ... buy this DVD and cherish it for the years to come!
B00008H2LB|4.0|If you havent noticed, there is a singer and a rapper in linkin park. If you like the songs when there's more singing than rapping, get this. It's great and is alot soft-rock[ier] than hybrid theory.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I LOVE this movie and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.  The piano pieces are incredible.  \\"Georgiana\\" and \\"Liz on top of the world\\" are my personal favorites.  \\"Darcy's letter\\"  evokes the stressful emotions of the movie (which I just generally skip if I'm trying to create relaxing atmosphere).  \\"The Militia marches in\\" is very patriotic sounding (my kids love it so I guess it's not so bad).  Overall I truly recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys classical and relaxing music .
B00005JOLI|4.0|First of all, Eragon is far perfect. It has its many flaws, but it still is able to overcome them and become a enjoyable film. Adding elements from the rather long book was a difficult task and of course things had to be cut dissapointing the hard-core fans of the book. I was a moderate fan of the book and was still able to enjoy the movie. I thought the most impressive element of Eragon was the acting. A cast that I had never heard of delivered with a fantasic job. The weakest part of the film was the script. It just didn't seem to work at times. Still, I loved the world of dragons and riders and went to see it twice.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I thought Sandra and Keanu were really good in this.  A little far-fetched but I liked it.  My wife stopped watching half way through so this might not be the \\"chick-flick\\" I anticipated.
B000G759LW|5.0|I loved Back to Basics. Christina Aguilera has one of the best voices in the music industry today, and I believe she's one of the best artists of her generation. This album brings double discs filled with great music. I specially loved the second disc because of the great ballads and old-themed music. If you're a good music fan this is a must-have.
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep was absolutely brilliant!  The movie moved well and the plot and character interactions were perfect.  I loved this movie and have watched it three times in a week.
B00005JPCD|5.0|Man is horrible and maybe we can save the planet if we educate the kids now. Most adults have given up or are out to satisfy their own agenda, and to heck with the environment. Someone has to pay attention and fix what has been destroyed or is close to being destroyed. We need all the help we can get.  <br />Love this movie!!! Love trees!!! Love dancing!!!   <br />  <br />
B000HT386M|2.0|I bought this movie for a laugh but hardly even got a smile out of it.  Sandler is good at comedy: he should leave movies \\"with a message\\" to serious actors.  He doesn't have the range to carry this one off.
B00005614N|5.0|the title says it all. two giants of jazz at their best. positively sublime. a must for all jazz lovers.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Well done movie with a twist on a bank robbery which was a little unique.
0060578793|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law.  He and I are both avid \\"Man vs. Wild\\" fans and this book is the bible of survival info.  He reads it almost every night.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I gave this movie for gifts.  The film during the credits makes me cry.  A must for the holiday season.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|Of course you should watch Season 1 first, but certainly continue over to season 2. While the mystery isn't quite as good as season 1, it certainly keeps your interest. Plus there's lots of that great Veronica wit to keep you laughing.

B000063V8T|5.0|This is a great box set and Amazon sent it out very qickly and were good to their word as for shipping dates.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Audre Hepburns debut.  This ismy favorite movie of all time.  A romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film I've ever viewed.  If you're not moved by this story and it's portrayal by command performances, then you're not breathing.
B000069KGM|3.0|It's easy to be lulled to sleep by the proliferation of schmaltzy pop ballads that have been churned out over the decades by this seminal jazz/rock band. And, as result, it's a band that is easily dismissed by many - heck, Chicago still isn't in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, an inexcusable oversight; even if all the band had to be measured by was those schmaltzy power pop ballads, it would still deserve a plaque in the hall. But Chicago is so much more than the hits, as evidenced by this double-disc 1969 debut. Powered by the three-man horn section and the raw guitar style of the late Terry Kath, the band moves smoothly from catchy pop punctuated by jazz riffs (\\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings,\\" \\"Questions 67
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love period dramas and so when I found this one and read its summary I was excited.  This is my kind of movie.  It reminded me of Pride and Prejudice, which happens to be my favorite period piece.  This is just a fantastic movie; the story, the actors, everything so if you like Pride and Prejudice you will probably like North and South.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a melancholy death album that's sweet and sorrowful, but most of all it is beyond MOVING.  Good god, we've all heard some of these songs before, but NOT sung like this.  \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" is enough to get you sobbing on the spot, he sounds so vulnerable and tired.  We all know those feelings this album stirs up, so it touches DEEPDEEPDEEP.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I liked this Dylan CD.  I only really got into Dylan in a big way last year, and I was used to all of his old stuff, which I love.  This album was a surprise, but a very pleasant one.  It's much more jazzy and bluesy in a delightful kind of way.  This is what true musician is all about, for me: someone who plays music and is continuously evolving and experimenting, not because s/he needs to prove anything (and Dylan for one certainly doesn't!), but simply for the love of writing and playing music. In that respect this album contains all of the genius of Dylan and his great band.  Don't expect the usual guitar and harmonica combo here, this is a different sound, but it's very good nonetheless.
0316010669|2.0|An effusive monologue fortified with contrived oversimplifications does not make something factual or profound. In the end - I am right back where I started - only slightly chagrined for expecting to have gleaned some cogent insight regarding the recent advances in cognitive science in exchange for time invested.<br /><br />Granted, he's a deft writer. However, if you've had a college level introduction to psychology -  you will struggle holding back natural questions that one would assume he would address in the succeeding pages - but no. Consequently, your \\"bovine excreta detector\\" will(or should) remain illuminated throughout the entire book.
1881273156|5.0|This book can assist with helping figure out a spouses love language so it will be easier to relate.  I'm glad it touched on children towards the back of the book as well.  It allowed for me to analyze my kids' love language and then I can apply what I've learned to them as well.  Thanks!
B00068NVI4|4.0|It was great to see Yes back together. They did play a lot of their different songs from different decades. Overall very good. Only issue I had is Roundabout being played accoustically and to a different rythm on some others played that way as well.
0767020308|5.0|I absolutley love this movie,she was precious in this part and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys period pieces.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|Some years ago, Dave Grohl appeared on the Howard Stern Radio Show and played an acoustic version of \\"Everlong\\".  He proved that stripping down a pretty heavy rock song to the bare bones, as it were, works.  He returned to play \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Learn to Fly\\", which also turned out extremely well. <br /> <br />\\"Skin and Bones\\" is an acoustic concert with added accompaniment and it works quite well.  I wouldn't put in the same class as Nirvana's Unplugged session, but when it comes to modern rockers unplugging, it's top notch.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I had a little problem at first with Amanda Root.I know the character needed to be plain,but I found her absolutely unattractive.As the movie went on her personality came through.I thought it was well done and a very sweet movie.I would definately recommend it.
0385335482|5.0|Confessions is by far one of my favorite books. Becky Bloomwood is the most comical, insanely hilarious characters ever written. I literally read this book in one night..then I immediately rushed out and bought the rest of the sequels. Normally I'm very skeptical about sequels, but Sophie Kinsella is very true to Becky and doesn't disappoint!! I've raved about this book to all my friends..you won't want to miss the exciting dilemma's a credit card can cause!!!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I have watched this movie over a dozen times over the years. Everytime I see something new in it. Many of the scenes are so well composed that they could stand alone as photographs.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Okay, out of curiosity I rented the first disc of the first season because I had never watched this show. That was all it took. I now OWN the first and second seasons on DVD and I am anxiously awaiting tomorrow night's new episode. This show is AWESOME. I LOVE Allison.
B00000JRTX|5.0|One of the best films of the past decade. Wonderful English humor and a love story that keeps you wondering until the very end. Highly recommned if you like your humor edgy and smart.
0307237699|5.0|I've just completed this book and I'm so impressed I plan to make sure all my friends read it too. Mr Obama really says nothing earthshaking BUT what he does say makes a great deal of sense and I believe is a way to make this country what it should be - hospitable and caring again.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Another outstanding concert by Yanni. This one being different in the sense of being more intensive. Diffently outstanding a must have for those who enjoy Yanni.

B00005V9HH|4.0|Five thieves are called together by a mysterious mind to pay off a debt to him that none of them realized existed.  They're supposed to make amends by pulling off a dangerous heist.  There is a violent shootout near the end.  The climax itself is unbelievable if too closely examined, but the film itself is done so well that you're not that likely to question the logic behind the plot.  Fine direction.  Excellent acting on everyone's part, particularly Kevin Spacey.  Good script too, with insinuating dialog:  \\"The greatest trick the devil ever performed was convincing the world that he didn't exist.\\"  If you like action, police stories, crime thrillers, and a bit of edginess in your movies, you'll like this one.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|This album has every song you remember, plus a ton of tracks that you don't.  Excellent greatest hits album, absolutely essential for anyone who lived through the 80's.
1401302378|4.0|Chris Anderson (editor Wired Magazine) took the opportunity to expand to readers on his own word invention \\"The Long Tail\\".   He obviously did a lot of homework on the subject and it does cause one to think how the \\"long tail\\" impacts one's personal and business life.    \\"The theory of the Long Tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of \\"hits\\" (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail.\\"  The book provides several examples so you can identify others on your own.  Small business really can be very profitable.    For those in the Internet and business world this book holds some concepts that are very helpful.
B0001I55OC|5.0|This was the first movie that I was introduced to Gerard Butler. Timeline is a new twist on time travel It is entertaining, and full of adventure. Archelogical dig becomes the focal point, as young men and women seek to find the artifacts from a french castle.<br /><br />The group consists of a scotsman (Gerard Butler) a lovely young woman that Paul Walker ( professor's son head of the dig) is in love with, but she is more interested in her work then in love, or so she says. Billy Connolly the head of the dig.<br /><br />It is like walking back into history and getting to almost to participate.<br /><br />The story line is unusal and the premise of time travel draws us in. Gerard Butler is handsome, charming, and so awesome in the part of Andre Merrick. The group find out that the company backing their dig has some thing extraordinary going on behind the scenes. This movie is worth watching, owning, and viewing.<br /><br />Loved this movie!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This is the epitome of study abroad...well..from the European perspective anyway.  American students can't always relate, but this movie script was well written and the movie itself well put together.
0393316041|4.0|This is a good book if you haven't read any of the other books about Feynman.  A few of the chapters have been published elsewhere, such as in \\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\\" which in my opinion was a better (more science-centric) book.  This book was more about his personal life and included some interesting information about his experiences with women and his time spent travelling.

B00001U0E1|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Everything about it - acting, directing, costumes, screenplay - is absolutely stunning! <br /> <br />The story goes as follows: young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is hassled by an in-debt theater owner to finish writing his play.  Unfortunately, Will finds himself cursed with horrible writer's block, a problem which is further aggravated by the discovery that his muse, the fair Rosaline, is cheating on him.  Then he meets Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young woman that yearns for the theater, but is unable to follow her dreams because of the laws against women on the stage (female roles were played by young boys).  What follows is a magnificent love story complete with mistaken identities, disguises, and laugh-out-loud comedy in which Will Shakespeare finds the inspiration to write his most romantic work: \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". <br /> <br />Every actor is superbly cast.  Joseph Fiennes has a sort of boyish charm and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely perfect.  Both are wonderful actors that pull off the entire range of theatrical emotion (from comedy to despair) during the course of this 2 and 1/2 hour film.  Needless to say, the supporting cast (including Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Ben Affleck) is just as wonderful.  In addition: this is probably one of my favorite screenplays - it's extremely well written and has a perfect balance of comedy, romance, and tragedy.   <br /> <br />Shakespeare in Love is completely worthy of it's seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actress).  It mixes hilarious comedy and heartfelt romance and will dispel any association between the words \\"Shakespeare\\" and \\"dull\\". <br /> <br />5-stars...I love this film!
0307276902|2.0|Shame on the publishers for classifying this book as nonfiction. I read the book months after the \\"gotta read this book\\" hoopla in addition to the scandal;and concluded that only a dullard would think the author actually experienced some of the experiences.  Besides the dentist visit, the idea of a couple social workers allowing an institutionalized person rescue someone from a drug house is simply ludicrous.
0446672653|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It is an unlikely love story with a wonderful end.  Worth reading.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Can't say enough about this CD.  Dylan's style on this disc is very entertaining.  First time in years, I've remembered the words to the songs so I can sing along!  OH, lucky world!!!!!
B000FILW86|5.0|I've been a Cheap Trick fanatic since the 70's, through the good stuff and not so good stuff and I have to say that this is one of their best recordings ever.  I just can't get enough of this cd.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie because I really dug the \\"Underworld\\" movies. Not that I thought it would blow me away, but I thought it would be a cool story and some interesting fights and action sequences. About 30 minutes into the movie it became obvious that this movie was not gonna live up to my expectations. The trailer led me to believe that the story would build up to something more, but most of the interesting things from the trailer happen early on and in smaller doses than I thought. The movie starts out with them doing their best \\"Lost Boys\\" impression and never really gets more exciting than that. It's not very scary either. The creepiest thing is the spiders which were creepier in that Harry friggin Potter movie. The dialog is campy and corny - just watch the \\"Little Miss Muffet\\" scene and see if you don't wince at how ridiculous it sounds. The story is weak too since there are absolutely no surprises and things are never really explained worth a flip. For instance, they never explain what the heck a \\"darkling\\" is or what the point of it is either. If this isn't enough to dissuade you from wasting your time with this, then just know there is a bonfire scene and a dancing scene complete with jukebox. Oh and what was the deal with the 4th \\"brother\\"? Did he even need to be in the movie? All he did was chime in with like 2 lines the whole movie and stand around. It's pretty tough to watch the whole thing without wishing death on every character in the movie.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|Este es un disco que est&aacute; al nivel de los grandes cl&aacute;sicos de Iron Maiden, no digo que supere a ninguno pero me parece que llega al nivel de estos. Este disco tiene grandes canciones al m&aacute;s puro estilo de Iron Maiden, con un manejo de los instrumentos increible y con la voz de Bruce Dickinson a un gran nivel, parece que no pasaran los a&ntilde;os por este grupo. Un disco muy recomendable.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|Digs into your brain over time, for sure. Still, it never comes off as more than playful. It's clever, it's cool, and it's cocky, but it also seems lazy and underdeveloped.     Overall, it might be a better record than their sophomore release 'Room on Fire', but sadly nothing here touches \\"What Ever Happened?\\" or \\"Reptillia\\" from that disc. In a way, the album is less gimmicky than 'Room on Fire', because it relies less on superficial hooks, but the bottom line is that those two tracks are UNBELIEVABLE in their hooks -- they hook you and make you BLEED; in that respect, 'The Strokes', when they're on, are as good as any of the other indie-rock bands out there. But, alas, 'First Impressions' doesn't have anything so magnetic, and that's disappointing.    The closest it gets to this approach is, surprise surprise, the album's first track and radio single, \\"You Only Live Once\\". Indeed, it slits your skin open and melts into the blood, piercing with its charming, merry riffs and melody. Even so, it's more subtle, and is representative of the entire album -- it's fetching indeed, but much more discreet in revealing its slick self; because of this, I don't think any 'Strokes' album gets better with each listen as much as 'First Impressions'.    And I really do like virtually all of the songs here, even if some of them are fairly lukewarm. It's an easy listen, and there's a good time to be had. Absolutely love the lyrics in 'On the Other Side' -- clever, funny and relatable. 'Ask Me Anything' is simplistically unique and charming in its own right. I'm not sure any other band in the world could pull off something so plain as 'Fear of Sleep' and make it such an awesome song. Yes, it's a good time indeed.    Three and a half stars, says I. 'First Impressions' is one of those albums that I'll never declare brilliant, but I don't really have any part of me that wants to lay anything negative on it -- it doesn't warrant it.     HOWEVER, I do hope 'The Strokes' bang out somethingtruly extraordinary soon, because I know they have it in them.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|VERYYY beautiful movie! The CG is breath-taking and the Japanese cast was perfect for the characters. Well done and a perfect closing to the FFVII story.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've never recieved this product, though the order was placed twice.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is a great CD for Ray Charles fans. You also might want to look for the tribute concert that was filmed at the Staples Center. I attended the concert and now have the DVD. A must see!!
1405206691|4.0|I LOVE pop-up books -- particularly Sabuda's -- so am always looking for pop-ups. This was a very cute story -- a little reversal of roles from the typical 3 little pigs and big bad wolf. The pop-ups certainly weren't as good as Sabuda's but adequate to be fun to turn pages and look at.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I hate that the 'spotlight' reviews are so negative on here.  Granted, I never bought any previous releases of the films.  I didn't mind the little touch-ups so much, but frankly the stupid CGI Jabba, Greedo shooting first, and the entire prequel trilogy made me feel like an idiot for ever liking Star Wars to begin with.   <br />So finally, here's the original cuts packaged with the rerelease ones, and while they're not updated for people's ultimate home theater systems, they ARE the original cuts.  If you have that much of a problem with it, you probably have some bigger issues that need addressing. <br />For the rest of you, go ahead and enjoy some classic entertainment!
B00005AWMF|5.0|I'd buy any Sade album anytime without ever hearing one song beforehand. Its good to have most of my Sade faves all on one album. A must have for any Sade fan.
B000GTLQXU|1.0|This might be the worst movie I ever saw.  In fact, I didn't even get through the first 30 minutes as the acting was so horrible.   <br />Holy Moly, no where near the original.
B000BW7QX6|3.0|love the movie, but my wife really digs it. Reminds her a bit of farscape
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Emmy's voice is as good as ever if a little more mature. This is nicely complemented by Mark's rough vocals. A good selection of songs with shades of Emmy's recent work in Rd Dirt Girl and Wrecking Ball in several of the songs. Emmy is a master of harmony and some of the close work on this album is a delight.I would have liked more of her in solo but I am nit-picking. All the Road Running and 'If this is goodbye' are the best tracks on the CD and are sung with real feeling. <br /> <br />If you like emmy (and even if you don't) BUY this Album
B00004STPT|2.0|It was ok, if you like that kids of movie, but not for the mother in me.
1878424505|4.0|A word-of-mouth recommendation of this book was so greatly appreciated. The Four Agreements offer a plan, steps to be centered, within ones life. The calming effect of the knowledge past on is amazing. The Four Agreements are almost an immediate sense of calming, and contiuning desire to live ones life with them. A flowing and enlightening read, I strongly recommend
B00000K3CR|5.0|Tom Hanks should have gotten an Oscar for his role in this movie.  He plays a 12 year old who makes a wish and wakes up 30.  His portrayal as and adult child is sparkling.  Elizabeth Perkins becomes his love interest.  He ultimately decides that he would rather have his missed childhood, and goes back.  The piano scene in the toy store is marvelous.  Hank's job of playing with toys and evaluating them works well.  His best friend's loyalty and help make the movie, along with his return home at the end.
0618680004|4.0|The snappy zingers that will deconvert people are at the end.  As a former \\"born again\\" I feel that the vast majority of people will be deconverted by one-liners that they chew on, like \\"How many T-Rex were on Noah's Ark?\\", not the Anthropomorphic principle and the 7 cosmological constants.  (BTW, I was deconverted by The Selfish Gene.) It seems absurb that many would believe in the Bible (or whatever) based on the gravitational constant being correct.  That's got to be a miniscule fraction of believers.  I'd like to see an abridged or reorganized version so that people who don't finish will still take the main message home.  Pareto please.   <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|Something really good to watch I can't wait to see the next season
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins delighted me again. He allowed me to think about my atheism with pride and to open a whole new world to be discovered.  Well written, as usual.  I strongly suggest reading also  Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon by Daniel Dennet
B000FDVOXO|5.0|The governor of California never looked more impressive.  The film is the consummate blend of science fiction and superhero.  The opening is as fine a science fiction facade as one could hope for, the balance of the film basically a cops and robbers story with special effects.  If you dig that(and who doesn't) then this is a must for your film library.
B0009WK5CM|5.0|It was a gift for my grandson and he was very happy, so I'm happy!
B00004T9VY|5.0|Cat Stevens has always been one of my favorites.  His lilting voice has never been matched.  He has been the center of some controversy over the years for his non-musical interest and pursuits; if this bothers you, I understand(it concerned me too.)  But, the music stands apart, an entry in the pantheon of great folk music.
B000BT97AO|5.0|As a child of the 80s, this book brought me back to my childhood and some of the movies I loved to watch then like Labyrinth and Willow.  I got this movie originally as a fan of Neil Gaiman and fell in love with it.
0743556003|5.0|This book is not the standard lock the door, close the blinds, turn on all the lights in the house book.  This book is a great book.  I really enjoyed traveling with Lisey to other parts of the world that Scott and lisey's sister had visited.  The visions that were created were vivid by King's ability to write.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a good book.
0618680004|4.0|\\"The God Delusion\\"gives a fascinating and logical insight into why there is almost certainly no personal God watching our every move.It postulates convincingly scenarios that explain our religiosity,and our morality and highlights all the abuses and horrors that seem to have come from religion.It bases much of its argument on Natural Selection as a cause of the seeming self-improvement of living organisms,  sometimes to a point of excess, though in fairness it may be pointed out that many chapters are a reprise of writings or speeches given elsewhere; this gives a feel of disconnection or repitition in the flow of argument from one chapter to another. <br />As far as our fascination with religion goes I personally think we are wired to accept it. We suffer from a cultural schizophrenia which, like one variety of that disease, makes us accept one Primary Delusion and then organize our lives more or less logically as if that delusion were fact.I also think that we dont need to make much of the killings and horrors committed in the name of religion since we as a species like to do the exact same in the name of politics, philosophies, personal power, etc. We like killing and maiming our fellows; religion just gives it one type of cachet.I am reminded , in our imagining a world with out religion,of a similar 'what if\\"-that there should be a world without men. A wise woman I know said \\"Well, there would still be a lot of bad stuff going on, just the toilet seat would be down instead of up\\". <br />Dawkins has been criticized for not countering every theological argument in the world, unfair in my opinion since this was not the purpose of the book. Those he does counter he does so devastatingly. He also does not spend too much time on the cause of the origin of life-or even the universe-in the first place, understandingly so because for now we just dont know. <br />All in all, the book would be very convincing to a person with a completely open mind, though unfortunately there are not too many of those around. <br />Brian Oliver.
B000BEZQ18|3.0|Great film, but the songs selected in the soundtrack could have been better. It seems to be a Willie Nelson meets Spaghetti Western Movie Music styles. It is typical background atmosphere music you readily forget as soon as you leave the theater. Buy the DVD of the film, but leave the soundtrack alone.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Great series, but prefer to watch it on a DVD set like this.  Have been looking for the most recent season's DVD.  Is it not out yet, and which year would it be? <br /> <br />Have also purchased or received as a gift \\"24\\" and \\"The Sopranos\\".  I was very distressed that the most recent marketed version of \\"The Sopranos\\" was @ $62+, and that was for only part 1 of Season Six.  I felt this was a big \\"rip off\\".  It would be bad enough to pay that amount for the entire season, but for just a half season!  I may refuse to ever purchase it again! <br /> <br />Thanks! <br /> <br />dc <br />
B000002J5K|5.0|Good music from a truly funny film. Aretha at her finest. Belushi can sing! Great interprettions of Chicago style blues. A must have for your soundtrack or pop collection. Good party record too.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this CD. My first John Mayer but I find myself playing it over and over. This is a keeper. Every song is beautiful.
B00005ASHM|2.0|But I think this album kinda sucks.<br /><br />The only song I like is \\"God Only Knows\\".  I might like \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\", if it hadn't been killed by a million plays on commercials and movies.<br /><br />Ho-hum.  I like the Beatles a billion times better, if we're comparing.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I've heard a lot of people say that season 2 wasn't as good as season 1. I completely disagree. Maybe it's because I watched it straight through on DVD and didn't have to wait week to week like they did, but I feel like season 2 really opened up and showed that there was a lot more going on on this island than anyone could have imagined in season 1.<br /><br />The bonus features are phenomenal, including an \\"Everyone's Connected\\" interactive thing that allows you to see how all the characters were, in one way or another, connected before they ever got on board that plane.<br /><br />Season 2 is great, and doing it on DVD is even better.  5.1 Surround - awesome!
B000GPIPVU|4.0|Any follow up to a successful album should come pre-labeled with Caveat Emptor in bold letters. The pressure an artist feels to churn out another hit record normally produces mixed results. This, however, is not the case on Ray LaMontagne's second album. An artist's first album is full of songs that he has carried with him for years; songs that have been honed in bars and hours of self-doubt. 'Till the Sun Turns Black' is a beautifully produced studio album that finds LaMontagne encompassing all the flavors in the melting pot of folk-ish rock. You can clearly spot the songs whose style is aped from his musical favorites, but Ray's energy and soulful voice make each song unique to him. Buy this album.
0783230079|5.0|A must have for Robert Downey Jr fans! Funny, clever, original story! Tear jerker too! Good for the entire family.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Loved these two together in Speed (let's forget the disaster of it's sequel), and they do not disappoint in the Lake House. Saw it in the cinema, then had to pre-order it asap. The concept of parallel time dimensions is always intriguing, and if you can allow a few unexplained concepts, it is worth the ride. Did my head in trying to figure out the time-loop continuum, but it is not the focus here. Overall a warm fuzzy chick flick for a Friday night.
B0000797IO|3.0|Not worth buying, rent before you buy. Not a Jennifer Aniston quality film.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I'm a big fan of Three Days grace. Definitely love the first album very much rockish from \\"I hate everything (about you)\\", Home, Just like you. You expect no less from 3DG's latest album One-X. Their first single released was \\"Animal I have become\\" which did real well. Lyrically not that strong but very much so different style. Adam, Lead Singer, voice definitely changed but he still has that rock charm that we come to love from the first album.<br /><br />Every song on One X is a definite listen. Very much great! A definite purchase!
B00006B1HH|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Recommend for families, but perhaps not for children younger than high school. Some mature themes.
0060776757|5.0|I have read virtually every book published about U2 in the past 22 years.  Much of the information in books written by people outside the band is incorrect.  Therefore, it was refreshing and interesting to hear the correct version of the history of the band, along with tidbits never before revealed, as this is the first time U2 have written the story in their own words.  I believe this book is perfect for the die hard fan; however, as a relatively new or uninformed fan, it would be a great way to avoid misconceptions and misrepresentations that exist in other books published throughout the years.  Buy it! Enjoy it! Fall in love with this band!
1582701709|5.0|I bought the THE SECRET DVD and have watched it five times with friends and family. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who watched it was inspired by the message... the Universe/Spirit/Being/Goddess/God is waiting for you to clearly ask for what you want. \\"Your wish is my command.\\" Focus on what you want. Feel the joy of receiving it KNOWING your wish is on the way. How can any reader/viewer not see the creative genius in this?<br /><br />When my sister gave me THE SECRET book for the holidays I initially thought it was a kind-but redundant-gift. However, I often open the book to a page and read a message that is exactly what I need to remember. I HIGHLY recommend getting the book & DVD because the principles provide a roadmap for success. I don't have the audiobook yet but will get it since I want to continually feed my brain healthy, creative concepts.<br /><br />Caryn Colgan<br /><br />Author of Ancient Pact, Volume 1: The Element of Air

B0007M22TI|5.0|Great Seller - This is one of my favorite DVD's - Too, Too Cool! <br />
0786890762|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I loved how it was written entirely from emails, letters, IM conversations, and other such notes.  Very different in style from most books.<br /><br />The story of Rosie and Alex made me feel like I really knew them, and I could totally see myself in Rosie's role.  I had a best friend like that at one point in my life, but we did eventually drift apart unfortunately.<br /><br />My only criticism is that it ended where it did.  I would like to have seen at least one more chapter after the book's epilogue chapter.<br /><br />Overall though, a very enjoyable read!  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Outstanding!  The best new album I've heard in years!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, period.  It has  a great mix of tasteful humor and true meaning.  I love it.
032147404X|5.0|I purchased a Minolta 5D SLR about 8 months ago and was looking for a book containing techniques and when to apply them. I have owned film SLR's but never expermented much, but with a digital expermenting is easy and I wanted to learn more about how to shoot better photos. <br /> <br />I found this book very easy to read and to the point, and have read it cover to cover twice so far. If you are looking for a technical in depth book this may not be for you, but if you want a this is how it is done book you will enjoy this book. I learned several new techniques and will be trying others I have read. Another thing I like about the book is in most chapters there are blank pages for notes, an easy way to cronicle your own results with a particular technique. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Miami Vice features endless shots of speedboats going to and fro, lots of unintelligible mumbled dialogue, and a lame drug-kingpin plot we've all seen a million times.   <br /> <br />It also features 2 partners, Crockett and Tubbs, who have absolutely zero chemistry with each other.  If you hadn't seen the tv show you'd assume this was their first day on the job together. <br /> <br />I am a fan of Michael Mann and I also loved the original TV series, but this film is a snoozefest.
0790729350|5.0|I found the director cut to be not as good as the theater version doesn't have the same flow.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My daughter saw this movie for the first time a few years ago on TV and felt it was heartwarming. She was so excited to receive it for Christmas. It makes a nice gift!
1932100660|5.0|With the information contained in this book you'll be able to eat your way to health, clear up a lot of the misinformation spoon fed to us, and hopefully reduce the amount of medications you are on.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Although I don't necessarily like the way the children's facial expressions were drawn, I think they captured the book's essence of remembering the innocence of Christmas. Belief of Santa is put to the test in this movie and the outcome is wonderful.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|The writing was terrible and the video was just ok. If I had known it was this bad I would have just rented it.
032147404X|2.0|This book has some good tips on photography for a beginner and covers a wide range of topics; however, the author's humor leaves a great deal to be desired and makes for extremely aggravating reading.  If you would still like to read the book but receive the most out of it, do yourself a huge favor and skip the first page of every chapter (they have no value whatsoever).  The asinine jokes are throughout the book, but the worst are on the first pages of each chapter.<br /><br />If you're wondering what his \\"humor\\" is like, picture the goofy nerd in high school that had the top button of his shirt buttoned, thick glasses, and who would snort when he laughed at his own jokes - bulls eye - that's the author of this book and his tedious sense of humor.  Dead ringer.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|The series is very good, video and sound is perfect. Can't wait till the second season is released. We don't even watch it on TV so we can watch it on DVD without commercials.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I love this movie. Great adaptation of the comic book. (no matter what Alan Moore says) The character of V is ambiguous, intriguing, and even scary. The Wachowski brothers did a good job with this one.<br /><br />I give the movie a 5 out of 5 stars, but I give the DVD special edition only 2 stars. The DVD package is sorely lacking. No commentary on the regular DVD edition. There was so much they could have added to this, deleted scenes, gag reels, concept art...the book From Script to Screen book plus the official website is better stocked with goodies than this DVD. But, this is just another in a long line of movies Warner Brothers is skimping on the extras on. The HD-DVD has a commentary, supposedly, but most people aren't going to have access to HD just yet.
0743564170|5.0|Since I do not have the talent to give a synopsis of The Thirteenth Tale, I can only say it is definitely a \\"Tale\\" you don't want to miss.  It has an air of mystery with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering what is going to happen next.  Sadly, as with all good books, eventually it does end.  You will wish for more.  I have loaned this book to three other people, and all of them became totally engrossed in the story.  We all want more from Ms. Setterfield!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I remember watching this in the theatres and liked it, but felt there was something missing in it. I had wanted to buy the regular DVD set when it came out, but held off. I'm sure glad I did. The 4-Disc Director's Cut was worth the wait! The movie is a much better watch now with the scenes which were removed now restored.<br /><br />All the extras are excellent as well. I enjoyed the mini-documentaries on all the costumes, sets, props, the rehearsal process, everything.
B000FUF6QS|3.0|I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY WATCHED IT YET BUT REMEMBER WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME OUT AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM INDEED
B000002L9J|5.0|have this Smiths album on vinyl and cd...brings back many memories from the late '80's....wish the Smiths would reunite for 1 night and put out a Live Concert DVD.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|This was a great movie but with the high defination it was stunning.  The detail was so crisp that you could almost touch the mountains.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|A great album! Without doubt a more mature musician. Every time you hear it you'll find something new in each song, great production. Favorite songs are: Belief, I don't trust myself (with loving you), Heart of Life, I'm Gonna find another you. Really all songs are great. John Mayer delivers great music in every album, this one is no exception. A great contemporary composer and musician.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This movie is one hell of a mind trip.  Its a murder mystery with clues given throughout the film, some you get and some you dont.  Bale is a great great actor and his performance is excellent.  The ending is so good, you'll want to watch it for a 2nd time right after you've just watched it for the 1st time.  Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job and I wonder how she got so lucky being in 2 of the coolest movies in '06, including another mind trip call \\"The Jacket.\\"  I dont want to give any spoilers away, so theres not a whole lot more I can say.  This movie is dark, dirty, and gritty and needs to be seen and appreciated
0307236722|5.0|This is one of my favourite cookbooks, the recipes are so easy to follow and they work every time.
1564029654|4.0|This is a wonderful book, and my daughter just loves it. The illustrations are beautiful and the message reinsures children, that Mommy always comes back home...
0142405809|5.0|This is a calming story for any pre-schooler!  Perfect for bedtime soothing.  The rhyming is also a surprising plus.
6304508611|5.0|I am sure you all know the storyline already-when I bought this I didnt have a DVD player, but I do now so I am looking for this on DVD.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Awesome show!! Recom. this too everyone too. Actually bought this for all my friends for Christmas. I bought it from Target for $5.99 on sale though.
B00007GZVR|5.0|This is the first \\"hey Duude\\" movie! My hubby loves it. Now I need to get it on DVD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|It Disney, Why say more. As a car expert. I got a good laugh on all the vintage cars used in the film. Any person knowing cars would have a hard time getting the models of all the classic. This is a boy movie and for race fans. Wonderful done and great fun to watch over and over again.
B00005RDRO|5.0|It seems that the US can't make a good farce, except for Neil Simon who has it down to a fine art.  I think this is his second best one, \\"Blazing Saddles\\" being his best so far!  I have seen this every time it was on TV so I was glad to see it out on DVD.  I always like all the old \\"who done it\\" movies of the 30's & 40's so to see them all spoofed in one movie, I still crack up every time I watch it.  It is so sad though that most of the actors in it are no longer with us.  It is sad that there aren't young actors coming along to take there place.  If you need a good laugh or to be cheered up get this one out and watch it!!
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|Barbra is at her best, and the songs are great.  The performances with Barry Gibb are outstanding, and the Robin Williams performance is a nice bonus.
1594200823|5.0|I never knew how much effect corn has had on our society.  I asked myself how a discussion of corn could possibly be interesting?  Well, Mr Pollan has made it not only interesting, he has made me look at the food chain in a completely new way and it isn't pretty.
B000001GQQ|4.0|The piano concertos by Prokofiev and Ravel are played brilliantly and the quality of the recording is all right, though it could be better (which cost this recording a star). A real treat, both Argerich and the orchestra show great timing and dynamics. <br />Both sound and interpretation of Gaspard de la nuit do not match the recording by Alexandre Tharaud (Ravel: l'oeuvre pur piano). Still I wholeheartedly recommend this album.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|...not the toe-tapping Bob I was hoping for (with the exception of one or two songs).  To give you an idea of my personal tastes, my favorite Dylan album is Good As I Been To You...so I like folksy Bob, as opposed to the bluesy Bob who appears on this album.  As long as you're not planning to use it as a motivational tool you'll be fine.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|This was the follow-up to Roll the Bones and saw the band get a lot more into electrical guitar and less on the keyboards and synthesizers to back up the sound.  Standout tracks include \\"Stick it Out\\", the instrumental \\"Leave that Thing Alone\\", and \\"Everyday Glory.\\"  Though probably not as popular as Rush's earlier stuff, from the mid to late 80's, this is a solid album all the way through and displays what the band does best, write good songs backed up by nice guitar, bass, excellent drumming and some keyboards.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Time well spent.  Arguments presented in a well rehearsed and logical manner.  Perhaps too professorial for some, but well worth the time to see several times.
0385338694|5.0|I'm not typically a book reader, and so to say that I read this book in two days is phenominal!!  <br /> <br />This is a funny, witty, light hearted book and was recommended to me by 3 of my friends before I saw it in the local department store book aisle. If you like books written by authors such as Elizabeth Young and Helen Fielding, read this book, as it may be as good if not better than their writings!!
1593351917|5.0|The best BBC mini-series that l have yet seen.  Probably the best version of this novel that will ever be made.  Excellent production all the way around.  This is the one to buy.

1400062756|5.0|Dweck's new book shows the psychological benefits to seeing one's own intelligence, talent, and creativity as incremental or malleable as opposed to fixed. When one's intelligence is viewed as shapable, the need to inflate and defend it goes away, along with a number of other costs detailed in this book that go along with that mindset. This book is on my MySpace page as one of my favorites. It is a must for those raising children in terms of teaching them this healthy mindst that unlock their confidence.  It is also useful for students who constantly face the prospect of failing exams, and how to deal with that pressure in a healthy way.
0671015206|3.0|It's not bad, but for me it was a little boring
0307001369|5.0|My toddler LOVES this little book. The concept is simple. There are labeled pictures of ordinary everyday objects. It's a great way to re-enforce what she's learning about objects in the world. It has kept us busy and happy on many car trips. It's an inexpensive way to spend a little quality time with my child. I see this book as a prelude to \\"What do people do all day\\", which is also good, but in my opinion a little bit busy for a one year old.
630469654X|5.0|It is a good movie; however the only thing I didn't like was the print on the screen as it goes along.
0783227434|5.0|This is the best movie if you are looking for a show with an ancient book of the dead, skeletons, a well positioned chainsaw and a heaping dose of silly humor.  Simple plot.  Better than average acting.  Plenty of quality quotable one liners.  What's not to like?  This movie is sort of the 3rd in the Evil Dead trilogy, but the first 5~10 minutes can catch you up well enough.  This is an excellent film to watch on or near holloween instead of a gory, depressing slasher movie. :-)  Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was introduced to Firefly after the movie, Serenity, came out.  Firefly is a great series and was canceled way too soon.  This series is a great purchase which goes great with the movie.  I love them both. <br /> <br />Scott Nielson
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is a Disney animated classic.  This DVD finally addresses the movie as it deserves and it looks and sounds as good as it has probably ever looked or sounded.  There are numerous extras that delve into the creation of the movie and also into the influences on Walt Disney that in many ways are reflected directly in the feel of Lady and the Tramp.  Disney does not \\"fool around\\" with their Platinum Editions and this is no exception. <br />If you're a fan of Disney animated movies and have only the poorly done previous release from the Disney Anthology it's time to upgrade.

1576751988|5.0|No so called \\"self help\\" book can solve all your problems for you, or even part of them.  Like wise, you cannot build a house with just one tool, say a hammer.  You need many tools, the hammer, of course, saws, pliers, screwdrivers, wrenches, more saws, rulers, saw horses and on and on.  I like to consider books such as this one, \\"Eat That Frog!\\" as another tool in my tool box to help me manage my life.  This particular work hit very close to home, due to the fact that procrastinating is by far the one single problem I have, that causes me more problems than all the others put together.  Brian Tracy has given us a delightful, and I must say, quirky, way of looking at this problem and wonderful tips on how to avoid it.<br /><br />The advice given here may, at first glance, seem simplistic.  But it is far from that, particularly if you break his method down and actually use the suggestions he makes.  And this is the key...You Must Use His Suggestions!  Like all self help works, they do you absolutely no good what-so-ever if you simply read the book and then stuff it on a self and forget it.  You must use it!<br /><br />Now I will grant you that many of the points and suggestions in this book will already be known and understood by most experienced managers.  The nice thing about this book though, is that in covers the subject, which, let's face it, can be as dry as dust, if a fun way, in a way that forces you to remember.  The author has a pleasing and humorous style which makes you want to continue with the next chapter, if for no other reason, than to just see what he has to say and how he approaches a problem.  It is an enjoyable book!<br /><br />I can recommend this work to anyone wanting to get a bit more out of their work life and their life in general.  In this world we live in, we need all the tools we can lay our hands on and this is a wonderful tool to add to your life's tool box!
B000GPIPVU|2.0|If you like old school folk music, you'll enjoy this disk.  The bluesy track \\"Three More Days\\" is great ~ but doesn't blend in with the rest of the albumn.
B000I5X81K|3.0|... for an adequate album.  I enjoyed most of the songs on here, but I was unimpressed with \\"Machine\\", Josh's collaboration with Herbie Hancock.  It was too different from the usual Josh Groban style, and I just found it annoying.  However, the other collaborations on the album (\\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Weeping\\") seemed to work, and I quite liked them.<br /><br />Of course, the highlights of this album are the songs that are similar to what's on Josh's first two albums.  They are highlights, but there aren't any songs that I listened to and said, \\"Wow!\\"  There weren't any goosebump-inducing (in a good way) songs, either.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed, after having such high hopes.  There's nothing wrong with this album.  I just wish it evoked the same feelings in me that the first two did.
0446580171|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' \\"Dear John\\"  is another in his line of books with familiar characters with slightly different twists.  He follows his standard formula 1) His protagonists are of upstanding moral virtue with minor emotional flaws from small towns in North Carolina who are more refined than the occasional out of stater who appears 2) his female leads are all clones of each other -all put on a pedestal with no discernable imperfections in character 3) Once his characters fall in love, they are incapable of ever falling in love with anyone else for the rest of their life. <br /> <br />   All these suppositions are incorrect compared to real life but they fit the formula for the romantic genre of novel which he follows.  \\"Dear John\\" is no different. As are Spark's other books, it is a page turner and the relationship between Jon and his father was the most interesting aspect of this book as many men have had difficulties in communicating with their fathers. We know this story will end sadly and the sacrifice that John learns to make was predictable and exemplary even if not realistic.  <br /> <br />  If you liked most of Sparks other books you will enjoy this one- it's better than \\"At First Sight\\", Spark's previous effort in romantic fantasy.
6304696515|5.0|This was a great read. Easy to understand and much more indepth and indetail than the movie, which is also excellent.  I'm a huge fan of period books and movies and this is one of the best. John Malkovich surely would make any girl's heart flutter.  He is charming as Valmont and plays the character exactly as I expected after reading the book.  He's what makes the movie.
0060899190|5.0|I came across the PostSecret web site last year and since then have become a fanatic.  This book makes it all the more better.  It'd definitely an amazing thing to own and read the secrets of someone you've never met, but still find a way to feel connected.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is one of those movies - they only come along once every few years - where not only do you laugh until your sides hurt, but scenes and lines from it immediately become part of your daily life. Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer, both good on their own, have a fabulous chemistry that makes you want to see them work together again. Highly recommended!
1416905014|5.0|This Cinderella brought a silenced fascination to our 4 year old grandchild.  She carefully opened the many extra corner nooks with ever-widening eyes and carefully studied the colorful twirling dancers, the changes of lizards to horses, the mylar-glass slipper put onto Cinderella's foot.  Report from Mom is that she still sleeps with the book after 4 months and hasn't ripped any part of it even with daily handling.  We were all fascinated with the imaginative mechanics put to use.  A keeper!!
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris has an absolutely extraordinary ability to communicate the humor and absurdity in common situations - family holidays, menial jobs, learning a new language, etc. I bought this book on a friend's recommendation, and after reading it I immediately bought another copy to send to my family.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|well I thought that when John did his last album that he had finally gotten past the \\"pretty boy, where's the girls\\" faze. From what I've seen of the favorable reviews of this cd, he still draws a very young crowd eventho many of his blues admirers are heavily based in the Clapton generation. I bought it...gave it 3 times with an open mind,then gave it away. He is a rockin blues guitarist & I have always admired his pick of mentors. He's wasting his talents on the commercial radio money gigs. Go back to the 3 piece band & rock on Mr. Mayer.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|It is great to compare the songs you know to the way they have been caressed and melded together.  It isn't like hearing them for the very first time, but more like driving a familiar road and suddenly noticing a new attraction - you sit up and take notice.  This is a sit up and take notice album, no matter if you know every Beatle song down to the slightest pause between words, or if the Beatles are some group your grandparents talk about.  Enjoy!
006054094X|5.0|Our book club had endless discussions on the truth of the material,  decided that it was probably true, then we discussed how it would impact the teaching of history and the ramifications.  Any book that can cause such extensive and heated discussion is to be highly recommended.  Reading should have the ability to stimlate our thinking.
B0000047CX|5.0|While the world slept, jazz legends like bassist Charlie Haden and guitarist Charlie Byrd were taking trips to Brazil and hearing these curious musicians playing something called bossa nova. On one such trip, Byrd returned to the states with some recordings by Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. The music on those early tapes kept nagging at Byrd's brain, until he gave in and shared his burning secret with saxophone legend and friend Stan Getz.<br /><br />Getz really liked what he had heard. He contacted producer Creed Taylor at Verve Records, expressing his desire to play with these guys down in Brazil. Before that recording would be made, in the interim, Byrd and Getz got together and recorded the album \\"Jazz Samba\\" in 1962. Suddenly the world woke up and took notice of this new sound with the Billboard hit \\"Desafinado\\".  Within months the album itself went to number one. Later that same year, Getz recorded the album \\"Big Band Bossa Nova\\" and then collaborated with Luiz Bonfa to record the album \\"Jazz Samba Encore\\" with Creed Taylor as producer for Verve. The craze had officially begun.<br /><br />Yet the defining bossa nova album was yet to be recorded, despite the impressive success of Getz's early collaborations. On March 18, 1963 the record, this classic record you see for sale here today, was recorded with Stan Getz on tenor saxophone, Joao Gilberto on guitar/vocals, and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano. Astrud Gilberto was not a musician by any standard prior to this recording. She was simply Joao Gilberto's wife, but one night Getz asked her to sing the English portion of the classic song \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\". The rest is history.<br /><br />To many jazz connoisseurs, this album is the defining recording of bossa nova that set the bar. It won two Grammys in 1964 for best album and best jazz album. But the pop, mainstream acceptance of this album is not what makes this album a must have.  This recording is timeless for the musical talent and longevity of those who participated in its creation. Stan Getz was one of the masters of jazz tenor saxophone. His playing combined with the compositional and playing power of Jobim and Gilberto are what make this album withstand the harsh test of time. This is one of the greatest recordings ever made and belongs on the shelf of all music lovers. If you have the old 78, consider this 20-bit digital transfer remaster an overdue upgrade. The music has never been more alive than on this, and you receive two bonus alternate takes as well. Attractively packaged in a cardboard digipak, to hesitate buying this version any longer would be a crime. I give it three billion stars.vity of those who participated in its creation.

B000H7J9RQ|5.0|Barbra Streisand - One Voice is Streisand at her best regardless that her audience had to fork out $5,000 for the opportunity to \\"be in her presence\\", feted and entertained \\"in her back yard\\" while contributing to her \\"personal political causes.\\"  This DVD captures a magical night with one of the great voices of the last century and when she sings she transforms herself into a hauntingly beautiful woman.  Nothing she has done since has measured up to the stunning talent on display on this particular evening and it illuminates dramatically how she has squandered her immense talent over the years since doing this special concert.  One has to ask why?  Everything she has done since is about putting more money in her already bloated coffers.  The world of music has evolved and changed around her and instead of embracing the huge possibilities available to her, she keeps releasing a rehash of her past glory (hits) or really bad \\"new\\" albums.  She supposedly has a fear of stage appearances but seems to overcome that liability as long as she is getting a $1,000 per ticket. This product is an important addition to anyone's collection of Streisand's music.
0783114893|5.0|This movie is amazing.  I've seen it so many times and each time I pick up on something new in the movie.  A great thriller, great cast and I can't imagine the new remake can come anywhere close to the original.  Rutger Hauer is truly so scary and psychotic.  You won't be disappointed.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE should not be a funny movie. Think about the characters in the film. We have a mother who's trying to keep a dysfunctional family together. Her husband is a self help guru who can't get his book published. The oldest son is an odd lad who has taken a vow of silence he will not break until he gets into the Air Force Academy and it's clear from the beginning--he hasn't a shot of getting into the academy. The young daughter wants to enter a the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant, a contest she has as much of a chance at winning as her brother does of getting into the Air Force Academy and she spends far too much time alone with her grandfather who has no boundaries and say the most inappropriate comments to anyone who will listen and even worse comments for those who do not. Add to the mix a gay brother who is a frustrated Proustain scholar who has just attempted suicide but can't afford a hospital stay so he goers to live with his sister and her family. There's nothing funny about this family, yet as they all are crowded into a Volkswagen bus for a road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine contest, we find ourselves laughing out loud, often hysterically at this sometimes dark, sometimes slapstick, but always clever comedy.<br /><br />The film works because of its ensemble cast that works together to bring out the humorous nuances of the troy. Toni Collette is convincing as Sheryl the working mother trying to keep her family together and throughout the film, she's the only sane personality. Greg Kinnear is Sheryl's husband and is a convincing hapless self help guru we want to shake into reality but also someone we feel for as well. Alan Arkin is the offensive yet lovable grandfather from hell. My guess is no one had a grandpa quite like him. Steve Carell's at times dry and deadpan manner suites the lovelorn suicidal Frank perfectly. Paul Dano is believable as Dwayne and Abigail Breslin plays the young Olive rather sweetly and truly is a \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" (you'll have to watch to see if she actually wins the crown--this reviewer will not divulge the plot).<br /><br />When I saw this film at the theater, I thought it would be a one time only kind of film. Seeing it more than once would never repeat seeing it the first time. I was wrong. It's one of those comedies that can generate laughs over and over. This is a film you won't soon forget and can be enjoyed over and over.shine\\" (you'll have to watch to see if she actually wins the crown--this reviewer will not divulge the plot). <br /> <br />When I saw this film at the theater, I thought it would be a one time only kind of film.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Continuum is definitely a pretty good album.  I guess...it just has that sort of dark and sad angst-of-being-twenty-something feel to it.  I think my favorite song is \\"Gravity\\"; I've never been in that situation myself, but I guess the sound of the music was pleasing to the ear.  \\"Stop This Train\\" is another great song, also rather depressing.  But I get it, especially being a frequent subway rider myself.  Those were the two that stood out for me as the best.  Maybe it's just that in some way it calls up a lot of sad, lonely feelings in me, so I honestly don't listen to it as much as I used to.  But if you like John Mayer, it's definitely a great album.

0345440757|5.0|We had a very colicky 3 month old.  My cousin let me borrow this book and it worked amazing.  I would always rock my baby to sleep then lay her down and she would immediately wake up.  After this read (and a lot of hard work in the beginning) we were able to lay her down sleepy, but awake and it solved the majority of our sleeping problems.  We were able to use these techniques on our son.  Now 3 years later, I have people ask me how we are able to just lay our kids down without a fight and I credit this book.

B00003CX8N|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are superb together.  The dialogue is fabulous, the acting genuine, not contrived.  Somehow in this computer, e-mail age we've gotten away from the meaning of a hand-written letter, of communicating thru books and each other.  This movie is a peek into the lives and minds of a generation ago who felt those things mattered.
0060776757|5.0|It is. It weighs like 5 pounds! It's got tons of pictures and words it it, which is probably why it's so heavy. It's the only book about U2 I own, or have even ever read, so I guess I am a novice in this area, but it's a good book. It reminds me of those TIME/LIFE books that are loaded with pictures and witness comments. It feels like history when you read it instead of like a fan book. I have always liked U2 but never knew much about the personalities behind the music, so if you're like that, you would like this,because it seems to tell absolutely everything you may want to know and some things you may not. One thing I didn't care for was the way the printer used color on the pages making them virtually impossible to read, the reason being that I think this is a book people will want to read, not just have sitting around so they appear to have ecclectic tastes.But I'm not joking when I say this is a flippin' huge book! You have to read it at a table for support! My neck is killing me! Neil, you did a great job, though. I guess if I had to sum up what this book is like,um, it's like going over to somebody's mom's house and looking through their photo albums while you wait on the couch. yeah.

B000J3OTSM|4.0|This could be one of the great and most memorable dance movies ever, if it weren't for a weak and unoriginal storyline.<br /><br />First of all, the dancing in STEP UP is fantastic, even breathtaking at times. The biggest asset the dancing and choreography has in this film is that it is completely REAL! There's none of that, shoot the lead actors in close up and insert the real dancer in long shots.<br /><br />The leads, Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan are AMAZING dancers for actors. It is very rare to find ACTORS in hollywood that also DANCE this good and the creators of STEP UP were intelligent enough and professional enough to use no smoke and mirrors in the movie. They dance and we see them dance. In fact, there are many instances in the movie that are jaw dropping. Most noteably, a scene with Tatum on a car. Then the final scene will give chills to true dance fans.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, STEP UP is far less creative when it comes to storyline, originality and believablitity. Unfortunately, it is ONLY the dancing that will garnish much emotion from its viewers.<br /><br />Many of the dilemmas were too easily solved with coincidences and rushed plotting. Many of the shocking instances were way too foreshadowed, obvious and unshocking. Many of the instances that moved the story along were sort of, for lack of better words, silly.<br /><br />I don't want to give too many examples because I don't want to ruin for those who haven't seen, but I'll try to be vague. Like, the car scene for instance. As cool of a dance scene as it was, you can't help but think, \\"What the heck is this dork doing?\\" Cause that is what you would be thinking if you saw this clown doing this elaborate dance in a parking lot in broad daylight, for no reason. The death scene... I saw it coming fifteen minutes before it happened. Terrible execution. Also, Tatum's free-style dance character adapted to the choreographed moves too easily.<br /><br />The storyline to STEP UP is very run of the mill, you've seen it before, and you've seen it again. Bad boy meets good girl, learns something good, changes for the good, they have a falling out and they get back together just in time to reach their goal. This to me is STEP UP's biggest flaw, but what makes it even worse is that the reason for their falling out, or at least the length of their falling out, is very weak and doesn't really inspire much emotion other than... \\"Oh, I bet they get back together seconds before the final dance.\\"<br /><br />I recommend STEP UP, but only for the amazing dance sequences, choreography, realism and originality. It's just unfortunate that they couldn't come up with a storyline that was original or storyline execution that was more believeable and anticlimatic.it again.

I was honestly surprised at the depth of character development and plot focus that was evident in this movie.  My son like the movie for the race cars (artfully done btw).  I liked the movie for the cultivation of a hero.  There weren't many (obviously) kissy-face scenes that my nine year old would pronounce *GROSSSS*, but the sweet sentiments were still there.  The artwork was fantastic.  And as someone who has lived on Rt. 66, the essence of plain, honest, living comes across beautifully.

I totally agree with all the readers who say this book was a chore to get through. I really think King's accident affected him more than he realizes. This book is filled with meaningless words - and SO MANY OF THEM! It was like he was paid by the word, and when he ran out of real words, he made some up! I want the old Stephen King back...the guy who could chill you and thrill you with each page. THAT Stephen King did not write this book...an imposter did. We've been \\"booled!\\"  Don't waste your money.

0393327655|5.0|For those of you who crave a realistic understanding of who we are and where our belief system comes from, especially those who would like to suppliment their Ishmael/Story of B illumination, this book is a must read.  Sam Harris writes what I have found to be one of the most well-authored, humorous and revelatory texts of our time dealing with how outdated religious constructs have a profound effect on our lives. <br /> <br />One note:  What I loved about his take on the subject was that, although he is one of the world's leading athiest thinkers, he is not a denouncer of religion, per se.  He simply rejects the nature of the gods as we have portrayed them and leaves room for the possibility of yet-undiscovered realities. <br /> <br />Critical thinker?  Interested in politics and religion?  BUY THIS BOOK.
B0000VD04M|5.0|You have to be into the schlock of Ed Wood. Or - if you want to see an amazing portrayal of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau - it's a must. <br /> <br />Otherwise - probably too cultish for the mainstream movie fan.
1891252089|4.0|As any book about ashtanga, the undertanding is much better when you already know what this practice means.  <br />Not only the photos, but also the texts, are excelent. It's a book to keep life long, to consult and read many, many times.
6304711905|5.0|If your into westerns this is one you should pick up. This is a great version of Tombstone and Kurt Russell does a great job in it.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I cannot tell you how many times I have watched this movie.  I never tire of it.
B0001US8EO|5.0|This was a great addition to our western films, we can watch this one over and over again. I recommend you pick this one up.
6303122647|5.0|Christmas or Halloween?<br /><br />Why not both?  This movie's great fun with a neat lesson woven in.  We have a great time every time we watch. I recommend it to everyone as a fabulous family night after trick or treating or while you're setting up your Christmas tree.  Fun, fun, fun!
0884271536|4.0|An interesting concept presented in an innovative novel. Easy to read and  follow. Just like a novel once you start, it is a page turner and hard to put down. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this along with Goldratt's first novel, The Goal.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|This is a great holiday CD.  Diana is great.  I bought one for my sisters as a gift to enjoy too.  Buy it now!
B000FIMG68|5.0|You certainly will not be dissapointed with this purcahse!<br /><br />The Lost DVD's even gives extra tips & Clues to what is happening. These extra clues I didnt find while watching the series on TV.<br /><br />If your a Lost Fan You have to add this too your collection!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Just a great offering from Maiden. This is the best since Bruce returned, better than D.O.D. and B.N.W., and it keeps getting better with repeated listenings. The lyrics are really great on this one and the Guitar work is stellar. The whole band is running on all cyliders! Five out of 5 stars easy...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I LOVED it!! I really hope Joss Whedon and all the cast members can get together for a sequel. It was funny and exciting and had some great plot twists. BUY it. You won't regret it!
B00027JYLC|3.0|Still, it's a good movie for it's time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every episode is wonderful! I rate this as good as all the Star Trek series and sequels. I can't believe it was not renewed. What is wrong with the TV and Movie people!! This would be a tremendous moneymaker if it had more backing. Wake up!! I will truly miss all that could have been.
0887308589|5.0|If you want to know wath really happens inside a typical organization... read this book and you'll name everyone around your cubicle as the characters in the book. Have fun and discover the real organization structure.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|Marvelous music in the genre of Sarah McLahlan but definitely with a sound of her own!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you are reading this, you probably already know that you want this!  Firefly was an excellent series, and was cancelled wrongly.  If you like science fiction involving the edges of civilization, space pirates, and spaceship battle, you'll love this series!  There's a definite 'Wild West' feel to this excellent show, and that aspect shows up in some places that will leave you rolling on the floor laughing!
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Great movie! It's so much fun to watch Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gear dance. After seeing the movie my husband and I took ballroom dancing lessons.
0743289412|4.0|To be honest, I've been a little let down by SKs last couple of books (Lisey, Cell) and expected more out of this story.  Mostly focuses on the wife, when I thought it would focus on the fantasy and horror of Booya Moon, and the \\"piebald\\" creature they saw reflected in a glass of water.  Good, but not great.  Hope his next is better - I think that'll be Blaze, but the comic Dark Tower will be out in Feb.
B000002VCO|5.0|I love this album.  It has some great songs that I had forgotten about over the years.  I listen to it over and over.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie will wake you up to the truth. It's not pretty but we all must face the facts and change they way we live. I sold my BMW and bought a VW Passat Diesel and now run on 100% biodiesel. It's clean burning and made in the USA. No need for war and no more money to BIG OIL.
B000002VCB|5.0|I had never listened to this older APP album when I was young, but am glad that I did now.  It has some really creative stuff on it and I listen to it a lot.
B000I0QL82|3.0|To begin with, let me say that this is a really good movie.  Great music, talented and charming principles, and a story that keeps you entertained.  It is a classic and it looks crystal clear on the screen in this new transfer.  However, don't temp me with extras that are as poorly executed as these.  Fred Astaire's daughter has been very informative on other DVDs but this documentary not only reiterates the same old stuff you've heard over and over but is very cheaply produced.  I'm not even sure the two people having the dialog were in the same room!   This DVD has taught me not to be so anxious to add something to my collection because of attractive packaging and the promise of new information.  If you like the movie and don't care about the extras, buy it!
B00000HZH7|4.0|No, not really. Seven Churches falls squarely in the realm of thrash in my opinion. However there are some elements in the music that clearly point in the direction of death metal. On the whole this is a very good thrash record with some excellent riffs. The lyrics on the other hand are so utterly ridiculous that I could barely read them in the lyrics sleeve. Now I know nobody really cares what metal lyrics are about but they could have at least tried. Recommended for serious fans of thrash, old school death metal or anyone who has an interest in classic and important metal albums.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|When I first heard of this project I was a little reluctant to get a copy of the album as I thought it was one more attempt to sell more of the same by using the image of The Beatles. But when I started to read reviews stating that it was a good album I became curious and decided to get it, luckily, my sister gave to me as a Christmas present... an what an excellent present it was!<br /><br />The idea of re-mixing The Beatles is not new, Sir George Martin did the same for the Beatles `Anthology' released some years ago. Here he basically takes the mixing to a whole new level by giving new renditions of classics by the band performed... by the Beatles themselves! He actually used original master tapes and studio outtakes to shape the album that accompanies the show by Cirque Du Soleil.<br /><br />The chorus from `Hello, Goodbye' at the rhythm of Glass Onion, the riffs from `I want you' accompanied by the circus music from `Being for the benefit of Mr Kite', `Octopus's garden' with the `Good night' music, the chorus from `Here comes the sun' with the `Inner light' music playing in the background are just some things you can expect to listen here, as twisted as these may sound the mixing is incredibly well done that  this new twisted versions will get to you the first time you listen to them.<br /><br />This album is definitely a must for music lovers, but fans of the band will want to get the special edition that includes a DVD, how can this listening experience be any better? By listening to it in Dolby 5.1 sound! The DVD itself is reason enough to get a copy of this album, while it contains no extras at all but only the full album mastered in 5.1, here you will listen to Beatle classics as you have never done before. The experience of listening to `I am the walrus', `Yesterday' and many more in the home theater is something we fans of the band have waited for years, and since it doesn't seem they will re-master the discography anytime soon, `Love' is what you want to get... for now.want to get... for now. <br />
0743454537|4.0|I read the reviews on Amazon.com after I had already started reading My Sister's Keeper, so I think that helped me prepared myself for the ending that so many found to be gratuitous.  When I got to the end, I was expecting something shocking, which by default made it less shocking.  But, I will say this for the story as a whole.  It's real.  It isn't pretty; there are many times that I was completely disgusted by the actions of the mother and even more disgusted by the inaction of the father.  I sympathized greatly with Anna and found myself imaging what I would do in her situation.  I also felt empathy for Kate.  I was born with Cystic Fibrosis, so this novel hit home for me and made real what my family must have gone through.  Realizing that this story is real also made it easier to come to terms with the ending, which, in all honesty, is shocking.  But, I promise you that when you read it, you will understand that it was the only way the story could end.  It is bittersweet - though more bitter than sweet.  I wouldn't recommend this book if you like for all stories to end neatly and happily, but if you want to read a book that is real and honest, this is a good story.
B000AL730O|5.0|Only McCartny can make this music <br />This cd is positive as Paul. <br />Produced and played with groove!!
0743201140|5.0|Buckingham and Clifton have filled in the gaps in the search for personal success, proving that most of what we've been taught regarding overcoming our weaknesses is completely wrong. The strengths finder on-line test that the book leads you to will be a revelation for most people. I have used this book and the test as a teaching tool in my seminars and programs that provide a method for applying discovered strengths, and there has never been even one person who said the test was wrong or that they did not gain tremendous personal insights from it. <br />But, the knowledge itself is incomplete without a method for applying it to accomplish your own personal success. <br />I recommend it highly
B000002LK1|5.0|the best songs oof Depeche mode of all times. <br />I love this cd
B00005JNDZ|5.0|I think every woman can relate to Bridget at some point in their lives. She goes through the ups and downs and insecurities that come with being in a relationship but she does it in such a cute and funny way. Excellent film.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was my favorite disney movie when I was younger and was so excited when I saw that it was coming out.  Now that I am a mom it was such a pleasure seeing that my little one enjoy the movie just as much as I did.  He loves the music and the characters just as much as me.  A great disney movie!!!
B000007MVM|5.0|I always would think twice before getting a Syd Album.   Man, do you know what sorry I waited.  I introduce Syd to all musicians I play with, and like me, from that point forward, his cd's, or mix ones we make never leave the player.  So get this, get this now!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This is a great album.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it several weeks ago.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I think this is the best Machine Head album in a long long time. Maybe The More Things Change is their most known album but this one is almost that great. It has their -good- new sound. Powerfull without the Nu Metal Supercharge style.
B000FDECGA|5.0|This film is required viewing for anyone who enjoys comedic, graphic violence with plenty of high pressure blood splattering.  What can be said?  This ranks up there with \\"Repo Man\\", \\"Blazing Saddles\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"Monty Python and The Holy Grail\\", \\"Godzilla\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Mad Max\\", \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", \\"Videodrome\\", and \\"The Warriors\\".  A must see, must own for the couch potato!
B000J3EEBY|4.0|After reading many of the reviews here I had mixed emotions about getting this CD. Now that I have actually heard it I remain struck by the power of this woman to emotionally transport you to a world of flowing visions that rise and fall like waves. Yes, or maybe no, these is little new here. You can hear memories of prior songs. And the mixture of almost painful cries from the Celtic pieces do not really mesh well with the textures of the Middle Eastern sounds. <br /> <br />I tend to judge the music of McKennitt by how strongly I feel goosebumps, heartaches, and mild tearing. Using that scale Penelope's Song, Beneath A Phrygian Sky, and the final track of Never-ending Road (Amhrán Duit) all rate a solid A. Her voice retains that ability to climb and climb while backed by a foundation of sad sounding instruments.  <br /> <br />The CD is a winner and only suffers from its odd collection of very different sounding, and feeling, pieces. I'll be listening to this one for a while.
006097625X|4.0|McCloud looks at comics as an art form and gives some insights into how the artists expect to be seen. I liked the book very much and passed it on to my son, Rick, who is an amateur artist. He enjoyed it too.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|My boyfriend assured me this was going to be my new favorite movie. I knew virtually nothing else about it beforehand.  <br /> <br />By the end, I was utterly disappointed. This movie keeps slamming its audience with a stream of mishaps and disasters, many of which are unrealistic (made moreso by the fact that they all occur in a 2-day period). Of course I was expecting a very creative, uplifting and satisfying ending to redeem all of the suffering.  <br /> <br />---Spoiler?--- <br />What I got was a completely proposterous, silly, outrageous event which was supposed to unite the family in the bonds of social deviance. It didn't make me laugh, it made me cringe. No little girl would be so naive as to be COMPLETELY unaware of how inappropriate her routine was. She wouldn't have continued the routine while people stared in awe, booed, shrieked, and chased her around the stage.  <br /> <br />Olive is just WAY too hollow in this movie. She is never affected by anything around her. *I* would have been at that age! The central character of a movie should be deeper than that. I would have liked to see her react to her family's trials. If the movie would have taken the dad's effect on her a bit further than a transient \\"Dad hates losers\\" and her studying her reflection once, it would have interested me much more. <br /> <br />This movie left me feeling disappointed and empty. What was the message? \\"F**k beauty pageants,\\" as Dwayne said?  <br /> <br />PLEASE stop overrating this film! It's fine, watchable, but it isn't the best movie of the year!!! <br /> <br />
B00000K0E5|5.0|Love the James Bond movies!  Pierce Brosnan does a fabulous job and Sean Bean ROCKS!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This is one of those movies that takes you back to the 80's (which is great if you grew up in the 80's). All the different \\"cliques\\" coming together, during detention, to realize how despite their differences, they are a lot alike.

1592289444|5.0|I've read quite a few true adventure/survival stories: Into Thin Air, The Last Place On Earth, Shackleton, but never have I read such a harrowing story of strength and perseverance. The real question is, why hasn't anyone made this into a film? Once you start, you won't be able to put it down.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|A must DVD for any fan of Cher.  She is the best.  You will watch this, and listen over and over again.
B000J103PC|5.0|Streep delivers unprecedented daunting effects of cindering burns which caused me to cringe at the ghey intolerable world corporate America.  Two of my favorite qualities were exemplified: simple plot, terribly complex which is all of Streep.  Whoever did makeovers for this eye-popping cornucopia of minted prowess formulated a salacious menagerie.  Even though it is hard to put the book down, put the book down sister, because Frankel delivers as always.  I bought this movie for all of my nieces and nephews for this Holiday.  I watch it all of the time; in fact, I'm watching it now whilst typing.
B0002W18MU|5.0|The only true love of your life has just died and you are on your own inexorable green mile;full of love and joy and sadness and love of your god you stand up to say goodbye. If you hear this cd every day you will realize the beauty and the preciousness of life and that time stands for no one. There is a Hebrew toast that says\\" May your cup of life have one more drop of joy than sadness.\\" hauntingly beautiful says it all.
006016848X|5.0|For anyone in a relationship or thinking about getting into a relationship or if you've been in one short term or forever.  This is a must read.  Not only is it informative but is done so in such a way like no other book on the subject ever has.  When ever a couple decides to become a couple, each should give the other a copy of this book.  Funny, entertaining but most of all solid information from both sides of the fence.  This book was written for men and women alike.  If every married couple read this book, the divorce rate would drop!!! <br /> <br />One of the best books ever written, period.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|As a Formula One fan who wakes up at 2 a.m. to watch races live from places like China and Malaysia this film has always been a hit with true fans.  To have it in my collection is perfect.  It would be impossible for anyone to gain access to the sport today in the way it was shown in this movie.  During a time when the sport was truly dangerous and exciting the storyline along with the footage is perfect.
0679879269|1.0|The first two books were well-drawn out, character-focused and exciting. This book was none of those things. It was a confusing mess with an anti-climactic ending. In terms of reading this as an adventure story, the main bad guy gets destroyed really easily and really fast. And the tempation we're all waiting with bated breath to see Lyra face ends up being not really a temptation at all, just a quickly thrown together ending to finish the trilogy. Sorry Philip Pullman, looks like you couldn't wait to get the check for this one!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|A \\"must have\\" classic. Excellent movie with exceptional acting, well cast, moving plot; watch it over and over and enjoy.

B0000AQVCL|2.0|These guys play with energy and excitement, and are very reminiscent of the early Who.  But the song writing just isn't there.  Besides the radio hits \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" (which is The Who's \\"My Generation\\" played sideways), and \\"Look What You've Done\\" (John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" played sideways), there is really only 1 other decent song on the album.<br /><br />The rest are just rambling junk with no hook, no interesting solos, and forgettable lyrics.
0143034901|5.0|This is absolutely the best book I have ever read!  I wish the author had more of his books translated to English.  If you have ever been to Barcelona, this is the book for you.  If not, read it and then go to Barcelona.
0060001941|5.0|This book is timeless.  I've read it a couple of times and so has my mom.  Nothing dull in these pages.  When friends and I discuss books, I always suggest this book first, second, and last!
0141301104|5.0|My daugher will be 8 in a couple of months, and she got this book for Christmas.  Once she finished reading it, she declared, \\"This is THE BEST book I have ever read!\\"  She laughed out loud a lot while reading The Witches and has instructed everyone in the family on how to detect a witch.   <br /> <br />One drawback to this book is that she now firmly believes she should stop bathing. <br /> <br />We love Roald Dahl's books and I'm sure will add more to our collection as time goes on.

B000FIMG68|5.0|What can I say...I love LOST and can't wait for the next season to start! Very exciting and I love the fact that the DVD has all the extras that you don't get just from watching it on TV.  I actually watched it on TV ordered this DVD and watched the entire season again and saw things I missed or didn't catch on TV! Great - loved it!
157912626X|3.0|The well-ordered world of Colonel and Mrs. Bantry is turned on its ear one morning when the body of a young woman is found in their library.  Neither the Bantrys nor their staff knew the young woman, Ruby Keene, a dance hostess at the nearby Majestic Hotel.  Fearing what the whispers in the village will do to her husband's reputation, Dolly Bantry calls her friend and sleuth, Miss Jane Marple.  She and Miss Marple check in to the Majestic Hotel and begin investigating.  They meet Conway Jefferson, an old man who had been planning to adopt the victim, and his young in-laws, all survivors of an accident that killed Jefferson's children.  Ruby's cousin Josie also works at the hotel, having gotten Ruby the job when she hurt her ankle.  Additional suspects are the too-handsome dance instructor, a poorly-spoken young guest of the hotel, and a neighbor of the Bantrys who throws too many film industry parties his neighbors do not approve of.  In the end, Miss Marple has the whole thing figured out well in advance of the police, who fall for an obvious red herring before she straightens them out.<br /><br />Christie writes with typical British wit and humor, wry observations appearing here and there, such as a reference to a woman who regularly ministered to the poor, no matter how hard they tried to avoid her.  Miss Marple's character is smarter than everyone else, but not in the least arrogant about it, finding effusive praise somewhat trying and deflecting any boastful claims about her abilities.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, I recommend this book for a quiet afternoon or evening when it can suck you right into polite English country society and amuse with its light sense of humor.  It's easy to see why Christie's books have such timeless appeal.
B000F8O35U|5.0|We bought this movie for our kids and they love it as much as my sister and I did the first time it came out!!  I hate that Disney only releases their movies every nine years...They are only hurting themselves.  But as far as the movie, I would recommend it for children of any age.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This soundtrack speaks volumes to the heart.  You cannot listen to this soundtrack without being swept up in the beauty of the music.  Truly a masterpiece...so beautifully done.  I highly recommend it...and the movie as well.

0743298020|4.0|If you like a good story set in a bucolic village with a bit of horror, a bit of madness, and a mystery at its core, this is a book for you.  Vida Winter, a reclusive author, has decided to tell the \\"truth\\" about her life, and has hired a young woman, Margaret, to listen to her stories, take notes and write the book.  Margaret is the daughter of a bookseller with  questions about her own past.  She moves into the big old house and becomes mesmerized by the tales she is hearing.  As she writes and researches she discovers not only the truth of Vida Winter's life, but that of her own.  The book is filled with interesting characters, lots of suspense and a satisfactory ending.
0596101996|5.0|This is THE reference book for JavaScript. I go to it when I have a question about how something works or how to do something. It has a detailed index, which is always important to me because I rarely want to read a chapter when I'm looking for something specific. <br /> <br />I've owned two previous editions, and when I replaced them, they were each well-worn and dog-eared.  <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who finds themselves in the world of JavaScript.

B000JJS8TM|3.0|It's wonderful to hear the Beatles in DVD-Audio quality and superbly mixed surround. It's hard listening to the Beatles remixed to pop beats and other fluffery. There are many points on this DVD-Audio that I love and keep going back to over and over again. Then there are other parts that repulse me. Eleanor Rigby starts with such well mixed harmony, I listen to it regularly and use it show off the full potential of DVD-Audio. Strawberry Fields suddenly morphs midway into modern beat and it ruins the song entirely. <br /> <br />The music deserves no more than 2 stars but the surround mix and audio quality deserve 5. Oh so torn. But I do hope this spawns some more DVD-Audios from the Beatles original works, in stereo or surround.
0843175109|5.0|Some of the Mr. Men series are better than others.  This one is good, teaching about accepting who you are and realizing your potential.  Other Mr. Men characters appear to make it more interesting.  Highly recommended - my 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|As a child I lived in a small town in Northern Maine that during the winter months was often nearly completly covered by a featherbed of snow.  It was a chilly but happy kids' playground of pure white, chrystal fun.  Unfortunately the town was home to a pulp mill that burned coal to complete its purpose.  Often during those winter storms I would wake to see the white wonderland covered with the dirty ash and soot that spewed from the pulp mill's stacks.  It was an awful feeling to see its loveliness descrated.  Al Gore's book/dvd brought those days to mind, and more importantly demonstrated that that kind of polution can be corrected and/or avoided with a little help from us.  It's a beautiful, informative, often sad but extremely helpful look at what is happening and what we can do about it.  I bought six copies and sent them to my children (who live in six different states).  If you recommend something to your kids, you can certainly do the same for everyone you know.  At least I belive you can.  You'll be very happy you read/saw this important piece of work.

0684824906|5.0|What a great book.  You may take your time reading like I did, but you will only savor it more this way.  The descriptions take you mentally right into the time-period when Mr. Lincoln was forging his way into office as President and his masterful use of people, especially those with whom he competed.  He did have opposition but he uniquely leveraged what was best about each person so they could contribute their best to the overall good.  You will really enjoy this book.
0786838655|4.0|I found this book while searching (hoping) for a new Rick Riordan Tres Navarre story.  Why was he wasting time with young adult books when he should be telling us about Tres?  When I looked closer and saw the plot was about modern demigods living among us, I had to give this book a chance.  A great treat for adults who love mythology as well as for the target audience of young(er) adults.   My sister (50) liked it as much as my niece (11).  I couldn't wait for the second installment!
B000000WG4|5.0|My sister and I went to see the movie, \\"The Exorcist\\" when it came out in the early 70's. She was so frightened by that movie that my brother and I had to take turns staying with her in her apartment for about a month.  <br /> <br />I remember hearing a song that was being played during that movie that I thought was \\"catchy\\" and interesting. Later on, my brother brought home a newly-purchased album (remember those things!, aha!) entitled, \\"Tubular Bells\\". I literally got a case of \\"the chills\\" when I heard the part that was featured in \\"The Exorcist\\". The level of quality playing by Michael Oldfield was incredible. It was sort of like the infancy of electronic New Age music. He announced the name of the instruments that were being mixed in including with finally, the tubular bells. I still get flashbacks when I listen to that CD. If you saw the movie, \\"The Exorcist\\", maybe you too will remember that chilling part of the movie when a selection from \\"Tubular Bells\\" was played. I wonder if Linda Blair has copy of this CD.

B00003CXDD|4.0|A wicked queen wants to destroy an infant girl who may one day rival her for the throne. This makes one recall King Herod's attempt to destroy the Baby Jesus. And, as was the case with the baby Moses, the midwife prevents the baby from being killed, and instead places it in a basket to be floated on the water to be found by some willing caretaker. The wicked queen is determined to find and destroy the child, much as another wicked queen, obsessively jealous of Snow White's beauty, sought repeatedly to have her found and killed.<br /><br />Willow has a crooked magic wand which he uses as a sorcerer. At first, he is only able to do relatively \\"minor\\" things such as change his location relative to a tree, and then to change humans successively into various animals. In the end, despite the best efforts to protect the infant girl, the wicked queen manages to get hold of her. The queen prepares to send the infant girl into Oblivion. Willow and his magic wand manage to storm into the queen's chamber just as the infant girl is to be destroyed. Will Willow's magical spell be capable of overcoming the wicked queen's considerable powers, and to do so in the nick of time? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.
B00006GA4C|4.0|I listened to this album constantly as a teenager but then traded it (for some crud no doubt) when I was in college figuring I'd outgrown it. So when I recently bought the CD I was amazed at how much I still LOVE this stuff.  This, along with Black Sabbath's first album, made ringing declarations that the 60s were over.  These guys were far from great musicians but they sure could write a hook (I wish the latter day Staind / Limp Bizkit types took a page from their book).      Downsides?  Mark Farner's no great singer but on \\"High Falootin' Woman\\" he crosses the line into being unlistenable.  And the lyrics on \\"Please Don't Worry\\", telling the kids not to listen when someone says some drugs are too strong, are definitely not cool.      Mel Schacher's bass was mixed impossibly up front but I think it gives the whole exercise a kind of unique sound.  Grand Funk railroad is probably not the first place I'd steer people who are curious about this era but for those who were headbanging back in the day, it's all primo stuff.

B000002AHM|5.0|When you get a bunch of guitar virtuosos together, that usually adds up to a real snoozefest of lots of technical proficieny and zero tunefullness. So an all acoustic session would be even worse right? Wrong!     People can go on about the technical proficiency demonstrated by messrs. McLaughlin, Di Meola, and Delucia. But technical proficiency alone is not music. This, my friends, is music. Nominally, this is labeled as a jazz album but it really defies any genre. If you have even the slightest affinity for great guitar playing, plunk down your ten bucks and listen.
B00004W510|5.0|If you could only own one Band album (which I hope never happens to you), this is probably the one.  Actually, if you could only own one album by anybody, this one is pretty much up there too.  For a band with three other essential albums (Music from Big Pink, Stage Fright, and Northern Lights - Southern Cross), The Band had to work pretty hard to earn it's place as the group's top recording.  If you don't own this record, all I can say is \\"buy it as fast as you can.\\"  It's a classic, influential work of songwriting, playing, singing, and production genius as well as a portal from mainstream rock to the rockabilly, country, gospel, folk and blues that it synthesizes.<br /><br />There's not one weak cut on this album--from the soulful, uptempo openers to the classic anthem \\"The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" the back-porch \\"Rockin' Chair\\" and the heavenly funky \\"King Harvest,\\" the album flows seamlessly from start to finish like some sort of time travel experiment in which somebody took a time machine to 1865 and brought rock and roll along with them.  Guitarist Robbie Robertson's songwriting was never as consistently good--the songs range from narrative stories like \\"Dixie,\\" and \\"Rockin' Chair,\\" to more humorous stream-of-consciousness lyrics like \\"Across the Great Divide\\" and \\"Rag Mama Rag,\\" as well as more oblique numbers like \\"Unfaithful Servant.\\"  Drummer Levon Helm and pianist Richard Manuel contribute as well on several numbers, notably \\"Jemima Surrender\\" (Helm) and the heartwrenching, soulful, \\"Whispering Pines\\" (Manuel).<br /><br />What makes this album so classic is the combination of great songwriting with an unmatched blend of musical virtuosity and variety.  Robbie Robertson's guitar is biting and original, full of between-vocal fills and pinched harmonics as well as some really resonant acoustic work.  He's a master at understatement, usually eschewing solos for lead that supports the song as well as the vocalist while at the same time remaining oh-so wicked (\\"King Harvest\\" anybody?).  Levon Helm's drumming is so fat it sounds like he's in the room with you, and his combination of heavy funk with the mostly folky music accounts for a large portion of this album's unique sound.  Rick Danko has always been an underrated bassist, backing up Helm's funky drums with an equally funky bass bottom that grooves and gets deep at all the right moments.  Richard Manuel's piano is solid, though he's easily outshone when Garth Hudson tears across the keys on songs like \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" and \\"Jemima Surrender.\\"  Hudson represents a one man musical army, unmatched in virtuosity--his unmistakable, agile Lowrey organ lines typified the Band's sound for their entire career, but he was also adept at playing pretty much any instrument he got his hands on, including melodica, clavinette, some of the raunchiest saxophone ever laid down on a rock record, trumpet and accordion.  Most bands would have killed to get a musician like Hudson into their group, and his talents aren't wasted here, bringing class and jaw-dropping keyboard lines to the aforementioned tunes as well as \\"Look Out Cleveland.\\"<br /><br />The final ingredient to the other-worldly magic that makes up this album is the fact that The Band had three of the best vocalists of the early rock era, using them each as lead vocalists as well as backing singers in gorgeous harmony combinations that showcase each singer's unique vocal timbre.  Levon Helm (lead on \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\"), the group's only American member, contributes the Southern flavor, soulfully croaking out lead vocals that evoke good times, the anguish of Confederate soldiers and some irreverent debauchery.  Rick Danko's country-inflected vocals (lead on \\"Unfaithful Servant\\") crack with palpable emotion and provide the sugar-sweet, high-range harmonies on many of the tracks.  Last and most impressively, Richard Manuel (lead on \\"Whispering Pines\\") possessed a truly priceless set of vocal chords, capable of deep, resonant power (\\"Jawbone\\"), unbelievable texture (\\"King Harvest\\") and a heavenly, bellowing falsetto that still makes my hair stand on end (\\"Whispering Pines\\").  These voices are the stuff dreams are made of, and they rotate back and forth, showcasing each singer's talents and deftly matching each singer with the song he sings.<br /><br />I also have to mention John Simon's production--this record feels and sounds so organic, like everything is happening live in a small room.  The texture is so clear and rich, and the record's woody, thick low-end still rocks and grooves just as hard as the Band wanted it to when they originally recorded this gem.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on this album aren't truly essential, except maybe the studio take of \\"Get Up Jake,\\" a live favorite.  Instead, they mostly help prolong the magic, providing slightly different alternate takes that reveal different vocal nuances and less polished products along with a window into the Band's creative process.<br /><br />This record is so good I can't recommend it enough, truth be told. It influenced so many other artists and still sounds so fresh and unique today that it really is a must-own album that belongs in your collection to be heard, reheard, and treasured for years and years to come.p, resonant power (\\"Jawbone\\"), unbelievable texture (\\"King Harvest\\") and a heavenly, bellowing falsetto that still makes my hair stand on end (\\"Whispering Pines\\").

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I am just another one of those Beatles fans who HAS to have all of their music that was ever released (I even found the Christmas records). But this album was GREAT! The Martins did a wonderful job on all of the 27 songs. The remixes, out takes, and studio chater worked well when blended in. The songs fade into each other just like Sgt. Peppers! If you won't buy the album for just that, well, they were all completly remastered (All you need is love is finally in stereo-or at least sounds better) and for only $10 you get nearly one and a half hours of music, you can't go wrong. Plus the DVD version is the FIRST Beatles' album in surround sound.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|The cinematography in this movie was excellent, but the story was very brief and did not do a good job of telling you who was who.  Unless you had played the game within the last two years or so, you probably would be guessing just what was going on the whole time.  If you were familiar enough with the game to remember the backstory and the characters, it made for an interesting little aside, but nothing you can't live without having seen.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I just finished watching Step Up and even though it was not the most original movie it was a great entertaining one. The movie stars one of the most beautiful men in the world named Channing Tatum. Channing plays a guy named Tyler who is a foster kid living with a family who can care less about him. He hangs out with his friends Mac and Mac's little brother Skinny. Tyler and Mac steal cars and sell them. On Saturday nights, they stop in at their neighborhood club. One weekend night after being threatened by some thug, Tyler, Mac and Skinny run off in to the streets. Then Skinny decides to smash the window at the Maryland School of the Arts. After messing around on the stage in the school auditorium they end up getting busted by a security guard, and Tyler takes the blame for it. Tyler gets sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the Maryland School of the Arts, and at first wants nothing but to finish his time assisting the janitor. One day Tyler is making repairs on a ladder and sees some dancers trying out to be the partner for Nora Clark. Nora needs a stand in while her dance partner recovers. Tyler offers to be her partner, but she hesitates. When he convinces her that he is serious enough to be her dance partner the rest is history. Step Up is a great movie in the tradition of Save the Last Dance, and Honey. I have to say Channing's ability to move his body the way he does only adds to his charm. Check out Step Up for a fun entertaining movie with one hell of a hot guy!<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: Spanish, French<br /><br />Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0)<br /><br />Commentary by: Chinning Tatum, Jenna Dean and director/choreographer Anne Fletcher Dolby Digital 2.0<br /><br />Deleted Scenes<br /><br />Bloopers<br /><br />Myspace.com Dance Contest Videos<br /><br />Making the Moves featurette<br /><br />Music Videos
B00005MM67|5.0|K2 is in my personal top-5 of all time.  I'm an armchair mountaineer, so I like the story and scenery, as well as climbing action (most of which is pretty accurate, with just a few petty mistakes).  The very good story is a character study within an action movie, and it stars Michael Biehn, a very under-appreciated actor who was also great in The Terminator, Aliens, and The Rock (he was even pretty good in the really horrible Navy SEALS).  Matt Craven is quite good as the best friend.  Among mountain action movies, K2 is better than Cliffhanger (which is very good) and WAY better than that stupid Vertical Limit a few years ago.
0679422714|5.0|The stories in this book, albeit hard to believe, are not unreasonable.  Just think what will happen in Iraq if US troops withdraw immediately: Without obvious political or military leaders, warlords with hundreds or thousands of guns will take over cities and provinces.  There might be some compromised peace for a short period of time, but most likely civil wars will take place until a new ruler takes over the entire nation.  Guess who that ruler will be?  It will not be a person like you and me.  Instead it will be the one who knows the best in killing his enemies both inside and outside his party, most likely another Saddam Hussein.  This was exactly what happened in China after the last emperor was overthrown.  If the new ruler was not Mao, it would be someone else with similar character.  <br /> <br />The same situation took place several times in China history.  Fortunate to the ancient Chinese, the new emperors knew that \\"one can not rule with the mentality he took over the nation.\\"  Mao could not afford to follow that rule because he faced much powerful foreign countries.  With the victory spirit, he wanted to industrialize China rapidly with his limited education background.  Half of this book describes the results of that kind of vision.   It was unfortunate, but it was just the law of human history.  What destined to happen, happened.   <br />
0316286850|4.0|It's a beautiful book full of beautiful faces, but I am a makeup artist who works for brides and their bridal parties, proms and special events/occasions, so many of these 'looks' just aren't right for my clientele.  There's a lot of interesting commentary about Aucoin's background, experience, and from the stars he has worked with, and I liked the sections on shading and eyebrows, but I wouldn't have purchased this book if I had first looked at in a bookstore.

In fact, I sent this to friends who had a daughter after having three sons, and I said the book was for all three boys, and they loved it.  This was based on Amazon.com's listing and description of the book and nothing more.  I highly recommend it, mainly because it helps an older sibling to adjust to having a new baby in the home, and because it puts him in the spotlight as a new big brother.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I think Mel Gibson accomplished something very important with this film. James Caviezel was deeply moving in his portrayal of the Christ. The other actors made their characters believable. Although no movie could ever do justice to this subject matter; this one is an admirable attempt at illustrating how terribly He suffered for us. The ending shows a unique glimpse of His Resurrection (and ultimate triumph).
0767802470|5.0|The stage on which this movie is filmed is an important<br /><br />part of the story: the cramped quarters of the submarine<br /><br />magnify the tension of the wartime action. You cannot help<br /><br />but identify with the men trapped under water as the pressure<br /><br />mounts on their inflated can and the rivets holding it together<br /><br />start to ping loose.<br /><br />Having breathed with them and felt yourself almost crushed<br /><br />on the floor of the Mediterranean, there is the awful<br /><br />moment of watching them committ a war crime and a violation<br /><br />of the traditions of naval war as they pull away from a<br /><br />burning merchant ship and allow the civilians whose ship<br /><br />they have torpedoed to die in the water, swimming toward<br /><br />them for help.<br /><br />The genius of this movie is that after identifying with<br /><br />these men, we get to commit (along with them) a hideous<br /><br />crime against merchant seamen. So we become complicent<br /><br />in a minor example of the German way of dealing with<br /><br />civilian life: murderers by proxy.<br /><br />The final scene of the movie, indeed its happy ending,<br /><br />is a bit of a vindication for the viewer, but the shock<br /><br />of this close encounter remains for a long time.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN<br /><br />9781601640005
B0000AUHQF|5.0|I've always thought that Rudy was one of the classic sports movies ever. This edition is great. I love it when a movie that is based on real-life events is able to put together some DVD extras about the events in a documentary-style format. This edition of Rudy does just that. The documentary about the making of the movie, and the real life Rudy, is a good one and contains commentary from Rudy himself. I enjoyed it. <br /> <br />The CD with the music from the movie was an added bonus. I hadn't seen the movie in a while and forgot how good the music was. I was surprised that I liked the CD so much.
0618680004|5.0|This is probably the most interesting and informative book by Dawkins yet on this subject.  It has stimulated me to read other works by several of the authors that are described in the text. For me, Dawkins seems to downplay the importance of free energy from solar radiation and geothermal sources in the origin of life and as a driving force for biological complexity. Nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics has a lot to say about these driving forces for the formation of living systems and their evolution to more complex beings--elements that are mostly ignored in the text. The origin of life may not be as improbably as Dawkins implies. Despite these scientific subtleties, this is a great book!  I gave it as gifts to religious and non-religious friends and relatives.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Merle Haggard is at his best on this cd. Would like to see a dvd from him.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Little Miss Sunshine is best viewed as the surprise sleeper independent film that made it big. The problem is, I don't know that that's true. From the first trailer, I felt that this film was branding itself as such, before anything like that had happened. If this film had come out a few years ago, before we had Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, and even Wes Anderson films like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, it might be more groundbreaking. Also, is a film really independent when it stars Alan Alda, Greg Kinnear, and Steve Carrell (the fastest rising name in comedy besides Sacha Baron Cohen)?<br /><br />The truth is, this film is an interesting, sometimes funny, almost poignant look at a dysfunctional family. However, most of the circumstances that take place in the film are at best slightly unbelievable, at worst entirely silly. Often a huge argument will erupt, only to be settled seconds later. The entire premise of the film is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />On the other hand, all of the acting is superb. Steve Carrell is surprisingly successful as a depressed Proust scholar... I could go on about the rest of the cast, but they all nail their characters. The standout is little Abigail Breslin as young Olive, who has a Dakota Fanning-esque acting talent which really makes the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable film, but really that's all it is. It doesn't live up to its great hype, and it never transcends its \\"I'm a quirky independent film, love me\\" style. It's nice to see an original film in a time when our theatres are packed full of remakes, but Little Miss Sunshine isn't the hallmark of quality that it's made out to be.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|When the Beatles work was reissued on CD, I was deeply frustrated by the mock-stereo, amateurish mixing, the better(or worse?) examples being Sgt. Pepper's, Revolver, White Album and Rubber Soul. It was (and still is) annoying to listen to these albums with headphones. I wondered then what happened with the \\"magic touch\\" of George Martin, and how he let his name be involved with those poor quality works. But Now...what a surprise! most of the \\"Love\\" mixing sound crispy and clear, almost none mock-stereo! What happened? About the album 'Love': It seems that someone provided to a \\"DJ-something-looking for his 15 minutes fame\\" (maybe Mr. Martin's son?) full access to all the Beatles Vaults at Abbey Road, and that this DJ-something started a crazy demolishing/revisionist work using the Beatles music, mixing everything into everything. The consequence of all this is the \\"Love\\" album, conveniently launched close to the Christmas $ea$on. The Beatles' output is so overwhelming and unique by itself; it do not need this massacre. Do not buy this album, also ignore the cirque du soleil show. This will be my way to protest against this absurd.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Keira Knightley's fine performance cannot save this poor representation of the great book by Jane Austin. The visual presentation of the Bennet home was shocking. Rather than a gentleman of moderate means we see a household where the family walks through the chickens' habitat to enter the back door, the hog is led by the open kitchen door - it's a mess. Mrs. Bennet is represented as a sometimes drunken slob instead of the proper wife, light in intelligence, seeking to fulfill her primary duty - getting 5 daughters, with little dowry, married. There is no attempt to portray the close relationship of sisters, Elizabeth and Jane.  In fact, the relationship is cast as that between sisters Eleanor and Mary Ann in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". It was a terrible disappointment in nearly every respect. Buy the version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle - it's a treasure whose length gives hours of pleasure.

B00005MP58|5.0|There have been many versions of Pride and Prejudice over many years.  This one is our all-time favorite. The length of the film provides a leisurely study of the mores and customs of Jane Austin's time. It is faithful to the book - verbatim in many cases. All the performances are excellent; there is a depth of talent in the entire cast. The only flaw I've observed, after repeated viewings, is in the direction of Colin Firth's \\"Darcy\\". He does not appear to be burning with passion as he suggests. The attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy is palpable in the recent version starring Keira Knightly. Her performance compares favorably with that of Jennifer Ehle, whose 'Elizabeth' may never be equaled. The new film is too modern in language and careless with this classic. It is also too short to reflect Austen's times. Buy this treasure!

0670034711|5.0|One of the best memoirs I've read in awhile. Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love tells us how she learned to live life after deep sorrow. She didn't just want to survive a divorce, but instead live life with more spirituality and joy. She manages to do just that and teaches readers something about finding pleasure and grace along the way. In prose that is funny, thoughtful, and poetic, Gilbert learns to speak Italian and find the best food anywhere in Italy; chant in an ashram when her knees have gone numb; and  buy a home for a friend on an island where land is hard to come by.  <br /> <br />Read this memoir slowly. Her breezy prose is deceptive. You'll want to savor her descriptions of the food she eats and the places she visits, but you'll also want to consider the nuances of change in her experiences and perspectives. Then pass the book on, or buy a copy for a friend.
