B000069AUI|5.0|I've listened to a lot of soft rock and non of it compares to this. Naturaly,the first time I listened to the album,it seemed long and boring almost as though coldplay were a force sent out to make the whole world sleep. But after a few more listens,the album grew on me and I eventually liked every song on the album,my favourites being: <br />Clocks(5/5) <br />God put a smile upon your face(5/5) <br />The scientist(5/5) <br />In my place(5/5) <br />warning sign(4/5) <br />Amsterdam(4/5) The rest are also okay.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Sick, Nasty, and Brutally Disgusting, I Loved It!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This was the first movie in a long time,to make me not want to look at the screen when somthing nasty happend.<br /><br />Lots of blood, lots of boobies, lots of sex, and some good acting.<br /><br /> This is NOT a date movie unless you have the VERY rare girlfriend that doesn't mind copious amounts of nudity, blood, and some vicious torture scene. Most women would walk out of this movie and you wouldn't be getting any for a month. If that happens though, I know of this hostel you can visit...

1878424319|5.0|I am sure if you are reading this review that you were brought to this book by a friend, loved one or maybe just plain destiny.  I have to say that I have never been the type of person who has had a book or event reach me to my soul and make me change my entire outlook on the world and more importantly on me.  But this is exactly what this book has done for me.  My best advice to you is if you have found your way to this book or been brought to it by someone then just get the book and read it.  It is very short but the message and the teachings will be with you for the rest of you life.  If you truely want to change you life get this book.
0380729407|5.0|Bradbury's novel opens up with a wonderful prologue describing good months and bad months.  After reading this, I couldn't wait to delve into the novel to discover what other morsels of genius he had to offer.<br /><br />The story of good versus evil, youth versus death, and love versus hate is timeless.  It will never get old.  It will be recycled in various formats until the day people stop telling stories.  Bradbury uses his story as a vehicle to expound upon these themes.<br /><br />When a wicked carnival comes to town it tempts its inhabitants with youth and life.  It's hard to say no to your greatest wishes as Will, Jim, and Charles Halloway discover.  Some townsfolk cannot turn their back on their dreams.  Others discover that true happiness means accepting Life's twists and turns, no matter how cruel they may be.<br /><br />This novel is full of exquisite figurative language.  Bradbury shows his prowess as a storyteller in this tale of good and evil.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|So much for special edition. Enough complaints have been made about the lack of widescreen format - unforgiveable in any musical since the dance numbers nearly always take up the whole screen.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there are actually lines REMOVED from songs - in \\"The Hard Knock Life\\", Molly's orders to \\"Strip those beds! Scrub that floor!\\" have been erased, although there is still a camera close-up that clearly shows her mouthing the words. In \\"We've Got Annie,\\" a whole series of servants' exclamations are similarly gone. There are several other omissions that slip my mind currently. Why on earth would the editing team take out these lines? If they were going to remove anything, it might at least have been the two exclamations of \\"g-dd-mn\\" at the end, which are the only occasions of this movie turning un-kid-friendly and were entirely unnecessary. What were you thinking, Columbia?<br /><br />Get this movie by all means, but get the widescreen version. I don't know whether it shares the problem of ommitted lines, however, and until I do, I'll stick with my old much-loved VHS.
B00005JOYA|2.0|I'll mention up front that I've not actually played any of the 'Silent Hill' games.  This will doubtless make many of you think my opinions is irrelevant.  I understand your concern:  Seeing this film w/o playing the games I'm all too likely to judge it on it's own merits rather than just fawning over the fact that a game I like has been made into a movie.  And, contrary to what you may have heard, this film is plenty easy to understand w/o having played any of the games.  I suppose it could be said that the film doesn't entirely make sense, meaning that the explanations don't necessarily jibe logically with what we've been shown, but the connection we are supposed to make is generally obvious.  More to the point, I don't really give much of a damn if my horror movies make sense as long as it's got the individual horror scenes down well enough that I don't bother to look at the big picture.  Sadly, 'Silent Hill' fails in this respect, and wastes a lot of time and effort on a dull, hopelessly muddled script.<br /><br />I should also say that whoever put together the trailer for this movie totally deserves to win the Golden Trailer award, or whatever it is.  Nowadays the trailer making industry is in dire straits, with even good films usually having lame, distasteful trailers.  Conversely, the trailer for 'Silent Hill' actually made the film look like it had potential, and that it might actually be *gasp* good.  The 'Silent Hill' trailer is helped by the fact that it doesn't insist on showing us everything in the movie, focusing on the introductory parts of the film.  This points to how the trailer was able to trick me into thinking the movie might be good:  The introduction to the film is actually well done.  The set design is brilliant, the cinematography  quite gorgeous and the basic premise, while not utterly original, is intriguing enough.  It's the old mysterious, abandoned town premise, but that's always been one of my favorite horror setups, and this one is particularly well done, with some extra nice touches.  (Such as how the fog-thick abandoned town is near an ever-burning fire, which makes ash continually fall from the sky like snow.)<br /><br />Anyway, the film primarily involves Rose and her adopted daughter Sharon.  Now Sharon is a bit of a loon as far as little kids go, constantly sleepwalking and muttering about a town called Silent Hill.  Oddly enough, Rose decides to cure her of her ailment by finding this town, and, I dunno, wandering around there for a while.  Needless to say, there is a dark history behind the ghost  town (HA!), and bad stuff goes down when they arrive there.<br /><br />Basically, Rose and Sharon arrive there along with a lady cop who has been on their trail, and Sharon disappears, leaving Rose to wander around for the next hour or so.  Again, the opening scenes in the town are powerfully atmospheric, and the early encounters with the strange, humanoid creatures that live there are fairly good, but at about the 45 minute mark things start to fall apart.  It's really quite remarkable, how from that point on the film gets almost continually worse, until we arrive at the tediously overlong expository flashback stuffed late in the film and finally the tragically weak climax.<br /><br />Again, the film is severely hampered by the lame script.  The dialogue is nothing but cliches and banalities.  (I might as well cite the two particular lines that always get mentioned:  \\"Something terrible happened here\\", and \\"There must've been a fire\\" [said upon entering a burnt-out husk of a building].  Those may not be the exact lines, but you get the gist of it.  Rest assured, the movie is packed with junk like that.  More significantly, the script has got no sense of pace to it and the various explanations to the horror prove far too mundane considering the setup.  The pacing problems come from the general lack of occurrence between the midpoint of the film and the climax.  We just have things explained tous, uninteresting things, many of which are already known by the audience.  Furthermore, there is a subplot involving Rose's husbands attempt to track her down which is unnecessarily drawn out and poorly intergrated into the central narrative.<br /><br />Alright, now just a few random gripes:  Pyramid Head = Lame.  No other way to put it.  Crazy Lady played by Alice Krige = Way silly and over the top.  Also, this film works on the whole evil/scary child angle, and it just can't pull it off, and if you mess that up you look really silly.  And, ooh, don't get me started about the horrible CGI gore.  I never much care for CGI gore, but this is easily the worst I've seen in a film that actually got a theatrical release.  This is particularly prominent in the terrible, overblown finale.  It's just stupid, formless CGI spectacle, further weakened by the fact that the main characters of the film are generally on the sideline of the situation, so it barely even matters to us what is going on.  (Well, this would matter if we actually cared about these characters, anyway.)  Finally, most of the horror scenes are curiously unaffecting.  I don't even mean that they aren't scary, though they aren't, but they don't even really connect with the viewer on any level, and lack any intensity at all.  They're just a mild curiosity.  (Again, this less true of the earlier horror scenes, but it's never more than mildly unnerving.)<br /><br />Anyway, I can't say I wasn't more or less entertained by the film, but I'm just easily entertained.  It's got its moments, yeah, but it all comes together as a whole lotta nothin'.<br /><br />Grade: C-<br /><br />(P.S.

B000AP2ZDK|4.0|J-Dilla aka Jay-Dee alias James Yancey whose Works was released prior to his death on Feb 10 became known as a worldified timeless masterpiece. This is really good. To put it down, I was never much of a J Dilla/Jay Dee fan before I got to know him instantly. His musical production seems to be doing for me IMO. I can't hate. To me this marks as a first-time lover and beginner of the Genius of Jay Dee. Thank God for DONUTS. It's full of everything: pop, jazz, rock, funk, old school, r&b, etc. This Disc has it all.<br /><br />Thanks for the Legacy and for all the Help you put us thru this Industry. May You live in Heaven. You are Never Forgotten. I really feelin' it. Really neat and very fashioned.<br /><br />J-Dilla/Jay Dee aka James Yancey<br /><br />1974-2006<br /><br />To note: he worked with everyone from Tribe Called Quest, Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, Common, Kanye, Norman Brown, etc. And he's been cited as \\"America's most-renowned hip-hop producer\\", the Best there's now, \\"Pharell Williams's (of the Neptunes) favorite producer\\", \\"A Drum God\\" which was cited by Kanye West, and many others. He will be missed, the Industry will never be the Same. Time to bring back \\"Real Music\\", \\"Real People\\", \\"Real Goals\\". Where it all go???
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Oh, where to begin to describe this heaping mash of aural garbage? Who would have thought that the humble, but earnest beginnings of emo would, almost two decades later,  be spun off to bear this as its illegitimate, disfigured offspring. I keep listening to this record, desperately trying to come up with a single redeeming feature, only to be slapped in the face once again with how abjectly awful everything about it remains. <br /> <br />The instrumentation is designed so that a 9-year-old with cerebral palsy could play it by ear in about 15 minutes. I've never heard so many power cords in a single disc before (and yes, I've heard all of blink-182, the reigning kings of simple songs). It really is quite incredible how moronically simple these songs are. There is no originality, no musicianship, and no SOUL to this music. It exists simply to exist, it serves absolutely no purpose. <br /> <br />And then...sweet lord...then there are the lyrics. I'm still somewhat in a state of shock at how idiotic these songs are. I could ALMOST look past the asinine song titles if there was any lyrical substance in the songs themselves. I assure you that this is absolutely not the case. Its almost commendable, if it were parody. If they had come out and said \\"We did everything we could to make this as stupid as possible,\\" there would at least be some wit behind the album. As it stands, it seems as if these Las Vegas rejects are actually thinking they're making legitimate music. I think I'm going to be sick. If you don't believe me, go actually read a lyrics sheet to the inanely titled \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage.\\" If there is a single person who can make any kind of sense to these lyrical feces, please, for the love, let me know. <br /> <br />I'll be the first to say I'm a pretty big detractor of the whole emo movement. The \\"heart-on-your-sleeves/love me because I'm more sensitive than the other guy\\" thing is just a pretty dang stupid musicaldevice. But at least up until the turn of the century it was a legitimate musical movement. Now all we have are the idiots looking to eat of the scraps of a table almost completely picked clean.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend better music, but anyone listening to this trash doesn't really deserve to hear it. As it stands, the growing popularity of bands such as Panic! At the Disco has me not only saddened by the state of the record industry, but humanity as a whole. I'm not sure I want to live in a world populated by the kind of people who like this music.
B00024I31C|5.0|I sometimes wonder what makes the difference between an artist and a shooting star ? I'm listening to Cale's music for almost thirty years. Actually I grew with it. From one album to another he never ceases to surprise me. Probably the difference that I'm talking about lies in some magic blend of musical wisdom, imagination, loose attitude and passion for creation. Cale has them all. This album makes no exception. It has everything from each one of his previous approaches: the misty mood of \\"Naturally\\", the punchy sound of \\"Troubadour\\", the stompy rhythms of \\"Shades\\"... For any Cale passionate this is a must. And the sound of the CD is wonderful. Just listen to \\"The Problem\\" and \\"Fancy Dancer\\" and you know what I'm about.<br /><br />Amazon, is there a possibility to grant him 6 stars ?...
B00005J6SZ|5.0|A great blast from the past. I remember this record (vinyl) when I had it in (1984-1985) Madonna was young and full of energy in those days. She still does today. But at that time she really made you sing along with her with \\"Like A Virgin\\" lp. \\"Dress You Up\\" a real fast pace song with alot of energy. My favorite \\"Angel\\" a nice paced song. \\"Material Girl\\" was a song of wanting rich men, but I know Madonna was not really like the material girl song. She was just catering to the record and the time. Every song on this record was a great song even the less heard ones ex.(Pretender, Stay, Over And Over)etc. Whether you were around at the time or just discovering this remastered cd, you will enjoy the awesome remastering job done to it and the two special mixes. I listen to this cd and as commercial as this record was at the time, this cd really makes me miss the mid 1980s. Enjoy the cd, it sounds better than ever. Ps. My \\"Like A Virgin\\" record did have a scratch or two on it and it skipped back in the day...... you and I wont have to worry about that anymore.....
B0002ZMITY|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />It is full of laughs, and sometimes it is dry humour - you have to think to see what's funny - like the time Ali G and enemies were having a gunfight, and Ali G stopped the fight to escort two children across the road. When he set them down he said 'Remember kids, life is the most precious gift of all' and then as soon as they were on their way, he started shooting again!  <br /> <br />Oh well, I won't tell you anymore, otherwise I'll spoil the story. But you should seriously see it. <br /> <br />If you don't like it, well start wishing that you could shoot people like me over the internet.  <br /> <br />Until then, get down to the nearest Video Ezy and get a copy. NOW!  <br /> <br />Satisfaction - GUARANTEED!
0736063684|5.0|I am new to strenght training.  This book was INCREDIBLE.  It helped me understand the muscles to be used for each exercise.  The pictures are very helpful and allowed me to see exactly how each exercise should be executed.  I also bought Home Workout Bible and barely looked at it because this book was so complete.
B000002LCK|5.0|A sweeping chronical of one of the 80's greatest bands, Substance covers everything from the early days after the transformation from Joy Division to the pop perfection of True Faith in 1987.  For the casual observer, this is all you will ever need to cover the best New Order music. <br /> <br />There have been great New Order songs since Substance (\\"Round and Round\\", \\"World in Motion\\", and \\"Regret\\" come to mine), but none of it comes close to the genious of \\"Ceremony\\", \\"Temptation\\", \\"Blue Monday\\", \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\", and \\"True Faith\\" found on this compilation. <br /> <br />You may also find that the less familiar songs, such as \\"Theives Like Us\\" and \\"Sub-Culture\\", are quite good as well. <br /> <br />Disk two falls into more die hard fan area.  However, if you find that you enjoy disk two I would encourage you do more digging into the New Order back catalogue.  Specifically 1989's \\"Technique\\" and 1983's \\"Power, Corruption and Lies\\" are at the top of my list. <br /> <br />If you enjoy 80's techno pop you will not regret purchasing this album.  In fact it may become a staple of your music librbary as it has for me.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is story telling at its best. I give my heartfelt thanks to the entire cast, crew, writers, producers and director for making such a sublimely beautiful story. This movie depicts the tortured life of two poor, uneducated guys who just happened to be gay growing up in the deeply homophobic heartland (an oxymoron if I've ever heard one). Their story is painful to watch and makes you wonder, if in a different world, they would have lived long fulfilled happy lives.  But ignorance is alive and well in the good ol' USA guaranteeing many more years of tragic stories like this one for the unfortunate souls deemed unworthy of the righteous right.  Hopefully the laws of physics will keep humanity from reaching distant worlds for thousands of years to come.  The idiotic way we treat each other and our own planet is proof enough that we don't deserve such power and knowledge. More importantly however, alien species wouldn't deserve our hatred, bigotry and man-made religious intolerance!  Brokeback Mountain, though not intended, is a testament to human ignorance and intolerance!  But its also a wake up call to an emotionally psychotic society that still churns out young men with a deep hatred and fear of the emotion Brokeback brings to life with such clarity.  The question so many have not faced is \\"What are you so afraid of and why?\\"  This movie is a timely and important film to be seen by all.
B0002BO0AS|2.0|I've recently been going on a cd purchasing spree. If something catches my attention, I'll give it a whirl. So far, I've been pretty satisfied and proud of myself for the purchases I've made. Until I hit this snag. Another reviewer has said exactly what I've been saying for so long. This is unoriginal dribble. It fits so snug into the current trend of metalcore in America that I turned it off after two songs. I could throw this into a pile of As I Lay Dying, August Burns Red, Between the Buried and Me, Shadows Fall, Trivium, or any other current Ozzfest darling and never be able to tell the difference. And being in a band myself who has played with August Burns Red and BTBAM, I can tell you there is truly nothing new going on. Avoid this and get something with some balls.
B000E41MS6|5.0|After being off the air as a regular series for 16 years, it's understandable that the public was more than a bit skeptical about the return of Doctor Who. Known primarily as \\"that show with the really low budget\\" and set to be relaunched in a time when the Star Trek franchise had come to a crashing halt, was this really a good move?<br /><br />As it turned out, the advertising slogan was correct: \\"He's back, and it's about time.\\"<br /><br />Helmed by writer/executive producer Russell T. Davies (Queer as Folk, Bob and Rose, The Second Coming), the new Doctor Who was in many ways how fans of the original had always pictured a modern day incarnation of the program; slick, edgy, sharp, and fun. Assembling a group of writers who'd worked on other hit British shows (Coupling, The League of Gentlemen, Casualty), Davies and company wrote 13 stories that really proved that Doctor Who could and would still be topical in this day and age.<br /><br />Even the worries of a bit of stunt casting in the form of former British pop star Billie Piper as the companion Rose to Christopher Eccleston's Doctor proved to be all for naught; not only are both leads excellent actors, but they have such an instant chemistry that it's easy and understandable to see why the two continue to travel together.<br /><br />This first season has something for everyone. For long-time viewers there are classic foes from the past, but new viewers won't feel left out, as any bits from the past are presented in a way to make everyone welcome and on the same page. With high points with episodes like Dalek, Father's Day, and The Empty Child, you'll want to watch one episode after another in rapid succession.<br /><br />There are thankfully few weak points; one two-parter that could've stood to be compressed down to one (Aliens of London, World War III), and a slightly rushed ending to the season finale that feels like it comes down to a behind-the-scenes changing of the guard at the end of the season. They're minor quibbles, though, and quickly forgiveable when compared to the high quality otherwise on display.<br /><br />The packaging of this DVD set leaves a bit to be desired (the overlapping discs in particular seem like they're just begging for scratches), and it would've been nice if deleted scenes had prepared in time for inclusion here, but with numerous documentaries and commentaries there's enough to keep even people who've already seen the episodes entertained.<br /><br />Once you've watched this new series of Doctor Who, just be warned--there's no turning back.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|I was initially somewhat disappointed with Madonna's latest recording. For a woman who has constantly been pushing limits, this seemed like too much of a step backwards, a blatant attempt to lure back fans she may have lost after 2003's \\"American Life.\\" While I did not think \\"American Life\\" was her best recording, I admired its boldness and thought it contained some of her strongest songs ever.  <br /> <br />Personally, I think that Madonna as a balladeer is severely underrated, and, admittedly, the idea of an all-dance album from her might not have seemed as thrilling to me as it did to other fans. Several of Madonna's best recordings forge a bridge between dance music and ballads. I'm thinking of \\"Frozen,\\" \\"Secret,\\" even \\"Borderline\\" ... songs that are defined by a palpable melancholy and longing. \\"Confessions\\" has only one track like that, \\"Forbidden Love,\\" and it's the album's highlight for me.  <br /> <br />But this is a dance album, right? Right. Melancholy and longing isn't the point of this particular outing. Once I adjusted my expectations, I grew to appreciate this album.  For the most part, it's a really strong dance record. There are a few clunkers--\\"I Love New York\\" is downright awful--but for the most part it's Madonna mining a territory she has mastered before. Given that, there isn't the thrill of the new that I've associated with some of her best albums (\\"Erotica,\\" \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Music\\"). This feels like a very good Madonna album as opposed to a landmark recording. That said, a very good Madonna album is nothing to sneeze at. <br /> <br />While \\"Hung Up\\" is undeniable, I think some of the strongest tracks on here are the ones that are more insinuating, less beat-you-over-the-head catchy. \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Get Together\\" are shimmering and glorious, as is the aforementioned \\"Forbidden Love.\\" Many of the lyrics on the record are a little daft, and I wish some of the songs showed off her vocals a bit more (she was sounding really great at the Reinvention Tour), but this is a strong set.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|After 310 reviews already posted here, I doubt you want one more.  But as an avid A&E miniseries P&P fan I felt I needed to add my own positive review about this brisk adaptation.  The pacing was certainly quick (when Charlotte announced that she was marrying Collins after only 30 minutes I knew this was going to be a quicker ride than I was used to!), but the writers kept all the highlights and were able to piece together a refreshing version.  It's kind of like the Cliff's Notes version for those that want a quick taste of Austen without having to settle in for the 6-hour Firth/Ehle miniseries. <br /> <br />A quick note about MacFadyen, portraying Darcy.  I was prepared to dislike him entirely as Darcy, given my propensity for Firth's portrayal.  However, I discovered that my two favorite scenes in this version were the very two scenes that are the most important to the Darcy/Lizzy relationship:  His first declaration of love and eventual insult of her family followed by his second declaration in the meadow.  In both of those scenes MacFadyen was brilliant and I much preferred his awkward announcements over Colin Firth's brashness (sacrilege for most, I know). <br /> <br />Very well done!
1558216847|5.0|Rawicz describes his experiences from the beginning of the war, providing fine details that would be virtually impossible to fake were one not actually there.  During the German attack on western Poland, he was a lieutenant in the Polish cavalry. His testimony contradicts the usual ridicule of Polish cavalry. In fact, even though the German army was more mechanized than the Polish army (owing, of course, to the larger industrial potential of the former), the Wehrmacht was not fully mechanized, and there was also a German cavalry. In any event, Rawicz describes a successful attack of the Polish cavalry against the Germans. The German position was overrun. Scores of Germans were killed and other German surrendered to the Poles.<br /><br />Then the Soviet Union stabbed Poland in the back. Rawicz was captured, and eventually spent time in the dreaded Lubyanka Prison, and then Kharkov. He was subject to the standard trumped-up charges of being a spy. He was tortured, including by being subject to drops of hot tar put on him. He ended up in Camp 303 in Yakutsk, Siberia.<br /><br />His escape led to an over 4,000 mile trek to freedom. He only had an axe and homemade knife. The privations were appalling. One by one, his co-escapers died. For fire, he used dried fungus lit by flint. He had to cross the Lena River, the Lake Baikal area, the trans-Siberian railway, and much more. He ate snakes in the Gobi Desert. He describes the Mongols and then the Tibetans as being hospitable. Eventually, he had to cross the Himalayas, where he lost yet another member of the crew. Finally, he was safe in India.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I loved this movie!  Felicity Huffman was amazing and should have won the Oscar.  She brought a very real persona to the character and was totally believeable as she embarked on this journey of her life.  The chemistry between the two leads and the obvious development of mutual respect and understanding was truly touching. <br /> <br />If you like a lot of action in movies, you probably won't like this film.  If however, you appreciate character development and a good storyline, do not miss it. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, people should RATE THE MOVIE AND NOT THE COVER ART!  The film is fantastic and it doesn't deserve one star just because people are unhappy with the box it came in.  Unbelieveable.
B00000DR8R|5.0|This CD was on high rotation when I was in college but had been collecting dust for a decade or more when I recently rediscovered it while ripping my collection for my Squeezebox.  I found myself still singing along to almost every song.  Perfect Skin and the title track Rattlesnakes are pure pop genius.  There's only a few slow tracks on the disc, but then one of them, Forest Fire, is also one of the best and most memorable.  The songwriting by Cole and the musicianship by the band on this disc are fantastic - highly recommended.
B000E97Y6A|3.0|When the movie King Kong first starts off, I found myself mesmerized by sets, intrigued with the dialogue, and wondering if the casting and directing could keep up such great momentum.  The answer is NO!<br /><br />The first part of this film is so fantastic that I have recommended people only watch the first half and then just pull the DVD from the player.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong.  I don't think this film was a complete flop.  It is just a bit overrated, in my OPINION.<br /><br />Being tossed around by a giant gorilla can not be an easy job, yet Naomi Watts (as Ann Darrow) pulls it off brilliantly.  Her performance throughout the entire film is truly amazing and worth praise.<br /><br />Jack Black is also brilliant in the first half of this film, too.<br /><br />The second half of this film, starting with the dinosaurs are scared and running scene and ending with the most boring finish to a thriller (yeah, sure, it's suppose to be a love story - whatever) movie ever shot, is such a complete letdown that I would never actually purchase the DVD.<br /><br />Peter Jackson directed the most incredible trilogy ever - \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  That doesn't make him invincible.  This film proves that.  The second half of King Kong is nothing but a computer animated \\"Fear Factor\\" episode with an extremely boring ending that lacked any suspense, interesting dialogue, or creative input.<br /><br />It really is a shame.  This film could have been so much more.<br /><br />See ya next review!
0345440900|5.0|This is the first book I've ever felt passionate enough about to write an Amazon review - but I can't say enough about how much this book helped me with my son.  What I think the Baby Whisperer offers that other books don't (and believe, me, i've read at least a dozen others), is that she gives you PRACTICAL how-to knowledge.  For example, other books will explain the importance of getting your baby on some sort of sleeping schedule, but that doesn't help you when you know the baby's tired and it's time for his nap, but when you try to put him down he screams.  Tracy walks you through how to comfort him and gradually teach him how to go to sleep on his own without letting him cry it out, or become dependent on you rocking him or nursing him to sleep.  By the time my son was a few months old, once I saw the signs that he was tired I could simply lay him down and walk out of the room.  It took some work to get him to that point, but it was well worth it!!! <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone I know with a baby - as well as the companion book \\"Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems\\" which goes into more detail on the techniques, whereas this book really explains her philosophy and gives an overview of the techniques.  And finally, I'm now benefitting from her toddler book with my 14 month old.
068485743X|5.0|I felt, while reading \\"The First Five Pages\\" (and I do not mean that literally) that I was spending time with a kind, true, and wise friend. Somehow, although critical, I felt Mr. Lukeman was on my side. It seemed a very personal experience and I gained much from it.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|To tell you the truth, I was afraid to see RENT, the film.  I was privileged enough to see the Broadway production and it was an incandescent experience.  Needless to say, I wanted to preserve that and enjoy the soundtrack.  But on one rainy Sunday afternoon on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I tuned in to On-Demand and ordered the film.  I was hooked from the opening moment on.  So I cleared away whatever distractions I had brought with me to the couch to divert my attention from awful scenes filmmakers sometimes include in their films, and I sat back and let the experience unfold.  It was glistening!    The palette of the film is the same as the artwork used on the original Broadway production.  All but 2 of the main characters are from the original cast.  I have to say I was even worried about that.  Though I would enjoy seeing them again, would the passing of time preserve the spirit of those performances?  Not only is it preserved, but it has deepened!  Even so, after 10 years would time have not weathered their faces and developed their physiques beyond character believability?  Surprisingly, not in the least!  The performers and performances are timeless.  And would the two new performances dislodge the structure and momentum of the piece?  Not in the least.  Wonderfully, they are so there!  Further anxieties left me wondering if it would be a hungry RENT or one sated by Hollywood?  And was Chris Columbus really the right director to bring it to the screen?  Chris Columbus really understood the piece, translated it well, and made sure he kept it hungry.  And thank you very much for the skyline shot of the World Trade Center!    Another area of concern is the need to open it up for the film medium.  This is successfully achieved in the \\"Tango Maureen\\" and \\"Out Tonight\\" numbers.  Unfortunately, I did not find it as successfully done in two scenes.  For one, the scene in which Joanne takes Mark and Maureen to the Buzzline offices, and the other was the \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" number.  Unfortunately both these scenes contain the characters Maureen and Joanne.  The first maybe to give them something more to do that actually makes less of their use.  In addition the palette changes and becomes a bit flat - my apologies to a wonderful cinematographer.  And the other unfortunately has brilliant performances from both of the characters; but again, the room, the set, somethig about the environment doesn't match the rest of the film.    That said, I want to encourage anyone who has seen the musical and had some reservations about seeing the film to do immediately!  Believe me, the music is so, so powerful and its treated really, really well that it makes the performances and visuals that much more enjoyable.  By the time you get to the end and ask yourself if they've done the piece justice, I have a strong feeling you'll agree with me that they have.    In addition, the special DVD set includes the documentary called, NO DAY BUT TODAY which gives the background story of  Jonathan Larson's short life, death and the birth of RENT.  You'll meet the cast, producers, family and friends.  You'll come to love Jonathan's family just as much as you do his baby, RENT!
B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill (Christophe Gans, 2006)<br /><br />I hope someone explains this to me, because I don't get it.<br /><br />There are three kinds of people who hated Silent Hill: the people who played the games and found the movie not enough like them; the people who have never played the games and couldn't follow the plot; and the critics, who, as a whole, haven't liked a single horror film in so long that by now it's a knee-jerk reaction. They, too, had a hard time following the plot.<br /><br />What I'm not getting-- how did anyone have a hard time following the relatively straightforward, actually quite simple, plot?<br /><br />Obviously, I can't explain it all to you without spoilers. But, really, folks, has your ability to connect the dots gotten that rusty? If so, I fear for the fate of modern society far more than I did on Friday before about 9:45PM, when I left the theater after seeing what I thought was quite the bang-up little film.<br /><br />I wrote recently, in my review of Slither, that it was one of the best horror films I'd seen in ages. And here we are getting Silent Hill in the same month. It's an embarrassment of riches. It leaves me with the hope, however infinitesimal, that someone in Hollywood has finally grown a brain. Two movies in one month that lead me to revise my position on the death of the American horror movie. Hollywood, I am weeping with joy, and for once, you are the cause. Thank you.<br /><br />Okay, here's what I can tell you. Now, if you saw the movie and couldn't follow along, pay attention. Rose (Visitors' wonderful, and criminally underutilized, Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy's Sean Bean) DaSilva have adopted a girl named Sharon (Kingdom Hospital's Jodelle Ferland). She comes from rural West Virginia. Sharon has nightmares, during which she sometimes (a) sleepwalks, and (b) talks about a place called Silent Hill. The condition is getting worse. Rose, in a desperate attempt to get to the bottom of Sharon's condition, decides to take her to Silent Hill, about which Sharon, when awakes, knows/remembers nothing. Christopher is not at all happy with this decision. On the way, Rose and Sharon attract the attention of Cybil (Fantastic Four's Laurie Holden), a local cop who thinks they seem suspicious (she explains why later, and if you found it out of character, folks, you've never lived in places that consider black swampy water potable) and follows them. While running from Cybil, Rose gets into a minor auto accident that knocks her unconscious. When she wakes up, the geography has changed slightly, and Sharon is gone. Rose, now on the outskirts of Silent Hill, must rescue Sharon, while, preferably, avoiding Cybil.<br /><br />If you missed any of that, I'm guessing you weren't paying attention, because all of it was actually explicitly mentioned in the film. In general, each facet of the above summary was mentioned only once, but none of the above summary was stuff I had to use any big leaps of logic for. There are things people have been asking that do require leaps of logic, but those, in general, are more gamer-geek questions than \\"I didn't get the story\\" questions. (The most common of these being \\"why is Pyramid Head in this movie?\\", one of the few questions being asked about the film that seems to be inspiring intelligent debate. My answer: because it's bloody cool, and Christophe Gans seems to think so, too. The movie doesn't have to be entirely faithful to the game; most film adaptations of books are, shall we say, not faithful. Like, they're cheating harlots.) If you weren't paying attention, don't criticize the film for being hard to follow. Your fault, not that of Gans and Avary.<br /><br />Whom I should mention, though their contributions were, in fact, somewhat mediocre. Director Christophe Gans (Pacte des Loups) and screenwriter Roger Avary (Killing Zoe) did a competent job with their roles. Avary's script was a bit heavy on the exposition, Gans' directing was just heavy. (Though, to be fair, I felt that way about Pacte... as well.) It's cinematographer Dan Laustsen (who also worked with Gans on Pacte...) and monster guy Patrick Tatopoulos (Pitch Black) who really give this film, once it gets going, something to sink one's teeth into.<br /><br />The acting is, well, standard. Which is kind of surprising, given the presences of folks like Mitchell, Bean, Alice Krige, and Deborah Unger. Mitchell takes the Naomi-Watts-in-The-Ring approach to acting (scream at anything that comes near you); Krige does the zealot relatively well, but lacks the air of menace that you know she's supposed to have before she gets to play the zealot. Unger turns in the best performance of the lot, perhaps her best since Crash ten years previous.<br /><br />But then, are you really seeing a movie like this for the acting? Or, for that matter, the directing or the script? Competence is good enough. As long as there's atmosphere, you've got yourself a movie, and what Silent Hill does have is atmosphere in spades. One of the few problems I had with Hostel was its rather abrupt shift in tone; softcore porn one moment, hardcore horror the next. Silent Hill is, on the other hand, a seamless blend of atmospheric horror flick and gore film, with more than a little mystery and psychodrama thrown in for good measure. This, of course, leads to lots of criticism; the atmospheric horror fans are blasting it for the amount of gore, the gorefeinds are saying there's not enough. I could've done with a tad more gore, myself, but I'm not counting points off for not having enough. Here, it seems to me, is the first really hard evidence that America is learning from Japanese New Horror, as opposed to simply remaking it or imitating it. (And while Eli Roth made a bang-up flick, Hostel really is more imitation than internalization.) All of the visuals, once Rose gets to Silent Hill, are aimed at throwing you off, if not always disturbing you. Nothing looks right, even those things that normally would. (Gans does kind of overplay this a tad in the scene with Christopher and Gucci wandering through the school, but since he's setting up a later shot, I have to at least partially forgive him; whether you will or not depends on whether you think that later shot is also overdone. It is, but only a touch, really.) You know something's not right, even before Rose does, and by the time she's figured it out, you're in full-on disturbance mode. Avary does a good job of spacing things out (e.g., showing us the miners, giving us a scene with the miners, showing us who the miners are) in the script so as to achieve the maximum disturbance effect, and again, as long as you're paying attention, you should be able to connect the dots just fine.<br /><br />Now, what I didn't tell you at the beginning of this review: I have never played the Silent Hill games. I was only marginally aware of their existence before I started hearing buzz for this movie, and as of now, all I know about them I know from the movie. So I am living proof that the \\"you have to have played the game to understand this movie\\" criticisms are wrong. I've barely even seen the boxes, and I thought it was loads of fun and easy to follow. The script was probably too subtle for a lot of people who saw it; I hope to all that's holy that doesn't lead Hollywood to start dumbing horror films down again. A lot of us did get it, and we're deeply appreciative that this script got through the way it did.<br /><br />I cannot recommend highly enough that you see this movie if you're a horror fan. See it on a double-bill with Slither, if you can; they're two aspects of what the Hollywood movie machine can do, if they either encourage or ignore folks who want to make movies that don't fit standard fare. Great stuff, both of them. ****n, Gans' directing was just heavy. (Though, to be fair, I felt that way about Pacte... as well.)

B0000062Y2|5.0|Originally issued in 1970 packaged as a double Lp Concept album with Deep Purple's Ian Gillan as Christ back in the days of the  short-lived Rock Opera genre -- Jesus Christ Superstar was intially held as a musical play out of compromise and fear from sensoral scrutiny by its writers Timothy Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, as in its stead they opted to issue it on a 2 disc set of vinyl platters thus - until the time when it is finally made into a musical play in London the following year.<br /><br />This movie soundtrack for the film rendition directed by Norman Jewison comes as the definitive and the most complete version of this work from the songwriting team of Webber and Rice.<br /><br />Depicting the last seven days of Christ - of all musicals, JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR comes as the most impressive, given that not a line from its narrative are spoken, but are all (mark this) SANG! And are not only sang - but each musical piece which consisted this work from Rice and Webber comes as one of the most melodic work that are ever written for any musical, that it even gave the impression for every track within as songs that could stand on their own. This work kind of mixed elements from the lost genre of radio dramas, classical music, rock, and the bravado of broadway musicals all wrapped up and jumbled collectively in one complete package - hearken it is both a concept album and a movie soundtrack all in one.<br /><br />JCS the motion picture soundtrack also contains an impressive array of musical performances by its (albeit unsung) sessionist players - indeed it contains one of the best bass lines ever recorded that could be heard on the track wherein Ciaphas and Annas the chief high priests are having their discussion about Jesus - the track \\"Then We Are Decided\\", which is an exclusive portion found in the soundtrack. Also included is the theme song of the musical \\"Could We Start Again Please\\" which never appeared until the Original London Cast rendition came up with the song's first appearance - that presents an intermissionary(sic) segment of sorts having Mary Magdalene and Peter with the Disciples plead the song to Jesus, as a means to give further amplification about the Opera's whole thematical point, or idea that is, in this regard of its lyricist Tim Rice, that comes as more of a theoretical thought regarding the whole matter of Christ's message of coming down here on earth.<br /><br />Appearing in this third and best version of the rock opera musical are some of its cast from the original 1970 album as well: Yvonne Elliman playing the part of Mary Magdalene, and Barry Dennen who've made several movie appearances lately, such as the praying priest in the James Cameron flick TITANIC - playing the role of Pilate. The appearances of Carl Anderson as Judas Iscariot along with its entire cast/players comes as perfect in every sense of the word for all the versions that are ever assembled for this musical - most notably, Ted Neely - whose voice effectively gives a very distinguishable character to the role on playing the part of Jesus; eventually Neely appeared as a guest back-up vocalist on the song \\"Run To The End Of The Highway\\" for the late Christian Artist Keith Green's final LP, JESUS COMMANDS US TO GO, with Green's wife Melody.<br /><br />Quite ironically, the musical being criticized by certain religious circles, and indeed somewhat profane at certain respect with its unconventional approach of depicting the last days of Christ - many among its cast who participated in this musical throughout its various incarnations actually became 'christians' later on in their career, such as Jeff Fenholt who played the role of Christ in the original London cast rendition, and released several albums under the 'Christian' label.<br /><br />Also, a little controversy is identified in particular to this movie soundtrack recording that infers certain \\"allegations\\" to the phenomenon of backward messages called 'backmasking', as cited within the songs \\"I Dont Know How To Love Him\\", \\"Getsemane (I Only Want To Say)\\", \\"Could We Start Again Please\\", \\"Judas' Death\\", and \\"Trail Before Pilate\\".<br /><br />However, upon its stature and composure - JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is generally a phenomenal piece in the history of the whole spectrum of musical genres in its entirety.<br /><br />Nothing short of being monumental, I guess this is the one album that best defines a record album art-ifact.<br /><br />An absolute classic.etsemane (I Only Want To Say)\\", \\"Could We Start Again Please\\", \\"Judas' Death\\", and \\"Trail Before Pilate\\".

B00005JOWF|3.0|This movie was okay...nothing special.  It just moved way to fast and made no sense to me at all.  I really think that unless you are a fan of Ultraviolet or Milla Jovovich then u mite not like it.  I am a fan of Milla's so lucklily watching her on the screen kept my attention throughout the movie....okay well most of the movie, i fell asleep towards the end..and didn't even bother to finish it (oh yea btw, saw this on bootleg, so maybe thats another thing that made it seem worse).  So anyway i think i'll just wait for Resident Evil 3 to come out!!!
B000002URV|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Out of hundreds and cd's and thousands of mp3's, this album reigns above just about everything, even though I've had it for years. I'll never forget the new world I entered upon first listening to this album all the way through. And to think it was all put together just to see how people would react... regardless, I think it's the most beautiful album ever created, beautiful in its simplicity. 'Sadeness' is my theme song and 'Knocking on Forbidden Doors' takes me to some magical place full of mystery and delight. What a great, great album.
0380789035|1.0|Ultimately, this book felt like an old friend letting me down.<br /><br />I have read a large number of Hugo and Nebula award winners. This book doesn't fit. I read all of the praise for this book. I listened to a podcast of the author talking about The Anansi Boys. This book is simply a let-down. You keep reading it knowing that at any moment you will be rewarded with a masterful Hugo-calibur novel, but it never comes. The book only becomes interesting right at the very end, and then just as your interest is finally roused, ...well... the book ends. The main character, Shadow, is apathetic and the author captures that beautifully by completely eliminating any character development or interesting action for Shadow.
0060245867|5.0|I love this book and I love reading it to my kids.  My kids love the fact that it comes full circle, so it is like it never really ends.  We read it together all the time.  I also like the moose and the pig books
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Hey! Stop comparing this and the first 'King Kong' movie (as for the 70's version is out of context - and ready to be forgotten). The first 'King Kong' is a classic. Is untouchable. See this new version as... a New movie, if like there was no Kong in movie history. <br /> <br />The reviewer Paully said this film is 'technically well done - like the 'Star Wars' movies...' (I think he talk about the newer Episodes, I, II and III) BUT the new 'Star Wars' (and, let's be realistic, the old ones) lacks a good screenplay, lacks good interpretations (though they all have great actors!) and MOST OF ALL, lacks a great director, like Peter Jackson. Period. <br /> <br />As for the movie I think is really amazing. I thank Peter for - this time - get into a marvellous and extravagant movie with so-realistic unrealistic inhabitants and fabulous jungles - Skull Island and New York. <br /> <br />And - my opinion only - the special effects are the MOST incredible that I've seen so far. I really was amazed and touched by the beauty and by the beast. <br /> <br />I heard someone saying that Kong is a CGI character?! Don't believe!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I am writing this review to conteract the reviews of two prjudice sexists on the review board, Ryan Tierney \\"Ryan\\" and luv_nature. Both of these reviewers know the two men in Brokeback Mountain are in love, and that it is an incredible love story. Yet, they are enforcing the idea that traditional Western thinking of homophobia is the standard of the film. Instead of embracing such though provoking, and wonderful movie, they are what reviewer, Robert Frost, called \\"Propaganda Driven Activists.\\"    The comments they left are in no way helpful to the movie, and should not even exist on the review board. This is a incredible movie, and we all know it. If there are any more of you prejudice sexists that judge this film on your personal bias, get off the board immediately so that others may enjoy the film.
B000062Y98|5.0|Uh-oh. <br /> <br />Tie him up! Tie him up! <br /> <br />This is the grandest opus I have entitled to myself to keep and detect forever. Battlefield is a super nice song Davy, and don't you forget it! It starts out quiet and the Kursch comes in and it really starts rocking until a grand choir comes in and says aahhh.Then a sweet prechorus and a huge epic chorus for all! After that there is more stuff!!!! Then somewhere in the song it goes happy after he says that the ground is stained. It rock! The drumming is sometimes sweet nuts in the chorus. And then it ends fairly fast and good for health. <br /> <br />He's getting AWAY!!! <br /> <br />Wage war Kip, because the next best song is The Soulforged! It starts out very power metal and then goes into a medieval like guitar rind? And verse. Then there is an epic and triumphant sounding chorus that takes the leaf this time! Good Song, Man. <br /> <br />Stop killing me! <br /> <br />In my day we didn't try to hard to win. The natives wanted our brains and then they got them! But Wait For An Answer took care of that with its thunder sleeves! With an intro similar to The Soulforged but the singing comes earlier. Then a scary verse that could've exploded at any time. Then a super happy chorus that will stir you!! <br /> <br />I'm dead....shame. <br /> <br />...and the future shall repeat itself... <br /> <br />.........again and again.........
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This movie is perfect, at least the Japanese version of it. A must for any fan regardless, but the one problem is the english voice overs. I must say, they're horrible. The japanese voices were different and a little more appropriate. Too bad they just couldn't use the same voice actors if they would have known english. The character sound a little stupid in the english version and makes it seem like a cheesy after school special, but the movie itself is a keeper.
0805017445|5.0|This book I bought for my child when she was just born.  She learned the animals names and the colors used in the book. By the time she was one year old she had memorized the book and was reading it by the time she was two years old.  Now that she is seven years old she still loves it.  She reads it to her younger friends now.  As a mother I recommend it to teachers for use in their classrooms.
0920668372|1.0|I was unfortunate enough to have this book read to me as a child and every time it left me feeling sad, hopeless, and scared.  To an adult with kids it probably seems like a great way to remind their kids that no matter what they're special, but whenever it was read to me it left me with one message:  YOU'RE MOMMY IS GONNA DIE ONE DAY!!!!!!!!  AND WHEN SHE DOES, YOU'LL COPE WITH IT BY SINGING THE SAME ASSININE LULLABY TO YOUR NEW BABY!!!!  The book feels bleak, surrupy, and sad for all involved.  Go read kids some Chris Van Allsburg or Berinstein Bears.  Stay as far away as humanly possible from this paragon of disillusionment.  My 3rd grade teacher read this to me on the first day of 3rd grade.  I hated 3rd grade.

B00005S6K8|5.0|SABRINA is a fresh remake of an older Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn romance story about transformation, recognition, and deception presented with humor. Sabrina Fairchild (Julia Ormond) is the disrespected and ignored chauffeur's daughter looming through the trees at the secret love of her life, wealthy playboy David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear).<br /><br />After returning from Paris, Sabrina with a new haircut, change of clothing, and refined poise becomes the latest object of David's affection. The problem is she is the \\"chauffeur's daughter\\" -- and David is engaged to be married. The relationship interferes with a billion dollar merger. So older brother and financial tycoon Linus Larrabee (Harison Ford) devises an insincere scheme to steal Sabrina's heart away from David. Her vulnerability has an effect on Linus and he begins to recognize there is more to life than business deals.<br /><br />Ormond and Ford deliver performances qualifying SABRINA to be on the short list of movies to be watched repeatedly. (For me this means it was worth repurchase on DVD to supplement the VHS.) This is one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />Movie quote: \\"I know you work in the real world. And you are very good at it. I bet you haven't made a wrong move since you were three. But where do you live, Linus?\\"
B0002YLC24|5.0|I once was almost married. In the period of preparing my marriage I still kept loving that girl whom I had the chance to spend so little time with in some other period of my life, never the less Much-Much less than I spent with my partner back than. One thing is clear in that case; the amout of time does not count when love strikes your heart. What counts is actually the amount of love you have inside your heart.  <br />This film deeply ilustrates the power of love in a special angle. The angle of basing the power of love on one fine memory. And the effect the memory and assumptions may have on our physical life. Don't miss this one! <br />
B00004U2G1|5.0|As an owner of many SACDs (multichannel, stereo, hybrid and non-hybrid), I would have to say that this SACD is better than most but not as good as a small few.  Sure, they (the record company) perhaps could have made this multichannel...but would it have sounded as true?  For instance, take Friday Night in San Francisco (DiMeola, McLaughlin, DeLucia).  This SACD is not hybrid, and is mixed in Stereo, yet it is one of the truest to life musical reproductions I have ever heard. <br /> <br />Boston's self-entitled album is a 70s classic.  When I received this SACD from Amazon, I went straight home and blasted it on my system with all the windows open.  My wife left for the grocery store as Foreplay started playing at extreme volume.  I actually listened to this SACD three times that evening, with each time better than the last.  If you don't like Boston, then this SACD isn't for you.  On a decent system this SACD sounds great...on an exceptional system, this SACD sounds awesome.
0689862725|5.0|King's pop-up version is everything I expected and more from a pop-up book.  Usually with pop-ups, the story is a bit dull compared to the accompanied art of the book. But with this pop-up, the story was great...and I feel for both adults and children who love a good scare! And the art of the book IS wonderful. Everytime I go through the book, I discover something new about it. E.g. the way Trisha's face reflect when she looks into the water.<br /><br />This book is a must-have for book collectors and everyone who loves a good story.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I don't know which album Ms. Nash was listening to but this is one of the finer collection of songs I've heard strung together in a very long time. It's an album of passion, experience, memories, doubt, love, happiness and sadness. Nothing here is over stated and it leaves the listener to decide. Again Ms. Nash should pour a glass of wine relax, and absorb this fine, fine composition.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is \\"only\\" one of those that never will be forgotten in the music industry. Is a classic, a masterpiece, a wonderful piece of music, and I can't imagine someone who listen to this and think that's garbage or not interesting music. <br />Just put this album playing, lay your head, close your eyes, and FEEL the music. Is all I can say, this is just amazing!
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is by far the most amazing and spectacular show on TV. Currently airing on UPN at Tuesdays at 9PM ET/PT, it tells the story of a very smart, witty and resorceful teenager who attends High School and after school works in her Dad's Detective Agency. I started watching this show a month ago and loved it so much i saw Season 1 in two days and it's now my favorite show. If you liked Buffy and Alias you will LOVE this show.  <br /> <br />Alex
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|I rented Sky High for the kids and it turns out I was probably the one that liked it the most.  Sky High is the place where future super heroes go to school.  There, they learn how to be heroes (or side kicks) and go to classes like Mad Science and PE (save the civilian is a popular game).<br /><br />Will Stronghold is a typical kid trying to live down the fame of his two superhero parents.  Kurt Russell is great is the cocky dad who wants and expects his son to be a great super hero as well.  Kelly Preston is pretty but really doesn't have much to do.<br /><br />Will goes to school knowing he has yet to develop any superpowers.  Some of the best moments are when each kid has to display his powers and then be assigned to the hero or sidekick track.  Most adults will enjoy all of the super hero jokes.  The plot revolves around a typical high school movie plot of the boy falling for the popular girl and ignoring the girl who really likes him.<br /><br />The plot never gets too serious and instead plays for the jokes.  The cast was great, from the high school bad guy Warren Peace, the cute Lela (played by Danielle Panabaker sp?, sure to be a future star), Russell, and cameos by Bruce Cambell and Wonder Woman herself Linda Carter).<br /><br />Your kids will enjoy this movie and so will the parents.  There is nothing offensive in this movie so it is safe for all audiences.
1892005034|1.0|I got about 4 chapters into this book and stopped reading it. It was a challenge to get that far. I had borrowed this book from someone in the hopes that it would help me to establish more gentle communication with my young children, but this guy is definately not someone to get parenting advice from!<br /><br />First of all, the entire concept of NVC is based on the idea that it is a part of human nature to desire compassionate communication with others. This goes against some of my fundamental beliefs as a Christian. When I got a few chapters in and started reading the sample conversations, they were so robotic and absurd that I was reading them aloud to my husband for laughs. Even Rosenberg's writing language is absurd. For example, the instructions on one of the end-of-chapter exercises says, \\"If you would like to see whether we're in agreement about the verbal expression of feelings, circle the number in front of any of the following statements.\\" Please.<br /><br />Then I got to the chapter on \\"Taking Responsibility For Our Feelings.\\" I had almost finished it when I came to a part where Rosenberg is relating a story about his own daughter, and that is where I threw the book down in disgust. Here, he talks about a moment in his own daughter's life that was a cause for celebration: She had told her school principal to \\"F*** off!\\"<br /><br />Now there's a non-violent communication for ya.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's nothing less than spectacular!  The voice overs are done well and if you prefer the japanese version (which I do), you can switch back to them with ease.  Also, while Mena Suvari didn't do a very good job as Aerith in Kingdom Hearts II, she does a bang up job in Advent Children so don't let that sway you away from a great Final Fantasy experience.  Because it comes with 2 discs you get so much more content!  A recap of the FFVII game, trailers of film, a \\"making of\\" featurette, a compilation of all the games past, present & future and deleted scenes!  I couldn't be more happy with my purchase!  So if you've played any Final Fantasy games, especially FFVII, don't hesitate, pick this up now!
0385486804|4.0|The book \\"Into the Wild\\" details the incredible journey of a young man who \\"pulls a Siddharta\\" and gives up his earthly possessions, even his identity, because of a gnawing wanderlust in his heart....this is an amazing story from beginning to end...no matter what your opinion of Chris McCandless is at the end, the book teaches us what it really means to be free.......free from rules, possessions and the limits society places on us.......how many people can say they have lived that way? Once you read this book, you won't soon forget it....Living life your way, not caring what other people think, doing what your spirit feels it needs to do....pure freedom
0385338694|5.0|This book was so much fun.  Face it, if you are going to read something like this you should go into it knowing that it is not going to win any literary awards.  After accepting that fact sit back and let yourself have a great time reading this book.   <br /> <br />The book pokes fun of lawyers who are overworked and over obsessed with their jobs.  The main character is a delight and the story is filled with sections that were very funny.  <br /> <br />This is a perfect vacation book.  Chic lit at it's best.
6301543408|5.0|This film was unfairly panned. I loved the film, not so much for the search for God theme, but for the humor between Spock, Kirk, and \\"Bones\\" McCoy and the theme of friendship between the three principles.  The relationship of Spock and \\"Bones\\" is just as humorous as ever. The campfire scene, Spock's rescue of Kirk, and other scenes made me laugh repeatedly. The more important theme that touched my heart was the importance of friendship.  The characters of Star Trek have been one of the  main reasons that Star Trek has endured.  To see Kirk and McCoy deal with Spock's death in Star Trek II and III, and then see Kirk's commitment to save both Spock and McCoy further strengthened the bond of friendship between them.  Star Trek V solidifies the brotherhood between the three friends and the acknowledgement that they are \\"family\\".  <br />   The scene with \\"Bones\\" and his father moved me to tears.  For anyone who had been conflicted about suffering and death, this scene was very emotional.  For \\"Bones\\", who values life, yet loves his father, the decision he made must have been the hardest thing he ever did in his life.  DeForest Kelly was amazing in this film, given that he had recovered from major surgery and cleared for work just before filming.  He was \\"Bones\\" McCoy. <br />   If you haven't seen this film lately, I urge you to see it again <br />
0684853523|5.0|King writes the perfect autobiography, though not called that.  He brings you through a childhood filled with fun, fear, and confusion into a teenage time when he was taught to be ashamed of what he wrote.  What I liked best was the nail he put on his wall that overflowed with rejection letters for his stories from magazines, and that he said he felt shame for what he wrote for years, yet still published under his real name.
B000EHSVOG|4.0|Towering Inferno was the best and most realistic disaster film ever made. <br /> <br />In spite of its flaws (some due to poor editing) the action & drama were exhilirating, especially in any scene involving Steve McQueen's Batallion Chief Mike O' Hallorhan. <br /> <br />McQueen's calm, cool & collected \\"take charge\\" trademark personna were perfect for the role, which demanded someone that knew what needed to be done at all times and did the \\"dirty work\\", witness the scenic elevator rescue and the blowing up of the water tanks. <br /> <br />The film would have been better if it had focused more on the fire department's fire-fighting & rescue efforts, and less time spent on \\"fluff\\". <br /> <br />In spite of his fame for scoring \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Jaws\\", \\"Indiana Jones\\", \\"Superman\\" and other famous films, John Williams score for \\"Towering Inferno\\" may have been his very best, especially with his rousing beginning with the helicopter flight over Northern California / San Francisco, the incredible suspense he builds up with the planting the explosives on the water tanks and the two final pieces that end the film / credits. <br /> <br />The \\"Towering Inferno is worth watching for any scenes with Steve McQueen, the fire trucks racing through the streets of San Francisco and for John Williams masterful soundtrack alone! <br /> <br />The forth-coming Special Edition (due out May 9), filled with deleted scenes from the theatrical version, as well as the \\"AMC Backstory\\", which gives you the only \\"behind the scenes look\\" at the making of the film will make this an even more enjoyable viewing experience.
B000025OG6|5.0|<br />I read an interview with Luke somewhere online, and his description of \\"Gypsy Train\\" is, \\"...that first track is second-line meets Zeppelin\\".   <br /> <br />For someone who grew up listening to these guys; when I first heard \\"Kingdom of Desire\\", I was stunned.  My first thought when those opening notes from Jeff's floor tom hit the speakers was, \\"WHOA......!\\"   My next thought, \\"Grab something and hang on; this is going to be a wild and crazy ride.\\" <br />  <br />I knew that the musicianship was going to be top shelf; as these guys grew up in the L.A. session scene during the early 70's and through the 80's.  Of all the players here, Porcaro, it seems, somehow, shone brightest. <br /> <br />Lukather's vocals on every track are impressive.  At that point, there were four guys:  Paich, Porcaro, Porcaro, and Lukather.  Somebody had to step up.  Gone were Kimball, Williams, and Frederickson.  That left Lukather to do the lion's share. <br />And instead of flinching;  he just DID it, and it cooked. <br /> <br />For \\"Gypsy Train\\", they recruited Jon Elefante (Word/Epic, at the time).  Great background vocals also show up here from Richard Page (Mr. Mister).    <br /> <br />But it's the take-no-prisoners playing that turned my head.  As a musician; I'm always looking for new inspiration.  This album <br />had to grow on me; but once it did---there was no looking back. <br /> <br />This was Paich heavy handed; Luke burnin' the house down, and then there was that magical, drop-the-hammer combination of Porcaro (Jeff) and Porcaro (Mike) that created the deepest pocket I'd ever heard from those two upto that point. <br /> <br />The drum track on \\"Gypsy Train\\":  churning.   <br />Steady as a Rock on \\"Don't Chain My Heart\\" <br />Jeff is even granted a place at Keith Cronin's website (\\"Drum Licks from Hell\\") for the beastly fill at 4:06 into \\"How Many Times?\\".   THAT fill alone, proves that yes, Jeffrey did possess mad chops; though he'd have spoken otherwise.  (He alwaysdiffered to his heroes; Keltner...Purdie...Gordon). <br /> <br />Porcaro had found a harder edge to his playing, yet even on the ballads, he's still just Jeff.   Solid, groovin'...remaining musical the entire time.   As I write this; I'm listening, and there are tracks where he never lets up on Paiste's Signature Series 13\\" hi-hats.   He worked those over.  The same applies to the Gretsch kit he was behind.   Yes; he played Pearl in live settings, and designed the DR-1 drum rack with Paul Jamieson--for Pearl--but those are Gretsch drums possibly on \\"K.O.D\\" <br />It wouldn't have mattered.   They'd have taken a beating regardless. <br /> <br />And then to hear the last tune on the album:  \\"Jake to the Bone\\"--and to realize that Jeffrey possessed very tasteful Jazz chops as well, was just the icing on the cake.  That whole band slam-dunked that last track!  As far as I am concerned, this tops \\"IV\\" as my favorite TOTO album, with \\"Falling In Between (2006) a close 2nd behind \\"K.O.D.\\" <br /> <br />It's all about that pocket; and just how deep Mike and Jeff carved it for the rest of them to fall into. <br /> <br />Only God knows what we'd be hearing now from Jeff had he lived to see today.  It is appropriate enough, to note that he picked out the album cover art for Kingdom of Desire; right down to the Angel pictured above the \\"in Memory of Jeff Porcaro\\" line on the back cover.   (They had just enough time before the record hit shelves to note that line on the reverse). <br /> <br />Sure, this album may not appeal to all TOTO listeners, but there is so much musicality even in this hard-rocking, barn-burner.  It's not one to overlook.   Those who haven't heard this;  should.   What the critics hated;  was that TOTO was POLISHED;  slick....\\"too good\\" musically.   The thing is that these cats ALL knew the instruments they played, and PLAYED like there was no tomorrow.   They still do; even with the addition of Simon Phillips.   He, being different from Jeff, is going to adda new sound. <br /> <br />But for some of us; it's difficult-when the music is this good--(Kingdom of Desire) to break away from what we've heard before. <br />This album shows and entirely different side of TOTO not seen previously; it showed that they could stretch...and grow; instead of stagnating.   It also shows that a careful listen will stretch the listener's ear;  and brain. <br /> <br />Some of this stuff is MIND bending. <br /> <br />Brilliantly played \\"time\\" and \\"groove\\" from some of the best guys out there.   Get it! ;) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UA5|5.0|Ummagumma was a highly experimental album put out by Pink Floyd.  It should not be viewed in the same light as Dark Side of the Moon or Piper at the Gates of Dawn, or any other of their fully developed albums. <br /> <br />Ummagumma consists of two discs, both a live disc and a studio disc.  Both are excellent in their own right. <br /> <br />On the live disc, there are four songs, each of them with some bonus over the original, in many cases, length. <br /> <br />Astronomy Domine takes time in the middle to showcase Rick Wright, and is therefore much longer than the original.  While I prefer the Syd Barrett version on Piper at the Gates of Dawn, they are almost seperate songs.  4.5/5 <br /> <br />Careful With That Axe, Eugene is the standout track on this album.  Unlike the studio version on Relics, Pink Floyd took the time to flesh out the intro to the song.  This song is excellent to listen to in a dark room with your eyes closed. 5/5 <br /> <br />Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun is the first sign of Roger Waters' brilliance to come.  The lyrics are incredibly poetic.  This song is about four minutes longer than the Saucerful of Secrets version, and ranks among the finest of Pink Floyd's achievements.  That said, the vocals are difficult to comprehend on this version.  So, although the song is a five-star song overall, this version earns 4.5/5 <br /> <br />A Saucerful of Secrets is a long instrumental.  This version is not particularily longer than the original version, but it is considerably lighter in mood.  While I prefer the original version for this reason, many people will choose this version. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Now to the studio disc.  Each of the band members were given half of a side of an LP to experiment with.  That must be kept in mind when listening to this disc. <br /> <br />Sysyphus is Rick Wright's contribution.  Sysyphus was a mythical person sentenced to forever roll a boulder up a hill.  Whenever the boulder reached the top, it would roll back down and he would have to start all over again.  In the music, part 4 returns to portions of part 1, signifying the never ending cycle.  Though there are four parts to the song, they are meant to be listened to as a whole. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Grantchester Meadows is a dramatically different piece about growing up in a specific portion of England.  Roger Waters is pointing out different things he noticed in an excellent song. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Several Species... is another Waters piece, one that is almost musically devoid, the music being the scurrying of various small rodents in a cave, with a hilarious Scotsman impression by Waters at the end. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />The Narrow Way is the best song on this disc.  Like Sysyphus, it is meant to be listened to all three parts one after the other.  The first part introduces the music, the second part (my personal favorite) builds further, and the third part includes lyrics by Gilmour that are among his best. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Grand Vizier's Garden Party is a Nick Mason piece (featuring his wife) that is meant to showcase his drumming.  The first part is short, introducing the music.  Then the party gets started in part two, which consists of Nick Mason experimenting (because this is an experimental album) with drums.  Part three is much like part one, though shorter and more complex.  Like Sysyphus and The Narrow Way, this is meant to be listened to all the way through (parts one-three), although one could merely listen to part two. 4.5/5

B000002LCE|5.0|DIO had been known now for some powerful and frightining albums, by the time that in 1987, the band released its fifth album of Dream Evil. Dream Evil was a crossroads for DIO, as Vivian Campbell left in the time following the Tour for Sacred Heart, and now Craig Goldie was on lead guitar. Dream Evil was to be an album that was as much of a Heavy Metal Masterpiece, as Holy Diver and Heaven and Hell were, although Heaven and Hell was a Black Sabbath album.  <br />Night People is about Rebellion as it talks about people thinking about REVOLUTION, while Sunset Superman is about Heroism and how difficult it is to save the world. I could have been a Dreamer, is a song that talks about things that should have been, when All the Fools Sailed Away, is about people being missled and missguided, for they let themselves be walked all over by such people.  <br />Dream Evil is a song that talks about Dreams, with the song making me think about Sleeping Beauty and Melifecent, with the song talking about what happened to Melifecent, but at the end her being the one who sleeps for 100 years, after Aurora is awaiken by her dear Philip. You do not need to believe my story, but I am a strong fan of Sleeping Beauty.  <br />The album cover has a Painting that is of a Sleeping Girl with evil demons creeping under her bed and what looks like the ELF on one of Ronnie James Dio's first ever albums; in which he wore the costume of that ELF, with ELF being the band that made Ronnie first ever known. The elegant and beautiful Stain Glass window behind the Girl's Bed, has the Demon that was in Holy Diver and Last In Line, standing through it, thus giving the Painting a little connection to Sleeping Beauty.  <br />This was the last album to have Vinnie Appice on drums and Jimmy Bain on bass, while Goldie was also out of DIO, by the year of 1990, when a whole new band was created. Many as I have heard, have stated that this was the last good album from DIO, for quite a while, but at least we areable to hear this Masterpiece of an album, in which Goldie plays on this album in a similar way to how both Vivian Campbell and Tony Iommi played alongside Ronnie James Dio's powerful voice, as well as a tad of Ritchie Blackmore's glory.  <br />

B000EWBKM6|4.0|Of course I can't review this, the episode hasn't even aired yet.. But, I'm writing because I'm upset with all of the people complaining about the release of the finale before the rest of the series. Does no one remember Friends? They released the finale before they released the last few seasons.
B00006SFBD|5.0|What amazing music! One of just a FEW bands that \\"get it\\". They know how music is supposed to sound, move you, THINK! Mikeal is a GREAT leader (singer, guitarist, writer, etc), MARTIN-all I can say is-what a drummer. Peter keeps rhythm with his solos, and the other Martin on bass knows how to keep the buzz going. And let's not forger Per on keyboards. Great cd!
1400079179|2.0|After hearing a lot of great reviews for this book, I was excited to read something \\"fascinating\\" and \\"fast-paced\\". Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to the hype. I am a voracious reader, but this book took me three weeks to finish--I kept putting it down and reading other novels. I found this book slow, far-fetched (not the premise, but the massive scavenger hunt by two normal people), and predictable. The author's use of the term \\"sacred feminine\\" every ten pages or so was irritating. I did not find the book upsetting nor enlightening. I don't understand the uproar made by some people, its a work of fiction, and not very good fiction at that. I probably won't watch the movie since the author has said it's just like the book.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|With Back Home, Eric Clapton has released an easy listening album.  The question is, why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for sappy pop music?  His talent is his guitar, not his voice - if I wanted pop, I would listen to Paul McCartney.  Eric's voice is okay, but not great, and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here, it doesn't compare to his better CDs in any way. <br /> <br />I know that Clapton has nothing against pop.  He's played with every one of the Beatles at concerts, and is featured on George Harrison's solo albums with George and Ringo.  However, he can't sing a pop song like George can, and on this CD he doesn't play the guitar as well as George and Eric did on their classic collaborations like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Badge. <br /> <br />I hope his next studio CD is a Cream re-union album like the recent Cream re-union concert.  Perhaps going back to playing the guitar while Jack Bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut.
B000000OA6|5.0|As final musical statements go, this album has it all- tragedy, humour, defiance in the shadow of death and disease, fond reflections of the past, enjoyment of the moment and hopes for the future. I first heard this album on it's release when I was 8 and I had no idea at the time of Freddie's battle with AIDS- it was the most impressive album I'd heard at that age and now at the age of 23, this album continues to impress me and now having known what Freddie and the rest of the band went through to put this album together only increases it's emotional impact for me.<br />'Innuendo' is a jaw-dropping opener to the album, it manages to be both epic and intimate without intimidating the listener. 'I'm Going Slightly Mad' is their most under-rated single, funny and engrossing! 'Don't Try So Hard', 'Bijou' and 'The Show Must Go On' all give me goosebumps. 'Ride The Wild Wind', 'Headlong' and 'I Can't Live With You' are all joyous and brilliant songs. 'Delilah' is cute and amusing!<br />Along with 'Sheer Heart Attack' and 'A Day At The Races', 'Innuendo' ranks among the greatest of Queen's albums.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've been a Mark Knopfler fan since his days with Dire Straits, and it is my opinion that nothing he's done as a solo artist can compare to this new album of duets with Emmy Lou Harris.  To date this is Knopfler's finest work yet.  And what a delightful surprise Emmy Lou's vocals are! <br /> <br />  \\"This Is Us\\" is remescient of Knopfler's later Dire Straits days  (\\"On Every Street\\" Album), and makes the perfect hit single!  \\"Red Swaggering\\"  has a  very upbeat country/bluegrass sound and is also an instant favorite. The two songs Emmy Lou wrote \\"Belle Star\\" and \\"Love And Happiness\\" are fantastic.  \\"Belle Star\\" is upbeat and what a perfect blend of M.K.'s voice with Emmy Lou's!  \\"Love and Happiness\\" is a beautiful ballad, as well as the title track: \\"All The Roadrunning. <br /> <br />This was something of a risky undertaking for Knopfler given his macho guitar image (which is normally a guy thing).  However the ladies are gonna love this album also.  The music and lyrics are all originals are are beautiful!  <br /> <br />The blend of M. K. vocals with Emmy Lou's are PERFECT!! <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!  There are no filler songs here, and you will not be disappointed.  I have rarely given an album 5 stars but this one has earned every single one!
0783227434|5.0|Third in the series (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, then Army of Darkness).  This movie is a cult classic. <br /> <br />The one-liners constantly flow out so easy and and Bruce Campbell delivers them perfectly. <br /> <br />This movie is so entertaining, I watch it at least once a year.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is consistently loud, fast and unapologetically darn good fun! 'I Get Wet' is an all time classic as far as I'm concerned and I would not care if everyone else on Earth hated this man and his music- as the lyric to 'Fun Night' goes \\"We've got just one concern and we're gonna get dumb!\\" Let go for 35 minutes and enjoy a brainless full on party album!<br /><br />'It's Time To Party', 'She Is Beautiful' and the title track are the highlights of a record that helped to shed my shyness skin and make me the confident lover of life I am today.<br /><br />'I Get Wet' is my favourite Saturday night warm up soundtrack!

6305041156|5.0|The story line is superb ... the scenery is stunning and gorgeous, vast mountains and green valleys, walled castles and fortresses. Hidetora, the aging warlord, holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside. He announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons. Only one son, the youngest, dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting, he predicts the same after the transfer of power. He believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy. The youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord. Hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons. He has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half, which they easily do. He gives them in succession, three arrows bundled together, representing the unity of the family, none can break the bundle. This is Hidetora's example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified. He envisions the House of Ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during Hidetora's own reign of power. In his anger, Hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes ... Yet Subarua, the youngest, holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass.<br /><br />Hidetora visits Taro's castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to Taro's wife, Sue'. They are forced to move out. Hidetora discovers after the transfer of power, he is no longer respected. Sue' married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war, a war in which her parents were murdered. She harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother, Jiro. Hidetora's court jester creates a mocking song about Taro being like a gourd, spinning this way and spinning that way, implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it. At a family gathering Taro hears the song and is outraged ... In a surprise move, Hidetora and his guards leave to visit Jiro. Hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either, not at all what he expected. He left abruptly ...<br /><br />The treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you've seen the movie but have never seen the TV Series, please go back and rent it or buy it! <br /> <br />This movie was awesome and worth the wait! <br /> <br />You don't have to be American to appreciate it, but with the western talkin' I reckon it helps...
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is my second favorite musical right behind Grease. Renee Zellweger should have gotten the oscar for best actress for Chicago. Her acting is so vulnerable and fascinating, she is not like any other actress nowadays. Her singing is great, boy i was pleasantly surprised, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere are great as well. Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall. The audio commentary is also very good. I love the numbers, All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and Roxie. It is fast paced, has a solid storyline, and excellent tap dance number by Gere. Get this movie today, it will have you dancing like a nutcase, but a stylish nutcase.
0743442539|5.0|Graham Greene, who was possibly the best novelist of the twentieth century and who was no slouch at the spy novel himself, call The Spy Who Came In from the Cold, \\"The best spy story I have ever read.\\" When I found out that Greene had said that, I had to finally pick this book up and see if its reputation was deserved. <br /> <br />In my opinion, it was. Easily. It's the best spy novel I've read, too. I was riveted from the beginning. Le Carre won't ever let the reader become oriented. Nothing's as it appears. Ever.  <br /> <br />The characters are compelling. The plot's twisted (a good thing). And the novel just keeps hanging around because the implications Le Carre touches on (politically and philosophically) are far-reaching (well into today's milieu) and probing.  <br /> <br />It's a must-read for a lot of reasons.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|There is NO mystery story where they have to find a killer. <br /> <br />They DON'T have to save the world by blowing up an asteroid quickly approaching earth. <br /> <br />One of the main characters IS NOT dying from Cancer, or AIDs. <br /> <br />This movie is great.  To me it is about relationships.  The mere fact that a man and a woman in a movie are nothing but friends in a very platonic relationship, where else have you seen that in movies past, or present?  Or how many more will you see like that in the future? <br /> <br />The setting is Japan.  The cinematography is excellent.  I love all the locations that they used. <br /> <br />Besides that, the music is awesome. <br /> <br />This is a great movie with great performances.  Just don't expect the normal problems that are normally associated with drama movies (no deaths, no diseases, no drug problems, etc etc) and be ready for a movie about real life.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's American Life is her most hated album but I love it! It's a perfect blend of uptempo and slow songs. American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid, Nobody Knows Me, Die Another Day are great dance songs while Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Intervention, X-Static Process, Mother and Father, and Easy Ride show Madonna's serious side which i think she is a genius at. I'm not sure why people dislike this album, it is a better record than Music or Bedtime Stories. But of course her best creations are Like A Prayer and Ray of Light. Madonna will live forever, i just know it. All hail the queen of Pop!

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|As someone who saw the original Japanese edition, the Sony release of the DVD is a minor let down. Yes, the image is wonderful, crisp, clean, and BEAUTIFUL, but there are problems that Sony could and should have addressed: <br /> <br />- Incorrect translations. As someone who has studied Japanese, it's an affront to hear and see the script translated incorrectly. <br /> <br />- NO LAST ORDER! There was a 30-minute animated feature that accompanied Advent Children, and yet I am unable to find it on the discs anywhere. :( <br /> <br />- The subtitles take up too much of the screen, and are a garish yellow. Several other DVDs manage to produce decent subtitles that don't make you want to turn them off to see the rest of the mage, and to save your eyes from all the yellow. <br /> <br />- The English dub is horrible. Some voices are fine, and obviously have had training. Others? They cannot put inflection and acting into their voice, which makes the English version fall flat. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful movie, wonderfully put together and written, and yet Sony does not rise to the occassion.
1400079179|1.0|I love a good thriller, and I've have nothing against a good feminist gospel, not to mention a paranoid conspiracy involving the Church Fathers, not to mention some colorful background about Mary Magdalene (preferably, before she stopped sinning). I'm sorry to report that you'll find none of that in here. This is a dully written book based on second-hand recycled research. You won't find much that is thrilling, and any revelations are decidely boring. The undeserved success of this book baffles me.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Okay, well, when I first heard this idea, I, like most people, thought, \\"What the hell?\\" and started to laugh. But, after actually listening to it, it seems as though Metallica actually improved some of their songs. \\"One\\" and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" accompanied by this orchestra were even better than the original versions. <br />However, some of the songs that were selected weren't, in my opinion, the right songs. Case in point: \\"Bleeding Me\\" over \\"Damage Inc.\\" or \\"Ride the Lightning?\\" What? No offense, but \\"Bleeding Me\\" sucked. What about \\"Devil's Dance\\" over \\"Fade to Black\\"? That too was a poor choice. Not saying \\"Devil's Dance\\" is not a good song, I just feel like it is innappropraite for this album. Also, \\"Outlaw Torn\\" and \\"Until it Sleeps\\"? As much as I liked \\"Until it Sleeps\\" why not put in \\"Orion\\", \\"Sanitarium\\", \\"The Four Horsemen\\", or \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" on?
B000002UA0|5.0|Pink Floyd are a Phase One and Phase Two band, the \\"phases\\" being Syd Barrett and David Gilmour.  The first phase lasted only one unbelievable debut album, like no other Floyd album in any respect, maybe with the exception of snippets of Rick Wright's eerie keyboards.<br /><br />  \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" is a psychedelic LSD soaked masterwork.  Given to us the same year as \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and recorded in the studio next door at Abbey Road Studios at the same time \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was being recorded, 1967, it could be said that Barrett could have possibly started where \\"A Day In The Life\\" ended with the bizarre voices on the outgroove of the album.<br /><br />  Barrett wasn't without his melodic sense, but \\"Piper\\" is a musical excursion into parts previously unexplored, and even today only on the surface.  \\"Astronomy Domine\\" sets the tone for a trip that no doubt the hippie crowd could scarcely believe.  One who never took LSD or acid such as myself can only imagine this CD's impact on the fried brains of its first listeners.<br /><br />  We do visit a very catchy if eerie song with \\"Lucifer Sam\\", the best song ever dedicated to cats, kind of like James Bond on acid.  \\"The Gnome\\" is somewhat folky, but the centerpiece is the acid jam \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", a free form jazz piece never intended to be played the same way twice, and with only the intro and ending riff repeating, impossible to repeat.<br /><br />  Some critics view the album closer \\"Bike\\" as the closest song to mental dementia ever recorded, as the last bit erupts in a cataclysm of noise and maniacal laughter.  A perfect close to a musician who would never be able to repeat such a feat again.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Where to start? I've been a huge MK/Straits fan for years, but always found his solo releases a bit spotty - many tracks absolutely brilliant, with others forgettable. This one works start to finish.  <br /> <br />While not known for his singing, MK's voice works remarkably well with Emmylou's. This is without a doubt MK's best vocal performance. On top of that, his guitar work is surprisingly prominent in what's billed as a duets album. As a Straits fan, I immediately thought of bits of Communique. \\"Beachcombing\\" has some guitar tones and parts that sound Lady Writer-ish to me, and \\"Donkey Town\\" as a feel a lot like \\"Portobello Belle\\" to me. <br /> <br />I'm not as familiar with EL, but her performance here has made me a fan. Her voice is timeless and fits the material very well. (I think she wrote 2 tracks) <br /> <br />Again, all tracks are solid- but the standouts among standouts are Beachcombing, Diamond, This is Us, Donkey Town, Roadrunning, and Goodbye. Yes, I know I just listed 1/2 the CD! <br /> <br />Finally, I'd like to note that the recording/engineering is top-notch. This is a beautiful, natural sounding record.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|I have been a huge P!NK fan since day one. I have all her albums but this is by far my favourite. I don't listen to American radio but I have a feeling this was not a huge hit in the US -- However it did receive extensive airplay on Virgin, the UK's alt-pop station. Overall this one has more of a rock feel to it than most of her other work so that might put some people off, while turning others on. Trouble is my favourite P!NK song ever. God is a DJ is good for the dance floor. And Waiting for Love sounds like it could have been done by The Who.
B000AL730O|4.0|Simple production, nice arrangements, well crafted songwriting with a few flashbacks from the Beatles aera. Paul sounds a bit older and wiser this time around, as if he actually has something to say, although with a bit toungue-in-cheek attitude, especially on \\"English Tea\\".  Much quieter than anything else I have ever heard form him. Very personal, very good. Go buy it.
B000EQ4G5K|2.0|This girl hasn't even been out for a year and she already has a second album out. Somebody's 15 minutes of fame are about to be up. Anyway, this album is average at its best and it's just all over the place like her last album- pop, R&B, reggae, club. I already wrote a review on \\"SOS\\" and, like I said, Rihanna brings nothing new. I thought \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" was a remake of Queen, but it's not. \\"Break It Off\\" with Sean Paul was kind of weak. Other than that, the best songs on the album were \\"We Ride\\"  and the remix of\\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\"- the rest is just forgettable filler material. Rihanna needs to work on her vocals because sometimes her voice sounds warbly and shaky, like she's crying or something. And Rihanna has beaten Sade and The Brain hands down.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Excellent job by Jeff Lynne. Lynne, an all time favorite producer of mine has actually done very little this time around. Just made the most of the demos, thats all. He didnt have to do much, because the songs really speak for themselves. Trademark George. Brainwashed is right up there with Cloud Nine, another favorite of mine.
0767802519|5.0|Not much to say about this movie since it has become a such cult-hit. <br />Many can argue, but I belive this is the best work by Luc Besson. <br />Natalie Portman did amazing job regardless of her age back then. <br />Masterpiece.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|I love Ralph Fiennes but this film is truly bad. That pharmaceutical companies test and dump obsolete technologies onto the Third World is old news. But when Ralph's wife starts asking questions, it gets her murdered! Please. As if any multi-billion dollar industry would be so concerned about the rantings of a pregnant ding-bat. <br />The real problem, is that you don't care about the wife who is found murdered. She is an unlikeable character; I couldn't wait for her to exit the movie. She is obnoxious, secretive, and you just don't fully trust her. What ruined it for me, is that Ralph Fienne's character gives up his life to find a wife who was a virtual stranger to him; he didn't even know her. Their relationship was barely established, there was no sense that they <br />had any kind of emotional connection. Enough said. Boring, boring, boring. And finally, I'm so sick of the SHAKY CAMERA in films these days. It makes you sea-sick.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I was a major fan of FF VII. I think it had the best plot and characters of all of the FF titles. This movie is a long awaited revisit of the characters I knew and loved from an RPG which is certainly one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />My biggest complaint is the lack of character depth... To be truly honest the movie lacks many of the key elements that made the game a memorable experience. The plot is decent but they could have put a good many more character relations in the film. <br /> <br />I gave it five stars anyway; it was truly a beautifully done piece in the graphical sense and if you are a fan I can almost guarantee that you will like it. I can only hope that they make another one and try to add a more human element... an element that is familiar to what the game was to begin with. <br /> <br />I downloaded the movie and watched it first but I have already placed my order for the game and I encourage anyone else who enjoyed the game or even just a good CGI piece to lay down the money in support of Square Enix's future endeavors.
B00005JOQT|3.0|Why are you people dismissing this movie before it even comes out in theaters? The movie will come out in little more than 2 months, and yet there is one negative review commenting on what the movie will probably be like. <br /> <br />Stop bashing the movie -- it will take a more serious turn than the previous two \\"Superman\\" outings and from what I've heard, it will pay the utmost respect towards the first two \\"Superman\\" films and not offer up a caricature of Superman. And from I've made of press reports and the casting, the movie looks to be a different kind of superhero flick than we're used to (unlike \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Superman Returns\\" is a loose sequel to the first two films and pretends as if \\"Superman III\\" and \\"Superman IV\\" don't exist), but a good one nonetheless. <br /> <br />Bottom line -- both \\"Superman Returns\\" and \\"X-Men 3\\" look very promising and I will check both of them out. But please, don't judge a movie until it's released and you've actually seen it. It will seem awfully hypocritical to others if you hate the movie before it comes out and when you actually see it, you like it.  <br /> <br />Look before you judge. That's all I'm saying.

B000089RVX|3.0|I've had this album on my wishlist for a while, and finally decided to get it, after hearing nothing whatsoever from Evanescence again. They've completely disappeared, and word has it they've split. Well, what a complete disappointment, they barely scratched the surface over here in the UK. They released a couple of singles, but just went. And they were popular too.<br /><br />Evanescence came to light when they had two songs on the Daredevil soundtrack, \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (which has the most amazing video), and \\"My Immortal\\" (which features in the scene at Elektra's father's funeral.) Most of the songs on this, although rather rockier than normal for my tastes, but Amy Lee's voice is so powerful, of a higher class than your Mariahs & Whitneys of the world. There's so much emotion in it, and boy, can that girl hold a note! I'm so surprised that she hasn't had any solo stuff out, apart from a track she featured on, by a band I'd never even heard of, and nothing came of that either.<br /><br />\\"Tourniquet\\" definitely has the weirdest lyrics, but it's got some cool music, so you only really notice the lyrics if you're really listening to it. \\"My Immortal\\" is definitely my favourite track, but running a close second is \\"Hello\\". I loved that since the first time I heard it, which was before I bought the album. It has some to die for lyrics, for example \\"has no one told you she's not breathing, hello I'm your mind, giving you someone to talk to\\", and the title of this review. Weird, but very cool, and open to interpretation. Listen, you'll probably spot some better ones than me.<br /><br />I hope Amy Lee does eventually go solo, as she's totally amazing, and gorgeous to boot. Yes, that is her face on the cover of the CD, and the picture does not do her any justice whatsoever.
B0009HKH6Q|3.0|+++++<br /><br />This is an unusual movie where a bored millionaire named Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Crown (Steve McQueen) masterminds a huge bank job that's flawless and where he doesn't even have to set foot in the bank!  Instead, he hires five underlings (and he manages to keep his identity anonymous in hiring them) to perform simple tasks that, as a whole, combine together for criminal perfection.  But even though Crown has achieved perfection in the robbery, he can't maintain it after the event.<br /><br />Enter insurance investigator Vicky Anderson (Faye Dunaway).  She identifies Crown as the mastermind behind the caper just from looking at his picture!  She's out to get him but a problem ensues along the way: she falls in love with him.  Police detective Edward \\"Eddy\\" Malone (Paul Burke) makes sure that Vicky does not break too many rules in trying to catch her prey.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is terrific by Dunaway, Burke and, of course, movie legend Steve McQueen.  The background music is interesting even though sometimes it seems to be too loud and intrusive.  (The song \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\" won an Academy Award for Original Song.)  There are various movie-making techniques used especially split-screen imaging to keep the viewer interested.  There is even a clever ending.<br /><br />However, I had difficulty feeling for a guy who has everything.  There is hardly any tension that he might get caught as his accomplices (as mentioned above) don't even know him.  The sexual tension between McQueen and Dunaway is not maintained (even though, I must admit, that the chess scene between the two is very erotic).  This lack of tension causes the movie to become somewhat boring.<br /><br />In the 1999 remake, Crown actually does participate in the crime and so tension is created in the possibility that he might get caught.  As well, the sexual tension between him and the female insurance investigator is maintained.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD (New Transfer version) is, in my opinion, perfect in visual and audio quality.  It has one major extra.<br /><br />In conclusion, even though the story does not always keep you engrossed, this movie is priceless as an example of late 1960's filmmaking and gives the viewer a chance to see a major star in his prime!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(1968;  100 min;  widescreen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />+++++is, in my opinion, perfect in visual and audio quality.

B000EGCITG|4.0|After a couple of years away devoted to relaxing, getting married, and no doubt getting a few more tattoos (including a \\"panic button\\" tattooed somewhere), Pink comes back with this fantastic album, and what a joy it is to have her back.<br /><br />The album kicks off in true Pink fashion, with a song (and video!) slating every skinny, flat chested, fashion conscious celebrity out there. Naming no names, but Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, the Olsen twins, and probably many more were spoofed in the video, and you can spot the references in the lyrics. It's also about not doing what everyone else does, and not having to change yourself just so that guy will call you back. The song & video became an instant hit.<br /><br />\\"Who Knew\\" takes the pace down just a little, giving Pink a chance to show off her vocal stylings, and it's all about a break up \\"If someone said 3 years from now, you'd be long gone, I'd stand up and punch their mouths, cos they're all wrong, I know better, cos you said forever\\". A very powerful song, especially if you've ever experienced stuff like that, this will sucker punch you right in the stomach. \\"I wish I could touch you again, I wish I could still call you friend, I'd give anything.\\" \\"I'll keep you locked in my head, until we meet again. I won't forget you my friend.\\"<br /><br />The other stand out track on this is \\"Dear Mr President\\", which features the Indigo Girls, and I hope she releases as a single. Following in the steps of Bush-haters, including Eminem, Pink totally brings it down to just her amazing voice and a guitar. It has some really amazing, and thought provoking lyrics:<br /><br />\\"What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street<br /><br />Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep<br /><br />What do you feel when you look in the mirror<br /><br />How do you sleep while the rest of us cry<br /><br />How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye<br /><br />How do you walk with your head held high<br /><br />Can you even look me in the eye<br /><br />What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away<br /><br />And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay\\"<br /><br />I also LOVE \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\", which doesn't make much sense, but it does if you've ever been in that mindset:<br /><br />\\"Go away<br /><br />Give me a chance to miss you<br /><br />Say goodbye<br /><br />It'll make me want to kiss you<br /><br />I love you so<br /><br />I don't wanna wake up with another<br /><br />But I don't wanna always wake up with you either<br /><br />You taste so sweet<br /><br />But I can't eat the same thing every day<br /><br />Cuttin off the phone<br /><br />Leave me the ***k alone<br /><br />Tomorrow I'll be beggin' you to come home<br /><br />Tonight<br /><br />Leave me alone I'm lonely<br /><br />Alone I'm lonely<br /><br />I'm tired<br /><br />Leave me alone I'm lonely<br /><br />Alone I'm lonely tonight\\"<br /><br />Most of the songs are typical Pink, but she's getting a lot more into her own, and although not quite experimenting, all her songs have lyrics that will mean something to someone.

B000BT97AO|4.0|Mirrormask.  Was it great?  No.  Was it imaginative and different?  Yes.  And if, like me, different is what you like then you'll like this movie.<br /><br />Its strengths are its imagery and fairytale like story as well as its allegory to the real life world of Helena, our heroine.  Its weaknesses lie in its characterization, depth of story and continuity.  The fact that all we see and hear after the Helena is spirited away to a new work, possibly of her own making, may be a dream does help though.<br /><br />An imbalance was created by Helena and a darker version of herself trading places in the worlds in which they each reside.  One hates their mother the other loves their mother but feels guilty that she is dying after harsh words were spoken.  Now a world that may have been created by Helena herself with her drawings may be being destroyed and Helena must find the Mirrormask, which can grant wishes, to correct it.<br /><br />My family, including my young daughters didn't really like the movie so much as I did but I've always been the more abstract thinker and if the word that Helena finds herself in is anything it is abstract with masked faces and weird sphinxes, giants and crazy visuals.<br /><br />If you like different then this is your movie.  Just don't expect it to make sense in the end.  Did everything really happen?  Did Valentine really make it out of the mirror world?  Did Helena really save a world and defeat an evil self?  I don't know and the movie doesn't make it clear but hey, it sure is different.

B0000YB7Z8|4.0|The first time I saw Jethro Tull Live was the Bursting Out Tour. <br />This CD is precisely how I remember the performance.  <br />This in my mind was when Jethro Tull was at their finest and doing their best music. <br />The concert starts out electric with No Lulaby and Sweet Dream. <br />Ian Anderson then pulls out the acoustic and does some of my favorite songs. Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day, Jack in the Green and One Brown Mouse. <br />To me the real gem of this CD is the Flute Solo from My God and then God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and finally Bouree. <br />To me this was the highlight of the concert then and the highlight of this CD now. <br />Hunting Girl and Minstrel in the Gallery, along with Cross Eyed Mary and finally Aqualung and Locomotive Breath are included on side two. <br />This is Jethro Tull at their vintage, at their very best infact. <br />
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana has a rare level of depth and complexity that accurately reflects the situation in the world today.  While there was a lot going on in this movie, and I had a hard time taking it all in in one viewing, I never felt it was complicated just for the sake of being complicated, and I didn't feel lost.  There are multiple story lines running continuously through the film that finally come together at the end, although not completely cleanly.<br /><br />George Clooney won a richly deserved Oscar for his portrayal of a spy waking up to the questionable morality of his past actions.  His was not the only impressive acting performance in this movie.  Matt Damon plays an energy consultant whose marriage falls apart after the death of his son, and he becomes obsessed with reforming the system.  Chris Cooper plays a morally bankrupt oil executive who places profits ahead of patriotism.  However, of all the outstanding performances in this movie, Alexander Siddig is most impressive as a reform minded Arab prince who is passed over as heir to the kingdom by his ailing father in favor of his immature and greedy younger brother.  He responds by trying to convince the other leaders of his country that he is better qualified than his brother, which sets in place a chain of events that ultimately leads to the tragic climax of the movie.<br /><br />There seems to be two categories of negative responses to Syriana.  The first is that it is complex and hard to follow, which to a certain extent is true.  This is no fluff film.  It requires some familiarity with current events to truly appreciate.  The other category consists of responses from those who oppose its politics, and this is certainly a film that is of the opinion that the way the international oil industry operates ultimately leads to less democracy, fewer civil liberties, more government corruption, and greater unrest and violence in the Middle East.  One of the more interesting complaints came from an earlier amazon reviewer, Timothy, who called the film \\"Anti-American, Pro-Terrorist Propaganda\\" and said, \\"I'm sure Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are using Syriana to recruit new members.\\"  His concern seems to be that the film portrays two young men who are recruited as suicide bombers as if they are actual people, while he ignores the fact that the charismatic religious leader who recruits them is depicted as manipulative and amoral.  I suppose any film that doesn't show suicide bombers as having evil grins and rubbing their hands together in glee as they take delight in how many babies they are going to kill is \\"anti-American, pro-terrorist propaganda.\\"y, who called the film \\"Anti-American, Pro-Terrorist Propaganda\\" and said, \\"I'm sure Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are using Syriana to recruit new members.\\"  His concern seems to be that the film portrays two young men who are recruited as suicide bombers as if they are actual people, while he ignores the fact that the charismatic religious leader who recruits them is depicted as manipulative and amoral.

B000E42MU8|4.0|but, upside down??? In the first scene Keira is reading her book UPSIDE DOWN!!! Why didn't they catch that??? Automatically that made the movie a movie. I just didn't get into it like I did the past P&P's. Also, fast-paced is ok but some of the conversations didn't make any sense. It's VERY enjoyable if you don't pay too much attention to it. Like I said, the scenery and the music was beautiful.

Only wish they'd put out a CD so I could enjoy the show in the car while making that commute to work.
B00003CX9S|5.0|A few reviews below, Steven Leiker gave some facts about the award winners and losers of 1980, trying to clear up the confusion about who won and was nominated for what.   <br /> <br />He complains about Raging Bull winning best actor, supporting actor, and best director.  That's false.  Martain Scorsese has never won the Oscar.   <br /> <br />Before trying to clear the air, it is best to get your facts straight.    :-/ <br /> <br />Oh, I *heart* irony!
B00005JOYA|2.0|Eugh, video game to movie transitions. Haven't we had enough Mortal Kombats and Resident Evils? I did walk into the theater with low expectations, but kept my mind open. (About as smart as retrieving dropped soap in a prison shower, but I digress.) The movie is about a woman named Rose, whose adopted daughter sleepwalks near a waterfall piping out \\"SILENT HILL! SILENT HILL!\\" After about a minute's worth of online research, Rose heads to the ghost town with her daughter for some vague, subtext-explained reason. After Rose makes a brief stop, she notices the dubious foreshadowing of her daughter's once-adorable crayon colorings transformed into crude representations of blood and gore. The characters exhibit some obligatory shock, and continue towards Silent Hill. It would go against standard horror movie protagonist conduct to do otherwise, right? A cop who earlier wrote down Rose's license plate number follows her to Silent Hill, and disjointed scenes of mild intrigue follow. Silent Hill is an unapologetic exercise of style, intending to envelop the viewer in its dreary atmosphere to a level he/she doesn't notice the sterile script and generic \\"I'm shocked! Now let's move on.\\" horror movie acting.<br /><br />Visually and aurally, Silent Hill is brilliant. The tainted ghost town drenched in fog is perfectly emulated, complimented by lucid camerawork and a melancholic soundtrack. The monsters themselves are somewhat creepy at first, (except the giant bug with the whimsical demon face) despite the fact that the CGI enhancement is too obvious. (CGI will always lack the depth and warmth necessary to be mistaken for flesh and blood.) I love the subtlety in how the creatures are presented, adding to the creep-out factor rather than the shock factor. On a superficial note, I was a bit let down by the lack of gore, or any real brutality, until the last quarter of the film. I understand Silent Hill is a mainstream movie with a regular R rating, but I expected a bit more considering the monsters were shambling lumps of pulsating flesh. Come on, give the audience a reason to be scared. Near the end of the movie, there's alot of blood and a certain Evil Dead-esque moment I don't think I can mention on Amazon, but the accentuating level of suspense in the amount of violence these creatures could inflict worked only to render the film somewhat visually unbalanced.<br /><br />This movie certainly evokes that bleak, gothic feeling of the namesake games, but utilizes the impeccable atmosphere to create a lopsided framework to rest a dark, but wholly forgettable Hollywood good vs. evil fairytale. Not recommended.<br /><br />- Thus says the Pellingtonidering the monsters were shambling lumps of pulsating flesh. Come on, give the audience a reason to be scared.

B00004BZ16|5.0|This is the most underated album in rock n roll history.  I started listening to the Clash when I was in middle school.  When I first bought this album I did not understand it.  Sure, I loved the standout tracks such as the Magnificent Seven and the Call up, but as whole I just did not get it.  Now being 22 I sometimes go back and listen to this album as a whole on and off and is by far the Clash's most creative album.  Do not get me wrong.  London Calling is the Clash's opus and one of the greatist albums or rock n roll but if you ask any hardcore Clash fan like myself they may say that Sandinista! is their best album.  Much like the Beatles White Album this is just all over the place and listening to it in the year 2006 it stands up to anything done today.  The Clash were taking a risk by experimenting with different sound and that is what makes rock n roll exciting.  If London Calling made them musicians.  This album made them experimental mad men
0670033375|4.0|<br /> Jared Diamond's book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed is an excellent book to read.  Throughout this novel Diamond speaks of several different societies (e.g. Easter Island, the Maya and Japan just to name a few); and then put them to the test by using five reasons why he thought societies failed or flourished.  These reasons are damage to their environment, climate change, hostile neighbors, and decrease of friendly neighbors and how certain societies respond to problems.  This book will really make you think about your nation and if it is going to prosper or if it is doomed. <br />

B000EHRVP6|3.0|I'm gonna start off with the goods.<br /><br />The movie is original and has a good feel to it. The mood is set as three Americans travel across Europe in search of drugs, sex and more sex. The feeling of when and where is it all gonna go bad is delayed nicely and it keeps you interested despite the slow pace getting down to the nitty gritty. Yet, when it all does finally go down, the shock value is strong and unexpected.<br /><br />What they eventually stumble across, is more adventure than they were looking for. A sadistic game of torture, brought about by cat and mouse and they unwittingly fall into the trap.<br /><br />Now the bads.<br /><br />First off, in a way, it's a good, because when it finally does happen, it holds more punch, but it took a long time to get into the danger that the movie is based on. Much of the film is taken up with set up... travel, sex-capades and things that really don't have anything to do with anything that unfolds in the film. This is not a huge deal to me.<br /><br />Where the film lost me, is when Paxton is finally strapped to the chair and his torturer is having his way. What unfolds is a series of ridiculous coincidences and clumsiness that leads to his getting free. He yells something at his torturer that is not subtitled, but it stops his torturer for a moment. Then his torturer starts up a chainsaw, SLIPS IN SOME BLOOD and chainsaws his own leg. Then of course... there's a gun!<br /><br />I hate coincidences. While I was into this film, at this scene, which was probably the most important scene in the film... I rolled my eyes and didn't care anymore.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This is actually a good film. Better than Cabin Fever. Certainly not THE SCARIEST MOVIE IN A DECADE, which has been promoted. Maybe the most VIOLENT. HOSTEL is a movie that, in my opinion, missed a lot of opportunities to really be special when it hit the coincidence super highway, and for me, fell into mediocre land.
1594200823|5.0|When some kids tend to read early in their life, it is often that one book usually ends up storming inside their brain. They idealize the content. They live it. Once a teenager, a book becomes many, rooting this idealism that the young brings with them into the road to adulthood.<br /><br />For the adults, however, books rarely become discoveries. We tend to cherry pick books that read about a passion we already have, we seek the confirmation of our ideas. Often, we fall onto something new and exiting. Some great new ideas that sprang out of nowhere, or from someone who spent years browsing into huge libraries in order to finally come up with stupendous theories about life and the way we live it. Unfortunately, these authors are usually biased and it is so often that an educated reader needs to trash a third or more of the political contents of a book, if he, or she, wants to fully savor and meditate the ideas behind the main thesis.<br /><br />Then, all of the sudden, a book arrives and manages to shake us up like we have never felt so shaken before: A book that comes with an immense surprise by revealing many things we would have never guessed in a lifetime; a book all about each one of us, about what we are made of, what we eat, how we eat. A book which describes something so meshed into our lives (our food), a book that reads about a passion exercised by so many including myself (cooking), and finally, a book so humble, so easy to read yet tremendously insightful. The \\"Omnivore Dilemma\\" of Michael Pollan is a pure masterpiece, and, if I may say so, a book to devour.<br /><br />Michael Pollan may be a bit of a scientist but he is a heck of a journalist. And it is a wonderful thing: The reading is as limpid as a glass of Evian, yet rich as a bucket of soymilk. The Book is set in three parts, each like a glorious chapter about the main three different cosmographies of the world of food: the industrial food, the organic food and what feeds the hunter-gatherer. If Michael Pollan delivers the world of industrial food and its horror stories, he does it without a trace hysteria. His style is calm, very academic for a journalist. Well, if Pollan teaches Journalism at Berkeley, he better be good! And he is indeed an epitome of what's best in journalism: he just reports, simply and without exaggerations. Mr. Pollan understands that the horror of engineered food stands on its own without the help of dramatization. To tell its huge drama, the voice of science with a journalistic accent will just suffice to fright the heck out of any reader.<br /><br />And don't get fooled by the title: Don't go thinking that Michael Pollan is some sort of Dr. Phil with a flower in his hair and hay in his mouth, who's just pulled another pamphlet to make Oprah look good for the cover of her magazine. The book is not about healthy recipies. The \\"Omnivore Dilemma\\" is indeed a political book of the highest degree. It is a biological \\"j' accuse!\\", a powerful dissent against the dictatorship of the \\"corporocracy\\" and the cult of greed: the big oil/corporate food processors/pharmaceutical industry dictatorship over our nutrition for their sole enrichment.<br /><br />The intents and logic of their science and industry is indeed tremendously despotic: For the name of quick profits, these corporations aggressively changed the way plants are now grown - from the sun energy now from fossil fuel -. They \\"re-engineered\\" cows in order for them to \\"graze\\" on corn for most of their lives. But since cows are not made to eat such food, they are constantly medicated. Chicken and hogs go into the same treatment.<br /><br />Pollan notes that corporations have engineered our food supplies in such ways, that today's customers, after centuries of basking comfortably into their own food cultures are now hit again by this `omnivore dilemma': a condition that defines the everyday adventure of omnivores, especially the human kind, seeking to find edible foods that can trusted while struggling to recognize the food that won't kill them in a short or a painful long term. No wonder this sounds so despotic: Michael Pollan reminds us that the very science of growing plants -and especially corn- out of fossil fuel is a creation of the military that needed to get rid of their vast surplus of chemical weapons.<br /><br />If, in the \\"Omnivore Dilemma\\", corporate greed is the evil Empire, Corn is Darth Vador. It is the sword brandished by these corporations to slaughter the cows, the hogs and the hens that will finished, artificially and naturally flavored, into our plates. Its agriculture is based exclusively on oil; fossil fuel that keeps poisoning heavily our rivers and atmosphere while intensive corn farming and feeding are eradicating pastures and grasses from our landscapes, abolishing our chance in the fight against Global warming: according to Michael Pollan, if grasses and pastures were to flourish instead on the same amount of acres raped by the corn industry, they would absorb the equivalent of carbon emitted by 4 millions cars!<br /><br />If American agriculture is a mess of subsidy checks to farmers who hate what they grow but are economically trapped into hubris government agricultural programs written by corporate lobbyists, Michael Pollan reports alongside the tear jerking beauty of grass farming. Its natural mechanic makes cattle so happy, bulls act just like \\"big cats\\" around human presence. The beauty of its natural cycles, and the human, natural and financial profit this kind of farming generates, makes you wonder why this has not become the norm. What in the hell changed America from the pastoral dream of Thomas Jefferson? It's a question that Michael Pollan seemed to have figured so brilliantly:<br /><br />\\"The Government writes no subsidy checks to grass farmers. Grass farmers, who buy little in the way of pesticides and fertilizers, do little to support agribusiness or the pharmaceutical industry or big oil. A surplus of grass does nothing for a nation's power or its balance of payments. Grass is not a commodity. What grass farmers grow can't easily be accumulated, traded, transported, or stored, at least for very long. [...] Unlike grain, grass can't be broken down into its constituent molecules and reassembled as value-added processed foods; meat, milk, and fiber is all about you can make out of grass, and the only way to do that is with living organism, not a machine.<br /><br />Grass farming with skill involves so many variables, and so much local knowledge, that it is difficult to systematize.

B00005JOYA|5.0|Very rare is the case when game adaptations become good movie but so is the case with \\"Silent Hill\\".  A plot that revolves around an estranged couple Rose Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) both at different ends in how to care their sick daughter.  Ask for the comments that males were an afterthougth well there is a lot of testosterone in \\"Silent Hill\\" Cybil Bennett, the cop , is very a tomboy figure.  Rose herself often acts irrationally without thinking and breaking the rules.  Contrary to the belief of a few minority Silent Hill is a combination of male and female characters.    Now as for the differences in the game, I've played the whole series from beginning to end including the first game and while there are differences the movie does remain pretty faithful  to the game. In the game Harry Mason was the lead, in the movie Rose was in the lead and looking for her missing daughter. The setup is also the same, Silent Hill has been abandoned for years but a portal of reality is now inhibited by monsters , evil spirits and other abominations. Equally the setup of atmosphere will be very familiar to game fans. The town is depicted as cold, gritty, snowy,  mysterious and evil.  There are  a lot of dark and grainy scenes that serve as a good hint that something horrible is about to come on screen followed by a lot of shrieks and high pitch squeals to add to the mayhem!!! There are classic horror gags as well like when Cybil being approached by the limbless zombies of Silent Hill is still laughing barking out orders hoping they'll stop coming after her.      Acting wise everyone was pretty solid here. I would have loved to see more of Sean Bean whose a  great actor but Radha does a good job especially for the fact that she mainly plays unmemorable supporting roles in movies led by leading actors.  Jodelle Ferland is great as Sharon Silva and her alter ego Alessa.    Of course you don't have to be familiar with the game to love the movie, the movie has classic horror elements and angles that will make everything pretty familiar but of course you gain a great appreciation if knowing the game you'd see that French Director Christopher Christophe Gans did not let fans of the game down. That's the biggest bottom line after all the hype a lot of fans expected this to be another catastrophic piece of garbage like all of Uwe Boll's movie but thank God it did not. All in all \\"Silent Hill\\" is a welcome surprise to some of the poor game adaptations out there.
1400079179|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is not a literary masterpiece. It's just what it intends to be: An adventure thriller novel and a solid work of fiction that had me reading steadily to the end. If you're like me though, reading this made-up story on the Holy Grail will make you hungry for non-fiction, factual information on the Holy Grail, and for this, I'd strongly recommend reading Swords at Sunset by Michael Bradley, a remarkable book by a critically acclaimed Holy Grail expert (the author served as a researcher for the Da Vinci Code movie starring Tom Hanks and has written around 20 bestselling books, mostly on the Holy Grail). Bradley uses archeological evidence to advance the fascinating theory that the Holy Grail came to North America centuries before Columbus discovered America. Frankly, I found Swords at Sunset to be more fascinating than the fictional Da Vinci Code, but I agree with the many readers out there who suggest both books be read as a set. I sure can't argue with that - both books are a real treat.
B000099T2L|1.0|To the reviewer Mike G, its Ok not to like certain bands or singers, since we all have a different ear for different forms of music. But to say Pink Floyd has no talent, and give Beyonce a 4 star rating is absurd. Beyonce can sing you say. So can a million other people just like her. None of the material is written by her, and you say Floyd was a mass marketing device. Take a look at Beyonce. Hmmmm...This music I have no taste for, and I dont like it, but I will say that her voice is OK, but for the rest of her music, ummmm...NO...and Lets see if Beyonce can stay on the Billboard 200 for 17yrs, thats 17yrs in a row!! Learn about music dude before you make comments, That Music Theroy class has your name on it.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Superb album with Emmylou's voice and Mark Knopfler's ability to tap into the emotions and lives of ordinary people.  Should be in everyone's collection.  Especially wonderful are \\"This is Us\\"  and \\"If This is Goodbye,\\" which is the last song on the album and is based on the last mobile phone messagesof those who lost their lives in 9?11.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have not anticipated a movie this much in my entire life. And I must admit it surpassed everything I hoped for. The CGI was astonishing, every emotion and breath exquisitely detailed. The storyline, which some critics have marked as shallow and poorly thought out, is in reality deep, moving and intriguing. The movie followed up the story in Final Fantasy VII perfectly. I am a huge fan of everything Final Fantasy and think this movie is a must have for anyone who loved FFVII and the story therein.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Right after 9/11, I was sure  the Apocalypse was imminent.  Convinced it was all going to happen at once and the Big One was about to hit California, in abject terror I threw my stuff in the car and drove to Mendocino from Santa Cruz, trying to escape the faultline.  On the way I played this album and this album saved me.  It had something to do with the mystical quality of the melodies and her deep voice, as well as the song 'Planets of the Universe,' which seemed to be a cosmic take on  the end of the world and helped me transform my terror.  I got lost in this record as I drove.  It was pretty much a religious experience.   <br /> <br />A nervous breakdown is not necessary to appreciate this record.  It's just great, period.  It's something you can dive down into, but it still kicks rock 'n roll ass.  It's got that combination of melodic depth and rhythmic propulsion that really grabs you--maybe reminiscent of some of Kurt Cobain's songs--but more similar to a band from New York called October Project.  I hope you love it as much as I do. Some may need to give it time.   Though I listened to it over and over in that post 9/11 phase, I still love it.  It bears the test of time, as does most truly creative work. As to Stevie's voice, I frankly like it better in its gravelly middle-aged post-tobacco incarnation.  <br /> <br /> Stevie  should have gotten more credit for this record than I noticed her getting.  It's no throwaway....buy it.
B0007Y08QA|2.0|Right upfront, let me tell you that I didn't enjoy watching this movie one bit.  We've all seen it. It used to be shocking and smart, but now it's been done so much that it's dumb and predictable. Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts.  It's just not a twist any more. You can now see it coming and you now say, \\"What, not this again.\\" If this picture has any meaning to it or is trying to make a point about something, I sure didn't get it. The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on.<br /><br />The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over.

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|This is a pretty good album for Rihanna. I never had her first one, so I can't really compare, but she does deliver on this album. It has a lot of \\"caribbean-felt songs\\" on the album, but it definetly has it's R&B beats.  <br /> <br />Breakdowns. <br /> <br />1. S.O.S. [ 8/10 ] We all know this one, and it's definetly a catchy, get in the mood, pop song. Good song. <br />2. Kisses Don't Lie [ 5/10 ] I don't like it. For Rihanna..it's not a good song. When you think about it, and realize shes TRYING to do rock, it seems a little better, but not a good one. <br />3. Unfaithful [ 9/10 ] Great song. Awesome lyrics, and though at some times Rihanna sounds like she's barely breathing, it's a really good choice for the 2nd single. Awesome song. <br />4. We Ride [ 10/10 ] Definetly the best song on the album. Perfect R&B feel, and should definetly have the title of the 3rd single. Good lyrics, nice catch & very felt lyrics. Powerful track. <br />5. Dem Haters [ 6/10 ] Pretty good song, not great. She talks about haters and jealousy trying to bring her down. Dwane Husbands actually adds to this song, I think. Carribbean feel. Good song overall. <br />6. Last Goodbye [ 6/10 ] Not a bad song, kinda acoustic feel to it. She's kind of promising her man she won't leave, which kind of gets old, but it's not a bad song. Pretty good catch. Okay song. <br />7. Break It Off [ 8/10 ] Really good song. Her & Sean Paul sound so good together on this awesome beat. Very catchy, and just a great song to get up and dance to, which you'll definetly miss from Rihanna on this album ( or so I heard ). Great song. <br />8. Crazy Little Thing Called Love [ 4/10 ] No, no, no. Not a good track at all. It sounds like a slowed down version of \\"Dem Haters\\". Shouldn't have ever made the album. Her voice doesn't sound bad, but the song is just not good. <br />9. Selfish Girl [ 6/10 ] Not bad, not bad. The beat kinda grabs you, and you can vibe to this one. Her lyrics aren't the best, but her voice soundsvery good. Overall good song. <br />10. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You) [ 8/10 ] Best ballad on the CD, she sounds good. The beat is slow, but you can feel it. I like it, and her voice sounds good. Good song. <br />11. A Girl Like Me [ 7/10 ] Talking about girls, girls, girls, which I can't really relate to, but the beat & voice is good. Good song. <br />12. A Million Miles Away [ 7/10 ] Good song, her voice sounds kinda like it's in slo-mo though.  <br /> <br />OVERALL: Pretty good album, it seems like they took all the scratched ballads that were going to be on Music Of The Sun, and put them together to make an album. You'll definetly not have the dance-Rihanna-songs you normally have, but it's a good CD. <br /> <br />[ BONUS TRACK'S NOT BROKEN DOWN ]
B000002ADT|5.0|One of the greatest jazz recordings of all time, hands down. <br />This is cool, sophisticated, swinging, inventive music. Miles' solos are creative and melodic. Coltrane is harmonically complex and develops his ideas brilliantly. Adderley plays his characteristic fast bebop style. Thus, the players have contrasting styles, but they still mesh.  <br />The arrangements were mostly just sketches that were given to the musicians when they arrived at the recording session. As a result, the music is very free and totally unrehearsed. All of the tracks (except Flamenco Sketches) are first takes. <br />While it is ridiculous to call this \\"the greatest jazz album of all time\\", because of the incredible quantity and variety of jazz recordings available, this is definitely one of the greatest because of the breathtaking solos and groove.

Also, the fact that his track \\"Dust\\" from his debut VAN HUNT was nominated led me to the neo-soul singer.  Let me say that ON THE JUNGLE FLOOR was not the least bit disappointing.  In fact, it was a refreshment from the purely contemporary R&B.<br /><br />On this album, Van Hunt is clearly showing the influence of his veteran peers such as Curtis Mayfield and obviously Prince.  This Prince influence is instantly recognizable on opening track, \\"If I Take You Home\\", one of my personal favorites.  My favorite though is \\"Hot Stage Lights\\", which has the old-soul, retro-soul vibe written all over the electric piano, synth, and guitar driven production.  Other tracks that I particularly enjoyed is the exceptional duet with Nikki Costa on \\"Mean Sleep\\", also \\"Daredevil Baby\\", \\"Being A Girl\\", \\"Suspiscion (She Knows Me Too Well)\\", \\"No Sense of Crime\\", and exceptional first single \\"Character\\".<br /><br />This album is completely left field of what other R&B artists are doing now.  Even compared to neo-soul greats Anthony Hamilton and John Legend, the vibe of soul feels older here, at least where production is concerned.  Honestly, this album by Van Hunt is in that elitest group of exceptional modern soul singers such as Hamilton, Legend, and Gerald LeVert among others. 4 stars easily for the exceptional followup album. Highly recommended.
0446577383|3.0|This is the third Baldacci novel I have read, and I approached it with high expectations.  While this was still good escapist fiction, it lacked the cohesiveness and the directed energy of his other novels.<br /><br />Some great twists, some wonderful (black) humour but overall not great.<br /><br />There was enough there to keep me reading, and I'll certainly be reading his other novels as I come across them.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B0007P3582|1.0|This guy has got to have broken a record for; the worst MC ever to gain as much hype and money in the history of commercial hiphop. Personally, I just cant take it anymore, the way that rappers like him are making this genre (hiphop) an embarassing one to say you love and involve your life in. Don't you see, he even said himself he just wants to keep earning money, and get richer and richer...and its exactly people who like this album that are making his unworthy ambition come true. Awful beats, lyrics with no substance (which perpetuate this idea of rap being about guns, homies, girls and all of the other f'in stereotypes) and his flow? doesnt even exist anymore...he just drones on as though he has lost the grasp on the idea that he is meant to be an artist/MC and all essence of what is what that got him noticed in the first place. Also, alot of these people who say this album is good and so forth are NOT HIP HOP fans, so dont say you are, and if you think you are you need to seriously re-consider your taste as it is just becoming a joke now. Most of the time, it's people who are into other styles of music who want to cross over, just to say that they are into this hiphop stuff, and so they can have some generic music to \\"dance\\" to at a club or a party..which is fine but it just supports this idea that hiphop (in the not-knowing public's eye) is just a joke of a genre and requires no real talent to get into.  Now yes, I am mainly a fan of early, mid-90's, UK and underground Hiphop...but I am still into some commerical hiphop so don't think im being biased...but this it's just ridiculous now. Though, sooner or later the music side to 50 cent's career will fade into the darkness and aspects like clothing lines, sex toys and whatever stupid ideas he comes up with will take over and make him into even more of a success with his money.   Now, buy this album at all means to play at a party, use as background music or even just to demonstrate how much hiphop music nowadays is exploited by many but understood by few (to quote j-live)...but do not buy it intending to hear something other than brain-washing trash, or to use it as proof that you are a hiphop fan. aaaa, now that I have got that off my chest...I hope you enjoy this album
1400079179|3.0|I read this novel when it was first published (back in 2003).  It's a good novel without being a great novel, it raises some interesting possibilities and has introduced me to one of my favourite villains of all time.<br /><br />I recommend this novel to anyone who likes plausible possibility but who can differentiate fiction from fact. If religious themes offend, then read Brown's other thrillers instead.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B00005JO20|3.0|There is a lot to be said about King and about Kong. I like Stephen King a lot, but unfortunately, the film is not based on one of his stories. About Kong: one of my first movie experiences was watching Kong in the backroom of a Northern Bavarian restaurant, in a special Sunday afternoon 16mm kids' screening. Only the second half, though, so all the rubbish about explaining why anybody would go to this island in the first place was left out. (this was the 1980s version, by the way). The monkey was allright, however, I have to defend it against all these nasty reviewers who refuse to loose a good word about this version. <br />Matter-of-fact, in 1985, there was a reason to remake King Kong. In 2005, admittedly, there was not. Fortunately, most of the tales about production costs is an outright lie, of course, because every child can see that 76 per cent of the film is just a director's cut of Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Parc and Evolution and some of the realted BBC material. The rest is not very good, but a nice distraction on a Sunday afternoon. And most of it is very loud, too, so you can try the settings of your hearing aid, if you had one. If not, you will need one. <br />Now the objectively reviewing part: the airfight at the end really made me dizzy, so I guess it was well directed. Unfortunately, the monkey dies at the end (I really crossed my fingers for him, but I had tried that before when watching \\"Titanic\\" and to no avail, so I was not too surprised). I hope that there is KingKong II - The Curse of the Were-Monkey, or that maybe they let Terry Gilliam direct it. I want to see that woman pregnant with an 8-meter baby monkey and breastfeeding it!
B00007AJF9|5.0|A bit more violent than I appreciate, but worthy of a viewing or two. Cate owns it, but the others also do well. This film is far, far, better than Shakespeare in Love, which is a vulgar, tasteless, obsurdity. Cate should have won the Oscar, no question. No offense to Gwenyth. At least Elizabeth did well in the nominations department.
B000CBSHK2|2.0|From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...a sophomore slump for Beth's senior release. This is absent any life her previous albums exhibited.
B00003CXV4|5.0|I watched Sweet November for the third time Sunday and I enjoyed it like it was the first time.  Yes, it's a love story, and it touches your heart and makes you reflect on your own life.  I'm not ashamed to say at the end I cried like a baby again!
B00005JOE8|1.0|When V for Vendetta is actually about vendetta, it's highly entertaining.  But too often it strays from that theme in favor of pushing its own political agenda and a lackluster love story between its protagonists.    The problem with the first one is that this movie forces its politics on the audience the way the fictional government it villifies forces its own on its citizens.  If you're not a left-wing extremist, you're evil.  Don't try to tell me that's not what Hollywood is saying.  What makes the love story lack luster is 1) Natalie Portman is a nightmare of an actress, and 2) V wears a mask and speaks in a detached, emotionless voice.  Director James McTeigue seems to want V to be both a dark, mysterious character and a warm, romantic one--two things that don't quite gel.  Then there's the seemingly three hour running time.  I mean, come on.  Does any action movie (at least I think that's what this is supposed to be) really have to be more than ninety minutes?  This one doesn't, but it is anyway.
0316172324|5.0|This book is all about insticnts, mind power, and the ablity to notice something within those first two seconds of looking at it, as displayed in the book by the kourus, a famous greek stautue that everyone new was fake apart form the museum who was buying it!This book is about split second desisive moments, you know, when you know something is wrong with something, but you can't quite put your finger on it.<br /><br />Overall i really enjoyed this book beacuse i don't have much of that natural instinct within me, and i admire people who do<br /><br />Fantastic, Sam Worrall rating:5 stars
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This movie slaughtered a beautiful book. Keira Knightly resembled nothing close to an Elizabeth Bennet and the story was so rushed and sugar coated that only someone who has never read the book, or even heard the plot, could have enjoyed it. It was an absolute heartbreak. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Myself and others have been waiting a long time for this movie, but the experiance is not worth the wait. The story is directly related to the events of the Playstation game Final Fantasy 7 but the story within this movie is hardly worth telling. The only good thing about the movie script is that it brings back all the heroes that gamers grew to love in the original game. This CGI movie is beautiful to look at but is basically hollow at its core. The action is good, but I've seen better action combat in recent anime movies like Appleseed or Steamboy. The voice acting is OK but it never seems to truely fit in with the actions, movements, or emotions of the CGI characters on screen. I guess my greatest issue with this movie is that F.F.7 for the PS1 had such an epic and sweeping storyline that Advent Children feels so small and pointless compared to the great storytelling that inspired it. The bonus materials on Disc 2 are just OK with nothing truely amazing to mention. I know that a large group of Final Fantasy fans are ready to buy this DVD by the thousands, and they should. It will complete a collection and looks very good for a CGI film. Fans just might not be getting exactly what they've been waiting so very long for.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|So... since the rumors started of a FFVII movie back in the early 2000's, I waited for this movie.  I could not be more pleased with the results.  This movie is stellar in every aspect, most especially the story.  It can go as deep or as shallow as you want it to.  You might think, it's gotta be hard to pack a whole new story into a 102 minutes.  Well, Square Enix used every minute the right way, and accomplished the goal.  The story is touching, the graphics are phenomenal, and the action is intense.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you play the game before seeing this movie, otherwise you could possibly mistake this for an acid trip.  All the characters from the game are included, and even a summon! :)  Definitely see this movie if you liked FFVII, you'll gain a whole new appreciation for movies, the story you thought you knew, and most of all... emotion.
0226264211|5.0|One of my faves. Friedman was one of the best. Also read THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F. A. Hayek.  <br /> <br />As for Reviewer T.A. Turner: the good news is that your lobotomy IS reversible. There are a lot of brilliant ex-Marxists about these days. Reading Thomas Sowell for starters just may restore your mind. Of course, if it's your heart that's the problem.... <br /> <br />Putting forth a man like V.I. Lenin who said:  <br /> <br />\\"It would not matter if 3/4 of the human race perished; the important thing is that the remaining 1/4 be communist\\"  <br /> <br />---as an paragon of \\"compassion\\" is truly pathetic!  <br /> <br />Yeah, the \\"compassionate\\" followers of Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Mao & Pol Pot have thus far \\"liberated\\" by mass murder between 95 and 150 million souls. Purges, Pogroms and Killing Fields!  No other political party in human history has shed so much blood in the space of a single century. And Mr. Turner's colon is is knots over a Goldwater cartoon! Give me a break.
B000E1155E|5.0|I haven't heard any of the hype around these guys, I just listened to it and I got hooked. I've been listening to it non-stop since I got it a few weeks ago. apparantly the hype around them though is like waaaay exaggerated, but don't judge them on that, it's not their fault. it really is good music, might not change the face of music, but it sure gets ya movin! and remember, this is a debut album, the singer is only 19! so considering that, this album is amazing!
B00005JOYA|4.0|I knew going into this film that Silent Hill would be deeply polarizing to different people.  There will be fans of the game that love it, fans of the game that hate it.  However, there will also be the casual audience member that will love it and the poor sap who will go \\"WTF?  What am I watching?\\"    Such is the huge task dropped into the laps of gamer Christophe Gans (the director) and Roger Avary (the writer).  Neither of which are slouches when it comes to making films.  Add to that a cast that includes Sean Bean and Rahda Mitchell, among others, and you have the makings of a video game movie worth watching.  So, is it?  Well, that depends on the kind of individual you are.    The Silent Hill games are a very mysterious beast.  There is a semblance of a plot in the traditional sense holding them together.  However, much of the time is spent disecting the backstory of both the town and the people trapped therein.  The basic story of this movie is that Rose is a mother of a child named Sharon who is having dreams of Silent Hill.  Rose thinks its a good idea to take Sharon to Silent Hill to help her remember.  Fans of the horror genre know this can't turn well and it doesn't.  Rose crashes, Sharon vanishes and all hell breaks loose.    The rest of the movie is stylishly shot with filters, fog and darkness to create a living nightmare, both literally and metaphorically.  Here is where Christophe Gans shines.  He is in full control of what the town should look like, how the camera angles should show the action and how to propel Rose toward the inevitable gory conclusion.  The biggest problem he had to face was to bring a story that is hidden behind notebooks, letters and cryptic dialogue to a 2 hour film that doesn't leave the audience not knowing what happened.  It's easier to piece together a cryptic plot in a 10 hour game or 500 page novel than it is in a 2 hour movie.      I'll admit, there are some egregious dialogue problems.  But, I hate to say it, video games aren't exactly the birthing place of dialogue greatness.  Think Resident Evil: \\"Blood.  I hope it's not...Chris's blood.\\"  Think Silent Hill 3: \\"Remember me, and your true self as well, also that which you must become. The one who will lead us to Paradise with blood stained hands!\\" It's a bit over the top.  So when lines are spouted in the movie that seem to be head-shakingly bad, I guess if we can't fault video games why fault a movie?      As such, the film as a medium is forced to be a bit more obvious.  Here is where a lot of fans will turn up their noses.  I'll admit, there are times where the mystery is spoiled because Christophe wants the audience to understand more.  But overall, I think it works.  And works well if compared to other video game adaptations like Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Mario Brothers or *insert the Uwe Boll movie of the week here*.  Is it perfect?  No.  But what is here is an enjoyable representation of images, tone and feeling of the game series.
B000000WA4|5.0|Simply timeless... One of the first cd's I ever purchased, this album has stood the test of time and the harsh eye of hindsight. A defining work in the Alt. Rock canon, this is required listening for any fan of modern music. Highly reccommended!
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin spent nearly 10 years writing Team of Rivals, and it's worth the wait. A hefty book at more than 750 pages of text, this one still keeps you turning the pages as the author presents full and balanced portraits of Lincoln and his cabinet. <br /> <br />Lincoln emerges as the hero of the narrative, not just for his leadership during the war but for having the courage and conviction to surround himself with his former political rivals in the Cabinet, whom he felt were the best minds able to help guide the country through the coming turbulence that was the Civil War. <br /> <br />The book is as much a biography of those men as it is of Lincoln -- William Henry Seward, Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton, Edward Bates, Montgomery Blair, Gideon Welles. Seward, Chase and Bates were candidates for the Republican nomination that Lincoln had won in 1860 and initially thought him unfit for office. In addition, the animosity between some of them -- Chase and Blair, Stanton and Blair, Chase and Welles -- threatened to undermine the administration. But Lincoln held the team together and many of the Cabinet members, Seward most notably, became friends of his. <br /> <br />The War itself isn't covered in as much detail as the characters -- most of the key battles get only a page or so, put in the context of how they affected the national mood and how Lincoln and his team responded to them. More discussion of Lincoln's relationship with his generals would also be welcome, though to cover that would likely require another book. <br /> <br />The joy of reading this book comes in its defense of Lincoln as truly a master among peers -- not just during his time, but for all-time. He had a vision for leadership and a moral compass that resonates through the century and a half since his death. <br /> <br />Goodwin's book is well worth the read for Lincoln fans, history buffs, and anyone interested in group dynamics and how to drive them toward great ends. <br /> <br />DJ
B000002UAX|5.0|If there was ever a rock album that was a reflection of its time, it DEFINITELY was 'The Beatles' ('The White Album'). 1968 has been variously described as the year that came the closest this country ever came to an internal civil war -- the Vietnam War was reaching a peak of conflict, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the violence and chaos in Czechoslovakia, the demonstrations and protests at the Chicago Democratic Convention that year.   <br /> <br />Somehow, through its mess of stylistic range and gripping songwriting, 'The White Album' reflected it all.  The Beatles were coming apart at the seams during the recording process of this album, but in their usual brilliant way, they gave a perfect encapsulation of the times.  A previous reviewer here said there was a sense of terror about this album, and I would agree -- songs like \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (in my opinion, the best song on the album), \\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Julia\\" (a lament for John Lennon's mother), \\"Mother Natures Son\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" are totally haunting and remain enraptured in your mind after one or two listenings.  The album also contains what is unquestionably the hardest rock the band ever recorded in the form of \\"Yer Blues\\", \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\" and (especially) \\"Helter Skelter\\".  In a strange sense, the album as a whole also seems to be a kiss-off or farewell to the utopian spirit and promise that the 1960's held, and was alive only one year earlier with the \\"Summer of Love\\" and 'Sgt. Pepper's'.  Many people criticize \\"Revolution No. 9\\" for being an unlistenable avant-garde experience, and it may very well be, but for those who lived through 1968, doesn't it seem like its wierdness and bizarre construction reflected the turmoil of the events that surrounded the world at that time ? <br /> <br />If you are expecting a perfectly constructed Beatles album like 'Rubber Soul' or 'Revolver', you will be surprised or shocked at how different this album is from every other Beatles recording.  But it is no less a masterpiece that few (if any) bands would attempt, and if several filler tracks like \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road ?\\" keep this from being considered rock's best double album ever, there is also no album or double album that, taken in one listening, will raise a host of emotions in you as 'The White Album' can.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|Lousy tongue-in-cheek script, unconvincing cardboard characters, reheated crook-with-a-golden-heart story. If you like Sci-Fi, try Battlestar Galactica instead to see how adults write and act.<br /><br />And please hire a decent tutor to stop the actors from mangling their Mandarin Chinese lines, or better yet, get a first year student of Mandarin to dub them.
0553381407|5.0|Too many children of abusive parents have given up hope of ever having someone take their side, listen to them, and have empathy for their pain.  Too often they're told to \\"get over it,\\" to \\"move on,\\" or worse yet, \\"just forgive and forget.\\"  If it were only that simple!  Sadly, people just don't understand how those words can make a completely unbearable situation even worse. <br /> <br />Susan Forward is a lifesaver for these adult children of abusive parents.  She seems to completely understand the frustration and pain that continues long into your adult years.  She takes the burden of \\"fixing\\" the problem off the shoulders of the victims and puts it back squarely where it belongs.  Her attitudes on forgiveness are entirely different from any I've read, and rightly so. <br /> <br />Anyone who's suffered abuse or neglect as a child, and who still struggles with the pain of guilt, isolation, depression, anger, etc., absolutely MUST read this book.
068983571X|5.0|Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight.  I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell.  I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles.  One of the best mysteries in the series.  What more could you ask for?  A spooky<br /><br />legend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story,  Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant.  The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case.  Well done!
0307276902|5.0|A million little pieces is one of the best books that I have ever read. The style of writing that James Frey has is a very unique way of putting his thoughts down onto paper. James Frey records him recovering from drug abuse and his six weeks in rehab. He talks about the people that he met and the way that he was feeling throughout his whole time of getting the drugs out of his body. One of the reasons that I liked this book so much was because it was real he wasn't afraid to say what he felt about being their and the relationship with his parents. Towards the end of the book it got very suspenseful and it was really hard to but the book down towards the end. While reading the book it was still really hard to believe that this was actually his life and he really went through that.  After I did finish the book I almost had tears in my eyes because of how sad the ending was and how much it touched me I am not going to spoil it and tell you what happens at the end so you are just going to have to pick up the book and read it yourself.
B000002H33|5.0|Great stuff. This is by far the best work that came out of the genre. For my money, Metallica blew away Winger and Cinderella. And don't even get me started on the band they've been compared to the most, Poison. Everyone says that Poison were more skilled musicians, I say NO WAY! Do any of you even play an instrument?

0743539133|5.0|A terrific book giving you a different insight on the political savvy of President Lincoln. How he wrestled the Republican nomination in 1860 and how he got his formal rivals to form part of his wartime cabinet. The book takes you through the civil war and through the internal squabbles between Lincoln and his cabinet and how Lincoln used his savvey to placate his rivals and still get what he wanted from them.<br /><br />The book is gripping and well written.
B000001ES9|2.0|Quite obviously this is the \\"still in development of an identity\\" Rush, which still has its positive aspects. There's some good straight forward guitar rock (Finding My Way and the Sabbath-like riff in What You're Doing and the Iommi-esque break down and solo work in Working Man), and it kind of reminds me of the early days of Wooden Nickel-era Styx where you can see the band is feeling around for something still somewhat elusive, in Rush's case that being Neil Peart, both in terms of playing and lyrics. Honestly, musically speaking, there's even a taste of pre-Kiss band Wicked Lester here. That's evident on Alex's lead work on Take A Friend or the break in Before And After.   <br /> <br />Certainly hindsight helps visualize this developmental quality. Maybe people who remember buying that first record when it came out and liked it had a harder time adjusting to the changes to come. Others, like me, grew up on Moving Pictures-era Rush and worked backward to their earliest efforts and saw things a different way.  <br /> <br />I think the clearly Sabbath-inspired Working Man is the highlight here (and still a fun listen today), along with the serene coolness of Here Again. Geddy's almost-helium-like voice and the lyrical content, especially (Need Some Love & In The Mood being two great examples), makes one chuckle time and again for sure.  <br /> <br />Some bands give it all they've got on their first record and spend the rest of their careers trying to match magic and quality captured on their debut. And with others, like Rush, that first record is just a place to get their feet wet. The best was yet to come, and in Rush's case more than 30 years later now, that still may be the case. How many bands can you truly say that about? <br /> <br />
B00007GZR5|5.0|Given poor reviews when first released, I now realize that the \\"critics\\" did not understand the movie.  This movie is a wonderful love story, of sorrow, loss, and the infinate nature of love.  The acting is surpurb, but it's the story that makes this (not a \\"must see\\" but) a \\"must experience.\\"
B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill, as you all may know by now, is a series from the game company Konami who took video game horror to the next level for gamers.  It was a masterpiece in unsettling atmospheres, disfigured monsters, and in sound quality.  To be honest, I've never played the first Silent Hill game but I have been following the game series since Silent Hill 2 came out. So, when I heard about the game series being produced into a film in America, two things came to mind.   <br /> <br />1:  Oh no, American cinema couldn't possibly pull that off <br />2:  Oh yes, that would be a great film! <br /> <br />I will admit that I was very skeptical since many of the video games I have played which were turned into films have heavily disappointed me.  Fortunately, after seeing the first screenshots and trailers of the film, I was convinced they were on the right track.  Well, enough epilogue, I might as well get to my feelings of the film.   <br /> <br />What I loved about silent hill, as well as other horror movies, was the scenery, the environment, and the sounds.  All of it played into my favor as sinister and deep and I could not have been any happier with it.  The acting was well done but I don't think any of it screams Oscar.  The story was well done and fit well with me as a fan of the series. <br /> <br />What I didn't like was the occurrences of some bad CG or other special affects.  There's one moment in the film, which I will not go into detail about, that I saw a transition between live action actor to a mannequin.  Still, the CG did have its strong moments that had my jaw dropped on the floor.  The dialogue in the film felt a little hokey at times.  These were moments when the characters would say quotes that you knew were coming.  Still, I think the dialogue was enthralling and that it did get its point across.  Finally, I was a little brought back from the film whenever I saw the movie take on some video game aspects.  This only happens whenever the lead character Rose finds a clue on how to find her daughter.  These moments reminded me of the \\"invisible hand of the game designer\\" which are sometimes used in video games to give you a blunt answer on where to go next.  Still, I did appreciate the effort. <br /> <br />All in all, this was a very good film not just for the \\"video-gamer\\" part of me but also for the \\"Horror film fan\\" part of me.  It's a masterpiece in cinematography and atmosphere while also being a strong driving force in telling a complicated story.  However, I would like to give this last bit of advice for the movie goers before I leave.  If you love innovative cinematography, creepy atmospheres, thought provoking horror, and long movies (the film is two hours long), I'm certain that you will be happy with this film.  If you do not care for atmosphere, if you're looking for a gore-fest or scare you up film, if you are not a horror movie fan to start with, I have a feeling that you will not be satisfied with this movie.  In the end, this is one of my favorite movies of 2006 and I am excited about getting the DVD in the future with all of the extra features.  Thanks for reading my review. <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I'm with the above reviewer.  My reaction was like a photo negative of Mr. Nash's!  My expectations were enormous and were exceeded.  I haven't been this happy this instantly since the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's \\"Acoustic\\" ... and that was a long time ago.  Reminded me of the good old days, when a five star album was not a minor miracle.  I knew there was no way to lose with Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, but I was amazed by the combination.  The whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.  Their voices blend wonderfully, yet neither loses its uniqueness.  The result is something that sounds fresh and honest not calculated and manipulative.  Buy it.  If you don't love it, you won't have trouble finding someone who will!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I must admit that the music here is boppy and addictive and I love singing along with it.  But I also must admit that I think I can sing better than Britney - and that is saying something.  To think that she's made the money she's made by not being able to sing?  Amazing.  You should check out the cd for the songs, but her voice needs a big big tune up.
0618001905|5.0|I stumbled upon this book after learning about the Lord's Resistance Army and the horrific acts they continue to do to this day in April 2006. If you haven't read about what they are doing, look it up on the internet, if you dare. To know what is happening in our times but to be powerless to stop it feels like torture.<br /><br />Where did such barbarism come from. Was it part of a warring tribal culture? We'd heard about head hunters. A friend said it's part of the legacy of Colonialism in Africa. I couldn't believe it. He told me about this book about King Leopold - and I was galvanized just hearing about. I bought a used copy and in a weekend, this non-book reading gal, finished it. It is compelling, unbelievable, inspiring. This is the history behind the novel  Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad - read in high school - and \\"Apocalypse Now\\", the movie. The depths of barbarism that are revealed to satisfy the greed of a remote King are unspeakable. Read about how it began and how it continued. How it was discovered and brought down is enlightening.<br /><br />This history must be known, but it takes courage to read.<br /><br />Beware, it may propel you to political activism.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|...is a towel clamp.  It's a surgical instrument used primarily for clipping sterile towels to one another when you're draping a prepped patient for an operation.<br /><br />Figure half a dozen of 'em in the average abdominal procedure tray sent up from central supply.  The circulating nurse can always spill a couple more on the Mayo stand if you drop one on the floor, honest.<br /><br />Yeah, a towel clamp can be used as a tenaculum to grab soft tissue, sure.  But that's because the pincer-like design enables you to bite into skin or muscle or fascia with *less* damage than a regular hemostat or Kocher clamp might impose by virtue of crush injury.<br /><br />They're actually a \\"kinder, gentler\\" way to grab the patient's flesh and hold it so that you can put the puzzle back together with a minimum of necrosis or scarring later.<br /><br />Sorry to kill the buzz.
B000E5N62U|3.0|Quickly...  <br /> <br />Musically speaking, better than Kamakiriad, not as good as The Nightfly and worlds apart from Aja & Gaucho.  From a sound quality perspective, waaay to \\"ripe\\"... filled with bloated bass lines, only the musially naive will find this enjoyable. Boom box fans unite... thumping dead ahead!  <br /> <br />With its mechanical and fabricated sound, AUDIOPHILES BEWARE !! It ain't Aja or Gaucho or The Nightfly or Kamakiriad!! Is this acceptable in 2006?  <br /> <br />
0070511136|3.0|Identifies difference between large and small selling. Overall does make a few good points but the author could have summarized in less than 20 pages. My recommendation: do browse through the book but don't spend more than day or two reading it.  <br /> <br />Summery: Implication and need-payoff are the most important stages of large selling. More you work on these questioning stages better you will get at large sales, as you will learn objection prevention Vs handling. <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|Philip Seymor Hoffman shows that his Oscar & Golden Globe winning performance as Truman Capote are deserved in what could be remembered as one of the best Performances in History, he is Backed up by a very strong performance in Catherine Keener playing Harper Lee, the infamous author of one of the most exeptional american novels of all time - \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", Bennett Miller does what any great Director should do, nail the details but leave enough open for the audience to figure out what all will happen and what is happening, on their own. Wonderful Costumes, Exemplary Visuals & outstanding cinamotography. To some people this movie might be a little bit slow but if you pay attention closly and have a decent attention spand than you will most likly enjoy and be amazed by just about every aspect of this Oscar nominated film. <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B000EMGJM2|3.0|I enjoyed Van Hunt's first album a lot more.  The first album was off the chain and innovative.  In this album he lacked the introspective writing and lyrical style of the first album or the work he did for Rahsaan Patterson in \\"After Hours\\".  I am used to Van Hunt's writing and lyrics to be layered and full of subtext that translates itself into melodic majesty.  But this effort lacks the majesty of his previous works.  Such as \\"Penny with a Hole in It\\" - Dionne Farris or \\"Your love is the Greatest Drug\\" - on the Coach Carter Soundtrack.  This album was good but when it comes to Van Hunt I have come to expect something extra and intangible sound, unique lyrics and uncompromising prestige.  But at the end of the day he is still one of my favorite artists.
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|This book had my rapt attention for a weekend.  I could not stop reading.  While seeming a bit pretentious at first, the prose is consistent, sometimes beautiful, and definitely a part of the person we come to know as Eva Katchadourian.  Once I became used to her style, it did not bother me; I understood it was Eva, not Lionel Shriver.   <br /> <br />The characterization in this novel is excellent, particularly that of Eva.  She is possibly the most complete character I've ever read.  I was annoyed at her at times, and even bewildered at her reactions to certain situations.  However, I always found Eva to be a sympathetic character.  She makes many mistakes (and so did Franklin, her husband...he sometimes exhasperated me so much I wanted to throw the book!), which she admits to.  Eva villifies Kevin when he is just an infant, which forms an ever-growing wedge between herself and Franklin.  At the same time, it seems that she did what most normal, flawed people would do in her situation.  Her letters let us know how much she loves Franklin still, despite the way he seemed to turn against her sometimes due to their disagreements about Kevin (Franklin never really accepts that Kevin could be the sociopath Eva suspects him to be).    <br /> <br />Eva's story is disturbing, harrowing, and gripping.  It is hard to forget...it does not just go away when you put the book down.  This book affected me in a way that no book has before.  It made me question whether I ever want to have a child.  It gave me a nightmare.  It even made me feel trepidatious about going back to the schools (I am a substitute teacher).  It even, as another reviewer put it, \\"left a dent in my heart.\\" I am glad to have experienced such a well-written, moving story, but at the same time, this story left me with a sense of sadness, melancholy, and anxiety that I suspect will have a grip on me for a few days.   Do not pick this up for light reading.  If you want to become absorbed in a story that is important, timely, provocative, and emotionally gripping, please give this book a chance.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this CD and after hearing it everyday, since it's release, I have begun to love it even more! Very catchy songs and great lyrics! I can totally relate! I have the Dual Disk version and love the extras on the DVD part. Love the Stupid Girls video and the behind the scenes of the U + Ur Hand video shoot (which i think is her third single). This is a must have cd which you won't regret purchasing!
B0000009OU|5.0|This, the first album Costello recorded with his long running backup band - the Attractions - is a strong contender for the best recording in a long and varied career. Not as tight or melodic as the classic follow-up Armed Forces, this 1978 album is certainly the dirtiest, punkiest album Costello had ever pulled, and the Attractions are given more space here to roam than in any of the latter, more tightly arranged albums; drummer Pete Thomas is especially wonderful here, adding a savage beat to wonderful, infectious songs like This Year's Girl and Pump It Up. <br /> <br />Elvis's excellent debut, My Aim Is True, signaled the arrival of one of the freshest artists of his time; but This Year's Model makes My Aim Is True sound more like practice for the real thing. This Year's Model indeed shows him to be one of the freshest recording artists of the 70's, and though it's generally labeled as punk rock - and punk's influence is certainly there - it remains fresh today like few punk albums have. Like the Beatles in the psychedelic era, Costello was not an integral part of the punk movement but instead used it to create music that's new and fresh; and This Year's Model is true timeless music, more than a bit thanks to Costello's intelligent, sarcastic lyrics. Songs like This Year's Model and the single Radio, Radio are statements that are powerful today as they were back then. <br /> <br />Each and every song on This Year's Model is a classic, successful singles and undiscovered gems alike; Costello drew immense amounts of depth from songs that are akin to punk in their compactness, tightness and simplicity. In less than three minutes of songs he says more than many other artists can in a forty minute album - and the songs on This Year's Model are as infectious and straightforward as they are deep, intricate and intelligent. From the incredibly short, fast and furious No Action, through dark non-conformist anthems like Lipstick Vogue, Night Rally and Lip Service, to the unbelievably catchy classic Pump It Up with its infectious groove and Dylan-ish lyrics, it's an album that flows by quickly and strongly, not leaving any listener indifferent and making them want a whole lot more. <br /> <br />You get some more with the bonus tracks, which are good, though not entirely essential, and the album actually works better as a whole without them. Other than the essential classic Radio, Radio - which was not part of the original album but is there on all CD versions and makes a perfect ending for the album - there's also Big Tears (the Clash's Mick Jones playing guitar), Running Out of Angels and Crawling to the USA - all good songs, though not quite as good as the original album tracks; also included are acoustic demos of two excellent songs from the Armed Forces LP - Big Boys and Green Shirt. All of the bonus tracks are worth having, but on repeated listening I usually tune out after Radio, Radio.
B00005YJMX|5.0|This remake is one of my favourite movies. <br /> <br />It's surreal and just breathtaking. The camera work, costumes, the choice of locales...the music! Everything about it is beyond words. You must see it to understand. This is the kind of movie that makes me remember that cinema can be True Art.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Wow!  I discovered this show by accident.  THANK GOODNESS!  What a brilliant, well-written, well-acted drama!  The multiple plot lines, seeing the human, often flawed sides of doctors, even the music is just...the show is amazing.  ABC has a winner and this DVD  set is a must-see DVD of this year.<br /><br />Sadly, season 1 only ran nine episodes due to ABC discovering it late into the year.  Even still, nine episodes of GREAT TELEVISON are better than none.<br /><br />One thing that really stood out was seeing the character flaws.  Watching Meredith as she pursued a married man.  Hearing her call herself a whore while she's in bed with another man.  Seeing her hide from her Dad when he shows up at the hospital after so many years of being out of her life.  My heart cringed when Derrick (played superbly by Patrick Dempsey) told her he was \\"very sorry\\" right before his wife showed up.  By giving her flaws and making her appear like a regular person, she wins over hearts of viewers -- at least me.  I was rooting for her throughout season one and now season two.<br /><br />The other characters are just as good, if not better.  Burke, one of the residents, plays the confident, assured of himself, resident who, when he discovers he has competition for chief resident, doesn't consider the competition the enemy...just competition.  This, despite the current chief promising the slot to Burke.  Watching him work in the OR, he isn't cocky...just damned good.<br /><br />And who would have thought little Katherine Heigl (Izzie)would turn out to be so...well...full-figured?  She plays as a former model (actually looks like one too!) who paid her way through medical school by posing in lingerie -- cue a plot twist!  She is beautiful, funny, and has \\"quarks\\" that make her adorable.<br /><br />Sandra Oh plays as Cristina, a well-educated (3 or 4 degrees), motorcycle-riding, Korean doc.  She provides a tough, no-nonsense balance to Izzie.  T.R. Knight, who plays O'Malley, is funny to watch.<br /><br />Last but not least, there is Chandra Wilson, who plays as Miranda Bailey.  Her behavior, mannerisms, and the way she keeps her intern docs running around at just hilarious.  She is affectionately known as the \\"nazi\\".  I think of her like a mama bear watching over her cubs.  She is tough and demanding but she takes care of her docs.<br /><br />I think the current chief resident, played by James Pickens Jr, isn't long for the show.  He already developed a medical condition in Season 1 and has two doc angling for his job.  My bet is that he's gone by Season 2.  It would be a shame because he's got game -- the man can act.  There is a funny moment when he is practicing surgical moves and racing Sandra Oh.  During the warm-ups, she beats him.  During the actual exam, he not only beats her but performs the test with his eyes closed.<br /><br />(I am deliberately leaving out Alex Carev, played by Justin Chambers.  While he does a great job playing his role, his character is a snake in the grass.)<br /><br />Oh, about the DVD set.  It is made up of 2 DVDs.  It has a couple of bonus features:  Anatomy of a Plot (the toughest cuts from the pilot episode); Dissecting Grey's Anatomy (unaired scenes); and an Avant-Garde trailer.  The shows are in widescreen format - 1.78:1 and come in Dolby Digital 5:1 Surround sound.<br /><br />Get this DVD.  You will not be disappointed in the shows...only that the season ends so darn quickly.<br /><br />PS - Trailers and clips from Season 2 are available on ABC's website.ey, is funny to watch.   <br /> <br />Last but not least, there is Chandra Wilson, who plays as Miranda Bailey.

B00004TLN3|4.0|The reviewer below me was right. What's up with people? This movie had SOME flaws, but all in all I really liked it! I've watched it about 3 times now...yes at times the music is a bit....hokey.  <br /> <br />I would love to see a new adaption of this....really I would! Who else?! The book is wonderful...but it's so overlooked among her other works.
B00005JO1R|5.0|First of all, the collector's edition is definitely worth the extra $10-ish. Also, most of the deleted scenes are very good, which in my opinion rarely happens.<br /><br />That said, as Jon Steward so ludely put it at the Oscars, this movie is \\"'Ray' with white people\\". Personally, I very much liked \\"Ray\\"; however, I feel that \\"Walk the Line\\" is much, much better. It does have the same basic story line, but I feel the performances by Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon together were far superior than most of the performances in \\"Ray\\". Also, there is a true love story behind this movie...although Johnny Cash cheated on his first wife and that marriage did not work out, he was basically in love with June Carter from age 10 on, and to me that makes a true life story. Definitely a must-see, whether you like country music or not!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this biopic...<br /><br />Joaquin and Reese were beyond awesome in this, I love their singing! I'm not a huge fan of Johnny Cash, but this movie really riveted me and made me look up more of his songs.<br /><br />And it certainly solidified my belief that Joaquin Phoenix is one of THE best actor's of this age.
0399226907|5.0|As a young woman living on the streets, I had life direction. I delved into drugs and gang violence, but then I found myself in this book. While robbing a children's library, I discovered The Very Hungry Caterpillar and I could not put it down. My life has purpose and meaning now, and thanks to this wonderful caterpillar.
B00007AJF9|5.0|I was byond excited when this movie came out. I ran to the cinema! And I was certainly not disappointed. WOW. This movie is a stunner. <br /> <br />If you are at all a fan of English history, Elizabethian times and period drama's. You must see this! All the elements come together perfectly. Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth was perfect. Now I hear they're coming out with another one.... = ) Is all I can say.
B00009L1UP|5.0|This CD rocks from start to finish.Not one bad song on the CD Scarboro fair on the remastered version is awesome!I like last time in Paris and Dirty lil' secret as well.this is perhaps thier best CD they've ever made.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I guess I expected this movie to be a more comical take on the arms dealers. <br /> <br />Some comic moments. But mostly I was blown away with the deeper and more profound message of violence, it's impact, the human plight and our souls. It was one of those movies that kept me thinking on it and it's more profound meanings long after it was over. <br /> <br />My soul felt battered when I was through. A lot going on under the surface here than meets the eye.
B0000931QA|5.0|2112 by Rush, and Tommy by The Who are legendary concept albums,But In my opinion ,There just Isn't anything like Operation mind crime! When I first put the tape in my walkman and listened,and heard I remember now and going right into Anarcy X, It blew my mind!It does pull you into another world.Its a dark story.with a realistic ending, Not the happy ending you might expect when you first listen to the CD.It left room for the second OMC witch I have heard and find great too, Not the masterpiece like this one, however!the Intro to spreading the disease and the song eyes of a stanger where my favorite parts of the CD Suite sister Mary is a great song.Breaking the silence is awesome,The needle lies is cool too.And I don't believe in love was also really cool!The album keeps you thinking the entire time,and just keeps getting better al the way too the end with awesome songs that I never get tired of,no matter how many times I hear the album.A must have for any true Queensryche fan.
0671027387|1.0|Having read the Code, A&D, DigFort in that order, I picked this one up before a flight hoping it would reverse the trend in quality I had seen in my reading of Dan Brown. The Code was great but by DF, I thought I had picked Brown's High School Creative Writing sample.<br /><br />Gag.  I am on page 137 and will probably read the in-flight magazine, instead.  I tried to leave it on the connecting flight, but the Flight Attendant \\"helped\\" me remember it.<br /><br />OK. I am stupified by these points:  Does a F-14 pilot \\"hang up\\" a radio?  Also, what is the fuel range of an F-14?  I'd say a bit less than 3000 miles, but lets just say they edited out the 10 mid-air refuelings.<br /><br />A post-primary candidate for President is surrounded by no-less than 100 aides at all times and is filmed by a pool camera 24 hours a day, not guided by a 23 year-old brainiac and there's no time to be meeting with shadowey people in a parking garage.  What's he running for? Town Council?  Also corporations can only give 5k max to candidates (through a PAC), not empty out their coffers.<br /><br />Usually a major publisher will also try to edit out well disproved urban ledgends disguised as \\"informed background\\" as in the Presidential Seal facing towards the arrows in time of war.<br /><br />What candidate would have a debate on CNN and agree to debate anyone other than the candidate?  They have marathon meetings to determine how many debates and the size of the stage, you think the challenger Candidate just shows up at CNN and doesn't know who's coming from the White House?<br /><br />God, the uninformed pablum of the unconstitutional writing:  NASA is a Federal budget; schools (except on Indian Reservations) are the province of the States.  THe Fed cannot spend a dime on them.  Arrrrgghhh.  In Mr. Brown's world, there also seems not to be a Congress, except for Saxton, as the budgets for NASA are always incresed by the President personnally and it seems he runs the country like a benevolent despot.<br /><br />I admit I read the next five pages more just to see what asinine things were coming next: Oh God, the career-minded, but stunning, National Intelligence Analyst is breifing the WHite House Staff, who somehow aren't loyal to their boss anymore because his polls are slipping.  Even Nixon's Aides cried when he resigned.  Give me a break.<br /><br />I think the \\"Deception\\" in the title is most likely the un-researched, poorly checked copy that somehow made it past the editors desk because of the first line on the cover \\"From the author of the Da Vinci Code\\"  Say no more.  It could have been nursery rhymes after that.  The funny part is that there are media flaks on this website flogging this book for all its' worth.<br /><br />I am officially stopping on page 163 just to keep my sanity.  Oh, look, American Airlines has an article about turtles that I've already read twice.

B000B0WODA|4.0|You Could Have It So Much Better~ Franz Ferdinand is a nice straightforward rock album with simple yet effective lyrics and a sound that one has heard many a time indeed. I love the dance beats to this album and I really like the beats. I love the simple yet effective book-let. I love the photos and the cover art has a nice throw back feeling to it. I like how the lyrics are displayed and the idea for them to look like they were written in a notebook was a stroke of genius. \\"Do you want to\\" is a stroke of genius and the rest of the album is really nice. Highly recommended indeed.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|Rob Zombie is comfortable and secure with himself. Even in the movies, after House of 1000 Corpses, he went at it again with The Devil's Rejects. And now we've got Educated Horses, not remarkably different from The Sinister Urge or Hellbilly Deluxe - maybe some. It's just another dark - yet fun at the time - rock n' roll album Zombie Style. He sticks to musical and lyrical formulas, not switching up enough to alienate long-time fans, nor does the album sound exactly like the others. After all, on this one, he keeps mentioning Educated Horses on different songs. Not sure what that means, but it's fun to pick it out.<br /><br />Zombie only puts albums out every five years or so, and though this album is fairly short, it has enough quality music to enjoy until his next project.
4789007758|5.0|Everytime I am confused about an element of Japanese grammar I consult this reference book and I always walk away satisfied with all my questions answered. The translations are fantastic, the example sentences are chosen to clearly demonstrate the grammar point, and different usages are explained. What I like most is that this book takes varying English translations of the grammar point and shows how they are conceptually connected, so that you only have to remember the one grammar point rather than memorizing a bunch of seemingly different English translations. <br /> <br />I hope to be a Japanese teacher in the future, and I'll be keeping this book by my side at all times.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|So many people that I know have stopped themselves from seeing this movie because of the hot-button issue it presents to its viewers.  But honestly, get over it.  This is such a beautifully done movie, from the transcription of the short story to the silver screen to the expansive shots. Such a little thing as the word \\"gay\\" should never stop anyone from seeing this.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger's since A Knight's Tale, but I wasn't so much of a fan of Jake Gyllenhall's till I saw this.  Their acting is absolutely superb, and came completely from the heart.  They were each very expressive, and I didn't even feel as though I was watching a movie--I felt like I was right there with them, experiencing what they felt.<br /><br />It doesn't matter that they are both men.  It's love--we've all felt it before, in one way or another.  It's heartbreaking, it's wonderful, and it's impossible to live without, and this movie shows that rollercoaster ride perfectly.<br /><br />I enjoy watching westerns too, and I don't think that this destroyed any of the wonderful history that westerns have.  That's such a closed-minded way to think.  Rather, I think this movie paid homage to westerns and cowboys alike--I have a new respect for how tough real cowboys are, after seeing the work these two ranch hands had to accomplish for practically no pay!  This movie by no means tries to express that all cowboys are gay.<br /><br />All in all, this is a heart warming story that's wonderfully told and done.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about after reading the short story--while I thought the story was good, I never thought it could be retold this well on the silver screen.  Honestly one of the best \\"book-to-movie\\" flicks I've ever seen.  Great casting, believable acting and breathtaking shots.  Don't miss this one.  It's beautiful.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album did not do it for me when I first bought it, but like and good album: the more I listen to it, the better it gets.  The variations from track to track, and the enigmatic lyrics leave you humming and pondering for hours!
6305971935|5.0|I am very disappointed with this movie \\"The Philadelphia Experiment\\" that have no English subtitles, due to my deafness. I was planning to buy this DVD. <br /> <br />I have seen it many times in late 1980s and have been waiting for the English subtitles since.
0307010856|5.0|1) as a parent this is very fun to read and produces many giggles from the kids <br /> <br />2) fun story line with a purpose:  It helps children realize that not all fears have a foundation and can sometimes be laughed at when they are exposed. <br /> <br />3) nonpredictable ending

B00006SFBD|3.0|First off I would like to say that I am a huge Opeth fan not just some Opeth hater trying to be funny.  I own all of Opeth's other albums and they are all excellent.  I was excited when I purchased this album because it was the one to complete my collection and I heard from others that it was one of their best.  Honestly, I've tried to like this CD so much, if anything, just because it's from Opeth.  But everytime I listen this CD I just can't get into it.  Mikael Akerfeldt's death growls in this CD remind me of those bands like Cannibal Corpse, Nile and other death metal bands whose vocals sound like deep pig grunts.  Also, the clean vocals on this album sound almost too clean and overly produced.  In quite a few of Opeth's songs in the past, Mikael and Peter (guitarists) have repeated riffs at appropriate times in the songs numerous times to give a very atmospheric and emotional feel to the music (ie. April Ethereal, Black Rose Immortal, Moonlapse Vertigo) and the result has turned Opeth's songs into something truly special.  However, in \\"Deliverance\\" these sections aren't atmospheric at all and the many times I have listened the CD still hasn't been very emotion-inspiring.  I suggest you buy this CD though, because everyone else seems to enjoy it so much.
0440224764|5.0|I loved this book, it was a real page-turner, right up until the end.  I never saw it coming and found it a terrible ending for such a fascinating story.  I found Patrick a very likeable character and was hoping that everything would work out for him.  But the last few pages of the book just left me with my mouth hanging open.  I wish I hadn't read the ending, I had a much better ending in mind with Patrick and Eva having 12 children and living happily ever after.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! At the Disco's Album A fever You can't Sweat out is a very well Put together Album. It has Dance Driven Rock songs that are unlike anything out there right now. It is 13 tracks of solid gold songs. Each song you can't help but to tap your feet or bounce your head to. Panic's sound is like a hybrid of Rock/dance/30's style big band and they pull it off very well. After hearing each song you will want to learn all the words and you won't be able to get them out of your head. The lead singers voice is awesome, the lyrics are awesome, and the songs are extremely catchy. To be honest I had bought this cd in mid february of 2006 and it is in constant rotation. I can't stop listening to it. Buy this cd you will not be dissapointed. One last note they sound nothing like Fall Out Boy. First off the lead singer from Panic sings better than the lead singer from fall out boy. Secondly the music is completely different the way the songs are sung and how the music sounds is different. Check out this cd.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Book was better than the movie and I can understand what Cussler is boiling about.  The final product is not what was agreed upon.  The screenwriter did not read the book, he just threw scenes together and thought they would pan out.  The book worked and the movie stunk!

When he has mechanical problems with the car he is driving in the Monaco Grand Prix and crashes the car, the team owner fires him. He tries to get another ride but other team owners are leery of him. Eventually Honda signs him to race one of his cars. Extremely exciting racing photography and one of the very best racing movies. I highly recommend this movie to all racing fans. Good story, good acting, and wonderful cars..!! A true CLASSIC..!! <br />For those who like racing movies, \\"LeMans\\" with Steve McQueen is an excellent movie, too. Hopefully \\"The Racers\\" with Kirk Douglas will be released soon, too.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|There is an argument that short stories adapt to the screen better than novels. Maybe it gives more space for invention. I'm thinking of the two 'Mountain' movies and how leaden the translation of,'Cold Mountain' was compared to this superlative work.Both were based on fictions by writers I admire, though,'Brokeback' never suggested movie treatment to me, or even stood out in Proulx's,'Close Range' collection. But this is to possibly slight Ang Lee whose work is consistently more subtle and extensive than Menghalis's. For one thing, the mountain itself has a prominent and passionate place in Lee's telling.The curdling movement of the sheep flocks over the rugged terrain are suggestive of the swelling undercurrents of feeling that break between the two shepherds during their few months of exposure on the mountain. Ledger comes of age in this movie; brooding and slouched, angling a convincing mid-western drawl from one corner of his mouth with the repressed passion of a pit bull. Again, Lee's genius is to be applauded for how he's maximised Ledger's limitations.The women get the rough end of the stick (no pun intended)and the Amazon reviewer is spot on about McMurtry's hand in all of this as there is a pervading ambience of his,'Last Picture Show'. Wonderful flick!

B000001E18|4.0|I for one think experimentation is a good thing. Being safe and doing the same thing over and over is boring. Of course, being different is not synonymous with being good, but Zooropa is good in many spots.      I give it 4 stars for tracks 2-5 and The First Time, which alone are worth the price of admission. The rest of the album is throwaway. They're not necessarily bad songs (with the exception of Some Days Are Better Than Others-which is almost unlistenable. \\"Your skin is white but you think you're a brother\\" is the best line in the song. I rest my case.) just mediocre and unmemorable.    Zooropa is okay, but I don't like the German language that is being spoken.    Dirty Day has good music and pretty good lyrics, but somehow it just doesn't grab you like you feel it should.     Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car also has good techno flavor, but the lyrics don't hold up their end of the bargain.    As far as The Wanderer is concerned, if I want to listen to Johnny Cash, I'll buy a Johnny Cash album. I buy U2 to listen to U2.     As far as the 5 I like. They're EXCELLENT. Lemon and Stay are in my Top Ten of U2's best songs of all time.     I love Lemon for that r&b flavor and techno beat, plus hearing Bono sing in falsetto is a refreshing change.     Stay is good just because it is. I can't explain it.     Babyface is cute. I really like the nursery rhyme sound mixed with the heavy beat that drives the music.    In Numb I don't particularly like The Edge's lyrics, but the music and Bono's back up singing more than accomodate for the asinine word speech. I also think this is one of Larry's better drumming jobs.    The First Time is a song of hope, but at the same time, sounds hopeless. Really sad and good. \\"But I left by the backdoor and I threw away the key...for the first time, I feel love.\\" It could almost bring a tear to your eye.    U2's earlier great work should have bought them a little patience and understanding from their fans during this experimentation period. It's sort of like sticking with a coach during the bad years because that same coach led you to a championship during the good years. Success buys leeway, and I applaud U2 for their guts to try something new even when they don't always hit the mark.

B00005JOE8|5.0|If you cherish democracy, or if you mistakenly believe you still live  in one, this film is a must-see. V for Vendetta is spot-on regarding  the dark years of the United States: 2001 to 2009.    Although set in  England, it covers all the bases: using religion to suppress any  objective thinking in the masses; widespread surveillance of individual  citizens; rampant misinformation and lies from the government; faux  terrorism and fear used by the government to control its own people;  and the irony that the powers that be actually profit directly from the  result of said terrorism (in this case, it's pharmaceutical companies  profiting from bio-terror attacks, rather than oil companies  benefiting from Middle East turmoil).    And finally, the film reminds us  that it's the duty of all us to oppose tyranny, and governments like  those of George W. Bush. Bravo to the Wachowski brothers for a  selflessly political film aiming to safeguard our freedom.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|It should be no surprise Emmylou Harris' angelic voice blends perfectly with the gruff rumble of Mark Knopfler's. If you've heard her great duo with similarly bassoed country artist Don Williams on Townes Van Zandt's elegant \\"If I Needed You,\\" you could anticipate the perfect fit. And anyway, Emmylou's voice blends with everyone's. She is not only one of the most sought after duet partners in country music, but an iconic soloist who is on the short list of all time country greats.  <br /> <br />In a time when Nashville demands you are only as good as your last video, she is no Emmylou come lately. When one recent female country artist cut her first album and was asked of her goals for the disk, she replied: \\"I just wanted to do something that wouldn't embarrass me in front of Emmylou Harris.\\" Or as Knopfler himself put it during their release day appearance on Imus in the Morning, \\"When Emmylou sings a song, it stays sung.\\" <br /> <br />Knopfler is a talented songwriter and an elegant guitar artist with a distinctive musical tone and style that, if described in literary terms, might be dubbed \\"Hemingwayesque.\\" Just as Papa never used ten words when one perfectly chosen one would do, so too with Knopfler's guitar work. Knopfler's taste and economy is recognizable whether gunning out \\"Sultans of Swing\\" with Dire Straits or \\"Wild Theme\\" from his sound track of \\"Local Hero.\\" <br /> <br />In other words these individually brilliant artists flat out define good taste and talent performing together.  <br /> <br />Fittingly, \\"All the Roadrunning\\" does not up and shout at you, but comes at you with a quiet confidence. It is flash-free, as understated and tasteful as its participants. No one is showing off here, these are artists plying their craft. And just how good  that craft is may sneak up on you. We've had the title tune and \\"This Is Us\\" available as early teases--they may be the two most commercial tunes on the disk. No matter, MK and EH \\"filler\\" is better than most artists \\"A\\" Material.  <br /> <br />As I keep playing the disk, I find new treats within. This is very, very good stuff, the 15-year-old single malt you keep in the back of the bar. It respects your intelligence and taste. It will never pounce on you like an overeager puppy. It expects you to find it, and find it you will. <br /> <br />One minor issue. Knopfler wrote all but the two songs Emmylou penned. And while most are very good, Emmylou has become a world-class songwriter herself, and I'd have liked to have heard more songs written by her.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, while her \\"Love and Happiness\\" is touching, the biggest goose bumps come from Knopfler's \\"If This is Goodbye.\\" It is a stand-alone love song, a seemingly sweet and innocent ballad that could be a lover bidding a tentative farewell when romance  ends. The narrator is still in love, you think, his love object ready to walk away. Pretty standard stuff for love songs, particularly of the country variety.  <br /> <br />But as Knopfler has explained, that is not the topic. \\"The famous last words\\" that \\"could never tell the story\\" were inspired not by fading love but by the last phone calls from the World Trade Center left on message machines. In that context, and sung by these artists, it is haunting.   <br /> <br />This is a treasure of an album, one that can stand up not only to the ages, but to the very high standards the artists who recorded it have set for themselves.

B000DZIGDU|1.0|I started with high hopes for this movie, but quickly found the characters to be nothing like any Marine I have known.  The movie seems to purposeful portray marines as stupid, unorganized, unable to work together, without any purpose, regularly making mistakes that kill others, and then being losers when they finally get out of the military.  At the end, there are simply no redeeming aspects of this movie.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you're looking for straight-forward guitar rock that follows the 'verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus' formula then move on. If however you're looking for an album to TRANSPORT you to a fascinating if frightening place, then get hold of a copy of 'Kid A', slip on the headphones and close your eyes. The first true classic album of the 21st century, 'Kid A' may come across as ugly and confrontational on first listen but repeated listens opens you up to some fascinating songs and astonishing sounds. I love the album from beginning to end including the spaced out instrumental 'Treefingers'!<br />Highlights for me are the title track and Morning Bell's combination of pretty melodies and complex drum-patterns, the exquisite 'How To Disappear Completely' and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' along with the dark dance-influenced sounds of 'The National Anthem' and 'Idioteque'. 'Optimistic' is just as powerful as anything from 'The Bends' album.<br />Along with some exceptional album sleeve artwork, this is my favourite Radiohead album!
B000EQH2QK|5.0|I have been a Shakira fan since I was 14 years old with her smash hit album \\"Pies Descalzos\\".  This album reminded me alot of \\"Pies Descalzos\\".  At first, some of the songs were too slow and too deep in thought for me to actually sit there and listen to it like the song \\"Dreams for Plans\\" and \\"Illegal\\", but then, the more I listened, the more I enjoyed it.  There are so many themes and interpretations of these songs.  It is like an indepth novel which has many interpretations.  It's not a fun, catchy album like \\"Laundry Service\\"  so you actually have to read into the song to enjoy it.  It is exceptionally well written and creative!   <br /> One thing I don't like is when she translates a song that she created in Spanish to English, such as \\"Someday\\" and \\"Day and the Time\\".  These were beautiful in Spanish but horrible in English!  My opinion, if you are looking for a clubby fun CD this is not the one for you.  If you look to read into the music, then you will enoy this album.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Is there anything Emmylou Harris can't make better?<br /><br />I liked Dire Straits and all (the song, \\"Brothers In Arms\\" ranks very high on my all time favorite list) - but Knopfler's solo work has never resonated with me.  But seeing the two on a project together, there was no way not to purchase.  It's like pizza:  even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. And good it is.<br /><br />`Roadrunning' has Knopfler's trademark guitar work and Harris' unmistakable vocals (actually Knopfler's too). After hearing the first part of the first (and very good) track, I was worried that it would be all-Knopfler w/backing vocals by Harris, but it's not the case.  Ok, sometimes it's the case - but sometimes it's the reverse. They definately compliment each other.<br /><br />All of the songs Some of Harris' material (or the songs she has primary vocals) could have easily been on `Red Dirt Girl' or `Wrecking Ball' (\\"Rollin' On\\" and \\"Right Now\\"). \\"Love and Happiness\\" and \\"Belle Starr\\" is traditional Emmylou, and I think not only b/c Harris has writing credit on those songs.<br /><br />There are mediocre points and I won't win any point with this, but these include \\"This is Us\\" and \\"If This is Goodbye\\".  I find myself wanting the two to harmonize more - but it seems to be co-melody singing throughout most of the disk.<br /><br />For me, the absolute highlight is \\"I Dug Up a Diamond\\".  Some of Knopfler's vocal phrasing is out of character and it works well for him. It is one place they actually harmonize.  Had more of the album been like this - it would have easily been a 5-star release.
B000001FZK|5.0|to tell u the truth when i bought laughing stock it took me sometime to understand why this album is a masterpiece. <br />looking back ,talk talk was a synth pop band duran duran style with good enough songs , but their change in direction came in colour of spring another masterpiece i mean they took milestones from ,its my life, their departure in sound was 360 change of sound and direction. <br />then spirit of eden came, another departure in sound from colour of spring another truly masterpiece. <br />mark hollis created music a mix of free jazz on acid, and rock <br />so dark that is beautiful probably one of the best albums all time
0679431748|5.0|Christopher Buckley's book about the art of lobbying, Big Tobacco, pompous US Senators and all that passes for life in Washigton is a wonderful satire which has now been made into a more than passable movie, however as usual, the book still prevails.     I have read all of his books and enjoyed each and every one. He treads on some toes that need treading on, he pokes fun at Washington institutions that can stand more poking and is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Unless you have been caught up in the Us and Them mentaility of what passes for politics these days, you will enjoy this irreverend look at people and institutions which take themseves far too seriously these days.

Wings, join hands, and America will soar as the nightingale and have strength of the gorilla. <br />I urge you, end the controversy.  Learn to live together.  Love one another, for we are all children of the earth and beloved by Gaya.   <br />United we can achieve anything.  We can live eternally in happiness and never look back.   <br />Love can make it happen. <br />No longer will we fight over Hollywood fluff like V for Vendetta.  The movies we make will have complex, interesting stories and well-drawn characters, as opposed to the stereotypes we see in this tired plotline more stolen from than influenced by 1984.  Our movies will be fun and exciting crowd-pleasers, not preachy soap boxes meant to enrage their viewers.  And we'll understand that while peace in society is good, it makes for very boring cinema, therefore our characters will face several inner and outer conflicts as they pursue their noble goals.  That's not how it is in V for Vendetta.  Will our characters achieve their goals?  You have to see our movies to find out! <br />V for Vendetta is not a good movie.  If you agree with everything it says, it's still not a good movie.  It's poorly directed and even more poorly written.  Natalie Portman is not a good actress.  The only thing she was good in was The Professional.  Not Star Wars, not Where the Heart Is, and not V for Vendetta.       <br />Our movies won't be like that.  We'll hire only the best directors, writers, and actors.   <br />So Liberals and Conservatives, come together as one, and we'll make our own movies.  It will be our Utopia.

0767827791|4.0|Even though I agree this 1955 movie has moments of silly excess (just look at the DVD cover), I'm still surprised how there seems to be a backlash by contemporary critics against the film for being dated melodrama. That's exactly the reason why I find this film so entertaining, for the Baroque-level elements provide a dramatic resonance to the most mundane of settings, the Labor Day picnic in a small Kansas town during the Eisenhower era. Into this insulated cornbelt hamlet comes Hal Carter, a swaggering drifter looking to connect with his old college buddy Alan for a job. His natural, testosterone-fueled charisma attracts all the women, including Alan's girlfriend Madge Owens. Contrary to her repressed mother's nagging wishes to marry into Alan's wealthy family, Madge becomes drawn to Hal much to the disapproval of most of the town. Spinster schoolteacher Rosemary Sidney rents a room in the Owens house, but she is desperately aching for her reluctant suitor Howard Bevans to marry her. Madge's little sister Millie tires of living in her beautiful sister's shadow and solicits Hal's attention, and kindly neighbor Mrs. Potts is the only one who sees Hal as the positive life force he wants to be.<br /><br />The movie begs for Douglas Sirk or Elia Kazan to commandeer it with individualistic style, but direction is left in the hands of Joshua Logan, who directed the stage version on Broadway. Logan has a tendency toward focusing on the obvious in his films (\\"Sayonara\\", \\"South Pacific\\"), but he certainly captures the latent passions that drive screenwriter Daniel Taradash's florid adaptation of William Inge's play. The rural look of the film feels right, and James Wong Howe's stellar cinematography has a lot to do with that. Another contributing factor to the film's success is George Duning's familiar, Bernstein-like music score with its soaring string arrangements. The acting is uniformly strong even if the casting is less than ideal in some cases. In a role that should have ideally gone to Brando at his prime, William Holden is at least a decade too old as Hal (the actor admitted as much afterward) and a bit too haggard-looking to be the subject of such swooning. However, he conveys the empty bravado of his character with conviction.<br /><br />Even though she overacts during her drunken scene, Rosalind Russell is unafraid to show the deep-seeded loneliness and innate vulgarity in Rosemary. It's a masterful performance that repels at the same time. In her first leading role, a well-cast Kim Novak manages to show Madge's insecurity in a most affecting manner especially toward the end. Her mating dance with Holden to the strains of \\"Moonglow\\" under the Chinese lanterns is still one of the most sensual scenes in movies. In fact, their chemistry is key in overcoming the contrived hurdle of believing their characters would fall for each other over the course of one day. Effective in smaller roles are Arthur O'Connell as Howard (his heartbreaking scenes with Russell provide a sharp counterpoint to the blooming romance of the young lovers), Betty Field as Madge's mother Flo, a sympathetic Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts, a young Cliff Robertson as Alan, and an even younger Susan Strasberg as Millie. I have to admit the last ten minutes of the film always get to me for its overt romanticism. The 2000 DVD contains a decent print of the film and a gallery of stills from the film set to the music score.lly gone to Brando at his prime, William Holden is at least a decade too old as Hal (the actor admitted as much afterward) and a bit too haggard-looking to be the subject of such swooning.

B0009I7NNA|2.0|I've been a huge A7X fan since I heard their album \\"Waking the Fallen\\", which in my opinion is one of the best metalcore albums in the past few years, so naturally I was extremely excited when I heard that they were coming out with a major lable debut, I went out and bought \\"City of Evil\\" the day that it came out, I eagerly ran out to my car and put it in my cd player. The first song on the cd, \\"Beast and a Harlot\\" made for a promising start, but after that, the cd got progressivley worse and worse and by the fifth song, I could take it no more, I ejected the disc and haven't listened to it since.  My personal opinion is that \\"City of Evil\\" is a huge letdown, a majority of the people that I have talked to all say the same thing: The album just plain sucks. If you even try to compare this album with any of their previous effort, then you'll realize that there is none. Avenged Sevenfold have gone soft on us, if you're looking for anything good by them, buy \\"Waking the Fallen\\".
B000EHQ8AU|2.0|AHA, I have finally deduced that the new Placebo album is a true disappointment.  As I found earlier most of the songs just feel...fake.  Phoney.  And if you watch the documentary on the DVD (oh my --  about a whole 10 minutes long!) everything they say sounds scripted; it's like they want you to believe that they have evolved and their music will reflect that.  Well their music does reflect it -- it reflects the absence of most of what they once were: glam-rock antagonistic youth (for lack of a better description... i'm obviously not a music or english major).  There's even a point in the DVD where they talk about this album being the \\"death of nancy boy\\"; \\"NO!\\" don't kill nancy-boy... nancy-boy is what made you Placebo, and this change -- albeit they still have talent, more than most -- this change in image/sound will turn-away the fans that have loved them the longest.  Or at least will turn us away from their newer music (mostly anyway). <br /> <br />I will say only 4 songs on the 13 track Meds (actually 14 including the \\"bonus\\" instrumental on the dvd) are worth replaying (along-side almost ALL of their previous music): Follow the Cops Back Home, Pierrot the Clown, One of a Kind, and In the Cold Light of Morning (in my humble opinion). <br /> <br />There were others I originally liked when I first heard the album, but after repeated listening they started to annoy me -- like pin-pricks at certain points in the songs.  Those 4 above are the only exceptions. <br /> <br />Now most people would say 4 really good songs on one CD makes for a good album.  Well... not when its Placebo.  Placebo's previous 4 albums had each maybe 2-3 songs on them that I WOULDN'T want to repeatedly listen to.  This album is thus the complete opposite -- it is the death of nancy-boy.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I'll be brief.  The CD opens OK, \\"Island\\" is very good.  But that's about the end of the nice things to say.  The third track is unlistenable. Pure fluff.  The rest of the album is background music.  Like outtakes from 'Division Bell' or 'Momentary..'  I am a Floyd fan, and like David Gilmour's first two albums.  But his song writing skills are weak.  Nothing on the par with Roger Waters'. The songs on this album go no-where. \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" where melodic songs as well, but they evolved and the music took you along for the ride.  'On an Island' is mood music.  Not recommended!!
B0008ISM40|5.0|I won't leave a long review but I felt I had to write something in support of this album. As you all know, the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it. The 1990's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene. I was born in 65.  <br />I don't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves. In a world that's pumping out cr@p music. It's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry isn't totaly going down the toilet. <br />A quick rundown: <br />-Best song is #8  <br />-Excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 <br />-Song #2 and #5 are still ok <br />-Songs 3,5,7 are just average. <br />Overall the album has excellent flow, ie. the hit songs aren't the first on the album.  <br />-Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album.  <br />I hope NIN will continue. We need to purchase albums like this to show Trent R. that we appreciate his work. <br />PS. Keep a look out for the new TOOL CD out in a few days. I've heard it(don't ask) and it is their best ever! A must buy. <br />-R <br />
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I just rented this movie today, I've been dying to see it, but I wanted to wait for the english dub, at last it's here!  After watching the whole movie from begining to end, here's what I have to say...  The english dub exceeded my expectations! Yes, the voice acting is actually good! I was afraid that they might screw up the character's voices, but luckily, they didn't!  The story is a little bit lacking, but with FFVII as a big part of the story it would be hard to fit much more story in without making it very long. The story is pretty straight forward, 3 grey-haired guys show up asking where their mother is, (they're Sephiroth's brothers looking for Jenova.) A disease called Geostigma is making the population sick, and Cloud has to fight those 3 grey-haired guys.  All of the characters from FFVII are in this movie, they were all done very well except for Cid... First of all they made him too young, he looks like a teen when in FFVII he was in his late 30's. He's also overly American-looking, and get this... He has a Texan acsent, and not just an ordinary one, it's way too strong so he sounds like a hick! That was very disappointing to me... All of the others are okay though.  The graphics for this movie are nothing short of breath taking! You have to watch it for a second before you realize that the characters aren't real people! You can actually see the fabric that makes up the Character's clothes! (FyI, I dont have an HD TV.) Everything looks great!    Pros:  Barret, Cloud, Cid, Tifa, Red 13, Cait Sith, Vincent, and Yuffie are all back and better looking than ever!  The CGI graphics for this movie are excellant, and very real-looking!  You finally get some closure to the FFVII story, which I feel it despretly needed.  All the characters are well represented, and remain true to their respective personalities.  Some of the Limit Breaks make an appearence in this movie!  There's an option to view a mini movie which shows cut scenes that show you in retrospective what happened in FFVII.  This movie has a great ending, and a happy one at that!      Cons:   The story is kinda simple and straight forward, there isn't much depth to it.  Some scenes in this movie are a little corney... In one scene Weapon starts attacking people, and all of the characters show up out of nowhere to fight it. (Justice Legue assemble!!!)  They totally wrecked Cid by making him look and talk the way that he does. Honestly, they've turned him into a regular Whitey Mc'cracker! (Thankfully, Zack & Aeris weren't...)  Sephiroth's brothers are real moma's boys! They're always crying over stuff and whining for their mommy. When you watch Sepiroth's bros fighting with Cloud and the others, in the scene celections menu you'd imagine the scene to be titled, \\"Battle of the overly sensitive grey-haired people\\".  This movie's story is very depressing, if it weren't for the comic relief provided by Reno & Rude, this movie would be almost unwatchable.    Overall: All things considered, this movie is actually pretty good, and when you compare it to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, it's a masterpiece!   I plan on buying a copy for myself once I have the money.   As funny as this is going to sound, I recomend renting it before you buy it, but if you're confident that you're going to enjoy it, then go ahead and buy it first.   For Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, I give this movie 3 and 3/4 Stars!    Final thoughts: While some people say that you should just buy the original subtitled version, I think that you should buy this one. If you buy the subtitled version then you cant watch it in English, but if you buy this version you can either watch it in Japanese with English subtitles or you can just plain watch it in English. Besides, if you buy this version then you have the option to view it both ways and see which way best suits you.  If you own a PSone or PS2 I recomend playing the game too!
B00005JOE8|5.0|<br />Actually I am so pissed off because of the \\"right-wing\\" reviews and that's the main reason that I am writing so that I can contribute to the rating of the movie. I won't even bother arguing with those stereotype right-wing reviewers coz I know that I can't change their mind. Stereo in greek means \\"solid\\" for their information. Solid like rock or stone you know. So there is no sense in trying to write for pages trying to convince those guys that this movie is just great. They r strero types, solid types, hard to change and it costs a lot for them to feel anything. Ironically the movie is really making fun of those types in the first place in a very brilliant way. To make those sterotypes as annoyed as myself I am thinking of getting some fake reviewer ids and get logged on and rate this movie with 5 stars for several times.  <br /> <br />I recommend all open-minded people this movie which helps us to understand the world of today better. Especially Valerie's letter in the movie written in prison is soo touching and emotional.  <br /> <br />The moviescript in the whole movie is so great and it is so brilliantly written. <br /> <br />The music is great. Especially it corresponds to the feelings of the characters so well. Best you can see it while Valerie's letter is read. <br /> <br />I could write more and more, but in the end I would say the same: A great movie always to remember. Thanks to everyone who contributed to its creation.
B000068CNX|4.0|The second season of Friends is still not one of my all time favourite seasons. Yeah sure it has a lot of its memorable episodes, but at the same time it really didn't have that kind of bang when the first season arrived. Nevertheless I give this season set 3.5 Stars (it has to be 4).<br /><br />One thing I didn't enjoy about this season was the character Eddie, he stayed on the show for about 3 Episodes but it really just dragged. I didnt like the episodes where Joey and Chandler were seperated basically because of this Eddie guy. Anyway, he left and the show got back to normal.<br /><br />During this 1995-1996 season a huge Friends Backlash occured. Suddenly everybody got sick of them and hate websites were being made. This backlash I think kind of hurt the show in its Second Season.<br /><br />However, there are some good episodes, my Personal Top 5 Epsiodes Are:<br /><br />The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant<br /><br />The One With The Baby On The Bus<br /><br />The One With The List<br /><br />The One With The Prom Video<br /><br />The One With The Chicken Pox (Lol this has to be my favourite of Season 2, as I recently had chicken pox and can relate lol :P)<br /><br />Overall If you can only buy a few Friends Seasons I don't think its vital to purchase Season Two, definitley not the best out of the ten. However if you've got the money, got the time, or get it for free somehow...its not tooooooo bad.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The 2005 film version release of Jane Austen's timeles tale Pride and Prejudice does a far better job of representing the original novel than the old Laurence Olivier B&W version. It lacks the thoroughness of the A&E miniseries from the mid 1990s but fits admirably into a two hour time frame. <br /> <br />What struck me most about this version was the depth of the characters. Unlike the A&E rendition, these are all believeable people. The younger girls of the story especially portray characters of the maturity of someone at those ages. Although Kiera Knightly is not what I would picture as Miss Elizabeth Bennet, her skilled acting performance more than justified her selection for the role. In my opinion, she deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress. Tom Hollander as Charles Bingley is also terrific in his social affability yet someone young, naive and unsure of himself in matters of the heart. The characters of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were more believable while preserving their foibles intact. The elimination of inconsequential peripheral characters such as the Gardner children or Bingley's other sister and her husband contributed to a taut story. <br /> <br />The film is not without flaws. When Miss Elizabeth encounters Mr Darcy unexpectedly at Pemberley, he offers to escort her back to town. She declines, preferring to walk. The next, brief scene shows her doing just that. Lost in the shuffle are her aunt and uncle, who presumably would never have just left her stranded at Pemberley. Again toward the end of the movie, the climatic meeting of the hearts between the two protagonists rests on contrived and forced assumptions about Lady Catherine de Bourgh's visit to Longbourn. Perhaps the result of overzealous editing to fit into a two hour time frame (2:02 of actual story, with credits 2:09), their respective references to the offended Lady Catherine's tirade just does not fit terribly well. The filmakers would have done better to add a few more minutes to make the proper connections so that this crucial scene works better. <br /> <br />All in all, in my opnion this was one of the top two films produced in 2005. King Kong perhaps deserved more the Oscar for Best Picture (and won the British version of it) but Pride and Prejudice was a close second.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this.  I thought \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good.  But that was about it, as far as I was concerned.  It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released.  A bit surprisingly though, I thought \\"Hannibal\\" was really great once I finally did see it.  Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than \\"Silence...\\" (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally.  But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion.  Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster. <br /> <br />   The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter.  It seems like \\"Hannibal\\" has changed tract from \\"Silence\\" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves.  Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is.  Hannibal Lecter himself is,well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey.  His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around.  Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place.  One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness.  A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended).  <br /> <br />   Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling.  A very, very engaging and wel-made movie.
B000002I25|5.0|Call me a purist if you have to. But the Doors very first album, in my view, is the best they ever offered. From the first track to the last one, it's pure originality and the very defining sound of the Doors.<br /><br />There was some great stuff on subsequent albums -- L.A. Woman and Waiting for the Sun come to mind -- but as far as track by track greatness, \\"The Doors\\" is the one to keep in your car at all time.<br /><br />I love this CD. It's gritty and raw and it doesn't try to be too artistic. Tunes like Soul Kitchen, Whiskey Bar and 20th Century Fox are completely rocking and completely honest. There's ample introduction to Morrison's dark, brooding side in \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" \\"The End,\\" and \\"End of the Night.\\" This is a CD of many moods.<br /><br />The remaining Doors have released so many \\"greatest hits\\" style compilations, it's hard to remember today what is original and what was lumped together after Morrison's death. Each contains up to two dozen Doors hits from each album. It's good to have one or two of those for the long road trips, too. But to get into a genuine Doors mood, simplicity is the best route. Slap in \\"The Doors\\" hit play and break on through to the other side.
B0009P42SC|5.0|A movie that starts slow but good and builds to a massive scope of action and imagination, \\"Steamboy\\" is yet another example of how vast the field of anime has become.  Set in a London of 1866 just like the one in history books and set on the metaphorical eve of events that will change human history and cause the world to diverge from 'our' future.  Most of the movie's main characters are members of the Steam family (fourteenish-Ray Steam is the title character), and the father and grandfather of the family, away for years working in America, have discovered a method of harnessing steam power to far greater yields than anything ever seen in 'our' world.  This new technology puts the two against each other and starts the ball rolling toward the 1866 London Industrial Fair, and a sudden turning point in the world's history that occurs in a few hours of a single day.  Much of the movie is spent trying to decide which side one, as the viewer, wants to be on, what the true motivations of the various characters really are, and who is telling the truth about what.  As with the rest of the movie, this angle of uncertainty is very well done.  A tour-de-force of visual imagery and epic ideas, masterfully animated, this one in my opinion far outdoes director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous full-length anime \\"Akira\\".  One thing of special note: you'll want to stay for the full end credits and watch the background's changing stills-imagery for astonishing glimpses of the future world of \\"Steamboy\\", far more than enough to make a powerful case for a sequel as soon as possible.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I think I'll say what's on a lot of peoples' minds: \\"If they had released THIS instead of Spirits Within, they'd likely still be Square instead of Square Enix\\". <br /> <br />A very enjoyable film, that almost outlived its hype, thanks to delays in availability. Who cares, though? It's Final Fantasy 7! Cloud and Company back for more action and in breathtaking CGI as well. <br /> <br />This film brought the FF geek in me screaming back to life and it feels good. The visuals are great, of course, that seems to be Square's forte. The actual storytelling could be better, IMO, but then again they've got limited time to work with. With this much visual muscle, you almost HAVE to center on action, and leave other more dramatic plot threads (such as Cloud and Tifa's relationship) to doujinshi and perhaps an anime? (Did you see the the previews for Crisis Core? Sweet mercy!). <br /> <br />Casual sci-fi fans can appreciate this movie for its visuals and its trademark quirlk FF existentialist drama. FF fans will LOVE this.
1558216847|5.0|In 1939, the Third Reich invaded Poland. If you are looking for a book on the holocaust, then do not read this book. If you want to know the risks people will take to regain their freedom, then pick up this book and start reading a story of courage, will power, and determination. The author of this book was an officer in the Polish Cavalry but his greatest battle would not be fought in his own country. It would be fought in a Soviet Gulag where he and serveral other men decided to take a desperate gamble. I belive that it was Rudyard Kipling who wrote the following words. \\"He either fears his fate too much or thinks himself too small, who will not put it to the test to win or lose it all.\\" I doubt that the author of this book ever read those words when he and his friends chose to escape. With scant supplies and very little knowledge of what they were up against, they escaped from the Gulag to which they had been sentanced. They headed south because they knew that somewhere south of where they were, the Soviet Union ended and freedom would be their's when, and if, they crossed into another country. But this is not just a story of men willing ro risk their lives. It is a book that make the reader think about the choices we must make, the beliefs we cherish, and raw courage <br /> <br />I have read several review stating that this must be a fictional story. It is my belief that this not a work of fiction. I am a librarian and I checked the cataloging done by the Library of Congress. This book is cataloged as an autobiography. In addition, at the time it was first published, the record which could verify the author's claims would have been easily accessible, but I do not consider those facts the true test of this books validity. The proof is in the story told in this book. It is in the authors words. It is in the deep seated belief that you must be willing to take the greatest gamble on earth, to hold onto your beliefs and, ultimately, if you truly believe it, you mustbe willing to either live free or die.
006056251X|5.0|I read this book out of order and I was disappointed that I didn't start from the beginning.  I have since ordered the rest and pre-ordered the last.  I loved this book...  It was so sexy..  The story was fun and exciting..  The characters were people that I got to know pretty well.  I truly enjoyed reading this book and can't wait til I get the rest of my amazon order. <br />

B000E97Y6K|2.0|This is just a mediocre remake of an incredibly classic film. The original is one of the world's greatest films. They recreated 1933 NYC with new technology.....the real 1933 NYC is visible in the original movie. Very overrated film. Perhaps I expoected too much. The 18 inch rubber Kong doll used in the original was more intimidating.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill is a riot of color, music, action, plot and character.  Tarantino takes you on an amazing ride that beats just about any other action movie ever made.  And with stars like these, how could he go wrong.  The animated sequence is just genius, and oh! Uma Thurman!  Her performance and presence is overwhelmingly wonderful.  Whoever doesn't like this doesn't have red blood streaming through their veins!
B00004R99F|5.0|Man this movie is one of the best movies ever made. I am so glad that Disney made it. It always makes me feel better and plus it has the best song in the world on it. It is \\"Stand Out!\\" It relates exactly to me!!!
B000063DIH|3.0|Some great songs, some weak songs...how to decide? 5 stars? Nope. 1 star? No way! Any reasonable rock fan would realise that this album is a mixed bag and judge it accordingly. I personally happen to enjoy listening to this album in it's entirety, even if I know that not all the songs are great though. Is it worth buying? I think it is.
B00003CWTI|5.0|After watching Capote, I found myself on a Philip Seymour Hoffman kick. Having enjoyed his performance in Boogie Nights, along with the rest of the film, I decided to watch Magnolia. <br /> <br />I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Magnolia has one of the most interesting openers a movie has ever had. An opener that warns us that coincidence and fate have a peculiar method of showing themselves sometimes. <br /> <br />And that's the theme of the movie. This movie presents us characters, who are in some way connected to one another, either by family means, personality traits, or just fate and coincidence. <br /> <br />I came into this move just for Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting skills. I was rewarded with that and so much more. <br /> <br />Every performance done in this movie are performances to be admired. Yes, even Tom Cruise's. <br /> <br />Tom has been getting a lot of bad press lately, but don't let that affect your judgement in watching this movie. In fact, you won't care about Tom Cruise's mishaps, you'll care about Frank T. J. Mackey's. <br /> <br />I believe Tom does his best performance in this movie. One scene in particular, Tom shows was he's capable of in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br />And the rest of this great cast all have their moments to shine. John C. Reilly as a down on his luck cop, Jason Robards as a dying tv. show producer with a lot of regret, his wife, played by Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall as the TV host with a skeleton's in his closet, William H. Macey as the run down old game show quiz kid, and Jeremy Blackman as the new game show quiz kid. <br /> <br />Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderful follow-up to Boogie Nights has been overlooked by many.  <br /> <br />And that's a shame. <br /> <br />What happens towards the end of the movie is worth the price alone.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|As a fan of Avenged Sevenfold I had along awaited the arivel of City of Evil. Hailed as their break out album this is what launched them into main stream but i will admit when i heard Beast and the harlot i didn't think i would like the new cd. It wasn't what i was use to hearing but i went out and got the cd. <br /> <br />The one thing I noticed about City of Evil was how it had an almost Guns and Roses feel. This is heavely heard on track 5 (Trashed and Scattered. <br /> <br />There isn't a single song i hate on this cd. From Beast and the harlot all the way to MIA. There is no bad song on this cd. It is a great cd by an awesome band and any true A7x fan should not be without this cd
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana were a legendary band, and this is arguably their best album. An ideal introduction to the band, or some great listening if you're already into them. This is the album that boosted Nirvana to super-stardom, and planted their feet in rock history. A must-have for all lovers of alternative rock.
B0000714B5|3.0|First, let me say that after having read Hesse's Siddhartha many times, I am at least grateful that someone made an attempt to bring this moving novel to cinema. With the special effects we have today and an all star cast it could have been spectacular. However, even with a limited budget, I think this film could have been better. As other reviewers have pointed it, the movie came across as being \\"emotionally flat.\\" Also, because some important parts of Hesse's book were left out of the film, the movie seems choppy in places. For instance, when Siddhartha decided to leave the Samanas, he was challenged by the leader whom he bested at his own game. Another important scene that film neglected to show, was after Siddhartha's failed suicide attempt (which, itself, could have been portrayed better)when Govinda came upon him and didn't immediately recognize him, but sat by his side until he awoke. And there were many other important omissions as well, some of which could have been fixed with an accompanying internal dialog. If you have read Hesse's novel, you might enjoy the film, but if you haven't you will probably find this film puzzling at best.
B0000033P2|5.0|Until I got it back, I hadn't realized how much I missed this essential Emerson, Lake, & Palmer classic meld of classical, rock and bizarro country (one expects Sam Elliott's deep \\"Beef, it's what's for dinner\\" at one point.) I have the LP, and am waiting until the technology gets a little better before buying one of those handy-dandy all-in-ones that will record my LPs to CDs. So, as I said in the review of another of my gone-too-long favorites, Jerry Jeff Walker's *Viva Terlingua* (I'm not anything if not eclectic!) ain't Modern Technology wonderful? Those old fashioned turn-tables just jumped and scratched all over the place when one tried to play a record whilst driving the pick up truck! except now I'm out of the 57 GMC pickup truck and into my lovely little Ford Escape SUV Hybrid with a CD player and some lady in the dashboard who tells me when I'm on the wrong path. Some things change, but this ELP is still addictive.  And Wow! There's new songs on here! a march a la Dragnet! (Actually just new-to-me because, with the vinyl, I never played the B side :-)/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
B000E6UK5K|5.0|well, I got only five minutes to write this review.  Im in the post office and I have my car doors unlocked, or is it locked?? oh! Im so worried I may get robbed...oh me, oh my.  WAIT...lets take a deep breath...(one, two, three...) ok, i can do this...here goes: <br /> <br />I love this album.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable cd. I have listend to it and then played Meddle afterwords, and really liked the two of them back to back.  Cool mix.  Gilmour still has some great chops.  Liked his vocals too...good slack key, slide style playing on a few songs.  Everything is intermixed with alot of David's signature Floyd blues like rock soloing.  Also has a  little Brian Wilson feel to it in the more mellow personal parts. But thats a plus not a minus.  Certain songs do rock, but just not the whole album. some tender parts in places, just piano, or some orchestration, harmonica.  <br /> <br />If people should read my other reviews you will see I dont get too worried when a performer or group goes off in a new/different direction...but with this release, it still sounds like Gilmour and his Floyd influences, just with alot of new folkish and slightly techno sounds also incorporated.  I think it all comes of very very good, very integrated feel, sound, and lyrical imagery (oh man do I sound like a grad student? I guess I am, but I hate being so obnoxious about it:)) <br /> <br />...as far as the atheism comment mentioned by one reviewer, Im a Catholic Christian, pretty conservative I might add, but I didnt get an \\"atheistic\\" vibe from the song \\"this heaven,\\" at all. In fact, in my opinion, I find the song's lyrics very spiritually comforting based on my beliefs.  for instance when David says (pardon the long quote, but I find the whole song quite beautiful) <br /> <br />(Gilmour/Gilmour - Samson)  <br /> <br />All the pieces fall into place  <br />When we walk these fields  <br />And I reach out to touch your face  <br />This earthly heaven is enough for me  <br /> <br />So break the bread and pour the wine  <br />I need no blessings but I'm counting mine  <br />Life is much more than money buys  <br />When I see the faith in my children's eyes  <br /> <br />I've felt the power in a holy place  <br />And wished for comfort when in need  <br />Now I'm here in a state of grace  <br />This earthly heaven is enough for me  <br /> <br />So break the bread and pour the wine  <br />I need no blessings but I'm counting mine  <br />Life is much more than money buys  <br />When I see the faith in my children's eyes <br />  <br />As most Catholics believe, and the Church always taught, if you have grace in your souls, Heaven is present in your souls as well, therefore \\"Now I'm here in a state of grace, This earthly heaven is enough for me.\\" You basically have Heaven on Earth when in a state of grace. Whether David meant to or not, that is a very profound and lovely verse, religious or otherwise. And all with his family close at hand.  I believe the Old Testament psalms or proverbs talk about the blessing of a man, when he is close with his wife and children. Again, an earthly type of Heaven, the family, especially if everyone loves each other, shares faith, which David poetically mentions.  Also, how did Jesus signify his presense after His Resurrection, to His disciples on the road to Emmaus(sp?): He broke bread with them, and probably drankwine too with others. <br /> <br />It also reminds me when St Augustine said, \\"love God and do what you want.\\" Nothing really radical by the statments.  if you sincerely want to love God 100%, in a spiritually passionate & intimate manner, you never do what He doesnt want. Your actions, your desires, will be what God wants and desires.  You try to line up your desire completely inline with Gods. Its like when two people love each other, their wills become one, (at least ideally, yeah I know couples can have friction, break up, yadda yadda, but everyone knows what I mean when two people hit it off perfectly, andfor those few moments, times, they were very together in their likes and dislikes, and wants...etc).  Also the comment \\"be thankful for what you got,\\" comes to mind too.  These are not very \\"atheistic\\" verses to me.  but this is just my personal thoughts, so take it for what its worth.  sorry for the ramble. <br /> <br />Again, if I havent expressed it clear enough, I really like this new cd by David Gilmour.  It got in my head and made me think, even pray, in a good way.  Nothing nerve-racking, just very beautiful music with introspective subtle lyrics thrown in as extra. cant complain with that. <br /> <br />enjoy and dont overlook this gem. <br /> <br />Oook..I got a go now...I think I left my blinker on... (inside joke :)
B000005HLV|5.0|\\"In the middle of Transylvania all natural life has for a long time ago gone...\\" <br /> <br /> <br />De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, the first full studio album by Black Metal artist Mayhem. Released in 1994, it was accompanied by the most controversial story ever surrounding an album. Though this may not be everyones cup of tea, you really cannot deny the sheer beauty of this release.  <br />This is THE definitive BM album.  <br />Nevermind Emperor, Burzum, Darkthrone... all of their efforts pale in comparison to this bleak classic. Don't get me wrong, they're all amazing, but never has an album this aesthetically beautifully been ever recorded. The 8 songs here all provide the dark, haunting, pummeling assault that is black metal. Euronymous' rhythm guitar and Hellhammer's inhuman drumming (no joke, I still can't believe a guy can bash a drumkit like this) drive the songs with Grishnack's basslines providing the backbone (you can hear them no matter what many people I  <br />know say).  <br />To tie it all up are Attilla's vocals, guttural and sick. Even some fans tend to hate them but I think that overall, they are perfectly suited to the music. They are almost indecipherable anyway, unless you know the lyrics. I look at them as part of the music, and combined together it's a magnificently twisted <br />formula for the most absorbing music ever. <br />Mayhem would never really ever again deliver the goods as they've done here, mainly due to the loss of their main man, Euronymous, but in a way that just goes to show how important a record this is, a once in a lifetime creation. Nevermind their more experimental work, DMDS cannot be rivaled, ever. <br /> <br />This is infact a very biased review for I am just smitten with this album, have been ever since I got into Metal and got this cd; about 4 years ago I think. If you're a BM fan, you should have this album already. If you're a fan of good solid cold, extreme metal music, you really should get this. <br />I find myself obsessing over this album time and time again and it delivers without fail. Always. <br />Talk about long lasting appeal!
B00005B36H|5.0|<br /> This band are absolutely amazing, they're up there with the beatles, led zeppelin, pink floyd.....all the great bands. They are a difficult band to get into....you've got to give them time to sink in, and you will see, trust me. This album is an absolute work of genius. Stand out tracks are The grudge, parabol/parabola, lateralus and reflection........If you're finding it hard to get into this band, go and see them live stand right at the front and just let them take you on their journey. <br />            <br />          unchie
0064400557|5.0|I was very impressed with this book and the nature and style thereof. I believe that it shows the powerful impact that a writer could have on children's lives. I also believe that this book should be required reading for all elementary school students. It deals with the topic of passing on and trials very well and is written in a style that is easily read and remembered. <br />
0316168815|5.0|I'm not the sentimental type, and although expecting a good read from 'The Lovely Bones' I didn't expect to be so deeply moved by the story of Susie growing up in her heaven.  From her vantage point, Susie watches down on Earth as her friends and family move on from her death, but never too far from it.  Some reviewers here have suggested that this novel is a sappy reaction to recent events in our world.  I could not disagree more.  It seems that some readers have been 'taken in' by their American Lit professors, which is unfortunately easy.  It's easy to accept that your opinions and gut reactions might be wrong when confronted with the heady and seductive guise of intellectualism.
B000002NJS|5.0|After a four year gap since her last studio album, the R&B flavoured Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna returned to the studios in 1998 and came up with some of her most stunning, artistic and compelling work. The album would go under the title, Ray Of Light and encapsulated a multitude of styles - Dance/Techno/Indie. The project would be produced by Madonna herself with the aid of Dance master, William Orbitt.  <br /> <br />Ray Of Light (1998) opens with the hypnotic sounds of Drowned World/Substitute For Love. The track is mellow in it's content and shifts tempo midway through the recording. Madonnas vocal delivery is soft, sensual and warm.  <br /> <br />Swim is another tempo shifting number that is utterly compelling whilst zooming in on the swirling psychedelic vibe is the fantastically upbeat, Ray Of Light. Madonnas voice is impeccably strong, seemingly delivering this with a vengenace. Ray Of Light became a monster dance-floor filler that remains as startling as it was on its origanal release.  <br /> <br />There is a startling combination of Indie/Rock/Dance on the bizarre Candy Perfume Girl. Though not quite having the immediacy of some of the other recordings on here, still has significant musical merit.  <br /> <br />More adventurous was the hypnotic, trance-like effect on the stark, Skin which contains vast undertones of red hot, pulsating dance and Madonnas performance sounds heavenly. Skin like most of the other recordings on here is hauntingly atmospheric and has such immediacy.  <br /> <br />The album then swerves and steers back into a more commercial sound with the bouncy,upbeat, Nothing Really Matters which is utterly infectious and a guaranteed dance-floor filler.  <br /> <br />One of the ultimate highlights on this album has to be the stark, Sky Fits Heaven which has a more hardcore effect. Complete with thrashing guirtars and bizarre, synchronised effects, the track is one of the most memroable recordings on the album. A far cry from the sweet popsounds of Holiday and Like A Virgin!  <br /> <br />The remainder of the album careers along at a leisurley pace. Outstanding is another mesmerising and hauntingly atmospheric tune, Frozen which Madonna delivers compellingly whilst The Power Of Goodbye is breathtakingly beautiful, delivered with a sensual and soothing performance from this unbeatable pop diva. The profound religious and spiritual undertones on the fantastic, Shanti, conveys Madonnas undoubted diversity as an artist. Only let down is the slightly forgetable Little Star, but apart from that, Ray Of Light emerges as her best album yet and was one of the most important albums of the 1990's. A masterpiece! <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's debut is a good listen all around, here me out.  Ordinary guitar work, ordinary drumming, ordinary bass lines.  Joseph Hahn [scratching & samples] however, is an amazing turntablist and uses great samples to enhance these ordinary instrumentations.  Mike Shinoda [ryhmes] also put forth a good effort to compliment and fill in parts where they are needed.  Chester Bennington [vocals] has an outstanding voice and range hands down, but falls just short with once again, ordinary lyrics.  The radio hit \\"In the End\\" is the only real exception as far as \\"Non-Ordinary\\" lyrics.  When these six different aspects are woven together as properly as they are, they make for a good record or \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  It also makes them a pretty diverse \\"Mainstream\\" metal group.  The reviews for this album are a mixed bag, typically because people either LOVE or HATE \\"Mainstream\\" music, especially amongst the extremely biased metal crowd of today.  Either way, they should really consider lending an open ear to this album, and not just classifying it as \\"Nu-Metal\\" or \\"Jock Rock\\" because it is very well put together for a \\"Mainstream\\" metal band.  Your typical reviewer would categorize this album with the likes Limp Bizkit or Korn, UNFORETUNATELY the only thing i'd be able to agree with someone about these two bands is that both of them are f*cking terrible.  I'd recommend this album to the better facet of a little more original [but not much more] Nu-Metal outfits like Sevendust, Spineshank, or even Mudvayne.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|When Queer As Folk catapulted onto British television in 1999, I was 19 years old and had only just \\"come out of the closet\\" to family and friends. Quite strange that immediately afterwards, this show began its 8 episode run on the Britsih network, Channel 4. It all seemed so parallel to what I was going through at that time and if anything was a real eye opener for me as then just being a naieve, innocent 19 year old.  <br /> <br />Of course the opening episode sparked off outrage from critics and even the governement were not happy with the graphic content of the series with even talk of the series being taken off the air. I have a message to them - its simple, just switch t.v channels! The obvious level of concern stemmed from one of the characters wittingly seen having sex with a mere 15 year old schoolboy. No matter how immoral these situations seem, they do inevitably occur and thats all the writer of the series, Russell Davies was intending to draw upon.  <br /> <br />The action is set in the heart of Manchester, namely Canal Street, a gay village thats awashed with nightclubs and gay bars. I, myself live in Bolton, a few miles away from Manchester and have to say I absolutely love Canal Street and is not a bit unlike how it seems in the series. The night life is positively buzzing, the music always divine and certainly there are always some interesting characters to meet. Myself and a large group of friends regularly hit Canal Street every weekend and dance the night away at bars such as The Union, Mantos, Via Fosser, Metz and Hollywood Showbar, most of which are seen in this series.  <br /> <br />The absolutely drop-dead gorgeous Aidan Gillen plays Stuart, an arrogant, unlikeable character who is nearing thirty and has yet to come out of the closet to his parents. Despite how nasty he can become you can almost forgive all from his sheer good looks. In the first episode he scores the night with 15 year old schoolboy, Nathan Maloney. There are some graphic sex scenes with these pair of characters and if you're offended by homeosexuality in any way, its probably best you avoid the series full stop. As the series progresses, Aidan conveys a more two dimensional character, showing that Stuart was infact lonely and screwed up, which most likely stemmed from fear of telling his parents that he was gay. The role is played well and beleavably.  <br /> <br />Craig Kelly plays the much more likeable, Vince Tyler, whose bubbly personality really shines through and is a fun part in the series. His laughable obsession with Doctor Who and his frequent bad luck whenever he takes a man home for a spot of passion, makes amusing viewing and his timing is impeccable. Its made blatantly obvious from episode 1 that Stuart is madly in love with Stuart, who he has been best friends with since the age of 12. However his affections are sadly not returned by Stuart who prefers to sleep around with the entire gay village rather than settling down into a relationship.  <br /> <br />Charlie Hunnam takes the role of 15 year old, Nathan Maloney who is struggling to cometo terms with his homeosexuality and most likely had a host of teenagers identifying with his character. He literally crow bars his way onto the infamous gay scene in Manchester and becomes unhealthily obsessed with Stuart. Charlie plays the naieve schoolboy well and beleavably and causes some amusement throughout the series.  <br /> <br />Amongst the rest of the cast includes Denise Black as Vince's fun-loving, down-to-earth mother, Hazel and is utterly fantastic in the role, conveying a likeable two dimensional character. Her witty one-liners and timing is superb and injects a refreshingly fun side to the series. Carla Henry also causes some amusement as Nathans best friend, Donna, whose loyalty to Nathan is actually quite touching.  <br /> <br />The first four episodes are seemingly fun and games, following the gang as they plod along Canal Street and inevitably touches on prejudice towads gay men. There is a much darker undertone in episode 3 where the character, Phil, overdoses on heroin. In episode 4, the scene of the funeral takes place and is played out almost like black comedy.  <br /> <br />From episode 5, the series settles down and concentrates on a host of subplots that all shrewdly link up to the final in the series such as centering on Vinces relationship with a sueve Australian businessman, played by Aussie T.V veteran, Peter O' Brian and Stuarts troubled relationship with his family.  <br /> <br />The writing is impeccable as are all the performances. Many fun and games to endure as well as moments of genuinely compelling drama. Russell Davies shrewd observation on gay life is overly accurate but in no way is this the be all and end all to how gay men live so view it with an open mind. One of the fun aspects of the series are the characterisations where any gay man will be able to identify with at least one of them.  <br /> <br />On the whole an impressive series, thats certainly colourful, has many laughs to enjoy and is accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack. The ambience of the nightclubs and drug culture are shrewdly evoked. Without doubt, a classic!  <br />
0451527046|5.0|Great book! I recently reread this, about 25 years after I first did as a 10 year old, and, again, enjoyed it immensely! <br /> <br />It is a real rip-roaring page turner that I found hard to put down as there is very little let up in the action. It isn't a cheesy fairytale either, with several truly awful people portrayed in it, quite a few of whom die some nasty deaths.  <br /> <br />It is a riveting read for any body with an active imagination, full of salty sea dogs, piratical sayings, nautical manoeuvering, sword play and double crosses. It's time it was remade as a movie! <br /> <br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly to young and old readers!
B000002LGQ|5.0|In March, 1989 Madonnas long-awaited, Like A Prayer was released to the public and critics eagerly sharpened their pencils. Multiply produced by the pop diva herself, Steve Bray and Patrick Leonard, the album would encapsulate a striking of mixture of styles that ranged from Pop, Dance, Soul and even on occasions, Gospel. Like A Prayer (1989) quite possibly was her greatest album of the 1980's.  <br /> <br />The title track, Like A Prayer had startling undertones of spiritual and religious commentary that was both profound but controversial in its day where the stunning video of this classic where Madonna is seen dancing in front of several burning crosses was banned from T.V after just one screening. Still Madonna had made her mark and this fantastic classic raced to the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite steering into a gospel sound, the song is still highly sexually charged, highly danceable whilst she is backed by a string of angelic sounding gospel singers that was conducted by Andre Couch which merley heightened its blatant spiritual nature. One of Madonnas most definitive classics!  <br /> <br />The undertones of hot, pulsating funk on the playful, Express Yourself proved that Madonna hadn't lost her impeccable touch for making great, infectious, jamming dance musi. The track would become a cross-Atlantic Top 10 seller.  <br /> <br />The album then takes a plunge with the surprisingly dire, Love Story on which she duetted with dynamic pop singer, Prince. Love Story is a blatant waste of opportunity as these are such fine and diverse talents that were amongst the most important figures of twentieth century music. The mid-tempo beat careers along at a sleepy pace and petters out in nothing. Prince orchestrated the song and merley seemed like some sort of experiment on his part as its the only song that lets the album down.  <br /> <br />The compelling, Till Death Do Us Part was a song where Madonna seemingly confronted her own personal demons. Listen to the lyrics and they could almost be a direct message to her first husband Sean Penn. Their turbulent marrage was still very much lingering in her mind and its as though she is deliberately singing the song for him to hear. Madonna neatly glides along the windy, complex music arrangements and sounds utterly magnificent in the process.  <br /> <br />Madonna has always possessed the incredible and uncanny ability to turn personal experience and traumas into art. Promise To Try is a hauntingly atmospheric ballad that is both mellow and soothing in its content whilst on Oh Father, Madonna sounds as though she is exploring and trying to analyse her complex relationship with her father. The pain and confusion in her voice simmers out on this touching number and can move you to tears with her breath-taking and vulnreable sounding vocal performance.  <br /> <br />Cherish is a delightful confection of radio-friendly pop that returns to Madonnas more traditional, earlier sound. The melody is tight and punchy giving it an overly infectious feel whilst Madonnas tone sounds playful and angelic. Her sassy charm truly ignites this recording and it soon became a big seller on the U.K and U.S Pop charts.  <br /> <br />One of the adventurous offerings on here is the sugary but compelling, Dear Jessie which is utterly glorious from its fantastically arranged and highly origanal musical arrangements. Unsurprisingly, Dear Jessie with its fun, happy content became another huge hit in Madonnas already large catologue.  <br /> <br />Keep It Together is a nifty slice of commercial-flavoured dance-pop which Madonna delivers with style and finesse but one of the other highlights on the album is then served with the spiritual, Pray For The Spanish Eyes which is both atmospheric and reflective. This leads to the final of the album with the experimental, Act Of Contrition which has Madonna quietly uttering a prayer over an edgy, stark rock guirtar with a choirs background chants played backwards. This method was used by acts such as Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles in the 1960's to create that ultimate psychedelic effect. Certainly one of her more diverse offerings here.  <br /> <br />On the whole, Like A Prayer ranks as one of her all-time timeless, classic albums. Highly consistent and good solid work, this enjoyed extravagent sales figures and critics rightly haled this as a masterpiece! Fantastic!!!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXXS|5.0|The first Jurassic Park was the best, but I still like some things about Jurassic Park III better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first Jurassic Park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, Gladiator 2000, Godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic Park III had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert Stan Winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. The raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two Jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,Jurassic Park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised Stan Winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special effects of not only Jurassic Park III, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt II. Sam Neil really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the Jurassic Park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic Park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy Jurrasic Park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be Citizen Kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into Jurassic Park pt.III. Dont grade it for an Oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna returned in late 2000 with this superb effort, following on from the critically-acclaimed and grammy award winning success of what is still possibly her greatest album yet, Ray Of Light (1998).  <br /> <br />The album would be titled Music and would again offer the sound of the future and continued in a vaguely similar format to Ray Of Light. Madonna worked with a multiple number of producers on this project which included William Orbit (who also co-produced Ray Of Light), Mirwais Ahmadzai, Guy Sioworth and Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent. Music, offered another set of a diverse range of tracks that were both adventurous and compelling which has always been the genius of Madonna as she still never ceases to amaze and surprise. Madonna has always had that uncanny ability to be experimental and creative and still always come out on top.  <br /> <br />The title track, Music is a monster dance-floor filler. Containing a swirling electronic pop-funk vibe, Madonnas playful delivery gives startling ignition to this slick offering that caught onto the public like a magnet. Unsurprisingly and very deservedly, Music became a cross-Atlantic chart-topper.  <br /> <br />Impressive Instant is another startling and mesmerising tune with its strikingly synthesised effects and driving grooves. Would have made a perfect choice for release as a single as this would undoubtedly have been another monster hit.  <br /> <br />Runaway Lover, is a mid-tempo dance number that contains another series of bizarre, synchronised sounds thats still vastly origanal and highly inventive with its unique musical arrangements. Actually Runaway Lover does admitedly sound like a left-over track from Ray Of Light, but still is utterly impressive.  <br /> <br />I Deserve It has a remarkable combination of electronic-dance, with its again, synthesised effect, blended neatly into an arrangement that has a country twinge to it. A moody, acoustic guirtar ballad, the song is blatantly a touching dedication to her husband, Guy Ritchie, an immensley talented film director, whose credits include the two cult classics, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrells (1998) and Snatch (2001) You get to more fully apprerciate Madonnas striking vocal abilities here, and she puts in a powerful and passionate performance as always the case with Madonna.  <br /> <br />Amazing is a highly stylized, guirtar-powered and uptempo William Orbit collaboration who works his magic yet again with Madonna as he had done so consistently on the Ray Of Light album.  <br /> <br />Nobodys Perfect is one of the more commercial-orientated singles though those synchronised and echoey sound effects are still clocking away amidst the musical arrangements and Madonna delivers a subtle, exuberant vocal performance, neatly surfboarding along the complex arrangements.  <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me, returns again to the neatly gelled mixture of Dance/Country and delivers it with seemingly a vengeance. Madonna has always been sassy and street-smart and its nice to see she hasn't lost any of her magical touch over the years and if anything she just gets better and better!  <br /> <br />What It Feels Like For A Girl, is a more sultry, grooving number that is effectively mellow in its content and is a nice way of beginning to wind the album down. Certainly has many musical merits and this also was lifted as a single where it became another rapid Top 10 seller, though its mix is different to the version on here.  <br /> <br />More atmospheric was the stormy, moody, Paradise (Not For Me) where Madonnas slightly chilly delivery sends shivers down the spine through its trance-like arrangements. One of the more adventurous and inventive recordings on here!  <br /> <br />Finally this rollercoaster ride of an album begins slowing down with two impeccably delivered Dance-Country numbers, Gone and her fabulous renedition of American Pie which rounds the album off on a high note.  <br /> <br />Expectations were high after the classic Ray Of Light set which was one of the most significant albums of the 1990's and certainly one of the biggest of Madonnas career to date. The album generally received critical praise but was often unfairly compared constantly to Ray Of Light (which often came out better) but you should really judge this album on its own merits as there are enough individual qualities of its own and is consistently excellent, bubbling in a remarkable multitude of styles.  <br />
B000E97X66|5.0|My first serious exposure to Bruce Springsteen was with Live 1975-85.  While that set still remains my favorite Springsteen album (and favorite album of all time), I now understand the frustrations among longtime fans about its limitations and flaws.  While many of the indivdiual tracks might be definitive versions of that particular song, it doesn't really succeed in capturing one of Bruce's shows, and there's precious little material from the 1975 that appears in the title.  It seems like a huge waste that it took nearly 30 years into his career for Springsteen to release a full, unedited concert on CD (there's the fine Barcelona DVD, but the audio for that has never been released as of this writing).  And so the inclusion of the video of this concert on the remastered Born to Run set was huge news for Springsteen fans, most of whom will take live material in any form we can get.  And now we have it on CD in pristine sound.  I know a lot of people see this release as unnecessary, but I am glad to have it in this format since I don't have the knowledge or the desire to rip the audio from the DVD.   <br /> <br />As I said, I started listening to Springsteen immediately after the height of the Born in the USA days.  I hadn't heard many live recordings from before the Darkness tour, so I wasn't really familiar with Bruce's sound prior to 1978.  And honestly, I didn't really care for his vocals from anything recorded- live or stuido- in the 1970s.  Too much Jersey street punk schtick, and it sounded like he was trying to deepen his voice by singing from the back of his throat.  I generally considered Bruce to be at his vocal peak during the 80s, between \\"The River\\" and \\"Tunnel of Love\\".  However, this concert overcomes any vocal limitations that Bruce may have had back then.  This is Bruce and the E Street Band at their absolute finest.  It's certainly different than the polished stadium rock sound or the twangy acoustic tone that he's taken on in the past twenty years.  The band is leaner- no \\"wall of sound\\" from the past two E St Band tours where you have to wonder if a little fat could be trimmed- and the tempos are much faster.  This is almost garage rock, with an emphasis on guitar and piano.  Bruce also has a jazzier, bluesier sound, such as the harmonica opening for \\"She's the One\\", the Van Morrisonish \\"E Street Shuffle\\" and the extended jam of \\"Kitty's Back\\".  Some songs like \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" haven't changed much over the years, but others like \\"Tenth Ave. Freezeout\\" and \\"Born to Run\\" sound considerably different.  You get to hear these classics when they sounded fresh and before they had become the cherished but sometimes bloated anthems that we're used to.  And we finally get to hear classic covers like the Detroit Medley (also available on the \\"No Nukes\\" soundtrack) and on \\"Quarter to Three\\").  <br /> <br />So while I still prefer the era of Springsteen from the 80s on, this is an essential addition to his catalog.  The only problem is that it adds to your frustration that there aren't more releases like it.  We need similar sets for every tour he's ever done.  Live 75-85 is still a classic, but it can't substitute for complete, unedited versions of his concerts.  And given Bruce's frustrating tendency to focus his recent tours mostly in the Northeast part of the US, live releases like this are a nice concession for those of us who don't have access to 50 shows within a hundred miles of one another. <br /> <br />And regarding criticisms that this is an unnecessary release- I can't argue with that, but the easy answer is to just not buy it if you don't feel you need the audio from a DVD that you already own.  There's nothing on here that isn't on the DVD- it's not like 18 Tracks where Bruce tacked on some extra songs to entice those of us who had already bought the full boxset.  I'm glad that Bruce is finally loosening up and releasing a good combination of vault and new material- between April of 2005 with the release of Devils and Dust, and April 2006 with the Seeger Sessions, we will have had 5 releases from Springsteen in one year.  We're all (hopefully) capable adults who can pick and choose what we want to buy and what we can skip.  But if you're a Springsteen fan or someone who appreciates great music in general, DO NOT skip this concert in at least one of its forms.
B00005Y228|4.0|The diminutive Aussie Pop diva, Kylie Minogue is probably more famous and popular than she ever has been before. Though she has never really made it in the U.S she has indeed garnered a series of loyal fans in the States who simply lap up her unique work that is not unlike Madonnas earlier output.  <br /> <br />In late 2001, Kylie scored one of her biggest hit singles in years with the robotic, electro-pop track, Can't Get You Out Of My Heart which is almost trance-like from its slight though compelling repetition. Instantly infectious, Can't Get You Out Of My Head became one of the biggest club hits of 2001 as well as topping several countries around Europe (including the U.K where she has always been a consistently high seller). Following a successful re-invention with the stunning Light Years (2000) on which she moulded herself into becoming a modern day disco diva, it was quite clear that the diva was back, unbeatable, better than ever and even more remarkable.  <br /> <br />Also making great dance records was infact the entire album which was crammed with ptential hit singles. Though you could argue that the recordings tend to become rather formulaic at some points, it is consistenly infectious, highly enjoyable and is just bursting out with energy. Many of her vocals are synchronised against the highly synthesised effect to add to that essential club feel.  <br /> <br />This was much the case with another pair of hits from the album, the bouncy, even angelic, Love At First Sight and the mesmerising, In Your Eyes which was utterly compelling with its complex, trance-like musical arrangements.  <br /> <br />The title track, Fever is a bouncy slice of Pop that is as playful as ever where as showing off her more sassy side was featured on the driving Burning Up which would have made ideal chart material. However more startling was the superb, Give It To Me which contained some highly inventive and origanal musical arrangements that was strikingly quite ahead of its time. Kylie proves to be a dynamic and versatile vocalist on tracks such as these.  <br /> <br />The hypnotic tone of Fragile is dazzling and hauntingly atmospheric in its mood. What does seem to hark back to her old Stock, Aikten And Waterman sound was the upbeat pop number, On The Dance Floor that was less origanal than the majority of the album. Kylies vocal delivery had clearly improved since her days of bubblegum pop in the late 80's, with her voice having lost that slight nasal sound and has grown more refined, confident and sassy in recent times.  <br /> <br />Come Into My World is a sassy, sultry, sexually charged number that contains a fabulous performance from Miss. Minogue whilst other tracks on the album are all standard Pop/Dance cuts that when judged on their own merits are still infectious. From the racing rhythm on the albums opening track, More, More, More to the jamming affairs of Love Affair and Burning Up, they each complete the albums line up and round this off as a significant comback in Kylies career (she suffered a lull with her recording career in the late 1990's).  <br /> <br />Quite possibly on a par with the masterpiece Light Years (2000) album. Even if not, certainly not far behind.  <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is heartbreakingly romantic, and desperately tragic.  Of course, 50 years ago movies like this were not even imaginable.  However, 50 years ago, popular films tended to be racist and sexist.  The fact that movies like this are drawing an average of 4.5 stars (out of 5) from over 750 reviewers is a definately positive sign - proof that we, the human race, are growing more open minded over time.  50 years ago - this movie would probably never even have made it into theaters.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna truly reigns as the Queen Of Pop to this day (and that really is no overstatement)! For over twenty years in the music business Madonna has never ceased to amaze and surprise with each new release of an album. The Immaculate Collection (1990) is a just mere skimming of some of the masterpiece productions that propelled and catapulted her into world-wide recognition and acclaim with critics. Her shrewd choice of songs remains uncanny!     Holiday, a nifty, distinctley early 1980's, up-tempo Pop classic was infact Madonna's second release, following her debut single, Everybody, which had steered into more club/dance trends of the day (and bombed). Holiday, with its contagious groove is further ignited by Madonna's unique and distinct vocal approach, which has grown stronger and yet more refined over recent years. Holiday became the first in a long line of chart-toppers for the unbeatable, No.1 Pop Diva.     Lucky Star, with it's electronic, synthesised effect is equally of good musical value though was less accomplished than Holiday which didn't meet the commercial success of the previous single, though still stands well today (despite having 1980's stamped all over it).     Madonna explored her growing artistic integrity on the glowing ballad, Borderline. Borderline conveyed her undoubted wide range of distinctive vocal abilities, proving her voice carried enough emotional load to be able to carry off gorgeous ballads like Borderline with style and finesse. Lovely!     However one of Madonna's ultimate and definitive landmarks of her long and successful recording career is delivered next with the playful, Like A Virgin. Like A Virgin had been written and assembled by R&B master, Nile Rodgers who had also enjoyed chart-topping success with Soul music diva, Diana Ross (Upside Down). Madonnas evocative performance is breathy and seemless and enhances the catchy orchestrations too sensational effect. Unsurprisingly, Like A Virgin quickly zoomed into pole positionon both sides of the Atlantic.     Taking an obvious cue from her adoration for 50's movie star, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna next came up with the fun and bouncy, Material Girl which was utterly compelling in its content from it's infectious musical arrangements to Madonnas playful, angelic delivery.     The Immaculate Collection (1990) then highlights one of her early ballads with the beautiful, Crazy For You which still stands incredibly well today thanks to the sparse orchestrations and and exuberant performance from Madonna.     It's then back into party mode with the happy-go-lucky, upbeat, Into The Groove which displays the raw, sassy, streetwise side to Madonna. However of more artistic value was the divine, hauntingly atmospheric ballad, Live To Tell. The song is sensual, exhilirating and breathtakingly beautiful which ranks as one of Madonna's strongest and most passionate ballads of the 1980's.     The opening classical interlude on Papa Don't Preach is masterful. The lyrics offered profound social commentary that was rather oddly perceived as controversial at the time by the more unliberated critics.It was evident that Madonna was vastly maturing impeccably well as a recording artist with her vocal delivery becoming clearer, stronger and losing that slight nasal sound she had when she first began. At this stage in her career she was now fimrly America's leading female pop star of the 1980's.     It's then back into jamming pop terriotry with the delicious, Open Your Heart which Madonna performs brilliantly, sufboarding neatly up and down those familiar, catchy arrangements.     The sultry, Latin effects on La Isla Bonita is one of her most compelling recordings of that era. Madonna's smooth, lush delivery gives the wonderful musical arrangements an extra spark. Fantastic!     In early 1989 Madonna came up with one of her more controversial outings with the startling religious and spiritual undertones on Like A Prayer. The video to this classic was eventuallybanned but Madonna had made her mark and Like A Prayer is another of her most definitive classics. The gospel backing vocals along with Madonna's crisp, distinct performance is absolutely divine!     The red hot funk sounds of the electric and spectacular, Express Yourself proved Madonna still reigned supreme when it came to delivering great dance music which through all styles she has experimented with, have always initially made it some way into that genre.     More mellow and laid back was the mid-beat sounds to the exotic, Cherish which is vaguely familiar to her earlier work where as Vogue is just a pure pop masterpiece! Atmospheric and reflective in it's content, the stormy dance arrangements on here, complete with a sassy, sultry vocal performance from its star, is simply a genius piece of work!     More evocative and sexually charged was the erotic, Justify My Love which had been recorded specifically for The Immaculate Collection (1990). The tone is red-hot, hypnotic and trance-like through out where as another specially recorded track was the monster affair of Rescue Me. A dramatic affair, it's ignited effectivley from Madonnas almost stark and considerably chilly delivery. Rescue Me rounds this rollercoaster ride of an album off on an absolute high!     All tracks found on The Immaculate Collection are mere jewels in Madonnas crown. They each represent landmarks in her career and in twentieth century Pop music. Madonnas music continues to have a strong impact on the charts to this day and this album reminds you of where Madonna mania all started.       Ian Phillips     September 2006
0345457684|5.0|It is always a joy to stumble upon a novel like this - an author new to the reader, who writes well, and has several novels already in release. <br /> <br />Morgan posits a world several hundred years in the future.  His conjectured world is some parts cyberpunk, mixed in with a healthy dose of daily living having the same infrastructure and motivations as exist today.   His central conceit is that memory and consciousness are stored within a chip/core of some sort that sits just below the skull in the neck.  Thus, when someone dies, this core is removed, and uploaded into a mainframe, there to be reinserted into a new sleeve (excellent word - meaning body), or not, depending on the decedent's preparation and wherewithal. <br /> <br />Within this world, the plot centers around Takeshi Kovacs, a descendant of Eastern European serf/colonists on a world originally settled by Japanese.  Kovacs is killed at the onset of the novel, waking up to find himself on Earth for the first time, and in the employ/thrall of a 300 odd year old personage, a Meth (Methuselah), as Morgan's imagined future society labels the long lived.  The Meth has been recently re-sleeved himself, and has brought Kovacs to Earth to investigate why his previous incarnation committed suicide, the suicide having been done with such competence that Kovac's employer has no memory of the last 48 hours of that incarnation. <br /> <br />From there, we are treated to a police procedural of sorts, with trajectories of plot flowing in many directions, bolstered by a bevy of interesting ideas about the future, and plenty of action.  The author has a flair for descriptions and the language he employs brings to life images through metaphors and structure that are compelling, if perhaps a bit florid at times.  That being said, his ability to bring about a plausible and realistic future is a major asset of the novel;  the vernacular (\\"Meth,\\" \\"sleeving,\\" as described above, and much more) he has developed resonates with the reader and lends a strong veracity to the universe he has created. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />
B000EQ4G5K|2.0|Ok..now she's from my country and I'll be honest. She's not a great singer and her vocal range is not there. <br /> <br /> <br />Now to the album.  <br /> <br />This is an uneven album and Rihanna needs to cut her niche  and find out what she's better at doing. These albums with 2 hiphop songs along with 2 R&B tunes and 2 reggae dancehall tracks accompanied by 2-3 remixes only make the listener confused as to what the artiste is trying to say-I certainly was. <br /> <br /> <br />This is not a standout album, in fact it's average and just like any of the stuff any of these girls push out year in and year out. <br /> <br />It's ok to have a well made-up face on the disc cover but it's all about the quality of the material on the disc that gets the buyer going. <br /> <br />I'm glad that this young woman has made it unto the big market but it's time she pratices her craft,cultivate her voice and make some memorable music.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's debut album, Songs About Jane, contains a blend of pop, rock, funk and soul for a mixture for an uncompromising solid effort and introduction to mainstream.  \\"Harder To Breathe\\" leads this album off with front man Adam Levine's vocals have a hip-hop / rap and rock feel to it for a rough edge.  As a definite change of atmosphere, \\"This Love\\", lays the strength of the group with a pop mainstream layered instrumentation as the popular \\"She Will Be Loved\\".  \\"The Sun\\" has a more Jamaican / reggae feel to it that compliments the carefully carved lyrics and vocals.  Similar to a modern Stevie Wonder tune, \\"Sunday Morning\\" gives an impression of soul roots with an alternative twist.  \\"Not Coming Home\\" gives off the image of a live opening song with the multi-layered guitar riffs and crowd cheer track in the background.  This album presses pop to another height that other bands forget to incorporate for a fuller and or complete LP.
B0000062FN|5.0|Originally, I first heard this on a vinyl album, back in the 70's. I was blown away immediately. This is by far not only the finest Santana album ever released, it is also a listening experience that makes you want to hear it again and again. I just got the disc, after not hearing this album for about 30 years. What can I say? It is the ultimate musical experience with a unique combination of Latino, African, rock and jazz sounds, percussion played with amazing energy, combined with Carlos's wailing guitar...My daughter and I chose this album for our number one album for driving music, and believe me, that means it rates way up there on our list! We listen to it almost everyday, the disc will probably wear thin soon!<br />This album should be a must-buy in any serious rock-jazz-world music lover's collection.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I posted a review here praising actress Patricia Arquette for her luscious body. Someone mus thave complained to Amazon and they reacted as usual by deleting my review. <br />What is it with some of you people? <br />Are American women so uptight nowadays? or, are they just insecure?  <br />Can it bother you so much so that when a man notices a woman who is blessed with such a body like Ms Arquette's that you need to act like some slighted and spiteful little girl and cry to Big Brother? <br />I think Patricia Arquette is gorgeous and has a body that makes a man go crazy. Get over it people.
B00006EXL5|2.0|This cd is not their best work.  In fact, it's far from it.    You can feel the beginnings of their musicianship but it's really juvenile on this cd.  It's power chord hungry and a lot of the songs about a minute in sound too similar (this is in sharp contrast to their follow up).  Being power chord hungry isn't neccesarily bad (Nirvana was power chord hungry)...it's just ridiculously easy to play.  I just think the contrast wasn't well enough defined.  Their follow up cd still uses a great deal of power chords but they define that contrast better.    I did like the intro to the cd, Romance.  The old record sounding soft intro is a good way to set the tone (Smashing Pumpkin's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness comes to mind).    The singing isn't that great (much improved in the follow up).  The lyrics are reasonably deep but the style of screaming muffles too many words beyond recongition.    Their energy is great throughout the cd and I feel it is something they improve on on the next cd.    Now, for the parental advisary.  I can't advise any kid getting this album.  The lyrics are designed in a way that anyone that isn't \\"emotionally stable\\" could be caused emotional harm.  The follow up album is much lighter (and transitions more into an alternative/punk band).  Note: This advisary does not affect my rating of the album.
B00005JOE8|1.0|Look, Bush won the election.  Period.  He got the electoral vote, he got the popular vote.  Like it or not, he's president.  Accept it.  You'll attack President Bush, but not the terrorists who attacked our nation.  Why is what they did okay?    And why was my friend censored for criticizing the terrorist behind those attacks while others are allowed to openly criticize our commander-in-chief?    Don't get me wrong.  I'm not an extremist right-winger, but give me a break.  This is way out of hand.  Politics aside, V for Vendetta is still a terrible movie.  It's talky, it's slow-paced, it's too long.  The characters are as deep as a pitri dish.  The protagonist overcomes his obstacles so easily they might as well not be there, so there's really no conflict.  How is that entertaining?     (By the way, Turkeyman.  Your idea's not original.  The right-wingers beat you to it.)
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I can't get why people review this particular item with 2- and 3-star reviews.  I mean, Keanu Reeves had already established himself as a great actor in The Matrix trilogy, while of course Rachel Weisz was the main reason that many people went to see the movie in the first place.  It was a great movie; I loved it.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ex-cop who believes that he is the only one who can stop an invasion of demons from taking over the world- and it helps that he can actually see the demons.  This movie contains a lot of supernatural material, the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place (besides Rachel Weisz, of course), seeing as I love supernatural thrillers.<br /><br />Constantine's main focus is on helping skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister (also played by Weisz), and their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost. Constantine takes many trips to hell and back by going through a body of standing water (i.e. his bathtub, a pan of water).  There are also many sequences of demonic activity and language that almost makes a sailor blush, but I still loved this movie.<br /><br />Once again, I complain that Amazon's review system only goes up to 5 stars; otherwise, this would be much higher-rated.  Definitely recommended for fans of sci-fi or horror movies.
1400079179|3.0|(***1/2)<br /><br />Yep, that's all there is. A whizbang of a page turner, with not one but two, count 'em two, shadowy secret societies (Opus Dei and the Priory of Zion) duking it out, while our infinitely intelligent and superior hero, and his female companion Sophie, as infinitely intelligent and superior and sexy as the same hero's other female companion in the last book, dodge a terminally masochistic albino assassin to unravel a long series of cultch-lit puzzles, each wrapped in the one before like so many Russian dolls. As if their lives depended on it, which they do, but not quite so much as the author depends on it to arrive breathlessly at the cliffhanger at the end of the next short chapter.<br /><br />You have to respect the genuine craft it takes to manage to pack a moment of breathless suspense into each of 104 between chapter intervals. But after the 67th or so, it might start to feel a tad formulaic.<br /><br />Won't keep you from grabbing for the next one, though, til the whole bag of empty calories is gone.<br /><br />The real fun here is in the lore about those two secret societies, especially the Priory. My recommendation would be to take your conspiracy theory fun straight (and, for my money, more potent), by going straight to the source. Just because the authors of *Holy Blood, Holy Grail* made themselves look avaricious and silly by suing Dan Brown (who had given them perfectly fair acknowledgement), doesn't mean that their own book of deep trivia and trashy revelation isn't smarter, more convoluted, and a more satisfying guilty pleasure in the end.<br /><br />On the whole, I felt the Brown formula worked better, and the plotting felt less ad hoc, in the prequel *Angels and Demons*. You won't miss anything by missing either one; but if all you're missing by plowing through them is a few nights of prime time TV, you'll come out on top from the trade.
B000FA57N0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I already owned the DVD, but I could not resist getting the HD-DVD to view on my 106 inch diagonal projection screen.  At first, it did not look much better than the DVD version, but when I switched back and forth, the difference was obvious.  The DVD looks blurry-like I'm watching without my glasses (or after too much Scotch).  Differences in dark scenes are not as noticeable as bright scenes, but the HD version is still better.  If you have not seen this movie-get it now!  If you already own the DVD-get the HD-DVD ASAP!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Year: 1959 <br />Writer Truman Capote  (Hoffman ) is looking for a story when he stumbles over a brutal killing case in Kansas. He wants to write about how the murders affected the people in town, but ends up befriending one of the murderers and promising them he will help them in their trial.  <br /> <br />This is an honest movie; showing Truman Capote from all sorts of angles. You don't want to miss out on anything. Capote is a fascinating man to watch and he presents us with witty lines all through the movie with his ability to see the irony in all worst-case-scenarios. I haven't read In Cold Blood, but there's no need to. This is one of the greater movies released in this century. <br /> <br />I was blown away.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Man, what a surprise this movie was. Everything Is Illuminated was rented for me one Thursday night, and I must say I was disappointed at the prospect of watching it. It looked basically average based on the DVD back cover, and I figured it wasn't really worth my time to watch. WOW, WAS I WRONG. What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be. Excellent writing, excellent character development, excellent direction, quirky without excess, many funny moments, sparkling dialogue- This is a great movie!     I never read the novel, so I can tell you that it isn't required to understand or appreciate the film. While I'm sure the book gets far more in-depth with the concepts of the story, the film stands by itself as a work of art, and delivers a multi-layered story that is both funny and powerful. Great stuff.     Elijah Woood's performance is fine, but the film really belongs to Eugene Hutz. What a tour-de-force from this basically unknown actor! In addition, the grandfather role is performed deftly by Boris Lefkin, thus rounding out a top-notch group of actors. First-time director Liev Schreiber proves he will be a force to reckon with, as his pacing and direction sparkle.     While I don't want to give away the story, as I believe not knowing too much about this film adds immeasurably to its enjoyment, it is a pretty basic \\"getting in touch with your past\\" story, with numerous original and excellent touches added. All in all, this movie was a VERY pleasant surprise for me. If you are looking for an EXCELLENT movie that is somewhat 'off the beaten path', do yourself a favor and check out Everything Is Illuminated. RECOMMENDED!!
B000002NC4|5.0|I can't believe it took me until 2006 to discover Built to Spill...It only took one listen to their earlier release \\"There's Nothing Wrong With Love\\" to decide that I'll be spending the rest of the year catching up on all their music. For the moment, I can't stop playing this CD.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|This was a good movie not a great movie  <br />If you are a die hard De Niro fan or Pesci then you should get this to add to your collection  <br />Most of the movie stays great but some tends to lag on and seems like the movie has some extra scenes that where not needed  <br />as far as dramatic scenes go there arre a few and they are the best parts of the movie  <br />I would recomend The Goodfellas before this but if your a DE Niro fan like me get this movie
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|They really went all out and it shows the action is beyond amazing and its great to see the FF7 characters again.  If only they remade it for PS3...*mouth waters*
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I should mention up front that I am not a big video game fan, though some of my friends owned FFVII and loved it.  I have not invested my time in the world or its characters.  So when I saw the trailer for Advent Children at the beginning of Steamboy last year, I should have been neutral, right?  Wrong.  There was just something about it that captured an elusive sense of magic and beauty.   <br /> <br />When I bought the movie, I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations, that it would be incomprehensible to a non gamer, that I wouldn't be able to follow it.  I am happy to say that just a short time spent on Wikipedia to get caught up with the plot and characters made all the difference.   <br /> <br />Even though there are still a few things I am unclear about, that did not detract from the movie.  I am still floored.  I expected to simply enjoy the action bits and the CG work, but I found myself really becoming emotionally involved with the characters.  The music was a big part of that.  Simply astounding, it tugged at my heartstrings.  I couldn't stop humming it afterward.   <br /> <br />That is not to say there wasn't any negative aspects to the film.  The English voice dubbing is pretty terrible, as the mouths did not move with the words, and sometimes a line or a short scene did not feel right.  Some parts confused me where I think a fan would have gotten it.  However, if you just accept these things as a given, the experience of watching it is amazing.   <br /> <br />The movie is definitely an ode to the fans.  However, people who had no experience with the game can love it too, if you do a little research first.  I think fantasy fiction fans, regardless of gaming experience, will get a lot out of it.  The future of moviemaking has changed.  Imagine all the fantasy books that would fall flat in traditional movies that could be made into a work like this.  The idea makes me want to do a little happy dance.  Beautiful CG work, music and characters thataffect you emotionally, jaw-dropping fight scenes, and voice acting that is overall suberb (minus the fact that they did not move with the mouths of the characters). <br /> <br />          <br /> <br />
B00005V9IL|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times. I was thrilled to get the special edition on DVD for my birthday! I think everyone should see this movie, it's so eventful! If you love science fiction movies with romance, you will enjoy it too!
B0009AM5I6|5.0|If there were to be a single performance of Verdi's masterpiece \\"La traviata\\" on one's dvd shelf, this is it. Written at the height of his creative powers, it remains a staple in the repretoire of any respectable opera house.     Covent Garden rightly decided to downscale the sets to draw the focus on the main characters (with the exception of the third act, which accommodates for the large crowd). It is, as the editorial review dictates, unspectacular. There is no question that this production relies solely on the drama inherent in the music to drive the performance.     Angela Gheorghiu is easily this generation's most captivating soprano. She sings with a confidence and clarity in the upper register that few can boast, and a warm, luscious low register. Her phrasing is intelligent, always conscious of her place in the score. With superb acting skills to boot, she is a force to be reckoned with. Her Violetta is elegant, full of poise and strong integrity (odd, given the nature of the character's reputation as a courtesan), while at the same time vulnerable and sincere in her love for Alfredo. Her rendition of 'sempre libera' is so exhilirating, it will leave one gasping for air.     Frank Lopardo wouldn't be my first choice for Alfredo. He lacks the vocal splendor and prowess of his betters, tending to sound uncomfortably forced in the upper tessitura. Both he and Gheorghiu make a handsome couple, and his fiery denunciation of Violetta toward the end of act three is surprisingly cold and menacing. It's just a shame he doesn't have the voice to back it up. Leo Nucci is Leo Nucci. There are definitely better Germonts out there, but his Italianate sense of authority brings an authenticity to a mostly non-Italian cast (I think I'm quoting the leaflet here, but it's true!).     While Gheorghiu sparkles in this production, the true hero is undoubtedly Sir Georg Solti. The maestro conducts this piece with a delicate touch that is rare even for him. His London players give their all, achieving superb levels of nuance. By producing an eerily 'empty' sound, they brought a sense of unfulfillable longing in the prelude, echoing Violetta's ill-fated romance. While most of Verdi's works are typically laced with doom laden overtones, here it is absent. This is possibly the most intimate of his operas, and Solti's extensive operatic experience shines through with his probing and surprisingly revelatory reading of the score which wrenches the heart through to it's climactic end. When you take his theatrical, and often bombastic approach out of the equation, one is left with a rare, unparalleled beauty that is more than just noteworthy... it's miraculous.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is a great movie and it is so well known in the art house circle that I don't even have to rave about this movie.  But, please.  Do not read the review by this person.  He pretty much gives away the final twist.  This is not fair for the people who have not watched the film yet.  If you want to enjoy the film, I beg you - please do not read the review!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First of all i have never played Final Fantasy 7 or any of the  other final fantsy's.<br /><br />Either way this movie looked wonderful. So i preordered it.<br /><br />The movie itself deserves 10 stars. The characters and environments were beautifully made.<br /><br />It probably would have helped if i knew what had happened in the actual game but at least it gives you something to figure out. It is a small thing put together of the game, only bad thing is its in japanese...<br /><br />One thing that almost all these reviews are missing is the music. The music is wonderful, very instrumental. And it seemed to match the scene well.<br /><br />The story seemed good, was kind of hard to understand. The only other place i have seen FF characters at is in Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. So that is the only place i know them from.<br /><br />Now i am going to do something people really hate. I enjoyed the english version of this movie. The actors and actresses all seemed to fit into the characters the played. The only creepy one was Kadaj or whatever his name was. But i think he was suppose to be creepy. I think people that talk bad about english voice actors are crazy. But i would rather listen to them then keep my eyes pasted to the bottom of the screen reading subtitles.<br /><br />Over all<br /><br />This movie was great, i would definitely buy it again if i needed to. The bonus features were mostly trailers and stuff. The package looked great. This movie may have inspired me to want to try one of these Final Fantasy games.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|It's a comment that sure rings true: on South Park, Cartman speaks of an injustice while Michael Bay continues to make movies. While Bad Boys, Armageddon and the Rock had cool action sequences, they were also ADD-influenced in its editing and the emotional parts of the film just rang absolutely hollow. Anyone remember the animal cracker scene from Armageddon? Well imagine a love story that's perfect for Days of Our Lives and you find a really hollow effort but with great effects. <br /> <br />Obviously set around the time of the Pearl Harbor attacks in 1941, we actually instead follow 2 pilots Danny and Rafe as they end up falling in love for the same nurse, Evelyn. Rafe goes away, is presumed dead and Danny and Evelyn start a relationship. In soap opera fashion, Rafe comes back who's not happy then the attack starts. This continues until the Doolittle Raid to Tokyo. <br /> <br />If you want a great sound demo for your stereo you of course have to cue in the actual attack. Running just shy of a half hour, it's extremely well-done and worth the price of admission, or rent or purchase. ILM did a great job and it of course has that trailer shot everybody loves. Unfortunately it's the main reason to watch the film because it's essentially 90 minutes of bad dialogue until we get there. The same problem plagued Titanic where you can literally divide the film into 2 halves and the first suffers because it took so long to get to the 2nd. <br /> <br />The dialogue is that bad with some that are supposed to be inspired lines but come across as laughable, especially Colonel Doolittle's since it's essentially a big speech. The love story is of course laid on a bit thick and it's not a well-written one at that. Another problem is the certain faux-epicness of it all with big slow motion shots with planes flying overhead, big camera moves around people and it just makes me cringe since they have an almost indulgent feel about them.  <br /> <br />This is of course the big double dip where it includes everything they should've had on the original release. You get the commentaries, production diaries and featurettes as well as some historical documentaries. To add insult to injury, the historical looks have more substance than the actual film does. Oops. The director's cut adds some more gory shots that seem kind of sudden and out of the blue at times, especially with people's familiarity with the normal cut. <br /> <br />The effects are great but the film itself has a detached feel about it all, as if it's nothing more than a really cool action sequence. Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now's action sequences where exciting but also emotionally compelling where you felt the horrors of war, here it's just \\"look at the neat stuff!\\". I'm not demeaning the attack and massive loss of life but this film feels completely hollow in that regard. <br /> <br />I have no idea whether to recommend this or not so I'm going to give it the rating of a CR, meaning a cautious recommend. If you buy the film and love it then all the power to you but if you hated it, don't say I didn't warn you, this is Michael Bay after all.
B000EDWL82|5.0|What is apparent?  That this band is great.  Low, down grade lyricist, overlayed with stinging guitar riffs, easy base numbers and drums that bang.  I am listening to the band for the first time.  I can definately put comparisons with Interpol, early Joy Division, Echo and others, but Editors are definately none of the mentioned before.  They have a keen sense of what they like, want and where they are going.  Any time you can listen to the first 5 songs and not remember the last 14 and 1/2 minutes, you are in musical paradise.  That is what this album does to you, and more.  Highly recommended and needs to be within your playlist.  Going to be in top 10 for new in 2006.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Tron in many ways was supposed to be a big hit. It had ultra cutting-edge special effects for its time and the story seemed to be pretty cool. However the film, criticized for poor acting and a lack of a coherent plot made the film a minor success. Since then it's become a cult favorite with its audience steadily growing over the years. I actually first experienced Tron through Kingdom Hearts II, the Playstation 2 videogame with the world of Tron as one of its levels. I got interested in the movie so I rented it and while it's not to me buy worthy, it was certainly an entertaining film. <br /> <br />Tron isn't actually the computer world name but one of the main characters. I don't even know what the name of it is but anyway. The Master Control Program(MCP) has been turning the computer world into a kind of militaristic world, with second-in-command Sark making people play videogames until they \\"de-rez\\" or basically, die. Unfortunate for Flynn who is zapped into the computer world and has to team up with a program named Tron to defeat the MCP and save computer land. <br /> <br />Even typing that plot, part of me is thinking \\"good lord, that is kind of silly\\" but since I play quite a lot of videogames with tales of flying fortresses and airships and mystical beasts, I just let it slide. Some people couldn't figure out the plot but to me it kind of made sense although I'm no computer expert so all the \\"geek speak\\" tends to fly over my head. <br /> <br />What attracts people to Tron is most likely the animation which is one of the first if not the first heavily-CGI extensive film and while it doesn't have the pristine shine of recent films, it's certainly quite a visual feast, especially if you're watching it for the first time. The much-praised lightcycle is just as cool as people describe it and the film's quite colorful. However I found that the novelty value went down where I wasn't wowed anymore and was like \\"okay, on with the story\\". Oddly enough the film didn'teven get nominated for Visual Effects Oscar since people thought they \\"cheated\\" by using a computer. Nowadays, every Visual Effect Oscar has to include computers. Screw models, matte paintings, miniatures and in-camera techniques and stunts, if you got a computer and you're talented at it, you could get nominated.  <br /> <br />It's a film that feels slow at times and story might be hokey but boy is it a blast to watch, just don't pay attention to most if not all of the acting at times.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|For all you Floyd/Gilmour fans if you're expecting some heavy,aggressive Floydian style music forget it.  If you're expecting anything like his last one was \\"About Face\\" from 1984, nothing like it.  It is definitely on the mellow side which isn't entirely bad but for my personal taste prevented it from being a 5 star review. I would have liked a few more rockers myself.  IT really reminds me alot of the film soundtrack \\"More\\" by Floyd from 69'if any of you old timers are familiar with that one. Moody,light & smooth.  Definitely night time music.  He has his bandmate Rick Wright on keyboards for a couple of songs, Crosby&Nash on the title track & Phil (Roxy Music) Manzenera ironically enough on keyboards too instead of his normal excellent guitar playing.  Still Gilmour managed to come out with an entertaining & enjoyable disc.  As long as you don't mind \\"Mellow\\" you will still be pleased with the results.  Think of it as listening to Pink Floyd \\"LIGHT\\" - Larry Anger

B00000I07P|5.0|As the 20th anniversary of this album approaches, I take measure as to how much the music on this album has been loved over so much time. It still sells thousands of copies weekly. It has become a staple in the CD case of any rocker, and most importantly, it is a lot of fun to listen to. \\"You give Love a Bad Name\\" is a classic rock anthem that will live on through later decades as one of the best hard rock songs ever written. The same goes for \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" and \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". It's subsquent twin album entitled, \\"NEW JERSEY\\" is awesome too and enjoyed almost as much success as this album did. I would expect nothing less from the album that put BON JOVI on the level of super-stardom. Thanks Jon, Richie, David, Alec and Tico!! Rock on!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This was actually the first Coldplay CD I have ever bought. I remember watching the Wicker Park movie and fell in love with \\"The Scientist\\" so I decided to check out the band and wow. I don't regret buying this CD. At first I thought it was okay but after listening to the whole CD for a couple of days, I am hooked. I love it. It's really great. Very mellow, and great music.  <br /> <br />Some of my favorite songs are:  <br />*Speed of sound <br />*What if? <br />*Square One <br />*Hardest Part <br /> <br />But the whole CD is great. I highly recommend it.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Trent Reznor is at times a victim of his own success. It seems like some people seem to expect some new level of enlightment with each NIN album. First off, No, this album is by no means to be compared to TDS or The Fragile. In fact, this album seems a more likely follow up to Pretty Hate Machine than either of those albums. This album is not the emotional roller-coaster of the most recent albums. It is, however, a top-to-bottom tight little album with some very good material. Given, there is some filler, but all of the singles off this album are extremely well done (particulary \\"Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only, both of which conjure up images of the days of yore when we were in single digit Halos), and the last song \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is a superb closer(if you like the album cut, I hope you had the opportunity to see it live on the most recent tour). Die hards and new fans alike will enjoy this album, and I recommend it not only as a NIN fan but to any music fan as one of the best albums of 2005.
1400079179|4.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. It was an interesting idea, although there was nothing particularly unusual in it. It was rather predictable in spots, but when all was said and done, it was a pretty good thriller. I listened to the unabridged audio version and wished I bought the abridged version instead because there was too much filler about the sacred feminine and all the secret societies that was just plain boring to listen to.<br /><br />I'm left with the feeling that the reason people are making such a fuss about the book is because they halfway believe in its premise that Jesus lived and married Mary Magdalene and moved with her to France where they had a child, the descendant of whom just happens to be Robert Langdon's companion, Sophie. To these people I have to say, \\"It's fiction, folks!\\"<br /><br />However, looking at it purely as a thriller, it holds its own in that area. Brown knows how to write an action scene even he if does separate the action scenes with long, boring expository passages. As long as the reader remembers that it is fiction and doesn't take it seriously, it's a good book.
B000B5H7QO|5.0|This is definitely an excellent special edition release, but it's just a shame that it wasn't released everywhere as a special edition.  These live tracks will probably end up on a boxed set someday, but what can you do?  If you're a big RP fan, <br />you just have to have it.  This is great added value to an already superb album.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I've seen this movie in Japenese with English Subtitles, and pure English. Even though I had to watch the subtitles, it was MUCH better. The voices suck, just from how they sound and everything. I'll purchase this though for the special featurse, but the japanese original is much better.
B000E0LB8G|5.0|Universal deserves our thanks for making these seminal performances available once again, at mid-price and with the addition of three top drawer sonatas to boot.  I own the fortepiano/period instrument cycles of Levin/Gardiner, Lubin/Hogwood, Newman/Simon and Tan/Norrington.  The Lubin and Levin cycles are my favorites and I can't really decide which is better.  Both are well played and conducted.  Both also use different fortepianos to match the increasing demands Beethoven placed upon the instrument as the mechanical and range capabilities improved and his style matured.  The orchestras are both colorful and handle their parts with aplomb - no sawing or scraping strings or squawking woodwinds here.  The instruments reveal all sorts of wonderful details that tend to be swamped by modern strings.  <br /> <br />I would have preferred the performers tackle the Choral Fantasy and the Triple Concerto as well when these were recorded, but the sonatas make a nice bonus.  <br /> <br />With Levin/Gardiner increasing hard to find and commanding high prices on the used market, my advice is to snap this one up while its generally available.  You won't be disappointed.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|To define this movie as anything but magnificent is outrageous! They've really done a number with it. It definately outbids its predecessor, 'Spirits Within', which ultimately... 'sucked'. Despite their response to the latest Chrono Trigger Remakes from their devoted fans, they have stolen my heart again with one of the greatest stories of all time...
068485743X|5.0|If you have ever tried to write a novel, you know the huge battle that is. Having written 6 novel-length manuscripts before I had one that I thought worthy of sending to an agent, I was grateful that I read this book before I burned my one and only chance with these agents. When you consider the perspective of agents--people who are flooded with amateur manuscrips--you appreciate this book much more. Consider the POV of an agent: you get thousands of queries, hundreds of manuscripts and many, many of them suck. You're looking for reasons to reject them. This book told me everything I could do to avoid being an easy toss for an agent.<br />  I thought I had already rewritten my novel enough. After reading this, I went through my novel chapter by chapter and fixed problems I had not been aware of. I went through and removed 1,000 adverbs. I confirmed that I had not used excessive adjectives. I did a rewrite for active verbs. I did another for consistency. I'm currently working on yet another one and boy am I grateful that I saw this book. You only get once chance to make a first impression on an agent. I am grateful to Mr. Lukeman now for preventing me from hacking off my own foot.<br />  In the coming months when I again approach my Agent's Market, looking for an agent, I will be damned grateful for Mr. Lukeman. No certainty that I will get my novel published but I sure feel better about it after reading this book and following its guidance.
B000056OBA|4.0|I quite agree to the first reviewer.. having Karajan's 1955 (London) and 1963 (BPO) cycles and having heard the other two. However, the uniform Karajan is not necessarily the best Beethoven.. though it is a good introduction. Please don't forget: <br /> <br />a) Furtwaengler version of 9th, be that the intense war time recording (1942) (music and arts, Berkeley) or post war, for example Bayreuth Festival in 1951.. this is the definition. <br /> <br />b) Also Furtwangler for a fine studio recording of 5th and 7th with VPO  <br /> <br />c) Kleiber's 5th. <br /> <br />d) Bernstein's Nos. 3 <br /> <br />e) Bruno Walter's version of Pastoral (No. 6)
B000001G16|3.0|Richie Sambora, guitarist of stadium rockers we all know (and either loathe or love) put this disc out in those bygone days of 1991 and - surprised us.<br /><br />We didn't get a bunch of 2nd rate BJ tunes. We didn't get endless widdly diddly excess nor crap attempts at showing a blues/roots tinge.<br /><br />What we got was an album that really opened up some possibilities for Richie. There were typical soft rock tunes like hit 'Ballad of Youth', youthful love gone wrong tracks like 'Rosie' but there was also more on display.<br /><br />The more on display is a guy with some body to his music, with an ear for a decent tune, a guy who with this album has perhaps shown the world that he isn't just a guitar player but a musician.<br /><br />Taken as a whole I can't give this album more than three stars as it's a bit overwrought in places and a little too understated too often/too long in other parts. But it does give anyone into melodic hard rock or BJ or afficianados of 80's rock a real glimpse at a guy who definitely has a voice of his own. Any fan of this genre should try to at least hear this disc. More metal fans may find the whole thing somewhat wanting in ooommpphhh.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark Knopfler gets a bit more rootsy with each new CD.  In this one he has added a fiddle and mandolin and some of the songs have an \\"old-timey\\" Appalachian flavor to them.  Emmylou Harris's folksy soprano is perfect for the music.  One wishes Knopfler would have taken the next step, added a banjo, and tried a couple of bluegrass numbers.  Oh, well.  Next album.      The rootsy atmosphere doesn't extend to Knopfler's electric guitar -- the highlight of the CD -- as his coloratura picking weaves in and out of the lyrics, unmistakenly Knopler with not a single note too many nor too few. \\"This is Us\\" is the single from the CD and it's probably the most rocking number.  There are others I liked more: \\"I Dug up a Diamond\\" is beautiful with a great mandolin in addition to Knopfler's guitar.  \\"Donkey Town\\" is one of the semi-strange Knopfler songs that sometimes work. Of special note is \\"If This is Goodbye,\\" about the fall of Flight 93 on 9/11.  It's lovely, sad and touching -- a virtual showcase for Emmylou's voice and Knopfler's guitar. There's not a clunker on the whole CD.                Harris is the perfect duet partner for about any male singer whose vocal range is from A to B.  That's Knopfler -- whose gruff mumble still manages to be appealing. This is a CD full of classy, quality listening music that falls somewhere between the genres of Rock, Folk, and Country.           Smallchief
B000BB1MIC|2.0|In my opinion, season 5 is when the girls start their not-so-graceful swandive to mediocrity. The emphasis of the show turns to Yale and Richard and Emily and the Huntzbergers so much so that the show is starting to resemble a \\"Who's who of upper class Conneticut\\" advertisement. Less and less time is spent in Stars Hollow, and former regulars on the show don't get the airtime they deserve. Suki, Jackson, Miss Patty, Babette (what happened to Maury anyway? He's simply disappeared from the show!) and even Taylor are rare sights these days.  <br />It's hard to complain about Lorelia's character, on her own she's fabulous. But when paired with Luke? The show has deflated noticably since this unfortunate turn.  <br />The same goes for Rory. Once a strong, independent character, she has been reduced to half of the Logan/Rory combination. By making the two women of the show half of a couple takes away from the girl power message the show started out with. They now need men to save them, like Luke loaning Lorelai the money and Logan (in season 6) sweeping in to save the paper just hours before publication. <br />The show was at its peak when it revolved around Stars Hollow. Season five isn't all bad, but it's the beginning of the end. Season 6 has bright spots, but they are few and far between. Who knows what will happen once Amy and Dan Palladino leave after this season? It's sad when a show overstays its welcome, as this one is in danger of doing.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I'd rate this movie 3.5. I'm not familiar with the Aeon Flux cartoon series, but after watching some clips from the Special Features of the DVD, I actually prefer the movie.  The cartoon Aeon has spazzy hair, is scantily clad in some strange male-fantasy sort of way, and I was a little disturbed by the scene of a man sticking his wiggling tongue into a woman's ear.  Borderline pornographic if you ask me.  <br /> <br />The movie version took some license, softened the hues, made the Bregna world stylish and organic.  I admit the plot is a bit oversimplified and the characters dramatically flat, but the physical action is a pleasure to watch. Charlize made for a gracefully efficient and lethal Aeon Flux.  She maimed her victims with elegance.  Somewhat contradictory in terms, but the action was very fluid and feminine.  I do like that director Karyn Kurasama chose to make a sci-fi futureworld that was very beautiful versus the traditional industrial, hardcore, burnt out look. Think of this movie as the softer version of the Matrix in haute couture.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Come On Feel The Illinoise has got to be the most beautiful CD I've ever owned. Treat yourself to this soulful, whimsical and amazing listening journey!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack as soon as I walked out of the theatre. So it wasn't long before it plopped itself into my stereo and it really does kick some butt.<br /><br />The production values do vary a touch and there are tunes from a couple of different spectrums of rock music but it all hangs together, amusing snippets of dialogue from the movie helpt break it up and remind you of how much you liked the film, which helps the soundtrack along too.<br /><br />While some of the more known songs on this disc would perhaps take the glory, it must be said that some of the originals that were written for the movie are true to the era and are darn fine too, so you don't have to worry about wading through garbage to find the good bits.<br /><br />For more immediate comparisons, this CD is better than the soundtrack to Rock Star, for instance.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool have a reputation for being \\"deep\\".  Most often, being overly deep - to the point of ridiculousness.  They're not.  They just choose some really esoteric things to use as metaphors for otherwise very simple things. <br /> <br />This album opens with \\"Stinkfist\\", a song that hits you like a sledgehammer, it's so heavy.  On the surface, it seems to be about a particularly painful-sounding and disgusting sexual practice.  In fact, it's actually a heartfelt song about the necessity to shock people in order to get them to pay attention to anything these days. <br /> <br />This is pretty much epitomal of Tool.  They're a heavy metal band - heavier than most, even, given their focus on bass guitar and drums - but they're also perfectionist composers.  Their music is intricate, and gives the impression that it's been put together like a thousand-piece puzzle.  Sometimes it's hard to believe that all that music comes from only one guitar, one bass, one set of drums and one singer. <br /> <br />This album is the central Tool album.  If you're interested in Tool, maybe heard some of their songs on the radio, or just been recommended by a friend (who possibly preached Tool at you like some kind of religious fanatic), this is where you start. <br /> <br />Talking about the songs is almost impossible.  There's pretty much nothing out in the mainstream to compare Tool to, and still very little outside the mainstream.  You really have to listen to it yourself, see if you like it. <br /> <br />But the thing is, pretty much everyone likes Tool.  Or, to put it another way, almost nobody hates Tool.  Those who do have either misunderstood that the \\"deep\\" elements of Tool are tongue-in-cheek, or they've got something wrong with their brain. <br /> <br />Anyway, the gist is this:  This album is a masterpiece of expertly composed music, clever/fun lyrics, and pointless interludes.  Yeah, nearly half the tracks are short clips of strange noises, but the quality and length of the actual music is such that you really won't care (in fact, there are many who complain that these silly interludes are missing from Tool's later albums). <br />
B000777J2S|5.0|Let me start by saying that I recognize that this album is an acquired taste. I can imagine that many listeners will find Antony too dramatic, too depressing, too eccentric, too this, too that. Let me also acknowledge that a lot of my favorite artists are acquired tastes--Bjork, Belle and Sebastian, and so on. I might be more likely to fall for something that is supposedly \\"mannered\\" than other music lovers. <br /> <br />More importantly, though, I want to say that this is the most strikingly beautiful and moving album I have heard in years. Antony's singing and songwriting are rich, haunting, and soulful, and I cannot say enough positive things about him. To me, this is a perfect record. Nothing sounds out of place, nothing feels forced. The first song is absolutely heartbreaking, as is the last, and there are several highlights along the way--the stately \\"My Lady Story,\\" the compassionate \\"You Are My Sister,\\" the rousing \\"Fistfull of Love.\\" While there are several \\"celebrity\\" guest spots on the record, you never forget who the real star of the show is.  <br /> <br />Again, I can understand why people might not like Antony, but in this day and age there is no excuse for purchasing an album and feeling duped because you realize you dislike the singer's voice or style. Listen to sound clips on Amazon or elsewhere--you should be able to tell from that if you completely hate his vocals, and you'll know to avoid his recordings.  <br /> <br />For those of you that do like Antony, I recommend checking out the EP's he has released for this album, which contain several excellent B-sides. I'd also recommend checking out his \\"I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy\\" EP, which contains three songs that you cannot find on any of his albums. Amazon doesn't seem to be selling it right now (there are used copies that are going for almost $70), but you can purchase it for $8 plus shipping and handling on his official site. I think the \\"Dead Boy\\" EP in particular is essential listening for fans of this particular album.  <br /> <br />
0743454537|5.0|I Love this book, Jodi Picoult has a way of writing to make you feel like you are actually having the person she is writing about sitting next to you telling you the story in person. I could actually visualize the characters.. This was a very easy read for me, I didn't want to stop reading it.  The ending was such a shock I wasn't expecting it.. This was the first book of hers I have read.  Now she has a permanent fan in me, Great book.
B00005JOUM|3.0|I thought Inside Man had its moments but was a little too much talk and not enough action. It starts off great and drags a little towards the end. I enjoy most of Spike Lees movies but this one wasent so amazing as some of his others. If your bored go too the cinema you might be suprised but I didnt think too much of it.
B000000OMB|5.0|When the super-group Asia came together, there were some big expectations that followed the group. John Wetton (from King Crimson and UK), Steve Howe (from Yes), Geoff Downs (from Yes and the lesser-known Buggles), and Carl Palmer (from ELP). While there were doubtless many expectations as to what would be the end result of this grouping of great musicians, this album was a runaway hit in 1982 (and, selling in excess of 6 million copies, was also the biggest-selling album that year). <br /> <br />Asia's self-titled first album is a true classic in 80s rock and roll. John Wetton's singing and song-writing meshes beautifully with the excellent music produced by these very talented musicians. It is a shame that Asia--in this classic line-up--only lasted a mere two albums, but enjoy those two, because on those two albums are some of the finest rock music you'll find.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|This movie was outstanding for a couple of reasons. First was the fact that it accurately portrayed the marine lifestyle exactly as it was during the early 1990's. I hear everyone who saw this movie say there was not enough action, or that people in the marines were portrayed wrongly. But this is how it happened. This was the Gulf War. Dont give the movie a bad review or think of it as \\"crappy\\" or \\"boring\\" just because it is true to life and doesnt have Hollywood type action. This movie blew me away with its authenticity and I was shocked at the bluntness of the films portryal. Overall, absolutely amazing!
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I loved Rihanna's last CD Music of the Sun and I just couldn't wait for this one to drop. This album is definitly a step up from Music of the Sun. My favorite songs are We Ride, Kisses Don't Lie, SOS (Rescue Me), Unfaithful, and If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part 2). If you liked, just liked Music of the Sun you will love A Girl Like Me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After just completing what I thought was an eloquent review of this RH masterpiece, I got an error page when I hit the \\"Preview your review\\" button, so I'm just putting my 2 cents (and 5 stars) in, no eloquence necessary.  Read the other 5 star reviews; there's nothing I'd write, the spirit of which is not found elsewhere in the 1900+ reviews of this seminal work.
0393327655|2.0|This book denies evolution in religion and cites its stagnation as a problem in modern times because of extremists and fundamentalists who interpret religious texts literally. Though I do not personally subscribe to any religion, this seemingly atheistic bias of the author seems condescending to his intended audience, and therefore, ineffective. Additionally, the author needs to conduct more research in religious texts and traditions or consult other people who have studied these things.  His information seems suspect at points.  Read it if you're curious, but don't just believe everything the author says.  There are inaccuracies, falacies, and misrepresentations throughout this book.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|Stevie Wonder's \\"Original Musiquarium I\\" goes beyond the traditional greatest hits package by offering 16 songs of rhythmic unity. A few tracks - notably \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" and \\"Do I Do\\" - are uncut versions that never reached the Top 40 airwaves. \\"Superstition,\\" \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman,\\" \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\" and \\"Sir Duke\\" remain essentials in this timeless collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|The first Tool album I ever bought was Aenima.  Hearing Tool for the first time was somewhat of a shock.  It took me a while to get used to this band.  I was pretty young, probably like 14 or 15.  Now I'm 18.  I bought Undertow next, then Lateralus.  I don't really like comparing Tool albums on a \\"better/worse than scale\\" because I think each of their albums are just pieces of art that have to be experienced and critiqued in and amongst themselves.  There are many reasons why I consider Lateralus (and the other albums) to be some of the finest music ever made.  From the beginning of this album to the final track, the flow is perfect from song to song.  It weaves in and out of each track seamlessly and when pieced together feels like one story.  I feel like I can listen to the album all the way through comfortably.  The instrumentation is solid as usual.  Danny Carey drives this band and makes the drumset have a \\"tone\\" or \\"voice\\" unlike other drummers who do not know how to do this.  I guess that college music education comes in handy.  The lyrics on this album are some of the most intelligent and inspired I've heard.  I think my favorite lyrics are on \\"Reflection\\".  \\"The Grudge\\" is, in my opinion, the best opening track off of any Tool album yet.  It begins solid and ends solid and is intriguing all the way through.  The ending leads perfectly to \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\".  Here I am rambling on about this album.  The bottom line is, if you haven't experienced Tool you need to.  The music that's out today just won't cut it for me.  It's just too damn generic.  It doesn't feel like art.  Lateralus is high art.  Buy it, then Undertow.  Listen to those for awhile and then buy Aenima.  Dive in head first and enjoy the beauty of Tool.
B00000GV55|5.0|This debut album by HC is in my opinion the most demanding than the rest of their works. It is also the one HC album that I discover a new thing with every time I listen to it, even I listened to it unnumerable times over the years. I am happy then for this ReR release which gives the most adequate and splendid representation of the old original.  <br /> <br />As for the ground and pillars of HC I do not fall into the line of other reviewers here. Being aware of that HC attracted most of its listerners from the prog secene at the time, its roots is not to be found only in progmusic. According to Cutler the average prog bands were not an inspiration to them, including Crimson and Giant. Soft Machine is named though, and at times you will hear small echoes of that, they also used to play some Soft and Mole covers at live performances. Roots is to be found as well as much in contemporary avant garde compositional music such as for instance Schoenberg, Cowell and Stockhausen and in modern jazz etc. In fact HC had a very wide range of inspiration and were not as narrow in their approach as the typical prog bands, including the canterbury scene. In HC both new classical music, jazz, blues, and rock meets, but without fusing in a predictable way and still remaining their very own signature. In this way HC is unique and have made music that will be such, \\"new\\" and original, as well as musically progressive, in the true sense of the word, for many many more years to come.  A classical band!
B00005JOFQ|4.0|This is a very good movie and it is not definitively a \\"gay cowboy movie\\".  In some sense it is based in a kind of story that exists since ancient times: stories of men alone can be found in the Gospels, other biblical stories, and in Arthurian and Knights romances (where tragic or unfulfilled love is so common) so Ang Lee's depiction of a conventional theme is not so rare, in some sense America should feel proud that this Taiwanese humble man directed this beautiful story set in an All-American ambiance: the Rocky Mountains.    Very slow at its first part (this is a very long movie like all epics as Gone With the Wind and others) to show the repeated and boring routine of the work of these two men turned into shepherds during the Summer; the movie presents a very good turn at its last part where the conflict explodes showing how the lives of many people (Ennis and Jack families) were affected.  Two scenes in closed atmospheres were superb: at a family house which I don't tell and in a trailer.  Acting was surprisingly good at this last part of the movie, specially by two female actors:  Linda Cardellini as the waitress and Kate Mara as Alma Jr. (age 19).    As for Heath Ledger, what can I say?  He should had won the Oscar in the Best Actor Category for his portrayal of this quiet and disturbed childhood cowboy, amazing!
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is my favorite Beatles album. <br /> <br />What makes it my favorite? For one, its songs are catchy. \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"The Word\\" preserve the catchy pop hooks of earlier Beatles albums like A Hard Day's Night. \\"Michelle\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are beautiful, melodic ballads. <br /> <br />More important, however, are the maturity and depth of songs like \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Nowhere Man.\\" On Rubber Soul, Lennon and McCartney show their ability to write about deeper subjects than pretty girls and broken hearts. Contrast \\"Run For Your Life,\\" with lyrics like \\"I'd rather see you dead than with another man,\\" with \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold your Hand.\\" Rubber Soul represents the Beatles at the end of their teeny-bopper phase, looking forward to a future of introspection, meditation, and, of course, drug experimentation. <br /> <br />Rubber Soul is what got the Beatles moving. The innovation and creativity that appears for the first time on Rubber Soul later created such masterpieces as Revolver, the White Album, and Abbey Road. Without it, Rock music would surely have developed differently. <br /> <br />For these reasons, Rubber Soul is essential to any Rock fan's collection.
B000002LOM|3.0|Kill Uncle is my least favorite Morrissey album for two reasons: first, the production is flat and has a tacky 80's feel to it. second, the songs sound directionless and dull. there are a few exceptions, \\"Sing Your Life\\" is a charming tune that has a really great upright bass sound and a simple melody line that is very nice. if the remainder of Kill Uncle carried the charm of this one song, then all would be well, but alas, it's not so. there are some dreadful songs on here, for starters, \\"Mute Witness\\" with it's cheesy keyboard vamp and electric guitar that sounds like it was ripped straight off of a Mike & the Mechanics album. eck. thankfully, it's not all such a thud...\\"Driving Your Girlfriend Home\\" and \\"King Leer\\" both have twisted vocal lines and a weird sense of melody that seems hard to get into upon first listens. but after repeated spins, grows very deep. both are very cool songs. i also like \\"(I'm) The End Of The Family Line\\" which sounds like a it could have been a lost b-side of The Smiths. so, from the whole album, these are the only songs that i really like (hmmm....i think i would be a little more drawn to \\"Tony The Pony\\" if it were a b-side); not the greatest moment in the Morrissey discography.
B0000035E7|5.0|First of all this has to be the best CD I own.  This is the first CD I ever bought.  I have every single Nirvana CD out there including: With The Lights Out Box Set, Sliver: Best of The Box, Nirvana, Nevermind, In Utero, Insesticide, MTV Unplugged In NY, From The Muddy Banks of Wishkah, and more. <br /> <br />This CD is raw and really intense.  Who really cares what Kurt spent on the recording.  The total overveiw of the cd has to be the best out of all of them.  The Cd has the best songs I have heard.  No matter what I could be listening to(Metallica, Pantera, Alice In Chains, Slayer) I can still turn on Bleach and think its the best because it is! <br /> <br />If you like anything hard/grunge, with Nirvana, and you want something heavier than Nevermind GET THIS.  Also the box set has alot of good stuff on that.  But this is better recorded than anything on the Box Set. The overall quality is better. <br /> <br />Need Nirvana? Need Something by Nirvana Heavier than Bleach? <br />GET THIS! <br /> <br />
6304884419|4.0|I have watched this movie quite a few times, since it came out. I think the movie has a great story. The acting is excellent, and it reminds me of watching a Martin Scorcese movie.<br /><br />The story of a mob boss and hard working father battling over a son's future. Includes some interesting characters and a well done set. Also, music is included in the movie well. Starting with The Same Ol' Song and Dance by Frank Sinatra.<br /><br />Well worth seeing! and the star of the film, probably wish he didn't try to live out the life of a gangster in real life.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I am not a music purist nor do I try to over-analyze every aspect of every piece of music in my collection.  What I can boil it down to is \\"Do I enjoy this CD?\\", \\"Does It Make Me Feel Good?\\" \\"Would I recommend this to a friend?\\".  It may seem simple, but I spend less time complaining about a particular CD's faults and more time listening to its strengths.<br /><br />\\"Amarantine\\" does not disappoint. I soothes the soul and moves the heart just like Enya's music is supposed to do.  Yes, it is familiar but Enya does what she does best and Amarantine is no exception, just an enjoyable CD from beginning to end. Enya flows well in my changer on shuffle along with Conjure One, Digital moodz, Enigma, Amethystium and Delerium.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|FFVII is a great movie with beautiful animation, if you didnt play FFVII it might take a while to understand what is going on but once you figure it out, you will truly enjoy this movie.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|At the heart of the animated series' genius was the tension between Trevor and Aeon, sworn enemies that can't stand to get enough of each other.<br /><br />This was almost completely ignored in favor of a moldy old mystery plot and a vacant love story.<br /><br />Instead of any tension (or anything that even remotely matches the cleverness of any one of the old episodes), you have the product of a couple of screenwriters who \\"wanted to give a Hollywood feel to the story\\" (to paraphrase them, actually) and a director who doesn't seem to know how keep an action movie exciting.<br /><br />Any incarnation of Aeon Fluz should be character-driven. Aside from maybe selling tickets with Charlize Theron's star-power, I'm not sure what the hell was driving this one.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's last album Hail to the Thief was NOT a flop, it sold 940,000 copies in the US alone(which means CLOSE to Platinum but WAY PAST GOLD) and if that was UK sales it would mean close to 4 x Platinum(takes 250,000 copies to sell for a British Platinum album). This album has alot of great songs like 2 + 2 = 5, There There and my favorite A Wolf at the Door. Despite the album was held out of #1 by the dumbkuffs Alternica(formerly Metallica)'s St Anger and the late great Luther Vandross' Dance With My Father, this is still a great album. Sales don't mean squat and if they do then it's HEEGOTCHA for you!
B000002URV|5.0|This is simply one of best ambient new age CD's of the 90s and certainly the best I have heard.  I never get tired of this CD and have owned it since it's first release. It heightens the senses and soothes the soul.<br /><br />While the later Enigma offerings are not quite up to the same level Enigma III is not a bad second to this CD. Delerium's \\"Karma\\" is also a great CD, only the first CD by Deep Forest and anything from Amethystium (the best overall new age composer) and Digital Moodz.
B000002TQV|5.0|1993 was the year that Radiohead released their debut known as Pablo Honey. It was a mixture of pop and grunge, with the hit song Creep. Fastforward 2 years later, and they released The Bends: the band's 1st masterpiece.<br /><br />Before I go any further, allow me to say that I liked the poppy grunge of Pablo Honey, being the hardcore Radiohead fan that I am. But I can't deny that this was a big improvment over Honey. The Bends still has, in my opinion, a little bit of a feel of that pop left. But it's.... deep pop (if such a thing exists). Take the song Just (one of my favorites off the record). It has those poppy (yet breathtaking) guitar riffs that were found on Pablo Honey. The chorus also has kind of a pop feel to it: \\"You do it to yourself, just you. You, and no one else.\\" And while it may be, um, \\"radio-friendly,\\" but its still one of the best off the album. High And Dry is another one of my personal favorites off The Bends. It strangley reminds me of the Rolling Stones' song Wild Horses, as it has that beautiful acoustic feel throughout it. I also like the wind effects at the beginning of Planet Telex, which was a sign of Radiohead experimenting with sounds (which would become more obvious of their next 4 albums, which were Ok Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail To The Theif).<br /><br />I don't know much about the chart history of The Bends, but if this didn't top the charts, shame on all of those fools overlooking this timeless masterpiece and wasting their money on an album from a fake band like Milli Vanilli.<br /><br />If you're looking for a catchy album with lots of depth, one of the best albums of the 90s, an album that will reassure you that there was actually GOOD music in the 90s, then this album is for you.<br /><br />I'm already a hardcore Radiohead fan, and you could be too- join the club!<br /><br />P.S. Whoever lowered this album rating from 5 stars to 4.5 should be hanged. Same with whoever lowered Ok Computer's rating from 5 to 4.5.4.5.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Here we go again. Some nondescript no talent music maven wanting to go against the grain and show how cool he/she is by writing something that will stem the tide of popular opinion. Oooh, how cool!<br /><br />Just give the CD a listen. It's a perfect melding of two musicians who go back a long way and have collaborated on numerous projects. Anyone who has seen them perform together on the Ovation Channel's great folk recordings with the likes of the McGariggle Sisters, Loudon and Rufus Wainwright, etc. would know that these two go back at least a decade. They have had ample time to hone their craft. Name a better guitarist? Name a better folk singer? Sometimes truth must rise to the surface.<br /><br />Some people must have proverbial tin ears. Even literal ones. I really must chuckle again, after rereading &quot;the official&quot; Amazon reviewer's take. I hate to be caustic, but in this instance, wrong reviewer for wrong CD. And that statement alone will probably get this review booted. But really, if the emperor is naked, might as well at least whistle. He might at least have time to run for his skivvies.<br /><br />These are great arrangements, great songs, great harmonies...in short... a wonderful recording from two of the best talents in the music &quot;industry&quot; today. In fact, if you sit back and listen to them as they mesh their musical geniuses, you might forget about such terms and just enjoy pure, unadulterated talent at play. Highly, highly, recommended.<br /><br />BEK
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I'm not a fan of the Final Fantasy games, so this film was not a trip into a familiar fantasy world for me. I DID see the previous deeply flawed \\"Final Fantasy\\" motion picture. Like that film, this one has a number of story and pacing problems.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I have a number of friends who absolutely LOVE the FFVII game that this film expands upon. I'm afraid it just didn't keep my attention.<br /><br />Sure, the animation is top notch, and many of the film's moments are arrestingly unique; but I just never connected to the dozen or so central characters. Too many subplots, too many characters, no central focus to the story.
014028009X|5.0|After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book.  This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today.  Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading.  That takes talent, in my book.  In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics).  You cant help but root for Bridget. <br /> <br />I recommend this book and its sequel.  Most everyone will get a good laugh out of it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Funny thing, I gave this movie as a gift to my 2 nieces, one of 6 years old and the other of 7, I was a little worried they would not like it, because the film was made in 1985, but when I asked them if they liked it, they said: <br /> <br />\\"Yes, it is really good, like Dora the Explorer!\\" <br /> <br />Of course, I had to ask why they said so, and they answered things like: <br /> <br />\\"That kid Mouth, he speaks English and Spanish, just like Dora!\\" <br /> <br />\\"They have a map, like Dora!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Data has a backpack with a lot of things\\" <br /> <br />\\"They are looking for a treasure and those bad guys want to take their treasure, like Swiper the Fox.\\" <br /> <br />And so on... <br /> <br />It looks like that since \\"Treasure Island\\", the stories of a journey, a map, a treasure and the frienship made along the adventure will always trap the minds of kids of any generation. <br /> <br />If you are worried about Mouth dirty language, trust me your kids will hear worse \\"expressions\\" from their class-mates at school... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki may have written the first book on accounting that is not boring to average people.  His lessons on the history of taxes and corporations are eye opening, and the fact that he's still shaking up the rankings so many years after the release says a lot about his business skills.
B00005QSMU|3.0|Comedienne Molly Shannon recreates her Saturday Night Live character, Mary Katherine Gallagher, the gawky catholic school girl, for the big screen. At times, the film is very funny. Unfortunately, it is not very funny as often as one would like. What works great as a five minute skit on Saturday Night Live does not necessarily make for a great full length, feature film, even though quite a few of the Saturday Night Live regulars have parts in it.<br /><br />The film revolves around Mary Katherine Gallagher and her attempts to fit in and make the most popular boy in the school want her the way she wants him. She also wants to be a superstar in the worst way, even though her grandmother with whom she lives wants her to become a business woman. She does get her big break, however, when her school has a talent contest.<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when Mary Katherine, absorbed in her romantic fantasies and impervious to her surroundings, has a one sided conversation with an apparent fantasy lover for whom she substitutes a tree as a stand in. At times, she even acts out her romantic fantasy with the tree. Imagine it with a nun standing in the background observing Mary Katherine. It is hilarious. Unfortunately, those moments are few and far between. Still, if you are a Mary Katherine Gallagher fan, you will enjoy the film. If not, you may be disappointed.
0312323859|5.0|I only realized that this book has a prequel after i read the whole thing in about 8 hours and went online to check it out, see for myself if others enjoyed reading it like i did.  I didn't know \\"Something Borrowed\\" was sort of a \\"Part I\\" of \\"Something Blue\\".  Anyhow, i read it in a flash because i just couldn't stop! I think Darcy is a real character in a sense that i believe there are many women like her in reality. I also know that a person like her can change for the better. Others may find the Ethan/Darcy relationship so predictable which i did too, but i really don't care because she deserves true happiness with him who came to love her unconditionally. I might not have read the first book yet (i will) but my point is, in every successful, true, faithful and honest LOVE a couple or someone is having inspite of deceits, trials, temptations, break-ups, infidelities in the past, there's always a true story behind it. And it's usually romantic. Just like on the reviews i've read about \\"Something Borrowed\\", im sure the main characters ended right, they have their own love story to tell, so is with Darcy. There's actually a moral lesson from this book that i discovered. How i wish all Darcy-like women out there not necessarily have to be getting hitched will be able to read this and make something good of their lives as well.<br /><br />I recommend this to all my girlfriends who would like to read a book for a change and actually read a non-fiction fiction. I mean, the \\"story\\" is not real, but it is true in reality. It's full of composures, anger, hate, sex i might add, forgiveness, self-realization, courage, gossip, even fashion and glamour, pride,(i will not add surprises but there are tid bits), but most importantly, love.<br /><br />Three thumbs up for this one for making me read a book after so many years of long pause and finished it within few hours! And to think i just happened to walk by the \\"books\\" aisle at Costco! There was \\"something in that blue\\" color of this book that caught my eyes and made me picked it up! Good thing I favor bluet caught my eyes and made me picked it up! Good thing I favor blue
B0001E5TTC|4.0|Russell Crowe is, without a doubt, very good in \\"Gladiator\\", but Tom Hanks in \\"Cast Away\\" is superb. It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.<br /><br />This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.<br /><br />Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.<br /><br />The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared. Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away. It is here that the picture falters somewhat, as there is no happy ending and the film ends somewhat unresolved. Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.t washes ashore.

B0000640VO|4.0|Okay, so yes this movie is completely unrealistic and does not have tons of depth to some of the peripheral characters, and many of the situations are strange and bizarre, but its hillarious.  I think the best way to describe this movie is quriky--each characters have thier own quirks and strange obsessions (very Roald Dahl-like to me). <br /> <br />No, this movie does not encourage you to think deeply about the psycology of the characters or their situations, but that makes it a perfect, sit-back and enjoy it FUN movie that will have you grinning through the whole thing. <br /> <br />Yes, parts are strange and at first its hard to see how some parts fit in, but each of the situations/subplots are humorous and are wonderful. <br /> <br />Do not watch this movie expecting it to be some sort of earth-shattering deep Academy-Award winner, because then you will be so confused at first that you will certainly be dissappointed.  However, this movie is one of the greatest feel-good movies ever, and despite its strangeness at points, it just fits so well with the quirky, but wonderful characters.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First things first- if you haven't played the game RECENTLY or at least read plot analysis as a refresher, then you're going to miss half of the dialogue/plot in this movie.  In a risky move, this film is serious about being made for fans of Final Fantasy to the exclusion of other potential viewers.  I've just seen the film for the second time after finally refreshing myself.  It's surprising how much more the plot made sense and how little comments made sense.  People have argued that the plot is weaker than they were hoping for- I think these are probaby the people that played the game ages ago and thus have no recollection of some of the important but intricate details from the game. <br /> <br />Instead, the plot is heartwarming, comedic at times, and wonderfully dramatic at others.  It brings back the nostalgia associated with the colorful characters from the game and successfully expands the concepts from the game.  Even the ambiguity of the love interests in FF7 is kept intact. <br /> <br />All of that said, non FF7 fans won't dislike the movie- it's just that fewer of them will love it.  The detail of the animation is definitely leagues beyond Pixar- the clothing at the very least is photorealistic.  Roughly half of the movie consists of pure action and it is superb.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN BETTER ACTION CHOREOGRAPHY BEFORE.  Several moments in the film are just so creative and unbelievable that I couldn't keep my admiration silent.  If you're an action buff, regardless of familiarity with FF7, you will love this film. <br /> <br />Finally, Nobuo Uematsu's score successfully manipulates tunes fromm FF7 into new and interesting arrangements....one towards the end, in particular, is amazing. <br /> <br />The discs come with a reasonable amount of extras.  Most importantly, the dub is impressive.  I watched it only because a friend wanted to, but I can honestly say that I would watch the dubbed version again; it ADDED character to some of the characters....Cid, Yuffie, and Red in particular were beyond perfect. <br /> <br />Truly, this film is a technical marvel and something that no real FF7 fan should miss.
B00005JO20|5.0|I borrowed King Kong from a \\"friend\\". From everything I had seen about the movie, in game form and in trailer form, at best I had hoped to not hate it. I never dreamed I would love it. Never considered it. For some reason I had just assumed (as in, ass out of you and me) this movie would be stuck somewhere between Mighty Joe Young and Jurassic Park: The Lost World - or - nice ape visuals with vague characters and action sequences. So wrong. I loved almost every minute of this movie. At its heart, I found genuine feeling and was actually touched. To nit pick over some character development issues, some strained chemistry elements, or any of my standard qualms is definitely not seeing the forest because of the trees. Best love story I have seen in a long, long time. Oh yea, and the effects were good:)
B000B63IEI|5.0|This recording reminds me so much of the Rach 2 by Julius katchen/Georg Solti. Andsnes and Pappano study and understand rachmaninoff's own recording very well. The performance here, especially the Rach 2, is peerless and stands with the few reference recording in history.
B00009V7P8|5.0|\\"O\\" is a beautiful album well worth the purchase. Rice's use of cello and round is elegantly pulled off in \\"Volcano\\" although songs like \\"Aimee\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" also display his incredible talent for integrating classical conventions (operatic solos and symphonic motifs, etc). <br />
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I only rated this movie as a 4-star deal, because even though it was very funny and imagineative, it was still a little creepy. But Johnny Depp makes this movie so outragously funny and colorful, that I would still consider this movie to be one of my favorites. A must see movie of the year!
B00009QG73|4.0|Not many bands can provide a consistent output of great music for decades, but Roxy has. They have plenty of classic records and many of these catchy pop tunes with tasteful arrangements are captured on this live performance.  <br /> <br />The concert is approximately 105 minutes long, has a good selection of tunes (most tempos are faster than the studio versions), good video, and three audio choices (DTS, DD 5.0, and stereo)...  all sound great. In addition, this disc has the option to display the lyrics as subtitles, which is a feature that should be standard for all concert DVD's.  Bonus feature includes a 17-minute documentary.  <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|It seemed as if his life was screwed up for good. But once Reese Witherspoon walked into Cash's messy life, she knew something had to be done. In this heart warming movie that will make you say, \\"Awwwww!\\" Watch as Cash falls in love and fixes his life. A happy ending with some suspense and romance. This is a MUST SEE!
0312330537|5.0|I picked up this book by chance in a large bookstore.  As I have enjoyed so many novels by Indian authors, and I always search for books involving culture-clash of any kind, I had high hopes for a book about an Australian hiding out in Bombay.  Well, this book fulfilled those hopes and more!  The story is so rich, so complex, and filled with characters you grow to love and cherish as much as the protaganist does.  I found myself grieving along with him as he loses dear friends in tragic circumstances. It gives one such a complete picture of the amazingly multi-layered culture that is Bombay.  The reader is taken through the expatriate gathering places, to the slums filled with the poorest of the poor, to the complex sub-culture of crime and Mafia-like bosses of sections of the city.  No one is completely bad, just as no one is completely good. Every character is as real and fleshed-out as he should be, and one is drawn into the life the protaganist builds for himself within this society, as he tries to escape, not just from the authorities in his home country, but from all the character flaws he has which have caused him to flee to Bombay in the first place.  This book has it all-mystery, suspense, romance, character studies, love, crime and punishment, and even war.  It literally has something every reader will enjoy.  <br />After finally finishing this huge tome, all I could do was sigh and hope for a sequel.

0440237688|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK.  Its my all-time favorite, and I'm an avid reader.  Read it!! <br /> <br />Every since I read The Giver the first time, in elementary school, I thought it should be a movie.  I believe the movie is due out in 2007, but I may be mistaken.  My sister and I will be among the first to see it, I'm sure!
B000EXZKQM|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of live performances on both DC and DVD! From the Al Jarreau/Kurt Elling vocal duet version of Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\" to David Sanborn and Phil Woods blowing down the house on the classic \\"Senor Blues\\", there is not a single bad track in this package.  I also loved the solo performances - Chick Corea's mind-blowing display of technique on \\"Armando's Rhumba\\" is a particular standout, as is Benny Golson's \\"Killer Joe\\" (the track Spielberg used in the Tom Hanks film, \\"The Terminal\\".)  This would be a good deal just for the audio CD, but the included video versions of the performances on the accompanying DVD are a welcome extra - they're shot beautifully and the Dolby 5.1 Surround really makes you feel as if you are there at the TV  taping... For me, though, the best part is that the artist combinations are really well thought-out, and give you the chance to hear some incredible jazz musicians performing together whom you would ordinarily never see on the same stage.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I never played Final Fantasy 7. I saw the trailer for Advent Children and immediatly couldn't wait for it to come out. I tried to borrow the game from a friend of a friend but that didn't work out, though I did research the story, and found out about how much of an impact the original game had had on gaming history, so I knew a fair amount as I sat down to watch Advent Children; plus, the handy little 'Reminesince of FFVII' feature on the dvd, which gives an overview of the story of the game' helped.  Fast foward two hours or so, the movie's over, and I'm having trouble putting my eyes back in my head. THIS MOVIE IS FREAKING SICK!!! IT WAS AWESOME!!   Words can't discribe just how amazing and breathtaking the animation is. The sheer amount of detail put into every single frame is incredible and spectacular, and it never falters. I almost forgot at times that it wasn't live-action.    When we lose the person we care about above all else, do we lose ourselves along with them? Advent Children continues the story of the hero from the game, Cloud Strife, two years after he defeated Sephiroth. The world has recovered from the last battle with Jenova, where the planet itself was nearly destroyed, but a mysterious and fatal illness, geostigma, has been spreading, manifesting mostly in children, and Cloud himself suffers from it too. Maybe that's why he won't see any of his old friends and literally never picks up his phone. To make matters worse, three violent youths-Loz, Yazoo, and Kadaj-who all bear striking resemblances to Sephiroth, have appeared on their quest for \\"Mother\\". Cloud is finally forced to step back into the role of a hero if he ever wants to figure out what's going on. Glorious action ensues.    The story was pretty cool, but I admit that it was hard to get into initially (again, probably because I didn't play the game), but once I did I really liked it. The trailer for the movie asks the question: What are Cloud's motives? Is it for the children, for a memory, or himself? Redemtion is a really big recurring theme for Cloud, and the scenes where we found out what he desires most and what he fights for seriously pack a strong emotional punch, and really raise this film above just some cool fight scenes.  Not to say said fight scenes don't kick a tremendous amount of ***, because said fight scenes do kick a tremendous amount of ***, and more. The first half of the movie sets the stage for the second half, which is an all out adrenaline blast. You go from a 3-on-1 brawl, to a giant monster fight, to a chase, to the explosive finale that leaves The Matrix in the dust. Enough can't be said about the action. And it goes incredibly well with the masterful music score, another thing that can't have enough said about it. Just plain wonderful.  Also, I thought the english voice actors did a great job, my favorites being Rachel Leigh Cook (Tifa, she conveyed a lot of emotion effortlessly and fit her character really well), and Steve Burton (Cloud, good choice in my opinion, a little reserved and broody but that was the character, and he really came through with the more emotional scenes), My few complaints are that: 1. At times, the action moves a little too fast and it's hard to follow, 2. This movie MUST be viewed on the biggest screen possible, it's much easier to appreciate the detail that way, and 3. I wish this movie was more accesible to people who didn't play the game. If you want to see this movie, Do. As. Much. Research. As. Possible. Or better yet, play the game, I have a hunch it'll be worth it.    As much a blast I had waching this movie, I know it's nothing compared to what fans of the game will get out of it. This whole film is one big Thank You to the fans who made the Final Fantasy Series what it is. It was made for them, not as much for the mainstream. It's all for you guys. Enjoy it.    For the skeptic and unimaginative: Yes, this movie is a sequel to a video game; Yes, the characters jump distances that, in real life, would never begin to be humanly possible; and yes, a character easily wields a buster sword that, in real life, would probably weigh 200 to 300 pounds. Get over it.    In the Final Fantasy world, the laws of physics do not apply. Just sit back and enjoy it.    Difinitly one of the best action and animation movies I've ever seen with a great and deep emotional punch to pack, I strongly recommend Advent Children  4.4 out of 5.  This is my first review on this site, I think I did good.    P.S. I really wanted to give it five stars but I don't think I have the right to as I didn't play the game. Plus, playing the game or a lot of research is required prior to viewing the movie. For that, I recommend FFVII's wikipedia page.
B000ERU6QC|5.0|After coming to the conclusion that the boundries of \\"SEXY ROCK\\" had been pushed to the limit with the release of \\"Peace, Love, Death Metal.\\" The boys in EODM do it to me one more time with \\"DEATH BY SEXY\\", And man did it feel good! The non stop groovetrain coupled with Jesse\\"Fabulous Weapon\\" Hughes' groundbreking vocals made me weep with delight like a fat man at a cake eating contest. Thier is nothing that compares to the sensation of listening to this album and dancing the night away... But dont take my word for it, buy this cd....NOW!!!
B0009ML238|1.0|Don't get to excited because they have a great name and a cool cover, even if their music has been descrived as the likes of Symphonie X and Dream Theater. They most definatly want to sound like them, actually they are trying to copy them! the riffs, the vocals how pathetic. There is no real talent and the songs are boring. Don't spend the money.

All I can say is if you want to enjoy a wonderful concert, buy this dvd.You will thank yourself over and over.Sit back and enjoy.
8495501007|4.0|...there was Arturo Perez Reverte. This is my fave Reverte book along with The Flanders Panel, and it is very similar. <br /> <br />Few guys are in pursuit of medieval magic grimoire that has illustrations signed by...Lucifer himself! Yeah, it sounds cheap, but it has comic ending, believe it or not, and it is more kinda farce than esotheric thriler. <br /> <br />GET/BORROW THIS ONE, it is FUN!
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Well, needless to say that when I saw the trailer for this highly expected film, I was forced to believe that the movie would undergo an entire atmosphere of gothic horror and squirmy scenes non stop. This, however, is not the case. Or, it is at least half the case, to put it nicely.<br /><br />The film is only one hour and a half long.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes, to me, is wasted in a montage of sex, drugs, booze, and little, if none, rock and roll. It didn't surprise me seeing as how Eli Roth clearly explained that, for some reason, he must use nudity in his films in order to capture the essence of the 80's nostolgia that got lost in the undertow of the movies of the ninties. However, we are now in the millenium which means: New Direction.<br /><br />But, on a more positive note, I did like the way the film slowly crept into the dark depths of fear. There are a lot of serial killer movies, supernatural killers, jason, michael myers, flesh-eating bacteria, fear of the unkown, fear of the water, hieghts, or an alien threat. But very few, almost none, do not focus on the fear of being in a room where some stranger gets to torcher you however he or she wants or pleases. So, becuase this is the first movie that hones in on that fear, I have to give the director credit becuase he did what he wanted to achieve; he made me squirm.<br /><br />Now, after watching it once, I was totally disoriented. But the second time around I began to find myself very sympathetic to the three backpackers who were in this feature. It seems as if they were destined to do dumb stuff right before they witnessed the horror of torture.<br /><br />There is even signature lighting and tone that really reveals that this was done by the same people who did the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake.<br /><br />In essence, it's an original premise but, for me, it just needed to get there quicker. Could have done without the gratuitus sex scenes and drug hoopla.<br /><br />This movie, in a way, shows you how sick and twisted strangers are when they get bored with there hum-drum lives.<br /><br />Also, to the horror-nuts out there; you should know that there is not much gore in this feature. If I could compare it, I'd say that it was a little more than what the movie SAW brought to the screen.<br /><br />But, another thing I've found is that this is way better than CABIN FEVER.<br /><br />But, when you think about it, Hostel really breaks into two different acts. The first act of the movie depicts the Hostel (a modern day soddom and gomorah) that the three backpackers are staying at. The second act shows how Hostel (meaning crazy) the villianous characters can be.<br /><br />I think, if anything, this movie will surprise you but it is not for the faint of heart.red with there hum-drum lives.

B00005JOYC|4.0|I have to say that Silent hill so far is the only game to film adaption that truly followed the feel, look, and even sound of the game it's based on. As we are to expect, the movie does'nt follow any story line from the games, although it is very similar to that of the first; in which our lead \\"Rose\\" whom replaces \\"Harry\\" of the first game, is in search of her missing daughter. As the movie progresses we see familiar characters, like Dhalia Gillespie and the nurse Lisa, whom has a small role in the film. We're also witness to various creatures we've encountered in the game, more notably Pyramid Head  and the Nurses.We also seeother memorable creatures, like the little ghosts and a freaky new one called \\"the Janitor\\". The film combines elements from all four games. Like the monsters from the second, and various little enviroment and characters details from the others. The movie keeps the games music which adds to the excellent atmosphere the film presents.I think the look and atmosphere are one of the strongest elements in the movie.They spared no expense in the blood and gore department, especially towards the end. Another aspect I thoroughly enjoyed was the transition between the real world and the dark. It's very reminiscent of the game, especially when we hear that dreadful siren, warning our character of what to come. I felt that the explanantion and ending itself seemed a bit rushed.Other than a couplefairly slow paced sequences, the first half was brilliantly plyed out, with a mix of moody atmosphere and freaky characters.Then as we reach our climax we seemingly get rushed explanation and ending, which did not really fit the feel of the first part of the movie. Regardless, I still enjoyed the film the film from start to finish. Overall fans of the game may be dissapointed by the thin story line, but in ways it makes it up.with excellent use of the games music, along with the right atmosphere and a fair amount of blood and gore. Look out for some of the more notable creatures in the movie, as they look very much like they do in the games.In the modern age of remakes amd games to film adaptation, Silent Hill sucessfully pulls off a creepy movie  that stays true to the games it's based on. If only it did'nt seem so rushed towards the end could have been better. Still though I say bring on part TWO!! An go see this one for sure.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that my preference in anime and movies in general tends to be for the magic, the larger than life adventures, the epic battles and the surreal mind trips through other worlds.  But anime isn't all magical girls, mecha, battle action and hentai-and Tokyo Godfathers isn't any of those things.  Director and writer Satoshi Kon is a past master of dramatic tension and character development and those who have scene Millennium Actress or Perfect Blue may have more of an idea what to expect from this movie-but I suspect even they won't anticipate how the story twists and turns.<br /><br />The setting is Tokyo at Christmas time.  The characters are three homeless people: Hana, an aging drag queen, Gin, an embittered drunkard, and Miyuki, a smart mouthed teenage runaway.  This unlikely \\"family\\" is about to find their lives forever changed by the discovery of a newborn baby abandoned in the trash.  Sounds kind of depressing, doesn't it?  The characters don't seem like they'd be likable at first, the animation isn't forgiving-these characters aren't idealized stereotypes.  And then the \\"magic\\" begins.  Satoshi slowly and subtly unveils his characters through the movie's unexpected twists and turns.  What starts as a quest to return a baby, becomes a journey of self-discovery, adventure and redemption for these three remarkable characters.  And by the end, you're breathlessly along for the ride.  It's a movie that's a reminder of how incredibly good character development can be-and rarely is, even on the live action screen.  For a viewer like myself, it was a surprising and touching treat.  And belongs in any decent anime collection.<br /><br />The animation style is gritty and realistic.  Don't expect the typical big eyes or wild hair.  Nor are there the stylistic chibi-cuteness moments, or wild takes that are so common in anime.  It's not cute, and it doesn't try to be.  This isn't an anime for the kiddies-there's tough stuff to deal with here.  The nudity and sexuality of this story is pretty minimal-a few boob comments and a shot or two of babies breastfeeding.  The violence isn't gory or showy-but when it's included it cuts right through the viewer.  The real reason this isn't for kids is because it will take a mature audience to understand what's going on.  I don't think most youngsters will appreciate the subtlety, or be ready for the types of issues presented.  The message at the heart of this movie, however, is universal.  It's about all the connections and permutations of family, about the ties that bind us and bring people to care.  It's about small miracles.<br /><br />If you are already an anime fan and you're willing to try something different from the usual fantasy or SF fare, this is a great place to start.  If this is your first foray into anime, or you've been put off from the medium before, this is also a great place to start.  If you're looking for curvy girls with saucer sized eyes and gumdrop colored hair, bouncy theme songs, cute fuzzy sidekicks and tricked out robot giants, find something else-this isn't the anime you're looking for.  If you like this, you might also want to check out Satoshi Kon's other work, especially Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress.<br /><br />Happy Viewing! ^_^ ShanshadThe nudity and sexuality of this story is pretty minimal-a few boob comments and a shot or two of babies breastfeeding.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|As a long and faithful fan to the Final Fantasy series, I have always had an interest in VII particularly. The plot and epic tragedy was amazing and unique, it gives the gamer the diverse emotional feelings that are displayed in the game. In my opinion nothing will ever top this game, unless a re-make to be born from a classic. <br />   As for the movie, the CG are impressive and if you are a fan it would be a nice collector's item. It's also evident that its square-enix's first \\"real movie\\".Battles are a little too intense and should have been more game oriented.I hope in the near future square-enix realizes the potential of the Final Fantasy VII plot and satisfies the millions of fans that have urgently been waiting for a re-make!Overall the movie is a must have!
B00005JOE8|2.0|so here's the deal.  Its all about this bad guy whos like the leader of England and he's bad.  so this dude dressed like one of the three musketeers wants to kill him and save the country from the evil governemnt people who watch everybody all the time and don't allow freedom.  i hate faschists.  Fascism is bad.  its like this customer i had at work the other day bacause you see I'm like a waiter.  Well, this guy just ordered his second plate of buffalo wings--no fooling!--and i was like \\"ReallY!\\" and his friend went \\"Dude, your not supose to say that!\\" and I said \\"sorry\\" and the dude was all \\"Shut Up Tad!\\"  man that dude likes buffalo wings.  Fashcist.  I hate fascists. <br />So anyway about the movie.  Its okay, i guess.  Pretty exciting.  good ideas.  I gave it two stars cuz things can always be better you know i don't want to be a brown noser or anything
B00004RHZU|4.0|\\"Can't Take Me Home\\" is a breath of freshness for the stagnent hip-hop/mainstream music. Her voice can rival Whitney Houstons and make Mary J. Take notice. This Cd is my favorite, however it was overlooked by the mainstream, but had some success when tacked to the movie \\"Save The Last Dance\\". However some of the tracks were alittle hard to get into...and other where the tryed and true  boring formula that works; but with no twist. it is worth the money to go and get this LP
B00003CWOL|2.0|OK, so get this: it's a movie about like, God and the apostles and angels, right? <br /> <br />But God is a WOMAN!!! <br /> <br />And the apostle is BLACK!! <br /> <br />And the angel is ALAN RICKMAN!!! <br /> <br />And nobody talks like the King James Bible! It's all like, jive! <br /> <br />HOLY SHIITE THAT'S BLASPHEMOUS!!! <br /> <br />YOU MIGHT LAUGH!!! <br /> <br />you have been duly warned <br /> <br />PS: They use the word \\"sex\\" in it. \\"Sex is a joke,\\" they say. That's an actual line of dialogue. I didn't know it was until I saw this flick of greatness. SEX!!
B000EGCITG|5.0|I bought this Cd because i enjoyed her debut Lp and Mizzunderstood. So i knew she would come with the radical sound on the the new Lp \\" I'm not Dead\\". I mean who wouldn't want to at least listen to some song on a Cd with that title. I am so glad i bought this Cd; it is awsome!!  I will not let it get away from me. I will make my friends buy their own copy!!
B000EMGJM2|5.0|One of my favorites cd soo far i have been a fan of Van Hunt since his first cd soo i was definetly awaiting his follow up and i must say i was impressed from the 2nd track on \\"If I take u home, Hot Stage Lights, Being a Girl, She Knows me to well,Priest or Police,Character, At the end of a slow dance and The night  is all highligts on the cd i highly recommend it
B00000J2SR|5.0|Yes, when that song is \\"Street of Dreams.\\" It is the best ever by Blackmore et al. \\"Can't Let You Go\\" is some righteous powerful vocals; dessert if you will to the main dish and another reason to grab this CD. The best part is neither song has anything to do with the Knights, Wizards or Dragons. That little banjo player (thanx Ian) really had gotten quite bent, but with this collection was bent back INTO shape. Cheers.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|After smash hit Pon de Replay, hit single If It's Loving (which bowed Top 20 in several countries) and a very eclectic dance album Music Of The Sun in her career, Rihanna got herself too much to work on it. Hearing SOS (Rescue Me) is a relief because goes beyond Pon De Replay and give Riha chance to explore on a more underground beat area. The albun which intented give Rihanna a break from reggea and dancehall (which aren't missing but few songs are still influenced by) and give her a step up to R&B area.  <br /> <br />Dem Haters and Sean Paul's duo Break It Off prooved to be hit singles when I heard them, good dance beat zone. Rihanna never miss on that but she's got working on do on songs like Crazy Little Thing or Kisses or tittle track which take the album on the ewww zone! Really she could do much better. <br /> <br />R&B area was overwhelming on Unfaithful and PS (Still Not Over You) which are singles prototypes and remixes of If It's and Pon give the album a complement.  <br /> <br />Like Music Of The Sun the album tries to get every single rythim available since reggea to R&B to underground dace beat but still have to see that Rihanna is an expert on dance tracks and very cool ballad girl. She must keep on that. Next album she'll do some hard rock if she keeps 'exploring' as record company sais.
0140293469|5.0|As good as the film, if not better... That may well be a worn-out clich? dragged out of the 'after-dinner conversation' bag-o-tricks; and for very different reason the written forms are so often better than their celluloid partners. Let me re-phrase that -  the films are so often BAD, that the book now seems much better than it was in reality. Here, however is a clear example of a BRILLIANT film; one of the outstanding drama/comedies of the last decade, that comes from an equally brilliant novel. Suffice to say that if you appreciated the film then you would equally appreciate the book. How can I say that with such certainty? Well because entire passages were lifted STRAIGHT out of the book and filmed verbatim, that's how! - I hardly think the 'screenwriters' really deserve any mention at all in that respect.<br /><br />The only people who might not get this book are Americans, or anyone with no knowledge of Britain or REAL contemporary British culture (there's not one mention of fish & chips - think again). I'm talking, sarcastic, dry, witty, ironic, poignant humour often of the blackest variety, sharp and cutting it will leave the initiated rolling on the floor or stifling laughs in crowded trains.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough, it's a quick read that will leave a lasting impression on you and if you have seen the film beforehand, all the best scenes (especially the Jack Black ones) will come flooding back as you read those memorable lines.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|One truly great thing about this movie is that it is not in the least pretentious, overblown, pompous, puffed up, or heavy handed. Neither does it hit you over the head with an overload of CGI and special effects nor wallow in personal issues like so many film today.     This movie is basically a swimming trunks and bikini action adventure flick. so, if want some good shots of Jessica Alba (Sam) in a bikini swimming - this movie is for you.    But there is more to \\"Into the Blue\\" than that. And it is not a teenager kind of film (i don't think there is one teenager in it, although ofcourse they may enjoy it like anybody else). Jessica Alba was probably about 23 years old when she was making the movie - and Paul Walker (Jared) was at least 31.     i'm not going into basic plot details (that has been done by others here) - just some fun observations.    Sam has a kissy-kissy ralationship with boyfriend Jared. in the first half of the film this actually becomes a turn off - it was funny when one of the characters actually tells them to basically 'knock it off ' when they start in on one of their run-of-the-mill kissing scenes. one thing more about turn-offs in the movie, *(SPOILER - WITHOUT  TELLING YOU WHO OR HOW)* when one of the main characters gets seriously injured and dies there is hardly any real or true concern for her life expressed by anyone.    But the film does mangage to finally get into some actual story-telling with some good twists and turns. a bit far-fetched and drawn out near the end but that's what makes it fun!!.    So for me \\"Into the Blue\\" gets 4 stars; it has a good moral to it - about the real treasure found in one's own heart, it had good nature photograghy of the ocean -- and it was just plain fun!!     It turned out to be pretty good.
B000062YAZ|1.0|I love metal. Especially thrash and speed metal, but this is the most overated album of all time. On this piece of turd, all of Slayer's songs sound the same. I was listening to it and I thought I was listening to the same song untill I looked at my walkmen and it showed another track. What the f--k? Oh and Kerry King is the worst guitatest EVER.
037571457X|2.0|The book entitled Persepolis, by Marjane Satrapi, was a very moving book.  The book talks about a young girl, Marji, and her life in Iran.  She finds out that she has to wear a veil, which she doesn't want to do.  The book talks about her life, and the lives of the people around her.  It tells about the life of her parents.  How they protest a lot and try to live a normal life.  It talks about their trips and their conquests.  The book also explains what a typical day for Marji.  It talks about how the war has affected Marji's lifestyle.  There were many bomb threats that occurred where everyone had to run to the basement.  \\" 'Marji, run the basement!  We're being bombed!' It was the beginning of the war,\\" (Satrapi 71).  It told the story of one of her neighbors and how her father died.  \\"...Pardisse's report was by far the best.  It was a letter to her father in which she promised to take care of her mother and little brother,\\" (Satrapi 86).  Pardisse's father had died on a mission.  It also talked about how a house near them was bombed.  \\" 'Darling? The Iraqis bombed us! Really? When? Just now! Well I guess I should dry off. War always takes us by surprise,'\\" (Satrapi 81).  Marji's mother was in the shower when they were bombed, luckily it did no hit them. It hit their neighbors, and when Marji passed, she saw the girl who lived there's arm hanging out.  I personally did not enjoy this book and would never read it again.  I don't like to read books about war.  A good part about this book is that it is written through cartoons so it emphasizes the words on the page.    This should not discourage anyone else from read this book.  I would recommend Persepolis only to people that are mature enough to understand the meanings behind the material in the book.        <br /> <br />
B00004ZELJ|5.0|This is filled with one of a kind moments that are just priceless!
0812548094|5.0|\\"Stone of Tears\\" by Terry Goodkind picks up right after the first novel, \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", and really hits the ground running.  The story transitions pretty seamlessly, and the reader is again struck with Goodkind's relentlessly brutal storytelling ability.  This book greatly expands the world of The Sword of Truth series beyond what had been revealed in the first novel.  The readers are given several new major characters, along with a host of minor ones, and an entirely new land of people only previously mentioned in passing.  At almost one thousand pages, this is probably the longest novel in the entire series, and a lot of ground is covered here.  The events of Stone of Tears set up the direction the rest of the series takes, which, as of this writing, is currently at it's tenth book and set to end with two more.<br /><br />There are so many different plotlines that it's difficult to summarize it all in one review, but the main plot here is that Richard is taken, mostly against his will, by a group called the Sisters of Light to their palace in the Old World. It seems the Sisters aren't fond of untrained wizards running around, as they have a tendency to cause unnecessary problems (and a wizard's gift can kill him if he doesn't know how to keep it under control).  At this point there are no other wizards left to teach Richard, so they take it upon themselves to ensure he gets the proper training.  Several reviewers of the books later on in the series try to point out that Richard is invincible, all powerful, never makes mistakes, etc.  To them I would firmly point right here, where the far-reaching extent of Richard's mistakes begin to manifest.  While it's true that Richard generally comes out on top in whatever immediate conflict he's involved in at the end of each novel, each and every one of his minor victories only creates a larger problem for the world.  At the end of \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" Richard does in fact defeat the wizard Darken Rahl, but the manner in which Richard defeats him tears the veil between worlds, giving the Keeper of the Underworld the ability to reach into reality and begin the process of freeing himself from his infernal prison.  Seeing as how that jeopordizes the lives of every individial in the entire world, I'd call that a mistake.  Likewise, at the conclusion of Stone of Tears, Richard (*spoiler alert*) destroys the boundary between the New and Old Worlds so that he can try to rescue Kahlan from a dark prophecy he has learned of.  While he is successful in bringing the boundary down, this act unleashes the full wrath of Emporer Jagang and his Imperial Order upon the New World - a force of destruction still being felt seven books later (*end spoiler*).<br /><br />The depth of the characters really begin to show in this novel.  Abstract concepts that Richard just talked about in the first book are delivered much more keenly by his actions this time around.  Richard's nobility and desire to preserve life is brought sharply into focus when he and one of his captors, Sister Verna, travel through the land of the Majendi - a tribal people who are at war with their displaced neighbors, the Baka Ban Mana.  It seems Verna, along with all the Sisters of Light, are well aware that the Majendi are ritualstically sacrificing members of the Baka Ban Mana, but they do nothing to stop it, as the Majendi allow the Sisters of Light safe passage through their lands.  Unable to stomach such blatant disregard for life, and the fact that the Sisters of Light do nothing to right a wrong clearly present to them, Richard does everything in his power to bring this horrid tradition to and end, even though it puts his own life in mortal danger.<br /><br />Although it pops up every now and again in a small way, the philosphy of Objectivism, which the whole series is based on, takes a back seat to the storytelling and action.  This one is mostly plot progression, and it does a very good job of that.  Besides the other world-altering examples previously mentioned, the \\"Sisters of the Dark\\" are introduced here, and are a constant menace throughout the book.  They dissapear at the end of the novel, off to do dark deeds on their own, only to re-appear in the newest novel, Chainfire, and bring a plot line thought dead in this book back to the forefront.  As was stated in my review of \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" every book in this series has some capacity to make the reader cry - look for it here in the form of an unlikely hero displaying emotions thought impossible for this particular individual.  Goodkind's ability at writing is showcased by the fact that he can vividly and effectively describe high fantasy, horrific warfare, scenes of dialoge, and more sentimental scenes all in one novel.<br /><br />If you liked Wizards First Rule, I'd highly recommend contuining the story here.orld-altering examples previously mentioned, the \\"Sisters of the Dark\\" are introduced here, and are a constant menace throughout the book.  They dissapear at the end of the novel, off to do dark deeds on their own, only to re-appear in the newest novel, Chainfire, and bring a plot line thought dead in this book back to the forefront.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Before I write my review, I just want to say I think it is to bad so much publicity has been stirred up via the controversy surrounding the film.  I do not feel it is necessarily controversial because it is not centered around the identities of two people as much as the journey of many who are in the film.  The film is about two men in sixties who are working seasonal work as sheepherders of sorts.  They are actually cast well as people from this time in the West.  Two cowboys who have not much more than the shirt on their back.  Soon they realize they both have a fondness for each other.  They also realize they are going to be going their seperate ways.  As time moves on through the next twenty years, the two men try to meet when they can.  What is great about this movie is the story is something anyone can identify with regardless of their sexual preference.  Its a great STORY.  The film is also good in showing us lives of other people like their wives and families.  The vison that flashes across Enos's mind when he hears of Jack towards the end of the movie is very sorrowful and had a large impact on me emotionally.<br /><br />Some people thought the movie was slow but I honestley thought the pacing was perfect.  Movies that move \\"slow\\", if done right, are great because it gives us time to absorb the settings and characters within the timeline.  If written well, as this movie is, we don't fall asleep, but are instead captivated again, by the story.  There are also beautiful scenic shots throughout the movie.  A quiet and friendly environment that had people in it whose inner feelings are strong and yet hidden.  I just think its a great story and don't understand why there was so much hub-bub about it.  I encourage anyone to watch it.  Its not about a certain lifestyle, but about life, love and the pursuit of happiness which sometimes is found, in one way or another.
1594200823|4.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is a celebration of alternative agriculture that every vegetarian should read. Michael Pollan's account of modern-day food production is beautifully written, and demands the attention of everyone who cares about what, or who, they eat. This is easily among the most important books on food written this decade. Happily, Pollan's disgust with factory farming is clear, and The Omnivore's Dilemma is largely a quest to bring ethics into animal agriculture.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the superior quality of Pollan's writing only makes the book's flaws all the more glaring. The Omnivore's Dilemma contains numerous minor and forgivable lapses:<br /><br />* Pollan spends three pages writing about Omega 3s, and the potential for grass-fed beef and free-range eggs to provide this elusive nutrient. Yet he never so much as mentions flax seeds, which are by far the cheapest and cleanest source of Omega 3s.<br /><br />* He writes that, \\"...eggs and milk can be coaxed from animals without hurting or killing them-or so I at least thought.\\" Whatever he may have once thought, he never gets around to informing readers that every commercially produced layer hen and dairy cow-even if free-range or organically fed-is sent to slaughter.<br /><br />* He even suggests that if all Americans went vegetarian, \\"it isn't at all clear that the total number of animals killed each year would necessarily decline.\\" This argument was first made by Oregon University agriculture professor Steven Davis, and has since been thoroughly debunked by Gaverick Matheny.<br /><br />These lapses can easily be remedied with short rebuttals. Not so with one of the book's main and most problematic themes: the idea that one small farm in Virginia might serve as a template for enlightened agriculture. The Omnivore's Dilemma is largely a hagiography of Joel Salatin, the owner of Polyface farm. Salatin's lifework is admittedly remarkable. He's taken virtually all the overt cruelty-but alas, none of the slaughter-out of his egg, chicken, and beef operations. What's more, Salatin has found a way to raise these animals without drugs or pesticides. Through farming practices that radically depart from convention, it appears that Salatin's brand of animal agriculture enriches rather than depletes his soil with each passing year.<br /><br />Most vegetarians take for granted that eating animals is akin to buying a Hummer, removing its catalytic converter, and using the vehicle to cart around nuclear waste. Pollan's book convincingly shows that animal agriculture can, in fact, operate in a way that respects the environment. For a reader who's acquainted with the staggering wastefulness of animal agriculture, it's hard not to get caught up in Pollan's account of the Polyface alternative.<br /><br />What Polyface has accomplished is a genuine achievement. However, Pollan never points out that there's a reason why Polyface is plunked down in rural Virginia-hardly the heart of cattle country. This model of farming could simply never be transplanted to the arid, near-dessert landscape of America's western states-the region that produces nearly all American beef. It's one thing to practice boutique farming and to raise 50 grass-fed cattle a year on lush, rain-soaked land in rural Virginia. It's quite another to imply that Polyface could be anything like a model for transforming America's beef industry. You simply can't scale up what's happening on a 50-steer farm in Virginia to positively transform the way that more than 20 million cattle are raised in the American West.<br /><br />Michael Pollan is a talented writer, and had he only put this manuscript out for proper review this book could have been a masterpiece. Despite its flaws, The Omnivore's Dilemma deserves the attention of everyone who cares about animal cruelty. Nowhere is the case for eating animal products made so persuasively and thoughtfully. Yet the book's shortcomings demand some prerequisite reading-otherwisethe reader may succumb to the same lapses in thinking that overcame Pollan.<br /><br />Reprinted with permission.

I Personally think the best rap album's dont come down 2, but i feel right now, are between this and 2Pac's Makaveli album, U can NEVER compare rappers, but can Always compare Album's. At least thats how i feel.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Every generation has a favorite superman, actor. In my generation , I can't imagine anyone playing the Man of Steel , other than Christopher Reeve. I've recently purchased the special edition and still find this film inventive and fascinating. The casting was exceptional. Glenn Ford , Gene Hackman , Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve give fabulous , performances. Director , Richard Donner , does a great job in capturing the childhood essence and motivations for the title character and sprinkles the script with the perfect amount of drama and comedy. Although the character of Superman has been considered a superhero for children , I must warn you that this film contains scenes of violence. It also must be taken under consideration that there are scenes of Clark Kent jumping out of windows and walking through fire. I would think of it as no consequence..but to an impressionable child....it can become a necessary precaution. Moreover , this special edition offers a director and producer commentary that as exciting and interesting as watching the film itself. This film is absolutely fun and great to watch. I higgly recommend it.
076792603X|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a book that will captivate the reader from the very beginning. This fictional story written by author Dan Brown is both praised by some and controversial to others. The book questions the fundamental belief that Jesus Christ did not wed Marry Magdalene and therefore have children with her. This book will run you at least a cool $15.00 for the hardback and as low as $7.00 for the paperback. In my opinion either would make a great buy. This book has drawn criticisms from the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian affiliated religions. While reading this book it will transform the reader from a world of fiction and fantasy to a world of reality. Dan Brown has to be the best writer when it comes to making a fictional book seem so real.<br /><br /> Robert Langdon an American symbologist finds himself suddenly in the middle of a murder investigation and on the quest for the Holy Grail. Sophie Neavue is French judicial police cryptographer. Sophie's grandfather Saunire is the curator at the Louve and is suddenly discovered dead. Saunire happens to be head of a secret society called the Priory of the Sion. The priory has been in existence for centuries with leaders such Da Vinci and Isaac Newton. The priory was established as a group that would protect the grail from the church and also holds the secret of Jesus Christ and Marry Magdalene being wed and had children and that Jesus' blood is still passed down. It is up to Langdon and Neavue to keep the grail and its secrets hidden from those who wish to posses it. The last part of the story reveals a shocking truth that will surely have the reader on the edge of their seat till the very end. This book will take you in unexpected turns and lead to some shocking discoveries. Dan Brown uses a very interesting style in writing this masterpiece; most of the chapters are shorter than five pages. With well over a hundred chapters this book will never string on in one place to long. It is interesting because I believe that it keeps the reader from getting bored.<br /><br /> The Da Vinci Code is complicated story that somehow Dan Brown made into a very easy to follow and understandable. I would defiantly rate this book as one if not the best book that I have ever read. Dan Brown does a good job with his use of words and how everything in the book seems so real even though it is not. The Da Vinci Code is a good read for anyone who is looking for a well written thriller. On a scale of one to five with five being the highest I would without hesitation give the Da Vinci a five. I am very glad that I read this piece of extraordinary literature. I can only hope that the movie is half as good as the book.lieve that it keeps the reader from getting bored.  <br /> The Da Vinci Code is complicated story that somehow Dan Brown made into a very easy to follow and understandable.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Big movies like this are reviewed and reviewed to death--over 700 people have written here alone.  And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being.  I don't think this movie would have worked without the transcendant power of Heath Ledger's portrayal.  When Ennis Del Mar ends his life ruined by his internalized homophobia, the pain he makes us see brings us all immediately to his experience.  This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love. <br /> <br />This is a big Hollywood Epic, but masterpieces are not the exclusive terrain of quirky, off-beat films.  When everything works right--superb acting from all four principles, restrained yet purposeful direction, a fantastic story--you must admire the result.  This is a beautiful movie, a gay movie, a human movie, an example of high achievement in the art of film.
B000001ESF|3.0|The good news is that the albums keep getting progressively better and that's unchanged here.    The bad news is that 2112 (admittedly after only four consecutive listens) isn't what it's historically cracked up to be either, in my humble mind. It's certainly not the best Rush album ever (tune in to find out which one is), though it's a marked improvement over its three predecessors. So props to Geddy and the boys for constantly moving in the right direction anyhow...upward.     I have to say, I'm not a huge fan of the multi-faceted epic song that takes up one full album side. Give me something long-but-cohesive like Bohemian Rhapsody or November Rain or Rime Of The Ancient Marniner instead any day. Most of the times the songs are so segmented, musically, that they could make just fine songs on their own, and together they just sound like mixed riffs and melodies with their only thread being a theme. So I think it takes a bit of pretense to enumerate or lower case your sub-songs. Usually it's a recipe to bloat and ramble. And while I think the whole 2112 Medley doesn't sidestep this, it's a good (tho' not great) assembly of sub-songs...most notably Temples Of Syrinx and Oracle: The Dream. I'd like to think that with some thought and effort, two or three of these mini pieces could've and would've made more substantial full songs if approached that way. The medley begins and ends in a very 2001-like manner that continues the geek-ification visited last with The Necromancer's narration. Not a bad thing, mind you...I like the genre.    A Passage To Bangkok is admittedly a nice little treat with a tasty riff and some great playing. The Twilight Zone, too, is a pretty nice bit of work...and I like Geddy's vocals and the subject matter here. Speaking of such, that leads us to Tears, which is a great ballad and perhaps the most outwardly sorrowful sounding piece Rush has ever produced. I've played that one multiple times, it's so good. Hidden gem number two (Rivendell on Fly By Night being the other) to surface in the first four albums. Both ballads too, which might make one think I have a predisposition towards the softer side...and I do...except that Rush doesn't often journey in this direction, so one should take great note when they do. This is a great song with an exceptional-though- subdued vocal performance from the usually tweaky-throated (at least at this point) Lee. A nice break from the screech.  Lessons and, to a lesser degree, Something For Nothing are filler.    I'm between a rock and a hard place on the rating. It's clearly better than the previous releases but to what extent? If you consider that a great album is going to have a 4.5 rating, is this only a full star less than stellar? I'm going to go a bit conservative for now, but this could bump up a half star in the future. Afterall, I haven't had the luxury of 30 years of saturation, though admittedly I am trying to give each disc multiple listens before typing anything about it.     I do think the record is a bit over-praised. But then again I like some Rush albums that others think are garbage too.
B00005JOI3|3.0|There is too much going on in this movie to be relaxing or completely enjoyable.  The plot was so muddled that, despite wanting to give-up after 40 minutes of viewing, I continued to watch because I couldn't fathom what the movie was about.  At the end of the movie, it becomes clear that a dying man runs through events in a confusing way.   <br /> <br />Contemplating the meaning of the movie was fun.  Photography was very artsy and well-done.  Overall it was worth watching.

1400077915|4.0|Who will most enjoy Runaway? <br /> <br />1. Old hearts who need defibrillating back to a life of passion. If you want to feel again that rush of first love, the sinking of personal rejection, the stabbing realization you've missed out, been decieved, or made a mistake, jump in. <br /> <br />2. The recently or imminently divorced. What are you running from? What else will you lose in the bargain? <br /> <br />3. Tired of your humdrum life? Munro finds the bizarre, the magical, the extraordinary in middle-class or back-woods lives. <br /> <br />4. Mothers. The stories celebrate the intricate psychological and social lives of ordinary women. Most poignant is \\"Silence,\\" a heart-wrenching mystery of a daughter's desertion of her mother.  <br /> <br />5. If you enjoy strong fiction but don't have huge blocks of time to read. The stories are short but rich. <br /> <br />6.Aspiring writers of short fiction. Long established as a master of the craft, Munro is able to draw both scope and depth into each character, each setting, each situation immediately. She is both entertainer and prophet of the modern human condition.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, the book falls short of 5 stars because of the unconvincing portayal of life in the early 20th century in the story, \\"Powers.\\"  <br />
B000EHRVP6|4.0|When watching this movie I got the distinct impression that Eli Roth, the director, knows and loves movies.  There are times early on when it seemed he was doing cinematic riffs on Hitchcock, at least before the extreme gore kicks in.  The choice of orchestrational music rather than rock or electronic helps to give the movie a rather sophisticated feel.<br /><br />I think I had all of the proper responses to this movie.  I winced.  I cringed.  I noticed how a character who talks about being a vegetarian at the beginning of the movie becomes a cold hearted killer by the end, and we cheer on this transformation, much as we cheer on a similar transformation in  Cronenberg's \\"A History of Violence.\\"<br /><br />The heroes of this movie, like Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, are flawed.  They tend to objectiify women and are out to have a good time.  But they never come off as mean spirited.  When friends and aquantances disappear they actively search for them, become concerned when one of them isn't feeling well.  It is a creepy movie that stays with you and has some sembalnce of context.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I don't know why my CD player or the discs themselves haven't totally worn out from all the times I have been playing this and the Fellowship soundtracks!  The Nazgul music, the beacons, the Minas Tirith, Grey Havens, Pippin singing, the hobbit themes from Fellowship disc, climbing up Mount Doom and the music at the Fire and Into the West, a gorgeous song about the purity of Frodo and Sam's love for each other and their hope of reunion.  Lovely!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a beautifully made movie.  It holds a special place in my heart for two reasons.  I loved this book and the characters so much and it also reminds me of a special day with my mother.  Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds do such a wonderful job of conveying lost love and longing.  The movie is shot in a way that is more keeping with what the time period would have really looked like.  The cast is not a typically beautiful Hollywood group and look like they could live next door.  Amanda Root does such a wonderful job of making Anne's transformation from the workhorse spinster sister to an independent (as much as possible at the time) happy woman.  She conveys the change in Anne when she goes from being a victim of heartbreak to moving on and finally to happiness.  All done without makeup.  Ciaran Hinds is brilliant as Captain Wentworth who is also heartbroken and is able to mend his heart and love again.   <br /> <br />There are many film adaptations of Jane Austin's books and I enjoy them all but this quiet story is touching in a way unlike the others.  It is both subtle and complex.  It's like really good chocolate without the calories.
0790729350|3.0|Heck- i really expected more from this DVD than I got. <br />I would have preferred if they'd included film versions of all the stuff released on the larger box set which preceded this release by a year or two I think. <br />No Creedence Clearwater, no Airplane's Eskimo Blue Day (easily a high point on the original 3 album release)- & you can barely tell Nicky Hopkins is on stage with them, if it hadn't been announced, though he gets some great licks in on Uncle Sam Blues. <br /> <br />And who is the moron responsible for the lousy subtitles? <br />It reminds me of the jokey subtitles used on Japanese releases of 60's albums- some of them are real clinkers. <br /> <br />And while the DVD mentions there are special features I sure couldn't find them. Perhaps I need to go over it with a fine toothed comb again, but you have too few choices, and the whole product seems to have been rushed. A letdown for only forty more minutes of music.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This is a good relaxed album. I haven't heard Music of the Sun so I can't really compare the two. If it is a lot of reggae tracks your looking for you might be disappointed. This CD has some reggae tracks but mostly focuses on R&B, but some of the R&B tracks are somewhat fast and have a good rhythm. Pick this one up you shouldn't be disappointed.

B000BMSTMS|1.0|To be perfectly honest, when I first heard this album, I laughed at how pathetic it was.  When will these farts just give it up and move on with their lives?  They already lost Hed (Praise Jesus, best decision he ever made).  Now, they are still trying to write music, and they are trying way too hard.  Seriously, when Korn first came out, their debut wasn't too bad.  It actually had a couple of good songs on it.  When Issues came out, it was the beginning of the end.  Every album since then has been terrible.  I laughed like a demon from hell when I heard Twisted Transistor because it was so cheesy.  It used to be cool to listen to Korn becuase \\"they were just so hard\\".  Well, \\"light-bulb\\", there are bands now that are much heavier and much better now.  The only people who still listen to Korn are posers and wiggers; bottom line.  So, for all of you little poser goth, hardcore or punk kids who say you still listen to Korn...You're not impressing anyone!  Korn sold out!  They are posers and wannabes!  Long Live Tool!
B00004Y6NP|3.0|Let me review this album for Money for Nothing, <br /> <br />What are these idiots talking about? First of all, chicks aren't <br />for free. You got the idea? Then Money is not for nothing. You <br />got it right? Anyway, I've always liked this CD for Money for Nothing and it is one of the best songs by the band. The other <br />good songs on this are Walk of Life, (Very good), and So Far <br />Away. But the rest....I can't stand this CD, it is really not <br />good stuff. I love this band but this isn't the band's best work. <br />Get a better Straits album which has Tunnel of Love, Telegraph <br />Road, or Heavy Fuel. Don't fool with the most popular albums by <br />the band, this, and the Dire Straits debut. And all I hear on <br />the radio is Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing, those 2 are <br />just OVERPLAYED!!!!! Why can't I hear the lovely Tunnel of Love <br />or even Heavy Fuel on the radio????Those 2 are just as great. 3 <br />stars for this poor made cd. LISTEN TO THE OTHERS INSTED.
0765315246|5.0|I don't read fiction for the most part.  It doesn't do much for me, and I can't usually stay with one fiction work (other than the classics) long enough to finish it.  I INHALED this one.  It's probably the best sci-fi text I've ever read.  It's full of interesting scientific concepts, the situations are explained enough to be plausible and thought-provoking, and you quickly become attached to the main character.<br /><br />Even if you don't do fiction, give this one a try.  You won't regret it.
B00004Y6NW|3.0|First of all, I like this one better than Brothers in arms. But <br />still all I hear on the radio is Sultans of Swing, and Money for <br />Nothing. Dosen't that kind of get sick of you??They're OVERPLAYED...I still love that song anyway, and it is one of <br />the band's best songs. Listen to this..... <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe they took this off the air. It is the best show ever. I hope they bring it back soon. We now own the complete series and the movie serenity!! This is a must have. Please try it out, its great enjoyment!!!
0895260131|1.0|They say you must never judge a book by its cover, but by placing \\"The crusades were a defensive war\\" on the cover- well I just burst out laughing. (I hope Robert Spencer isn't so stupid that he actually believes what he says- but statements like that make me wonder.) It's hilarious that somebody thinks they can pass this fairy tale off as fact. For once, Spencer's \\"research\\" is more comedic than offensive. This guy is a regular Michael Moore!
0553801503|2.0|I won't go into the history of how Martin needed to cut the fourth book in half, resulting in one half of the story taking place in A Feast for Crows and the other half, occurring simultaneously, in the yet-to-be-finished A Dance With Dragons.  That much, for Martin's fans, is common knowledge. <br /> <br />This book, however, suffers for it.  Many (if not all) of the fan favorites are missing in this book.  No Jon.  No Bran.  No Tyrion.  No Dany.  Instead, A Feast for Crows focuses on what could safely be considered the second tier characters in terms of interest, if not importance. <br /> <br />So, fellow reader, be prepared to read only about Cersei and Jaime.  Brienne and Samwell Tarly.  And, albeit sparingly, Arya and Sansa.  And yes, that's about as boring as it sounds. <br /> <br />I think it's safe to say that a lot of this book could have been trimmed down.  Brienne and Cersei, the two who take up most of the space, just aren't that interesting.  To make matters worse, nothing of consequence happens to them until the last 100-150 pages.  The journeys the two take -- both in a literal and metaphorical sense -- are just tedious to read. <br /> <br />To make matters worse, Martin introduces a couple of new players to the game of thrones -- one from Pyke, the other from Sunspear.  And no, neither really add anything to the overall story.  The word 'filler' was all but stamped on their pages, which is strange as one would think, given the history of this particular book in the series, it would be bursting at the seams with pages relevent to the main plot. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, the book isn't all bad.  Arya's story was nice as it finally progressed.  Littlefinger's plans for Sansa were finally brought out into the open.  And, finally, Jaime continued his development as the more interesting (by far) twin.  But between the lack of interesting characters, and of anything of note happening until the very end of the book, I cannot, in good conscience, judge it tobe more than just an average novel.
B000FGGE68|4.0|I was one of the few who actually thought this was a decent movie, and it may be because I knew what was cut out of the film and what will hopefully be restored in this Unrated DVD.  About 30 minutes was cut which told the viewer much more clearly why things were the way they were and why certain characters were doing certain things.  As it was, the movie was VERY hard to understand without this footage - and thus it is no wonder it floundered at the Box Office! <br /> <br />Also, there should be some nifty violence re-added as well!  Can't wait to see the original vision!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I just watched Advent Children with a friend of mine.  We both thought it looked pretty cool.  And we really enjoyed watching the Reminiscing FFVII film (the short film that goes through the events of the game).  But as far as the quality of the main feature, we thought it would have been a lot better if they'd just made Advent Children into a video game and used the clips as cut scenes.     The fight scenes were at times choppy and a little hard to watch.  Of course that's probably just the style, but I think I would have got more out of it if the camera angles would have taken a break and given more perspective, rather than always following the characters in jagged movements.  I felt this to be particularly the case during the motorcycle scenes.      The sound didn't match the environment.  It would be windy, characters' hair would wave like crazy, but the voice actors would be practically whispering to each other when there should have been gusts of howling wind and yelling shouts of rage.  The attitudes of the characters was just so nihilistic that I wanted to fast forward.      And now I break down into obsessive dramatic fanaticism: With all that's going on, I can't see how Cloud could be with Tifa (because it's definitely implied, though they don't really go into it very well).  I mean, Cloud is sooo not over Aeris (aka Aerith)!  He lives/spends his time where she used to live and all he can ever think about is her.  Forget forgiveness, he's got it bad for her.  Tifa was just part of his past.  And I think that's all she can be until he really gets over Aeris.  And if the makers of the film want me to believe that he's over her just because of what happened in the movie, they're pumping it up to be more than it's worth.      Another thing I thought was a bit lame was that all the Turks bit it, and you never actually get to see Reeve, just the cat.  It felt a little like character overload.  I liked it that most of the original protagonist cast didn't show upuntil the battle at Midgar, but then they all just came in like a clown car.      The three proto-Sephiroth characters were annoying.  Mother Mother!  I felt like I was listening to a bad remix of an incorrect, literal interpretation of Tracy Bonham's old hit song (no disrespect intended to her).  They were nothing more than childish versions of Krypton's General Zod.      I've waited two years for this film.  I'm glad I finally got to see it, but I have to say it was no Final Fantasy VII the game.  Watching it made me feel the way I felt after seeing Star Wars, The Phantom Menace.  It's not about the visuals.  This movie is beautiful.  I am more interested in content.    Making and being involved in movies like this one is what I want to do when I finally \\"grow up.\\"  It's just sad to me when I see something like this made and I compare that to how hard it can be to make it into the industry.      Edit: Because it is increasingly obvious of a correlation between people who gave low stars with receiving unhelpful ratings for their review, I wish I could drop the rating I have given this film to 1 out of 5 stars.  FFVII was a great game, and while its graphics pale compared to Advent Children, it was superior... I would give it zero stars, if I could, out of the same stubborn passions.  That is not to say that I hated Advent Children, I just see lots of places where it could have been better.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I am the type of DM fan that prefers their work since and especially after Music for the Masses. Playing the Angel continues the trend of what I expect and enjoy from DM. Their sound on PTA is one that is dark, deep, multi-layered, mature and emotive. For me, there is no other band that so accurately gets is right in putting together vocals (David Gahan sounds great on this), lyrics and music (Martin Gore is a truely gifted and mature songwriter) to evoke the base emotions of the human condition. The highlights of this CD are Precious, Suffer Well and Nothing's Impossible.
0679422714|5.0|Mao Tse Tung is unique among major 20th century dictators, in that his party is still in power, and his country still considers him mainly as a good guy who made some mistakes.  Hence, appraising him is difficult.  People who knew him are dying off from old age, many won't talk for fear of public censure, and incriminating archives and files are sealed.  Writing about Mao is like writing about Stalin prior to 1993: more or less an exercise in speculation and interpretation.  Until the Soviet files were opened, many otherwise well-informed people thought that Stalin was, like Mao said \\"70 percent right and 30 percent wrong\\", and that many stories about the Terror, collectivization, the Katyn massacre, purges and military invasions, were disinformation exercises by ideological enemies.  The truth about Lenin and Stalin was so awful that many thought it couldn't be true, that it had to be an exageration.    Hence many of the negative reviews about this book being biased.  Obviously, many readers would like to see also some of the \\"good things\\" that Mao did.  But what if he didn't do much or anything that was positive?  What if he was a narcissist who never loved anyone but himself, and a glorifier of violence, what if he was good at tearing apart rather than building up?  What if all he cared about was power (his own)?  What if his political discourse was mainly or solely an instrument in his bid for power?  What if the consequences of his reign for his country were unspeakable?  What if that country would have been much better off if he had never come to power, no matter what the alternatives?  What if he was a catalyst for all that was foul in those that surrounded him?    Please observe that these questions are never asked about people like Hitler, or Franco, or Mussolini, or Pinochet.  Paul Preston wrote a brick-like, 1000+ page biography of Spain's Franco in which he does not allow him any virtues at all.  Yet, if you read the reviews on that book at the amazon.com website you will not see anyone who regards it us biased.  People assume Franco had nothing positive about him (yet, when he died Spain was prosperous, peaceful and on the verge of joining the EU- compare that with Ceausescu's Romania).  When Nicholas Farrell wrote a revisionist biography of Mussolini, where he highlights many positive traits of Il Duce, he was immediately accused of being a neo- or crypto-fascist.  And when in the movie \\"Downfall\\" Hitler was portrayed as having some qualities (like being courteous to women and children), this generated a strong reaction, because it was assumed that it couldn't be true, and that it somehow attempted to \\"rehabilitate Hitler\\".  But when Volkogonov's biography of Lenin came out and showed that he was (mainly) a violent thug, many criticized it because they assumed it reflected a negative bias on the author's part.  Yet most of Volkogonov wrote has been confirmed by other sources and is now generally accepted to have happened.  Similarly, when a book comes about Mao that is strongly critical of his actions, it is thought to be biased.  It seems that many readers (and some \\"expert\\" historians) have already made up their minds.  They want the \\"good\\" left out of the biographies of right-wingers, but kept in those of the left-wingers', and if possible emphasized.  Hitler was a demon, but Mao was a flawed leader and nation-builder.  Mussolini and Franco are laughable buffoons, but Lenin was an inspiration for both good and bad.  And many people will say that Fidel Castro is a much better leader than Pinochet, in spite of the fact that Pinochet gave up his power willingly (something Castro would never do).    I don't know if all that Chang and Halliday write about Mao is truth or not.  But their research is impressive.  They interviewed practically anyone alive who knew Mao and who would talk to them.  They had access to sources not previously generally known.  Their picture is consistent and compelling.  It is also a reasonable match for other evidence.  Was Mao a great military leader?  If so, why did he get himself and Stalin into the Korean mess?  Was Mao an egomaniac?  If not, why did he promote his demented and excessive personality cult?  Was Mao a good father and husband?  If so, then why was he married four times, why did he desert his first three wives and their children when it suited him, why did he first use and then desert the awful Jian Qing, his fourth wife?  We already know that the Great Leap Forward erased some 30 million people from the Chinese statistics: read Jasper Becker's book \\"Hungry Ghosts\\" for that.  We also know the social costs of terrorist campaigns like the Hundred Flowers or the Cultural Revolution.  There are many sources.  Was Mao an opportunist, who used communism to get to power and keep it?  What would be so surprising about that?  Don't we know that many such other such opportunists like Fidel Castro or Nicolae Ceasescu did precisely that?  Isn't it possible that Mao was a deeply unattractive person, whose main virtues were a burning ambition, a strong intelligence and a total absence of scruples or empathy?  He wouldn't have been the first such person.  Think of Caligula and Nero, or Ivan the Terrible.  Think of Hitler: do his quick intelligence or personal kindness to his associates diminish his crimes?  What is the key component of Hitler's story: his crimes, or his personal attributes?  Don't many revolutionaries prefer destroying to building?  Here too one can quote many examples.    In sum, it seems to me that many of the objections to this book are quibbles.  It is 800 pages long.  It may contain errors.  But it does provide a complete, consistent and compelling image of Mao.  It is a ground-breaking work full of primary sources.  It should be seen as the starting point for a further evaluation of this historical figure (rather like Volkogonov's biography of Lenin).  And we should keep in mind that some is his henchmen are still in power.Regardless of whether this brought stability to China, it must be qualified as a bad thing.  Japan, which was often thought to be as collectivist and unsuitable for democracy as China, did manage in a generation to create both democracy and prosperity, which China hasn't achieved by a long way.  Ditto for Taiwan.  And let's not talk about size or heterogeneity of the population being a justification for a Communist dictatorship.  India's population is almost as large as China's and far more varied, and yet is has managed to survive for 60 years as a democracy without mass terror, Cultural Revolutions, purges and the starvation of millions.    Having Mao's photo and dessicated corpse in Tiananmen Square is as great an insult to decency, as would be having Hitler's picture and mausoleum in Alexanderplatz in Berlin.  Let's hope that the old monster meets the fate of his pupil Pol Pot: incinerated along with old mattresses and other rubbish, and discarded.  China didn't need him then, and does not need him today.
0553103547|3.0|I am a fan of long epic fantasy/sci-fi. series (ex. Wheel of Time, Thomas Covenant, Dune, Foundation, etc.). This initial volume of The Song of Ice and Fire series definitely shows promise. It's interesting, refreshingly different, complex, and surprising. However, I'm not completely sold as to whether or not this series will ultimately be rewarding. I have hope that it will. The prologue certainly sets the stage in its eerie depiction of the land beyond the wall, but the rest of the book mainly concentrates on the happenings elsewhere. In this, the book shifts from periods of high action to periods of non-action and back again. I have read a lot of Robert Jordan and he does the same thing, but I find I have more tolerance of this in Jordan's books. Maybe the reason is that in Jordan's books, you know who the good ones and the evil ones are. In this book, that is less clear, but that does serve to make it interesting and complex. I think the book really picks up around 2/3rds of the way into it and finishes rather well. My criticisms are 1) the use of characters who age between 9 and 16 years of age. Kids are no where near as deep and capable as Martin makes them out to be. 2) The eeriness of the prologue is not maintained throughout the book. 3) Martin seems to describe some actions after the fact rather that actually write the action. Other than this, this book is certainly worthy of a read, but like the Wheel of Time series, the ultimate big ending had better live up to and exceed all that comes before.
B000EQ5TSI|1.0|There should be a black dot selection for movies that truly suck. I rate this film as one of the worst movies ever made if not the worst. This regard mostly comes from the expectation or the capacity that this movie produced. It was capable of being an entertaining movie and the larger budget, inclusion of John Woo certainly increased expectation. In the end we were left with wire stunts that looked ridiculous, an abruptly changing tempo and so many of Woo's film signatures that I felt assaulted by them. I liked it when they were subtle and you actually had to look for them. This movie was truly a pain to watch.
B00005JOYA|2.0|Oddly enough, nearly every professional critic hated this movie, while legions of moviegoers loved it.  I am not sure what is causing such a wide dissonance betweent the two groups.  Silent Hill is not a very good movie.  It is not absolutely terrible either, but it certainly is not the masterpiece so many people claim it is. <br /> <br />The acting: horrible.  The plot: nonsensical.  And if you are a fan of the game you will be most disheartened by the major alterations they have made.  Contrary to what the director and writer have claimed, they did not, in fact, remain true to the game's story.  In place of the game's subtle and thought-provoking commentary on religious fanatacism, the movie resorts to a sophomoric attack on Christian Puritanism.  Instead of deeply disturbing violence that is symbolic and derived from the characters' psychological states, the movie has campy, gratuitous gore.  In general, while the video game appealed to adults, the movie seems to be geared toward teenagers and kids who sneak into R-rated features. <br /> <br />The visuals are amazing however.  This movie definitely looks like Silent Hill, but the resemblance ends there.  I suspect people who really loved this movie were mesmerized by the excellent set design and creature effects, which are absolutely fantastic.  Apparently plot and character development are only important to paid movie critics.
1592401791|5.0|Along with Mark Lewisohn's amazing 'Complete Recording Sessions' book - this is probably the only Beatles book worth reading if you already know the basic story of The Beatles and how they met and so forth. Mr. Emerick writes so well that you honestly feel like you are there with him as he watches these songs come to life in the recording studio. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I absolutely could not put it down!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I purchased this CD as a long time Mark Knopfler fan, i didn't know very much about Emmylou Harris but after listening to this CD i am a big fan of her voice.  These two sound great together, very nice mood to this album, nice guitar fills as always, nice flow.  very very enjoyable.  Reccomended!
B00005JOYA|5.0|The nations \\"so-called\\" top critics have been bellyaching for years about the current crop of horror moves.  They have whined and complained about those films repetitiveness: [...] teenagers/young adults being tortured and killed by a sadistic psycho, the lack of intelligence in those films, and those movies focusing on entertaining an audience with nudity, bloodshed, or a combination of the two.  So finally a horror movie is released that doesn't adhere to this standard and yet again they're still bellyaching.  Perhaps because some people can't be satisfied or maybe their negative reviews of this film stem from their inability to use their brains when watching a horror movie so they go out and wrongfully label this film as plotless and confusing.    Since those \\"so-called\\" top critics failed to grasp the plot and were confused, I'll enlighten them a bit.  I won't give away any major spoilers since that would ruin the movie for people who have yet to see it, but I will put out some useful information on some stuff that to me is elementary, but the \\"so called\\" top critics seemed to not have not been able to understand (honestly, what are they being paid for).  The basic plot of this movie is that Sharon DaSilva is in the mysterious town of Silent Hill looking for her missing adopted daughter named Sharon DaSilva.  In the process of looking for her she is lead from place to place by an entity that is intent on using her to seek revenge.  What's so confusing about that?      Other important aspects of the film that went over the heads of those critics was having a basic understanding of the fact that there are 3 worlds that exist in Silent Hill.  Those 3 worlds are reality, the other world, and the nightmare world.   Reality in the film is the world where the husband and Officer Gucci are as they try to locate Rose, Sharon, and Cybil.  In this world the town is abandoned because of the ash, smoke and forever burning mines that requires them to have to wear protective facemasks.     The other world in the film is a foggy place where ash falls like snow.  It is in this world that Rose, Cybil and Sharon are first transported to.  It is a vastly empty place that is completely closed off from the outside world by cliffs.  The religious zealots-miners who like Rose, Cybil, and Sharon have been pulled here inhabit it.  It also contains strange, mal-formed creatures.      Then there`s the third and final world.  This is a nightmare world.  But who's nightmare world is it? My recommendation is watch the movie and find out.  This world is a dark, and burned placed filled with the hideous creatures.  In this world a child molester appears as an S& M styled beast, there's a monster wielding a giant blade with a pyramid shaped head, there are also lots of bugs (scary stuff to a child), and burned childlike creatures who scream and cry out as they harass Rose in a well-done scene.            The other world's transformation to this nightmare world is indicated by the sound of sirens.  Here's a hint figuring out why sirens are heard will help you movie critics figure out who's nightmare it is.  It will also help you analysis an important aspect of the film's storyline.      So would I recommend this movie?  You bet.  It's one of the best video game adaptations out there.  I should know because I've seen more than my fair share of terrible movie adapations based on popular video games, the Resident Evil movies and Super Mario Brothers are some of the bad ones that immediately come to mind.  I can only wonder what the studios were thinking when they released those extremely awful films.    This movie is also a great stand alone horror film.  The visuals are beautiful and the story complex and tragic.  So forget the critics and their inability to think when watching a horror movie and enjoy this great film. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This ladies and gentlemen is not only the greatest rock and roll band in the world but the greatest album they ever made.  It contains many masterpieces - Gimme Shelter, Midnight Rambler and You Can't Always Get What You Want.  One has to rememeber the time at which this album was released and then listen to it now.  It still rings with style and orginality.  While Exile and Sticky are great ablums and feature in my top 20, this I believe is the best rock and roll album ever made.
B0002XDODU|4.0|After the awesome Mutter, I wasnt sure how Rammstein could come back with another strong album.  I'm glad that this album is a lot different than other rammstein releases, because although the other albums were awesome, if Rammstein came out with another similar album I think the sound would have started to get old.  They really change it up on this one.  It starts out with the erie sounding Reise Reise, and the according just adds a great touch.  If you are new to rammstein dont pick this one up right away, I'd suggest getting some of their earlier releases first and you can then appreciate this one a lot more. There are some hard hitting songs on here like Morgenstern, Keine Lust, and Mein Teil.  All in all though this album focuses on more diverse songs.  There are a few international songs, and by this I mean either in a different langauge or about a different country.  These songs include Moskau and Amerika.  One of my favorite songs on here is \\"los\\" the bluesy guitar adds a great effect and departs from the hard hitting style but is a welcome change.  Although slower, Stein Um Stein is also a classic, with a hard hitting refrain.  Rammstein sticks to their usual strange subjects in this one, so if you understand german (which I do) you will be in for a treat.  Even the slow songs on here, like ohne dich and Amour are pretty good.  All in all this album is not as good as the others but it was needed for the evolution of the band.  Pick if you respect rammestin as a band.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I think if you yourself have dealt with addictions, you will be able to watch this movie and feel the pain and hardships these people go through. The actors & actresses do an amazing job at portraying real addicts.. props to Burstyn who looked absolutely delusional in the ending hospital scenes.     The ending however (last 15-20 minutes), is really rough and intense- lots of stuff happens in the end- in all of the four main characters lives. It is really hard to just sit and watch, you want to help these people so bad. Or, you sit there knowing exactly what they are going through- feeling their pain and struggles. This movie is depressing, but it is so real life. It doesn't attempt to sugar coat anything, drugs-diet pills-sex- are all real elements that are explored to the extremes in this movies.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This review will be a little different from the norm. First, confession: I'm 47 years old. For the last 20 years I have listened to virtually nothing but classic rock. The only modern music I have been able to enjoy has been of the new age, Windham Hill variety. Over this time period I have often bemoaned, along with other friends my age, the lack of anything new or original worth listening to. Maybe it's a generational thing, maybe I'm just getting old and jaded, but I just didn't ever seem to hear anything that could compete with music from the 60s and 70s. Recently I decided to stop whining and see if I couldn't find something, ANYTHING, produced in the last 5-10 years that tweaked my interest. So I started asking around, doing a little research, and one band that kept popping up was Radiohead. I listened to some samples and found them interesting, but I was still unconvinced. Finally a few months ago I used a Christmas gift card to purchase \\"Kid A.\\" Like many people I found it at first almost unlistenable. But I forced myself to keep at it and eventually surprised myself - I really liked it! Bizarre for sure, but intriguing. A month later I followed up with \\"OK Computer.\\" And the rest is history. I have not been able to stop listening to it. I don't enjoy every track; there are several that I skip. But the good stuff is REALLY good. The first half of the cd and the last two cuts particularly. In fact I don't know if I've ever heard a more beautiful song than \\"The Tourist.\\" So I'm back in the game. I picked up \\"The Bends\\" last week, and plan to move on to \\"Amnesiac.\\" Music is fun again.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|I'm not a big war movie fan, its hard to put into words and<br /><br />to watch on screen just what it must be like to train for war<br /><br />and live that life and expect somehow to fit back into society<br /><br />once its all over, if you survive it all. Film makers try to<br /><br />show us what its like but it doesn't always come off.  Jarhead<br /><br />had some great points, it was slow here and there but I liked<br /><br />the acting performances.  This particular mission and<br /><br />the way the marines were portraited as just hanging out waiting<br /><br />for nothing but the eventual air strikes to do their fighting and especially<br /><br />the varied backgrounds of the servicemen showed us a different<br /><br />war movie, it took so long for them to get the action they<br /><br />were waiting for and then to watch air strikes take the place<br /><br />of hand compat it was frustrating to watch.  I enjoy reading<br /><br />books so it doesn't bother me to watch a story unfold, I need to<br /><br />get to know characters, so many movies these days are alot about<br /><br />fast action because they know people don't care about story<br /><br />lines anymore, bores to many so they just throw in the action<br /><br />to replace substance. Seems they are replacing the old fashioned<br /><br />military fighter with the more modern air strikes to achieve<br /><br />the goals but the old fighter is considered boring to watch<br /><br />as well. The wars that really mattered from the past, helping<br /><br />save nations for real reasons instead of whats really going<br /><br />on today made much better sense and had better stories to tell.<br /><br />Also of note, the filming of this movie was excellent.
0393327655|1.0|Harris seems to blame almost all of society's ills on religion.  In particular he seems to think that without religion, there would be no war.  It is true that religion has been a prime excuse for killing others, from the 30 Years War to contemporary terrorism.  Oftentimes, it has just been no more than that, just an excuse for ulterior motives, just as expansionism, for example, Muslim expansionism in the Middle Ages, every Crusade after the First, and the Spanish reconquista.  Genghis Khan wasn't any less brutal just because he had no religious motive for his slaughters. <br /> <br />Without religion people will just be able to find other reasons to kill.  After all, the worlds most prolific mass murderers (Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot) have all been atheists.  Religion, like any belief is most important, and does the most good, at the personal level, but Harris does not seem to recognize this.  So what you get is just more prosleytizing, that the belief in no God is better, in a utilitarian sense, than belief in God.  It just doesn't advance the debate very far.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|One major deal with Final Fantasy series is you don't get to see the same characters again. Lately, however, more and more of them are popping up whether in first-time sequels (FFX-2) or Non-FF games (Kingdom Hearts). This was the very first role-playing game I ever played on the playstation and I am glad for the reunion with the release of this DVD movie. <br />I am not sure what others expect from a movie based on a game, but I am glad that this picked-up from the end of the game versus redoing it from the start. The movie was awesome. If you haven't played the game or are unfamiliar with the storyline, you will still freak out over the animations and soundtrack. If you need more substance to a anime-type movie, then I would look elsewhere.
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" concentrates on an era of history that was, at least for me, largely ignored in school. This is the prehistoric era, when human beings discovered agriculture and domesticated animals. The development of these foundations of civilization, which occupied most of human history, is unjustly passed over in history courses in favor of the past few millenia of Western society. <br /> <br />I loved \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" because it filled this gap in my knowledge. Diamond's thesis, that the West's rise was due to attributes of its fauna, animals and location, is well argued, and written in a way that is accessible to the everyman. According to my research on the internet, most of Diamond's claims, although written almost a decade ago, are still widely accepted. Diamond also throws in many fascinating tidbits about African, Asian, and ancient American history, also unfortunately ignored in many American schools.  <br /> <br />\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" does what history should do: it explains why the world is the way it is today. I recommend this fascinating and informative book to everyone.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This movie does not do justice to the game. The story was completely one-dimentional and plain. People who have not played the game would have trouble understanding what is going on. The only thing good about this movie is the visual effects. Oh, and everyone had virtually indestructuble bodies and defied the laws of physics throughout the entire movie.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|So many others have said it all before, so I'll just add this: <br /> <br />This movie was brilliant beyond words. Some say they didn't get it or couldn't follow it.  <br /> <br />Well, if you didn't like it, you probably are not bright enough to engage in intelligent ideas wrapped in the form of entertainment (and it was not non-fiction though based on it, it was entertainment.) <br />Or, if you didn't like it, you're Bush-blind and have too much of a head in the sand mentality for the parallels of reality to sink in.
0316172324|5.0|I really liked this book.  It made you really think how you react to people...  Def a good read.
B0002B55WA|4.0|In the Anthology series, Paul McCartney used this phrase to describe what the Beatles (Paul, mostly) were trying to create with Magical Mystery Tour.  The resulting product, shown in black and white on TV in Britain, was widely panned.  Some critics went so far as to say that the film was proof that the Fab Four had lost their shine.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour was certainly no great cinematic work.  In fact, it's of virtually no consequence to anyone other than hard-core Beatles fans or stoners that like its psychadelic bent.<br /><br />Whatever it lacks, it has a surreal, quirky charm that makes it worthwhile.  Some scenes are just plain bizaare, like the dream sequence in which John Lennon, a mustachioed waiter in a posh restaurant, shovels a table full of spaghetti onto a fat lady's plate.  Not surprisingly, Neil Innes of Rutles fame (or infamy, if you prefer) is in the The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, who performs the song \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\" -- recognize the name, kids? -- while a dancer does a striptease.  Only in trippy movies like Magical Mystery Tour, or its cousin, the Monkees' Head, can you see stuff like that.<br /><br />Most of the movie is nonsense but some scenes are quite funny.  It's the kind of thing you'd expect if you asked a pot smoking pop group to put together a Monty Python episode.<br /><br />If nothing else, the movie is, more or less, like an hour show of Beatles videos.  Nowhere else can you see videos of \\"Fool on the Hill,\\" \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" and \\"I am the Walrus.\\"  You know that can't be bad!
0553801503|5.0|If you've read the entire series this far, then this will be another treat.  The stories of the selected POV characters are developed nicely and all of them end in a pleasantly suspenseful cliffhanger.  (For example, I now believe that Cersei has finally bitten off more than she can chew.  I can't wait for the comeuppance!)  Martin keeps the other characters' stories intertwined with these which keeps the series conherent.<br /><br />This volume is a more accessible length than the previous two; granted, it's only half of a story, so it should be shorter.  There is still the suspense of who is good, who is bad, what is Petyr Baelish's ultimate plan, how is House Stark going to trounce House Lannister, is Daenerys in any danger from the Greyjoys or Martells, and so on.<br /><br />I guess the only complaint I have is that half the cast is missing.<br /><br />Now if only Dance with Dragons was available right now...
B0000TLA9G|5.0|this cd is great it has almost all thier best songs on it. I bout it about half a year after it came out I was auchualy very pleased with it cause with tracks like welcome to the jungle and paridise city you cant go rong.  this cd is awesome i recomend it the songs are great and slash (the lead guitarest) kicks some @55 buy this aulbum NOW
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I originally had Tres Hombres on vinyl but when I bought Tres Hombres on CD I discovered much to my dismay that it was a remix. Ugh!  I never could get used to it and Tres Hombres went from being one of my favorite albums to a CD I had in my collection that I never listened to. I finally sold that CD a few years back.  Some of the original mixes from Tres Hombres were available on the greatest hits and that's what you would normally hear on the radio.  Now, someone has come to their senses and made the original, popular mix,  available.  Buy this, don't buy the remix. This is a classic album.   ZZ top weren't as gimicky then and the writing on this album is flawless.
0385512104|5.0|When I started reading the book, it was damn hard to put myself in the shoes of Christopher, since I had not had any contact to autistics before (except in films). So it was quite new for me, how an autistic boy thinks and why he acts as he does. That book gave me a ... sometimes scary, sometimes amazing insight into an authistc's way of thinking.  - The style of writing is simple, but it fits perfectly to Christopher, who's the actual narrator. <br /> <br />I come to the conclusion that this book is worth reading once and twice, probably even thrice. So just read it. ;D
0393327655|5.0|A Gutsy book I'm glad I took the time to read.  Sam Harris dares to question what others have been quietly stepping around for so long--Faith.  Using reason and careful throught, Harris examines the dangers of faith unchecked.  He demonstrates how faith-based intangible concepts such as promises of big rewards in the afterlife for doing things such as blowing up buildings and killing people who oppose certain views can have a chilling effect on the freedoms of all.  Harris dares questions the free pass faith gets when it comes to scrutiny and reason.    Perhaps it is a symptom of political correctness that our leaders won't confront the issue of dogma-inspired violence and faith-based fatalities.  Harris doesn't accept the vapid excuses from mealy-mouthed spokes-holes, and asks why faith shouldn't be subject to the same rational scrutiny as any other subject.  Why should rational people suspend good judgement and remain silent when others use the personal refuge of religious belief to justify poiltics, power grabs and violence?  It should say enough that in an age where we can send people into space and combat a vast array of maladies with medical science, there are still people who can be easily whipped into a frenzy of violence by something as insubstantial as cartoons they don't like.      A runaway train is a danger to a few, runaway faith may spell the doom of civilization.  Now is the time for this book.  Passiveness in the guise of respect isn't going to stop madmen from taking out innocent folks and imposing tyranny based on literal religious interpretations.   It's time to reinstate the Age of Reason.  Critical thought is the first step in that direction.
B000E33VWW|4.0|While \\"Capote\\" structurally is a textbook-ready slice off the old American filmmaking pie -- healthy doses of foreshadowing in chiseled dialogue and little need to read between the lines -- the film's message neatly exposes the rotting underbelly of the American dream. The film, if it tends to take the life of Truman Capote and boil it down to the meaty part of the microscope slide (if you will), is little more than the mundane allegory of the poisoning of power, the Midas touch, but under Phillip Seymour Hoffman's guidance, the writer is given an almost spiritual charm. It's through Hoffman's subtle portrayal of human fragility that you find yourself empathizing with Capote, who, as it turns out, is the true antagonist of the film -- not the misguided killers due for the chopping block.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Yes, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a strange film.  It is not the Hollywood blockbuster type.  Liev Schreiber in his first directing project does an excellent job.  The film is visually stunning, from the odd world of Jonathan who collects things in ziplock bags and tacks them to a wall to the Ukraine where Lista lives in the middle of a field of sunflowers.  The performances are first-rate.  As Jonathan, Elijah Wood's performance is minimalist, with his huge glasses being as much a part of his performance as his emotions.  His sadsack expressions seem heir to Buster Keaton such as the scene where he sits with a boiled potato that flies on the floor and gets fed to the dog.  Boris Leskin who was in \\"Men In Black\\" plays Grandfather, with true flare.  The story of a man who thinks he's blind and therefore wears thick sunglasses but who nevertheless drives the car is silly and endearing.  Eugene Hutz as the Ukrainian translator makes a big impression in the film.  His book-learned English is hilarious such as asking Jonathan, \\"Do you participate in carnage with American women?\\"  Laryssa Lauret who plays the mysterious Jewish woman in the field of sunflowers turns in a stunningly beautiful performance.  Her eyes are soulful and filled with the depth of feeling of a lifetime.  One of the most touching moments comes as she asks if the war is over.  Sammy Davis Junior Junior, the dog, gives an excellent animal performance from the ferocious to the sympathetic.  The film is so individual in its look and story that it is immediately set apart from other films.  The issues of the Holocaust and loss make it emotionally universal in scope.  The fact that it is so well done makes it memorable.  Enjoy!
B000EXZKQM|5.0|I found out about this 2-disk set while watching the \\"Male Vocalists\\" episode of the new PBS television series \\"Legends of Jazz,\\" and after buying it, I find I am really looking forward to seeing all the rest of the actual half-hour TV shows from which these 13 tracks and clips are taken.  As for this set, let me say first that the audio and video quality are simply outstanding, among the best I have ever heard, in fact, (which is not surprising considering that the TV series is shot in HDTV and features really outstanding Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.)  Next, as for the performances themselves, they really shine and there is something here for everyone - the set covers everything from latin jazz to be-bop, Brazilian jazz, fusion-type jazz, vocal jazz, and even throws in a bit of the blues, with a great duet by Robert Cray and Keb' Mo'.  A really nice mix of artists, older and younger, and a pretty good value for money, considering that you get both a CD and a DVD packaged together in the box.  I highly recommend this!
B000005E60|4.0|Boulez's recording of \\"Sinfonia\\" is fascinating in that it creates a revisionist view of Berio as a far \\"cooler\\" composer than he was. Granted, the complicated score works on that level, and the reserve with which Boulez interprets lends an organicism to the work's slow movements, and a direction to the first.  <br /> <br />Just a word of correction to other reviewers: the original LP, which is quite outstanding, has Berio conducting, not Bernstein, and it lacks the fifth movement, which gives it an almost elegiac quality. What's more, while--through Boulez's championing and elsewhere--Berio has been viewed as a rather \\"formal\\" or cerebral composer, his original recording is, if anything, remarkably romantic. It's interesting to see how the London recording (rather cool, crystalline--even more reserved than Boulez) and the Boulez contrast with the Berio and, to a lesser extent, the fine Chailly recording in their attitudes towards the third movement's \\"Mahlerian\\" text. A conductor's attitude towards Mahler (ironic, detached, involved, \\"romantic\\") goes a long way towards showing what kind of message their Sinfonia will give.  <br /> <br />The Sinfonia was constructed with more than a little doubleness in mind, and, to that extent, the Boulez is a valuable, ostensibly dispassionate essay on all Berio's worldview circa '68. Two interesting counterpoints: Boulez took over for Bernstein at the NYPhil in '69. Also, while writing the Sinfonia, Berio wrote a widely circulated (christian science monitor) critique of the twelve-tone establishment, although he quotes Boulez during Sinfonia. Boulez's championing of Berio suggests that ideological lines are not nearly as solid as we might at first presume.
B00005MJ06|5.0|The brief drum roll followed by Valli's preternatural shrill notes ushered in Bob Gaudio's joyous,'Sherri'. It was startling, thrilling and not the last word from them. Together with Bob Crewe, Gaudio would pen a string of pearls for the Seasons between '62 and '65, so compelling that Beatlemania was effectively muted during those heady days. the American Fab Four held me in abeyance.The unadulterated ecstasy of Valli's falsetto never fails to elevate my spirits. What a bonus, this year to discover,'Bye, Bye Baby' was the musical accompaniment to our 6 year-old's dance class. The Seasons may be synonymous with the sap rising and the budding of flowers, but were, aptly, a year-round pleasure during my adolescence. The thrills are all collected here with great production, though I find I've bathed sufficiently by around track 11. If you delve into the formula of Gaudio's constructions, you don't require savvy smarts to sense that a young Brian Wilson would activate the Season's harmonic portent for his own ends. Nothing but the best on this one.
B000000WCA|5.0|When I was in grade nine, I was obsessed with the Spice Girls.  My aunt gave me their first album Spice for my birthday (I think when I turned 15).  She said that, at the time, her step-son loved them, and thought that I would love them too.  Well guess what?  She was right.  From that day forward, my obsession started.  I bought their second cd Spiceworld, and even bought a few singles.  I got 2 Stop singles; one with 3 live tracks and the other with 3 remixes of Stop.  I have their movie Spice World, 2 concert videos, one in Istanbul, and one in Wembley.  I also got the One Hour of Girl Power videotape as a gift.  So, as you can see, I took a dive in the Spice Girls frenzy!   <br /> <br />The first music video I saw of theirs was Say You'll Be There.  I instantly fell in love with the blonde one, and sometime throughout my obsession, I found out her name was Emma Bunton.  I learned the other girl's names too.  Mel C was my favourite, because she was sporty and she wore a lot of Adidas, my favourite brand name.  I remember actually dressing up like her on her birthday (I didn't know it was her birthday, honest!)  I wore my green Adidas outfit. <br /> <br />When Geri left the Spice Girls, it wasn't the same.  Victoria, Emma, Mel C and Mel B went on to produce a 3rd album called Forever.  Although Geri wasn't in the group, I found that their sound matured tremendously.  It had more of an R&B feel to it!  They looked more mature too.  But a little while after Forever, the Spice Girls broke up.  I don't remember my exact reaction to the break up, but I know I was really disappointed and sad.   <br /> <br />My favourite song on the Spice album is Wannabe, because it's short and sweet!  It was also the first ever single the Girls made.  I love the music video to it.  The girls are hyper and energetic.   <br /> <br />The Spice Girls came and went, and I can proudly say that I participated in that era, and I will never forget it. <br />
B00014K5TQ|4.0|You know, the craziest thing about Party Monster is the fact that it's based on a true story. From the looks of it, you would think that it was a good story made up by writers in a K-Hole.But no, these events actually happened. <br /> <br />Party Monster is the story about the rise and fall of Michael Alig, the party promoter who was \\"King of the Club Kids\\" and was poised to become the next Andy Warhol, until drugs wrecked his life and ultimately led him to murder Angel Melendez. The movie is based on \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" by Michael's former best friend James St. James, as well as the infamous documentary of the same name. <br /> <br />Taking the role of Michael Alig is none other than Macaulay Culkin, who many of you know from the movie \\"Home Alone\\". While Culkin's portrayal of Alig has been criticized by critics, if any of you have seen the documentary, he pulled a pretty accurate portrayal of Michael Alig. Probably the best acting job, however, goes to Seth Green, who plays James St. James. Seeing him play a flamboyant drug addled club kid was not only amusing, but he pulled it off with great results. <br /> <br />Other's that take part in the movie are indie legend Chloe Sevigny as Michael Alig's girlfriend(or f*g hag, depending on how you look at it), TV star Wilmer Valderama as aspiring DJ Keoki, and in a surprising appearance, shock rocker Marilyn Manson as freaked out tranny Christina. <br /> <br />The only reason that I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 is because it irked me at how many liberties were taken on the actual story. While I know that this is probably a must when making a movie, it still tends to bug the s**t out of me. <br /> <br />Still, this a great movie that goes hand in hand with the documentary. If you want a good clubbing flick that's also a true crime story, check out \\"Party Monster\\". So far this movie has gotten quite a cult following, which really doesnt surprise me. While Alig's crime was horrible and impossible to condone, there's still a part of us that's amazed by him. Why? I guess because, if you exclude his crime, there's areas of his crazy persona that we all have, whether they're noticed or not.
0060012234|5.0|Geography Club by Brent Hartinger is the story of Russell Middlebrook, a gay 16 year old, who is negotiating the dog-eat-dog world of high school popularity.  He is also firmly and solidly in the closet at the beginning of this book and over the course of the novel the reader explores the pitfalls, dangers, and excitements of being a high schooler and being gay.  Hartinger locates Russell's' story in the social borderlands; he is not super popular nor is he reviled, and he is smart and snarky, but very insecure.  When rumors of a gay kid and a gay club start to swirl at Goodkind High, Russell is finally starting to feel good about himself and rise up the popularity ranks thanks to the influence of his closeted jock boyfriend.  This leaves Russell to make difficult decisions that will resonate with any reader who feels or felt like an outsider in high school.   <br /> <br />The story is told in two parts, the first focusing on Russell's alienation as he thinks that he is the only gay kid at his high school, and the second on the choices he has to make to preserve his charade of straightness.   He joins in the jocks in making fun of the schools most unpopular kid, and the weight of doing so demonstrates the burden of popularity, and motivates Russell to stop hiding and come out publicly to make it right.   <br /> <br />The Geography Club itself is a brilliant red herring on Hartinger's part, a club designed by its members to purposely be too boring for any one to actually want to join, so the few gay kids at Goodkind can discuss their lives openly and honestly.  Once Russell starts coming out, he learns that he is no longer alone, providing the character with some much-needed reassurance, and also his own place in the high school social web, even if that place is a secret.  The entire concept highlights the importance of Gay Straight Alliances for high school students.   <br /> <br />Some readers may find themselves overwhelmed by the fast pace, numerous side characters and short side plots.  On the other hand, this almost frenzied quality is what gives Geography Club such cultural authenticity.  These characters are trying to negotiate the treacheries of high school, with its rampant gossip, various teenage tribes and strict social norms. The Geography Club finds itself in a web of secrets, lies, relationships, and sexual identities that seems real for those who have attended a public school.    In the end, Geography Club is a compelling story that highlights the emotional difficulties of being gay, but achieves it in a way that even straight kids will relate to.   <br /> <br />Personally, I wish that I had this book when I was 15.  There was nothing out there for gay folks at ALL, and I over identify with Min (except for the Asian part).  Thanks Brent.
B000002LCK|3.0|I'm a big New Order fan.  But how can this be, you may ask, if I'm giving \\"Substance,\\" the band's 1987 greatest hits album (with extra and alternative tracks) only three and a half stars?  Here is where musical tastes become very subjective.  Simply put, I'm not a huge fan of 80's British techno-pop, where technology (i.e. tinny sounding rhythm machines) took precedence over real instruments.  That being said, I do believe that Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook are terrific musicians, whose talents were revealed in their less synthesizer driven tracks, and especially in the band's last three albums, namely \\"Republic,\\" \\"Get Ready,\\" and \\"Waiting for the Siren's Call,\\" which are my three favorite N.O. albums by far. <br /> <br />As everyone knows, New Order followed in the wake of Joy Division, after Ian Curtis, J.D.'s vocalist and creative force, committed suicide in 1980.  Joy Division had a darker, at times almost apocalyptic sound, whereas the new band leader, Bernard Sumner, was interested in jauntier dance-oriented pop songs, with a touch of irony, and heavily relying, for the most part, on synthesizers to create a repetitive infectious sound in tracks that often exceeded six or even seven minutes in length.  In fact, two of the songs on New Order's \\"Substance\\" were recorded earlier by Joy Division (\\"Ceremony\\" and \\"In a Lonely Place\\"), and Joy Division's own greatest hits album, released a year later in 1988, was also entitled \\"Substance.\\" <br /> <br />As for the songs on N.O.'s \\"Substance,\\" I have to say that some run on too long and sound too mechanical to me.  Some of the instrumentals on the second c.d., seem completely redundant.  However, there are obviously dance classics here, especially \\"Blue Monday,\\" \\"Ceremony,\\" \\"Temptation,\\" \\"Procession,\\" and perhaps a few others (it's hard for me to keep the tunes straight in my mind since the titles often don't correspond to the songs).  \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" is a wonderfully playful song with quirky lyrics (\\"Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray.  I'm waiting for that final moment you'll say the words that I can't say\\"). <br /> <br />As you might have guessed from my comments above, my favorite song on the album is \\"True Faith,\\" which reminds me of \\"Regret\\" from the \\"Republic\\" album, both of which are two of my favorite New Order songs.  \\"True Faith\\" has an incredibly compelling melody which sort of sweeps the listener away, and who could ever forget that strange video where two clowns continuously slap each other in the face? <br /> <br />I understand that \\"hardcore\\" New Order fans might not agree with this review, and may, in fact, consider \\"Republic\\" and its aftermath to be something of a sell-out (I wonder what hardcore Joy Division fans felt about early New Order).  Just try to accept the fact that a \\"true\\" New Order fan might feel differently.  The 80's techno-pop sound dominating \\"Substance\\" just doesn't have the same resonance with me as does the more lush instrument-driven melodies of the band's later releases, where not only do Sumner and Hook better demonstrate their proficiency in their playing, but also where Sumner's voice seems to improve with age.
0689878451|5.0|In And Tango Makes Three we are introduced to Roy and Silo, two male penguins who love each other very much and long for a chick of their own, and the open-minded zoo keeper who takes a chance and gives a choice to have a family of their own.  Despite the sexual orientation of the parents, this is not a book about sex or a moral lesson on homophobia, but a testament to the unique power of familial love and affection.  The message is clear, what families need is love and support to succeed. <br /> <br />The reader readily feels the joy and excitement of Roy and Silo when their baby finally hatches, and it jumps right off the page and into their heart.  The story would also apply to any couple or family dealing with infertility, not just gay families.  The book takes you through all the emotions involved in longing for, waiting for, and finally adopting and raising a child of their own.  It manages to do this while also maintaining scientific integrity and teaching children about the mating, breeding, and parenting behavior of Chinstrap Penguins.   <br /> <br />The illustrations capture the colors of a penguins world in cool blues, browns, and grays that make the black and white of the penguins seem incredibly vivid.  They suck the reader in so much that the bright vivid colors of the zookeeper and his office become that which is strange and alien.  And the individual illustrations are able to evoke as much pathos as the text itself, for example, the heartbreaking scene of the two penguins looking at their empty nest with confused longing or the joy apparent on their penguin faces when the see their new baby for the first time.  The illustrations also impressively incorporate many different perspectives, such as one shot looking down at the nest and another showing the progression of baby Tango breaking out of her egg.  And the text interacts with the illustrations, such as when Roy and Silo are shown doing things together such as bowing, swimming, and building a nest, by wrapping around the individual illustrations or curving in ways that suggest movement.
B000002LEU|3.0|My general method for reviewing music on this web site has been to review all of the studio releases, chronologically, of my favorite artists.  The band I'm now focusing on is New Order, but I have uncharacteristically reviewed their albums out of order (so to speak) because I didn't have their earlier cds.  But I realized how much I liked New Order, so I recently purchased on-line, the early N.O. albums I was missing.  I have owned \\"Substance\\" by Joy Division (as well as the album of the same name by N.O.) for some time, and I figured, what the heck, even though its not my cup of tea, I'll review it anyway, because, as every fan should be aware, Joy Division turned into New Order after the former's lead singer, Ian Curtis, committed suicide in 1980.   <br /> <br />There's no question that one can detect the influence of Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook in both bands, but while Sumner obviously  was (and is) the force behind N.O., Curtis obviously was the force behind J.D., which had a much darker and more brooding sound.  As one might expect, the Curtis influence is far greater on the first N.O. album (\\"Movement\\") than in later releases. <br /> <br />Anyway, let's talk about Joy Division and their album \\"Substance,\\" basically their greatest hits.  What strikes me with this short lived band (1976-1980) was they were sort of in no-mans land, hovering between late-70's punk and early-80's new wave, and clearly exerting influence over bands that followed.  In fact, one can hear a prominent J.D. influence in some modern bands, especially Interpol.  Songs such as \\"Warsaw\\" (one of the earlier names of the band), \\"Digital\\" and \\"Failures,\\" sound to me like they could have been performed by the Sex Pistols (albeit with different lyrics).  On the other hand, \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" \\"Transmission,\\" and \\"Atmosphere,\\" if sung by Sumner, would have sounded just fine on any New Order album. <br /> <br />\\"Substance\\" is an interesting and curious album by a band that could be described with the same adjectives.  I think \\"Love Will tear Us Apart,\\" and \\"Transmission\\" are the two classic songs, but I can see if others want to mention the first three tracks as well (\\"Warsaw,\\" \\"Leaders of Men\\" and \\"Digital\\").  To be honest, the album kind of loses me after \\"Failures\\" (track 12), but that might be because I just don't have the patience to listen to so many songs that are strange and discordant, like most of these.  Also, I should mention that I like New Order quite a bit more, especially their last three albums.  Still, I'm awarding this \\"Substance,\\" the same number of stars as New Order's \\"Substance,\\" so please don't consider this a negative review.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|Director Lasse Hallstrom admits in a bonus feature on this DVD that he fell in love with Venice, that this is the first film to be filmed entirely in that magnificent city, and that he elected to play Serenissima as the main character.  And that is clearly the best part of this adaptation of the life of the infamous womanizer Casanova.  The film sparkles, glows, and reeks of atmosphere, gratefully hiding the fact that the script is a mediocre mishmash of history and purged legend.<br /><br />Casanova is played by Heath Ledger and while it must be said that he does a fine job of creating the character he is given to play, this Casanova is a rather bland, skinny, lustless ordinary man, not one that would make a city full of ladies swoon for his ardor.  Though we see a few very tame conquests in the first minutes of the film, this Casanova is pictured as a grown boy, pining for his harlot mother who left him as a child, and a man who really longs to discover the love of his life and settle down.  He encounters a true feminist in Francesca Bruni (Sienna Miller) who is disguising her considerable profeminist writing talents as one Guardi.  But alas, Francesca is betrothed to the Lard King of Genoa, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt) and Casanova becomes engaged to a sexually frustrated Victoria (Natalie Dormer) who is in turn desired by Francesca's nerdy virgin brother Giovanni (Charlie Cox).  To further complicate matters Casanova is pursued by the Inquisition in the form of Bishop Pucci (Jeremy Irons) and is tried and convicted of ribald acts with nuns, sentenced to hang etc etc etc.  Paprizzio arrives from Genoa as Carnivale is beginning, and though intended for Francesca, he is more attracted to Francesca's widowed mother Andrea (Lena Olin).  There are endless scenes of mistaken identities abetted by the wearing of masks at Carnivale and the bits and pieces of all the intrigues fall together in a humorous and entertaining fantasy fashion.<br /><br />Venice is splendid as the star, especially as captured by cinematographer Oliver Stapleton and the story romps along to a glorious musical score by the very fine Alexandre Desplat with a lot of help from Albinoni, Corelli, Handel, Soler, Paisiello, Rameau and Vivaldi!  This is hardly a raucous picture one would expect about the wiles of the legendary Casanova, but once you accept the fact that the story has been cleaned up a lot it comes across as fleetingly great fun.  The stunningly costumed cast is consistently first rate, with Oliver Platt once again demonstrating that he can play almost any role he is given to perfection! This is a fun movie and a great travelogue for those of us addicted to the beauties of Venice!

0441009425|3.0|The problem with this book is not the writing, not the very interesting world, nor the characters being depicted.  It's just that it takes Mr. Reynolds so many many pages to line up his storytelling ducks in this particular series.<br /><br />I made through about half of Absolution Gap (the 3rd in the series) before giving up in frustration.  Since then, I have learned that it was the last volume, but this was in no way obvious on page 200 or so - it just looked like it was going to drone on forever.<br /><br />I think that Reynolds is one of the better new SF talents.  But starting this set is only worthwhile if you really really don't mind long books.  If you value brevity, by all means read something else of his.
B000022TSW|2.0|There were some excellent, hilarious moments in this film. But as a whole, it was not good.  The profaneness was \\"forced\\" and it was obvious.  At times, it added humor, but most of the time it made it stupid.  The whole Saddam and Satan thing was just stupid and more geared towards a 14 year old than the usual, ironic adult humor this show is good for.  Save this 81 minutes of your life.  OR, better yet, watch some of the former TV episodes.  Many of those are great!
B000B0WODA|5.0|Okay, I've never heard of these guys at all, but when I walked into my local Fry's and heard this playing, it immediatly clicked.  I've had it now for close to a week from this writing and still am not tired of it.  There are no bad songs on this album. Lyrics in a few are strange, but generaly catchy and the music is addicting. <br />My favorite songs: Outsiders, What You Meant, Walk Away, the title track, and The Fallen. <br />For a man of my age, it is good to hear that there are still artist that enjoy putting out music instead of junk.
B00004R7TP|5.0|Kate Bush's \\"Hounds of Love\\" broke her through to a much larger audience in the United States where she was viewed as the female Peter Gabriel. While Bush continued to break boundaries and push herself with her music the comparison wasn't exactly accurate like Gabriel she's a unique musiciain who has flowered and grown with time not wanting to repeat herself. This terrific remastered edition (remastered in 1997)of \\"Hounds of Love\\" sounds better than the earlier release and has, as an added bonus, some terrific b-sides and single A sides tacked on at the end.<br /><br />This album is dying to re-released as a DVD/CD combo or in some enhanced format with Bush's videos for the album.  The sound is extremely good and a definite step up from the previous edition of the album. The bonus tracks include the A-side remixes for her singles \\"Running Up That Hill\\" and \\"The Big Sky\\". We also get \\"Be Kind To My Mistakes\\" (which did receive a CD release as part of the CD single for \\"The Sensual World\\"). \\"Under the Ivy\\", \\"Burning Bridge\\" and \\"My Lagan Love\\" all are terrific and merit inclusion on this set due to the strong quality of the performances and material. Both the improved remastering along with the bonus tracks make this essential for Kate Bush fans.<br /><br />The booklet comes enhanced with lots of photos as well as the original lyrics for the album. It would have been nice though to include the lyrics for the bonus tracks and list the musicians for that as well. We also get a brief essay discussing the merit of the album and its importance.<br /><br />All in all a terrific package that could be improved, this is definitely worth picking up for the Kate Bush fan particularly if you don't have \\"This Woman's Work\\" which features some of the b-sides included as bonus tracks here and the remixes.
076792603X|2.0|After all the hype, what a waste!<br /><br />I thought the story was very lacking. No character development and not original.  The whole premise of the book is contained in three pages in the middle of the book that are portrayed as historical fact but given no support.<br /><br />This is the type of book that is what libraries are intended for.  A book not worth paying good money for.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I'm predisposed to like period pieces, and I like Casanova.  It has a fine cast, and I believe that he should have received a wider release than it did.    Heath Ledger plays Casanova, and he is very good in the semi swashbuckling role.  The role of Francesca is played by Sienna Miller, who does a fine job in her role as an early feminist.  The role of the Pope's inquisitor Bishop Pucci is played by Jeremy Irons, who does a solid job.  The scene stealer of the film is Natalie Dormer as Victoria, Casanova's fiance.  Think a younger version of Uma Thurman, and hopefully she will have that type of career.      The director says that he believes that the film got and R rating because of one scene at carnival where Casanova is trying to juggle his two love interests Francesca, and Victoria.  There is a scene where Victoria crawls under the table.  I personally believe that the film got a R rating from the scene in the nunnery.  It gives a whole new meaning to the old saying, \\"Get thee to a nunnery.\\"    The film is visually stunning, but that is mostly because the movie was filmed in Venice, and you are seeing things that you haven't seen before, because they haven't been put on film in 80 years.  If you are like me you who feel like you were watching a little piece of history, or walking through a good museum, because the city itself becomes a character in the movie.    The soundtrack is reminiscent of Vivaldi, but surprisingly, it's not.  I would call this music baroque, but I am not sure it's that either.    To sum up, I found this movie, a highly enjoyable drama/comedy for adults.  Casanova would make a good double feature with Dangerous Beauty or Dangerous Liaisons, both of which are available at Amazon.com and all of which I can highly recommend.  So, sit back and enjoy an evening with these DVD's, and don't forget the popcorn.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've noticed a lot of reviewers here say that they never even played or completed FF VII prior to watching this masterpiece.... Well, I did. So here's my review.    This movie along with the game it's based off of is one of the essential must own items since the beginning of time, I'm serious.     The movie has the best CGI ever to be seen in cinema, it'll blow anything by Peter Jackson right outta the water.    The movie is filled with as mentioned beautiful CGI and animations. And  action? This movie has tons of it. In fact, the whole second half of the movie is action.     All the characters in FF VII make a return in this movie, most of which don't get much screen time, but all is forgiven, due to them appearing in the climatic VS. Weapon scene. And the Turks return! And they provide some hilarious comic relief.    The storyline isn't as good as VII' is, but since Square Enix had a time limit of less than two hours you'd expect that. But I'm telling you, in those 101 minutes you'll get some major goose bumps from the adrenaline filled scenes.     The Cloud VS. Sephiroth scene is.... Masterful. No doubt about it. If this was the only battle in the whole movie, it'd still be worth buying, just for this one beautiful final confrontation.    So I'll close my, well, biased review with a perfect score of 10/10    Buy this masterpiece if you like millions of other people enjoyed Final Fantasy VII. I guarantee you'll love it
0804106304|4.0|I found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post-immigrant fiction. The Chinese-American experience is different from the Jewish-American experience or the Irish-American experience, but they also have a great deal in common. Tan successfully portrays the younger generation's desire to conform to American ideals and the older generation's often stubborn resistance to acculturation. Somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation.<br /><br />My only gripe is not with the book itself but with the notion that this is a profound work of literature that needs to be taught in high school or even college classes. I see it as excellent popular fiction, which is a major achievement, but not as a book for the ages.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Well, <br /> <br />I have to say I'm getting real tired of the same style bands. There's nothing worse then a commercial sounding band with horrible lyrics that do nothing but blatently thrash the  world. It saddens me to know that the \\"today\\" main-stream bands CONSTANTLY consist of immoral sexual themes, drugs, violence, and swearing. I Can't believe there are parents out there that allow there children to listen to this kind of music-if you can call it that. But, as for the review, that's irrelevent. Green day is highly over rated and has been forever. Its just one of those parent/America/Christian hating bands that have no concept. I know that when I listen to that kind of music, it brings me down.  <br /> <br />So parents, If your perfectly cool with letting your kids listen to a bunch of drug, sex and violence then be my guest, and waist your money on trash like this. <br /> <br />For parents who want to raise decent, well behaved civil children, I advise you stay far away from this band. I wish I could give 0 stars, but I guess I have to give them 1 for not being completely tone-deph.
0440180295|5.0|Fellow reviewer, Reinhold Strnat, you gave only one star to one of the greatest authors this country has ever produced.  I am now 42, but this book, along with \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" got me hooked on Vonnegut when I was 15.  <br /> <br />You say \\"If this is such a great anti-war book, why doesn't it make that point?\\" You actually answered that question yourself when you say, \\"It doesn't seem to have a point.\\"  Get it? Probably not.  Pick it up again in a few years, perhaps when you're in college when abstraction may come more naturally.  Then release any concrete expectations you may have as to how a point is to be made.  Let the humor, the absurdity, and the humanity take you right to the point that really is there.  When that comes, you too, will become yet another Vonnegut fan seeking out more of his work.  Best wishes on your future mind-expansion.   <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|The first thing that one realizes upon watching this movie is that it is relies almost entirely on A: the nostalgia impact for Final Fantasy 7 fans, and B: neat special effects. While this is not such a bad thing, we must objectively admit that Final Fantasy 7 is not the defining game of all gamedom, nor of all role-playing gamedom. Yes, it had financial success. Yes, it brought scores and scores of people into the genre who had never had prior experience with a \\"magic point\\". But why did all these people convert? Because this game pushed the envelope? Because it raised the bar? No, not technically speaking. Mainly, it brought a few things that were sorely lacking in the genre at the time, namely fun, cool-ness, and relief from the stagnation of medieval times. You get to ride motorcycles! You get a big-flippin' sword, and spiky hair! Oh wait, we had that in Chrono Trigger already, nevermind.<br /><br />Many would argue that the main innovation of this title was actually the story, but this cannot reasonably be factually supported. We have a bad guy, we have bigger bad guys, they're bad, we should whack them. Pretty typical. The idea of draining life force from the planet for industrial purposes was fairly interesting, though it's really just an introductory plot to the real evil as you soon find out. What went a much longer way was the surrounding intricacy, and, as they say, the devil is in the details. Having really cool character concepts (beyond just cool art) helps, but the interactions were pretty solid. We actually gave a damn about the relationships between Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris. Some of the \\"bonus\\" characters were a tad under-developed, but by that point we were mostly so thoroughly entrenched into actually becoming the protagonist that we barely noticed or cared all that much. This is much more emotionally involving than the second most popular game in the series at the time (FF3), which despite being wonderful and beautiful had a great number more protagonists, and in retrospect left us feeling a little disconnected and tugged around at times. Many purists at the time had beef with the materia system, which was certainly not a logical step forward from the Esper system, but ended up being a valuable plot device for the game, though just a neat trinket for the movie.<br /><br />So, since I'm trying to explain what strengths were brought forward from the game into the movie, let me just say that they could have done better. A few recognizable music themes re-appear, not to mention a new and very dramatic choral theme where the main lyric is, you guessed it, \\"Sephiroth\\". Unfortunately, this theme, and much of the rest of the movie, is absolutely sullied by ridiculously cheesy and uninspired driving  90's rock. It was very insulting, and reminiscent of Power Rangers fight songs. It was absolutely laughable and shameful at times, like when a jolly little waltz kicks in when Cloud is being stabbed by Sephiroth. Where were the noble composers we had come to expect? Pushed aside so that Godsmack fans with little in the way of music appreciation could get their rocks off. Speaking of insulting, and I don't know whether to blame the localization team or the Japanese writers, but Cloud's line to Sephiroth of \\"Stay where you belong, in my dreams!\\" was absolutely abysmal. And don't forget the snappy \\"Your mom is cool... wait, what am I saying?\\" delivered to the Remnants by our friend Reno.<br /><br />The character development, despite a newly invented ultra-brooding side for Cloud, was pretty much left to prior knowledge of the game. I patiently sat through the \\"Reminisce\\" feature, which was actually a welcome addition as two of the three people I had watched the movie with had never finished the game. Consider it a refresher course in Final Fantasy 7... and one last chance to remember how convoluted and unnecessarily long the plot was. Also, many of the characters specifically received fewer lines because they were cleverly trying to conceal the ridiculous accents given by the US voice actors. To be fair, though, the US voice acting was for the most part pretty great, though I probably could have found a better Sephiroth at the local community college drama department.<br /><br />Though enjoyable as an action movie, don't look for much in the way of something to really sink your teeth into. There are a few scenes that slam the brakes on the pace for no apparent reason, (like where Cloud and Tifa pass out, or the overly-emphasized comic relief from the Turks), so maybe even the action fans would be pissed, despite the fact that they even included the beloved Limit Breaks. Like the first Final Fantasy movie, I think I will find many people trading this one in over the coming years, as all the people who had no interest in the Final Fantasy aspect of it start to decide it just isn't worth owning when it could get you four dollars towards the new Nickelback CD. I don't hold the game to be utterly sacred as others do, but I think it could have made a better movie. Forgive me for being the devil's advocate, but this review is mainly for those who don't snuggle with Moogle plush dolls at night.<br /><br />...now I'm going to go log onto Final Fantasy XI.erly trying to conceal the ridiculous accents given by the US voice actors.

B000FA57RQ|5.0|I'm Going To tell You A Secret is another documentary from the most successful female recording artist in history the one and only MADONNA. For anyone who has seen Madonna Truth or Dare (Blonde Ambition Tour 1990) you know how entertaining Madonna can be. If you are looking for a Truth or Dare part 2 you are going to be disappointed. This is Madonna 14 years later (Reinvention Tour 2004) and she is not pushing the boundaries of sexuality as she did in the early 90's. What Madonna is doing is what we all at one point in our lives or another do, and that is question the purpose of our lives and that we try to be better people. At times I do miss the early sexual in your face Madonna, but like Madonna me and many other fans have grown up and are older and we have different interests. There comes a point in your life when you start to look beyond the surface and want to know more about the big picture. I will be forever grateful that I was one of those kids that got to see and grow up with Madonna and watch her push all those boundaries and define the music and MTV era like no one before or since. Now days it is hard to find someone who is as daring, truthful, outspoken or original as she was and still is. What will separate Madonna from other stars is that she keeps going. She may be drug down in the dirt for releasing what some call a bad album or bad movie, yet she will bounce back and amaze the hell out of you with a record breaking album (Confessions on A Dance Floor hit #1 in over 40 countries) and release a tour that goes beyond what a tour is supposed to be by stimulating your mind and senses. She is human and like all of us she will have her ups and downs. What makes her a true artist is that she does what she wants and creates the art she wants, and you can either join her along for one amazing emotional journey or you can stay behind and watch. I'm Going To Tell You A Secret is a great documentary and it shows no matter how rich and famous you get there is more to life than just that.

B000F6IOC0|5.0|I could say a lot about how much I liked this movie, but it would just be rehashing what others have said.<br /><br />One point that I would like to make. Marcus and Micheal, are remarkedly different hybrids. Mike has a wolfish look, as Marcus is batty. I like how they did differentiate them that way. Mike was a Lycan first, Marcus was a vampire. I liked that.
0143034545|2.0|I rated the same author's \\"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity\\" a five stars on Amazon with the review title \\"Excellent! Helpful for all walks of life\\". I am so sorry to comment that this \\"Ready for Anything\\" is an inferior and cliche version of his previous book. Sorry to comment that the author's attempt to write a much more strategic book on productivity had failed miserably. Read \\"Getting Things Done\\" instead, which is tactical but highly helpful. Dont waste your valuable time and money on this.<br /><br />p.s. I hold no bias on whether a book should be strategic or tactical, or both, as long as it's interesting and helpful.
1577311523|3.0|There is some truth in what Tolle writes but his understanding is incomplete and suggests he is niavely unaware of his ignorance or trying to exploit the ignorance of others. In any case, I do not find the instuction of a true master in the material I have been exposed to. He talks about the achievement of enlightenment but the third step, or as the Buddhist say, the third noble truth, is absent: the way to end suffering. This is where the true master's value is; in directing the student to a direct understanding of how to traverse the path from suffering to the realization of the end of suffering. It seems as if Mr Tolle is hoping the reader/student/listener will get lucky. Perhaps he has or perhaps he is exploiting the teachings of a true master. I believe he is setting himself up as another trap, one he may even be caught in. At any rate; he has nothing to offer that the dedicated student can not find without his assistance. He is not that special. Instead go to the library or better yet; find a true master. I might suggest Mr. Prem Rawat who teaches a \\"Knowledge\\" and reveals techniques that will help the practioner actually achieve the goal: Peace Now!

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I loved FFVII and I purchased this movie based on that love.  While the movie was acceptable (especially considering the level of movies released today), it wasn't as good as it was advertised.  There is little to no character development, Aeris's voice acting was horrible, and the plot just didn't do it for me.   <br /> <br />   While I know many out there did not like Square's last motion picture (FF: The Spirits Within), I can't help but compare the level of animation and find FF:AC lacking.  You may attribute this to an attempt to make it 'videogame-ish' but I don't see why they couldn't have put more work into it (especially since it was in development so long).  Don't get me wrong, the characters looked good (they probably just didn't sink as much money into it as FF:TSW since they lost so much money on that one) and Cloud especially was modeled very well. The fur of Red XIII, Cait Sith, and the 'wolf' wasn't very good and consequently they didn't get much screen time.  I don't hold that against the movie because fur is just hard to pull of realistically.  The motion of the people, especially in fight scenes, seemed very fake.  I know that sounds weird since the whole movie is technically fake, but it really stands out and was distracting.   <br /> <br />    As for the plot, it was fairly undeveloped.  People did things for no reason (for example, (described vaguely to not give spoilers), someone is kidnapped for no given reason (although I suppose it could have been to lure Cloud -- they never explain why and there was a better candidate if that was the reason), was never used by the bad guys, and escapes with no consequences). And the wolf? Never explained. And I felt some key points like Geostigma was never really used to its full potential (nor was it explained why the city ignored the tons of sick orphans on the street -- I guess Midgar is still a self-centered town?). And the rest of the FFVII cast randomly shows up near the end.  Vincent and Tifa were secondary characters, but the rest were merely cameos.  I liked seeing them but I feel they were there because they had to show up sometime and not because the plot needed them. And the worst part is they don't even help that much. And the ending? Waaay too convienent and random in my mind, with religious overtones for some reason.  I don't really see it as a dramatic conclusion to Cloud's story, but that's my opinion.  In any case, it is a weak ending that kind of jumps out of nowhere.      <br /> <br />   On the plus side, I love the Turks! Reno and Rude were funny --  too bad they didn't have more scenes. And I felt they did a good job with their boss (as a possible spoiler, I won't say who it is) as a character.  He's the only one that really got some character development (except for Cloud, but they kind of made him like Squall - a 'it don't concern me, leave me alone' quasi-jerk and then at the end he isn't so much.  Yay character development.  But then I don't like overly angsty characters.) <br /> <br />   It is probably worth seeing it for FF fans and I know some people who didn't know FF and loved it.  But for me, someone who knows and loves FF and who knows and loves animation movies, this was an average movie that I will own only because it will complete my FF collection.
6305428352|4.0|Notice I capitalized the word \\"movie\\" in the title of the review. The reason I did this is because it is a *movie*, not fact. While it is doubtful (although not entirely implausible) that the people whose lives Mr. Holland touched would be able to pull off a concert honoring the man like they did at the end of the movie, WHY should that detract from your enjoyment of the film? As Woody Allen said in ANNIE HALL, you can't get things perfect in life, so you try to get them perfect in art. Who the hell wanted to see Glenn Holland walk out of the school the last time dejected and forgotten? This is a man who gave up his dream (at first out of necessity but eventually out of dedication) to teach high school kids the wonder of music, and at the end of the movie he should walk out of the place for the last time thinking he's a failure? That is nonsense. <br /> <br />As for his less-than-perfect character, it made him human. His profound disappointment at his son's deafness (something perfectly understandable, as he's a musician and wants to share his love of music with his son) is something he eventually comes to terms with (although it takes a long time) - yes, it's selfish of him to feel that way, but again, he's human. The moment when he figures out a way to communicate with his son using music is wonderful. As for comments about the place of the arts in schools, when Mr. Holland tells the school board that they're creating a generation of children who will not be able to think or create, he's absolutely right. There is a bankruptcy of imagination in this country, and cutting the arts is a big part of that problem.  <br /> <br />I myself enjoyed this movie tremendously and share it with everyone I can.
0385510454|4.0|The author is a lawyer by profession. So do not expect a mistake in that field. But this book does not have to do with a lot of legal arguments. We are in the field of lobbying and power. Who has real power in our modern democracies ? The President ? The CIA and FBI ? Congress ? The People ? Or the rich who can pay for and use organized professional pressure groups know as lobbies ? No direct answer in the book, though a lot of implied answering matter. But we deal with the study of what happens when such a lobbying firm gets in possession of military secrets that give them a tremendous and totally secret power and that make them a competitor to secret services and spying agencies around the world. There the answer is once again not clear at all and Grisham definitely projects the dominant opinions and fears of the Western world, or maybe only of the Western hemisphere or even maybe only of the Northern third of the Western hemisphere, onto his subject : the Israeli Mossad is definitely a band of professional killers but they are `'self''-defending the state of Israel and this seems enough to justify these killings for Grisham. The Russians are poor and uninterested in anything and willing to live alone in their corner with their antiquated living style. This view is obviously anterior to the announced decision that Russia will oppose, or not support, sanctions against Iran. They do have the power to veto all United Nations decisions, do they not ? The Americans are, in spite of all the war episodes between and among security agencies and spying chapels, the depositary of all possible peace and safety for the entire world. Europe is nothing but the playground of everyone else. And finally Red China is both ahead of everyone and yet far behind the first three pakistani hackers that come along out of high school. Red China is dangerous, totally inhuman and dictatorial, which means dangerous for the world they only aim at conquering and controlling. Pure post-cold-war phantasms. And yet the book is interesting at another level : the discovery of Italy and the long lesson of Italian. If you can't speak some decent Italian after reading this book, it is because you are linguistically hopeless. That makes the book entertaining though it is rather shallow and superficial. As Grisham himself says : ? If something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake. ? We will note that the sentence is absolutely meaningless, but it is true down to its very last letter and comma. We must suspend our disbelief a lot and just enjoy the adventure, even if it sounds very iffy at times.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit? Paris Dauphine, Universit?

B000002OX7|5.0|Originally intended to be a sci-fi rock opera titled \\"Lifehouse\\", WHO'S NEXT is a classic that ranks amongst the finest rock albums ever recorded.  It's also the greatest album from The Who - and that's saying something.  This is due in part to the variety of emotions on this album, ranging from scathing anger on the classic \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" to free-spirited love on \\"The Song is Over\\".  \\"Baba O'Reilly\\", as grand a song as The Who ever recorded, opens the album.  There's very little time between that song and the subsequent tune, \\"Bargain\\" (which is filled with fierce vocals by Roger Daltrey, strong guitar-playing by Pete Townshend, and furious drumming by Keith Moon).  In fact, there's very little time between any of the songs; as soon as one is finished, we burst into the next.  It's particularly delightful to burst into \\"My Wife\\", a fan favorite with extremely funny lyrics by bassist John Entwistle, about a man running for his life away from his wife.  This CD is a delight: along with the nine tracks from the original release of the album, the CD includes seven bonus tracks, four of which have never before been released.  WHO'S NEXT is a must for anyone's collection.
B00004TVG7|5.0|The first remark concerns the instruments of this music, instruments that have been reconstituted on the model of the ancient ones. We will consider them as germanely faithful, and they create sounds, a sound environment or ambience that is particularly original. The second remark is that this music is based on  the pythagorian five-note scale that corresponds to the first five degrees of our modern major scale. Then a second group of these five degrees and intervals are added to the first five in a second identical group constituting a ten-note scale that will be the basis of all western music up to the Renaissance, and thus the basis of all Christian sacred music of the Middle Ages, a music known as gregorian. So, in this surprising sound ambience we also recognize some elements we have already heard and enjoyed in our heritage. Just take track # 3, ? Premier hymne delphique ? Apollon ?. Some of the chords are so close to gregorian music, and yet the instruments are so different, that we may think we are at the crossroads between some extraterrestrial music and gregorian chanting. In fact we are here at the very source of gregorian music that was to borrow everything from ancient Greek music. And then put this track # 3 in parallel with track # 16, ? Hymne chr?tienne (sic) d'Oxyrhynchus ? and you will hear the direct filiation. Track # 8 will provide you with the model of the traditional musics we find in the mountainous areas of the Mediterranean, Sicilia, Sardinia, Corsicca and Provence, among others, the music of shepherds and fishermen when coming back to land, a music that will become religious and christian later on and that still exists, mainly in the form of a polyphony. But the worst part - and also the best in a way - is that we only have fragments, tidbits, and that it is the concrete realization of the tremendous waste history has willed us and yet also the concrete evidence that history is never able to destroy something completely and that we have the means to reconstruct what has been destroyed with a specific procedure of genetic musical archaeology. To conclude we must take into account this recording is from 1978, i.e. a long time ago. To get a more complete vision we have to look for more recent recordings.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit? Paris Dauphine, Universit?

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|After reading Jane Austen's novel, I have had many arguments with myself over the judgements placed upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. I have decided that in thinking of a title for her book, Austen was not assigning one characteristic to each character but instead she was assigning two equal qualities to both of the main characters. I used to think that Mr. Darcy, with his wealth and prominent upbringing, was too PROUD to be in the presence of commoners like the Bennets. Elizabeth on the other hand, after first witnessing Darcy's poor attitude and pride, made that her first and last impression of him. Ever since that moment, Lizzy became PREJUDICED toward Mr. Darcy and others like him. These qualities can also be switched; Darcy shows prejudice against people of lower rank or standing in society when he comments on Elizabeth's appearance or when later he addresses the entire Bennet family and their inappropriate behavior in public. Elizabeth could be considered proud in that she stands up for her family, her friends, and her way of life. <br />  After being able to support both characters under either quality, I still wonder whether or not these qualities are upheld at the end of the story. Interestingly enough, the characters didn't necessarily show prejudice against eachother, but against eachother's company and also against their own. Their union seems an obvious way to allow them both to continue to be negative toward eachother's relations and their own in the privacy of their shared home. I also believe that they both continue to be proud individuals because with confidence and self esteem comes pride in one's self. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet sis not change at all throughout the story, they simply found in eachother the perfect match, both proud and prejudiced to the core.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|David Gilmour is one of those rare guitarists that has the ability to make you feel a variety of emotions. His compositions can be very uplifting and they can also be haunting and dark. \\"On An Island\\" is, like many reviewers have said already, a mellow album. Maybe not something a die-hard Pink Floyd fan may like, but maybe someone who's a fan of his work on the album \\"The Division Bell,\\" and who enjoys hearing music that plays it \\"safe.\\" There's alot to enjoy about this album, but by the same token, it can also be something that you may not listen to all the time. I really liked this album, but I didn't give it a 5-star rating, because it's not something I'd continously come back to time and time again. In fact, I haven't heard a Pink Floyd album in about 6 years. I mostly listen to jazz music now.
1400079179|1.0|Not worth the money.  Choppily written.  Poorly researched fantasy palmed off as \\"truth.\\"  If this is all true, as Brown says, then why would the earliest followers of Christ, including Peter, die painful deaths for a lie?
0316172324|5.0|This is a very amazing book that is so amazing and interesting that you'll be finished before you know it. <br /> <br />Gladwell really hooks the reader from the start with his wit and surprises. It will really change the way you think about the way you think (as complicated as that might be). <br /> <br />The stories and tests that are told about in this book are usually pretty interesting and make little sense until you read the end, and it all makes sense again. <br /> <br />This is a very good read- now I'm just hoping Gladwell comes out with more books!
B000E41MS6|5.0|Having grown up as a child with all the doctors, hiding behind the soffa it was so scary I at first found this one a bit flashy. As the series progressed found myself eagerly awaiting every episode. The characters are what I have come to expect from Dr. Who. With just the right amount of old and favorite enemies ex. the daleks, cyber man, mixed for famililarity. And of course it wouldn't by Dr Who without the good old signiture tune. The enthusiasm shown by Billie Piper and Christopher Eccleston make them believable. Now I am watching series 2 on the tv and can't for this one to be released on dvd.
B000002U82|5.0|We've all tried synchronizing \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" We've all found only the weakest correlations and those only by forcing it. But one trait the two masterpieces share is that each feels like a delirium dream that differs a bit each time we experience it.<br /><br />Listening to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is like listening to secret conversations in an asylum. The music is the sound of dementia and the stories told are those of madness, disease and death.<br /><br />Few albums compare to Floyd's trippy, dim journey to the dark side of the moon and back. At times poetic, at times gloomy and almost always profound, each song is unique in its richness and each is somewhat open to interpretation. Academics and stoners alike have analyzed each syllable, each individual note for glimpses into the soul of this inimitable band.<br /><br />Ticking clocks, low, throaty chuckles and the faraway groan of gongs lead the listener across bleak landscapes. \\"Breath,\\" \\"Time\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" seem to reflect on the perils of plotting one's course through the time and space of a fleeting lifetime. \\"Brain Damage\\" hints at mental disorder, disease and paranoia. And all the while, the hallucinatory ticks and tocks threaten to carry the listener away to a strange place if he does not secure his feet to the ground.<br /><br />For music that is experienced as much as heard, there are few, if any, albums out there that compare with \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Try playing it along with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" if you have to. Though it is not the startling, eerie match-up early legends would have you believe, there are some spooky moments. Increase the drama by creating a drinking game out of it. I'll see you on the dark side of the moon, or in the detox ward.
0804836272|5.0|For over two centuries Japan was ruled by the Shogunate under a law of isolationism, but in the mid-1800s this policy was to change with the arrival of Matthew Perry and his armed warships from the U.S. Navy. Their arrival sparked a revolution and the overthrow of the Shogunate: SHINSENGUMI: THE SHOGUN'S LAST SAMURAI CORPS is the first English narrative of these events, tracing the internal conflicts within the Japanese world and the rise in murders, assassination and violence as a result. The Shinsengumi were the most dreaded security force Japan had ever known, and their power and effects are followed through one of the most confrontational periods of Japanese history. A 'must' for any student of Japanese history and military culture. <br />
B00005YXZH|5.0|When this first came out, it was lionized in the extreme, and I just thought it was okay.  Then I randomly played it with a healthy volume one night, and WOW.  To be sure, it's not for everyone- anytime a band experiments, they're going to alienate some.  Still, the songwriting is wonderful, the noisy interludes feel so good (especially when loud), and it keeps a coherent (though not stagnant) feel throughout.  And, it's the sort of thing that gets more satisfying with repeated listens. <br /> <br />By the way, it's been long established that Jeff Tweedy can't sing in any technical sense.  Maybe he's like Kris Kristofferson, whose producer told him, \\"so what if you can't sing- you have a voice that communicates.\\"
0064471837|4.0|For some reasons that I couldn't quite tell, this book didn't get me attached to its main character, Sabriel. Maybe for me, she isn't my type of heroine. In order to really like a book, I must love the lead... I don't know why the lead here didn't click for me.<br /><br />About the plot, it's not that I don't like it... but it's not that I like it either. I think this has something to do with me not being attached to Sabriel. In spite of this, I must say that the adventures of this story got me hooked up. They are unique, and I somehow wished that I've got Sabriel's power. How the concept of life and death was told in this book was truly incredible. It got me thinking what's it like to be in the world of the dead.<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars because in spite of not liking the main character, the adventures got me interested to read it. It was also nicely written.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Note: THIS is NOT for the squeemish. If you were raised on the Friday the 13th movies, Nighmare on Elm STreet, Dawn/Day of the Dead..You will know what to expect...except no humor this goes STRAIGHT for the JUGULAR... the FX is turly astounding. no computer generated BS...but like back in the days of the Master of make up and FX- TOM SAVINI & ROB BOTTIN when things where done by painstakingly by hand. This movie makes SAW and anything modern comparable to it like a walk in the park... It brings back the times when George Romero wasnt afraid to push the envelope and with a diabollically well written script..well with Hostel this goes WAY over The EDGE..it contains all the elements of a horror splatter fest...on steroids...Every thing is in your face from the obligory teens on a trip to Amperstdam to smoke and score with the gals and do they... only to find them selves a REAL LONG way from home and the extremely brutal lessons that follow... From what i have gathered from watching the Behind the secnes this movie was created on true events that actcally happened in Thiland and had to to with orginized crime....which makes this movie all the more gut wrentchingly distubingly than it already is... So if you are up to having your skin crawl and are NOT afraid to look away from the screen and are up for a Real good Horror/Splatter fest with a well written script...Then this is for you other wise BE WARNED and STAY AWAY.......
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along which breaks new ground in its genre...a movie which delivers memorable sequences, both visual and auditory. A film for the ages. Sadly, this is not one of them. This is a film shot on a shoestring budget with no name actors and whose only purpose is to shock the audiance with \\"See, look how much gore I can put on the screen...and get away with it\\". This is quite simply a movie reflecting the basest of attitudes by some movie producers and directors. The fact that Quentin Tarrentino is somehow treated as a wonderful contributer to cutting edge movies doesn't speak well for those who actually buy tickets to see this drivel. Fortunately, I paid only a small rental fee and was still upset that I even paid that. If you really want to see gore, join the military and ask for duty in Iraq. There, it's real and stomach churning. Otherwise, spend your money on something worthwhile.
0689859368|5.0|The Spiderwick  seiries was fantastic but i have to say this book was one of it's best.It all begins where Mallory,Simon and Jared leave their old house and move into another house.Their only choice was to go the the Spiderwick estate.In the middle of the Spiderwick estate lay a house with many many secerts that haven't been opened.The house was big like a mansion except it looked like it was ambushed.The house looked like it was eleven rooms all in one.At the start Simon can't find Mallory so he told Jared that she's been missing.Jared and Simon go on a hunt to find her.They check lots of places but they couldn't find her suddenly Simon remembered to check the girl bath rooms.When Simon takes a step into the bath room he doesn't see her so he checks the toilets, and inside one of the chambers for toilets Simon see's Mallory's fencing medal.She must have left it on the floor and guess what she did.Simon and Jared get taken into a mysterious world of lots of secrets.They end up in a world with lots of elves and legendary creatures.And only then Simon and Jared realised they were being carried by pixies!I will leave it to you to read the rest of the book.but for now i will give a few coments on the book.I think this book was great and i am looking foward to read the other books in the seiries.I also like to give a credit to the illustrator for putting in lots of magical creatures in to  your awesome sorounding.I hope the author could bring up another seiries like the Spiderwick seires.I commend this book for children with a wide mind
B00004RJDA|4.0|Ever since watching Notting Hill when it first came out I knew it was one of those films that was going to be one of my all time favourites! <br />Unlike the ordinary romantic comedies where I can find myself getting bored, this had me entertained throughout! Spike was a character who had me in stiches and I thought the relationship between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant came across very believable. <br />I would recommend this film to people who enjoy a giggle and also who enjoy a good love story and you don't even have to be a huge Hugh Grant fan to enjoy this - as I am certainly not!
0689859414|5.0|The end of the Spiderwick chornicles has just ended.**DrOmAtIc FaDe OuT**This seiries has really come a long way.I found this book very interesting.Once i saw the art work i was stunned,after i saw the pictures it made me give up all of my sports and try art.In the book there is all of the secrets that hid down there.I was really stunned i thought i really was one of the graces,But i wasn't.This book has really set me on the right track to fame.I'd like to thank the author u've been a great insperation.It was great.I recomend this book for children with a passionate mind for faeries.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is by far my favorite Metallica album. The reason I'm writing this is because if Metallica wants to make some cash, stop putting out lame albums and remaster the back catalog. Being a musician and a bassist, when I'm in the studio I tell the engineer to make sure I'm not Cliff Burtoned. Buried behind the guitars. Do him some \\"justice\\" and make him heard.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the film. The plot itself was very intelligent, the powers (angels/devils) have complicated plots and plans which are clearly and imaginatively represented in the movie. Keanu Reeves is a great movie star, ok so he will never be regarded as one of the finest thespians in history, irrelevent - he brings a presence to the character of Constantine. Rachel Weisz (as we know now) is more than just eye candy, a talented actress she brings the right note of vulnerability and humanity to her character. Tilda Swinton's portrayal of the androgenous Gabriel was suitably delicate and surreal. All in all i found the film very enjoyable, i loved the twisted take on the whole Judeo-Christian mythology - God is probably not a nice guy, angels can be smug callous and vicious creatures, demons are badder than you know and the whole of humanity just puppets - very refreshing. (Four 1/2 out of five (five for tilting))
B00005J6T0|4.0|Great packaging, excellent remastering, 12\\" versions of True Blue and La Isla Bonita. However, with the available space on the disc, the record company could have completed the \\"True Blue\\" era with the 12\\" versions of Papa Don't Preach and Open Your Heart.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This recording is simply captivitating. Yo yo ma's mastery reintepretation elevated morricone's vision to newer heights. For those who are familiar with the movies, these scores now have another voice.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Excellent repackaging and sound, and two bonus tracks, the 12\\" versions of Like a Virgin and Material Girl...BUT, as with the other reissues, this could have been perfect for collectors had they used the abundance of leftover space on the disc to include the 12\\" versions of Angel and Dress You Up, which would have made this complete--not to mention adding the ORIGINAL version of Into the Groove, which was the B-side of the Angel 12\\", and has yet to appear on a full length Madonna release.
B00005JNX0|4.0|Although it took me awhile to actually sit down and watch this movie, once I did I didn't regret it.  The music is fun, the animation great, and the story entertaining for children and adults alike.  The cast couldn't have been better for the characters they played, and you could see a little bit of each actor in the character they voiced. A great movie for spending an afternoon or evening with your kid(s).
B00005J6T1|4.0|Not only does this rerelease sound great and fix the problem with Everybody--the version was originally faded a minute early on the vinyl LP, and is here restored to its entirety--but it also gives us the 12\\" version of Burning Up and Lucky Star. So what's missing? The 12\\" version of Borderline, and the track Ain't No Big Deal, which was a song that never made it on the original LP, but was later released on the b-side of the True Blue single. That would have made this the COMPLETE Madonna debut rerelease.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray Lamontagne is an amazing artist.  This album is wonderful.  I really like every single song.  The best way I can describe the genre is southern soul.  It has an old classic feel to it.  I highly recommend this to everyone.  Also, the price on it is great. I bought it here on amazon for $8.97.  It's a great buy.
0393327655|5.0|This is one of those books I read and want to buy a thousand copies of and send to everyone I have ever known. Not that I think this book can convert anyone away from their formed opinions, but I do think it has the power to expose the inner processes of our worldview.  This book stems from an author concerned about anceint dogma in a modern world that technology is bringing closer and closer together. 9/11 has made many of us cling ever more tightly to the security blanket that is faith in God. This author asks us not to give up on the word faith but to replace the words God and Allah with the sacred names of the family, friends, and neighbors that fill our lives with meaning and together can help make a better world for generations to come.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Just saw Silent Hill yesterday, not familiar with the game history as I am not into video games.  I really enjoyed it.  The music and atmosphere were so captivating.  I really enjoyed the music and was wondering if the official movie soundtrack is out yet?  Will there be one? <br /> <br />I notice that there are 4 CD's w/ Music from the Games, but wasen't sure if it is the same music that is used on the movie.  I'd be willing to buy all 4, but was wondering if there will be an official soundtrack release. <br /> <br />Thanks everyone!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I was recommended this CD during the intermission of an \\"Evening with Dream Theater\\" at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado on 14 March 2006.  Conversations during the break revolved around other recent metal concerts of the last year or so in the Denver area, such as the Queensryche/Judas Priest and Rob Zombie/Iron Maiden shows of the previous summer.  A few days after the show, I located a copy of \\"City of Evil\\" in my local record shop and brought it home.  An old-school hard rock/HM fan (Sabbath/Priest/Queensryche, et al) this was my first introduction this hybrid of EMO/punk and HM.  Fantastic album, especially \\"Beast and the Harlot\\"  and \\"Bat Country\\" - great riffs, guitar work, rhythms and melodies.  Afterwards, I went out to get two of their earlier albums, \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\", and was disappointed - primarily by the reliance on screamo vocals.  I love heavy music, but for me, there's got to be melody in the vocals, and so far this is the only A7X album that has that element consistently appearing from song to song.  Some of my hardcore metalhead friends, mostly into Power Metal and Thrash/Death/Speed Metal, liked the guitar work, but didn't care for the vocals on any of the albums.  I think that \\"City of Evil\\" is fresh, energetic and powerful.  And in contrast to what some diehard A7X fans may think, this is not a sellout - it's maturation.  They're growing as musicians, and this album reflects that growth.  If their next release is anything like \\"City of Evil\\", I'd be one of the first in line to buy a copy when it comes out.
B00005JJX8|4.0|This is a mystery that is much better than the current ones or the plethora of remakes coming out of Hollywood.  While there are some formula elements to it, such as Hitchcock's obligatory blond, this movie feels fresh and fun after a full 50 years.  That is really something!<br /><br />I think that its succcess hinges on the acting, which is good all round, but also on the way that the audience is kept guessing.  Is Grant reverting ot his old self?  Is Grace Kelly doing it for kicks?  Etc.  What is so fun about it is that it never crosses the line of the utterly outlandish, with superhuman feats or a deus ex machina ending while maintaining the element of surprise and mystery.  You just have man struggling - or posing to be - in search of solving a crime so that he won't get nailed.  Then there is the setting, in 50s Monaco, which adds a twist of glamor.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  It is rightfully viewed as a classic.
B000E97X66|5.0|I am not going to surmonize about this live release from the Odeon - London Shows in 1975. Other than the Bottom Line shows in New York from the same year, this is the definitive live document of an artist for the ages. Bruce was right at the point of arrival to the \\"Big Stage\\" at this point in his career, and the passion he shows in these performances was what he became famous for throughout the years. Nothing really to review here, as the E-Street Band is kicking it hard and there's not a loser in this selection of performances. This CD is not only for died-in-the-wool Bruce fans, but it's a primer for anyone on the planet who never got to see true greatness on a Rock n' Roll stage. Heaven knows that the great ones who once roamed rock's biggest venues are, for the most part, no more. A great document from a great period in rock.
B000059QY3|5.0|If there were to be a single performance of Verdi's masterpiece \\"La traviata\\" on one's dvd shelf, this is it.      Covent Garden rightly decided to downscale the sets to draw the focus on the main characters (with the exception of the third act, which accommodates for the large crowd). It is, as the editorial review dictates, unspectacular. There is no question that this production relies solely on the drama inherent in the music to drive the performance.     Angela Gheorghiu is easily this generation's most captivating soprano. She sings with a confidence and clarity in the upper register that few can boast, and a warm, luscious low register. Her phrasing is intelligent, always conscious of her place in the score. With superb acting skills to boot, she is a force to be reckoned with. Her Violetta is elegant, full of poise and strong integrity (odd, given the nature of the character's reputation as a courtesan), while at the same time vulnerable and sincere in her love for Alfredo. Her rendition of 'sempre libera' is so exhilirating, it will leave one gasping for air.     Frank Lopardo wouldn't be my first choice for Alfredo. He lacks the vocal splendor and prowess of his betters, tending to sound uncomfortably forced in the upper tessitura. Both he and Gheorghiu make a handsome couple, and his fiery denunciation of Violetta toward the end of act three is surprisingly cold and menacing. It's just a shame he doesn't have the voice to back it up. Leo Nucci is Leo Nucci. There are definitely better Germonts out there, but his Italianate sense of authority brings an authenticity to a mostly non-Italian cast (I think I'm quoting the leaflet here, but it's true!).     While Gheorghiu sparkles in this production, the true hero is undoubtedly Sir Georg Solti. The maestro conducts this piece with a delicate touch that is rare even for him. His London players give their all, achieving superb levels of nuance. By producing an eerily 'empty' sound, they brought a sense of unfulfillable longing in the prelude, echoing Violetta's ill-fated romance. While most of Verdi's works are typically laced with doom laden overtones, here it is absent. This is possibly the most intimate of his operas, and Solti's extensive operatic experience shines through with his probing and surprisingly revelatory reading of the score which wrenches the heart through to it's climactic end. When you take his theatrical, and often bombastic approach out of the equation, one is left with a rare, unparalleled beauty that is more than just noteworthy... it's miraculous.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have been a fan of both of these artists for close to 30 years (In Emmy's case, over 30 years). I have seen numerous shows of each, I have even met them personally, and they are lovely people and Hall of Fame musicians. However, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on this CD. It is a powerful artistic statement and worthy of attention. Their soulful vocals and Knopfler's striking guitar phrases leave the listener deeply touched. \\"This Is Us\\" and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\" alone make this CD worth purchasing. I'm ashamed to say that it took listening to the Imus in the Morning MSNBC TV Broadcast to realize that this CD had been released after a rumored seven years in the making because of scheduling conflicts. Imus has been promoting this CD relentlessly and it's one of the very few things I agree with him on.  I actually found myself choking back the tears the first time I heard \\"If This Is Goodbye\\", which is an endearing and enduring tribute to those who lost their lives in the 9/11 debacle. I can't remember the last time that a song affected me like that. I am looking forward to seeing Emmylou at the Midlands Music Festival in Ireland this summer. Maybe she'll have a surprise guest with her? The music on this CD is Americana and Country-based, and the lyrics are poignant and mature. Do yourself a favor a go out and buy this CD.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|Horrible. This CD's tracks should be used to play tunes for a baby's mobile. Someone should tell her not to stick her kid in places he doesn't belong.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Hearing A GIRL LIKE ME blew me away.  I haven't heard anything from MUSIC OF THE SUN but I really like Rihanna's sophmore release.  Hearing SOS on MTV I instantly feel in love with this eighteen year old from the islands.  Although she's young, her ballads are strong.  Mainly Unfaithful and The Final Goodbye.  Going back to her roots, Rihanna has some catchy beats to her songs.  Kisses Don't Lie, Dem Haters and Break It Off.  I'm definitly looking forward to more of this teenage sensation in the future.
B00005JNJV|3.0|This was the first Batman movie I had ever seen so I am not comparing it with any of the previous films in this series or whatever.  So then: <br /> <br />It was OK.  That about sums it up.  There were some cool parts and scenes and the concept of the villians weapon were pretty cool but the movie didnt have enough excitement for this type of film.  I never felt that batman was in much danger and he probably wasn't.  Christian Bale played the part decently but that darned raspy voice that many other reviewers complained about was getting to me too after a while.  The action sequences were not filmed very well with too much in-close camera work to really see what was going on.  The fighting itself was solid but I wanted to get a wider view of it all. <br /> <br />The backstory of how Batman came to be was pretty interesting and I enjoyed this almost more than when Batman actually came on screen.  Quite frankly,  the first hour of the film although slow at times was better than the last hour due to this backstory and build-up.  You could feel the anger of Bruce Wayne and his desire to clean up the city.     <br /> <br />There were the usual attempts at humor which I really hate in movies these days especially when they try them at what are supposed to be tense moments. Also, there were several cliche situations that you'll find in most action films.  I was impressed with the special effects and I was glad to see that CGI did NOT dominate the movie like it often does.  The directing by Nolan overall was solid but he needs camera work help as mentioned before.   <br /> <br />Katie Holmes was...well..... just another young, cute Hollywood actress.  You could have casted just about anyone in this picture without it making a difference.  The rest of the cast was solid if unspectacular. <br /> <br />Overall I would sugest watching it as something to do for a couple hours but don't get your hopes up too high.  It was decent, not a blockbuster and I can't see myself buying itsince I'd probably never watch it again.
B0006399FS|5.0|I  have always liked U2 who have always made great albums.I love vertigo.People love Bono because he is really good and responsible for the greatness of this great Irish band.Very highly recommended along with Joshua tree.IGNORE ALL ONE STAR REVIEWS PLEASE.
0385512104|4.0|When I was reading the first pages of The curious incident ... , I noticed that this was definitely no book for everybody. Especially the flat and emotionless style, takes some time, to get familliar with it. ASlos the lack of suspense and variation in writing, makes this novel hard to read. But if you like profound literature and if you're willing to invest time on thinking about it, the book afford's a intressting insight in the world of an authistic, called Christopher. A 15 year old boy Christopher, who suffers from Aspergers syndrome, decides to write a murder-mystery-novel about the death of a dog in his neighbourhood. In course of his investigations for his book, other mysteries and problems begin to come up - which turns out to be a real challenge for authistics like Christopher. To sum it up a very moving book, but a matter of taste.
B000000OQ5|5.0|I fell in love with Tesla in high school (guess when!) and my best friends and I played this over and over and over - we all eventually wore out our tapes (yes, this was before CDs had taken over the planet!)  Now I'm desperately attempting to rebuild my tape collection in the more permanent CD format and this is one of the FIRST that I've gotten new to do that (used CDs are more cost effective - but this one is worth every penny!)  Try as I might, I just can't pick a favorite song on the disc - each has it's own strength and power, even the ballads like 'Before My Eyes'.  This is and was a great inaugural album from an extremely talented band.
B00005MKEN|1.0|If you absolutely MUST purchase this trend, weel-worn formulaic tripe then please, oh, PLEASE buy it second hand, prefereably from a pawn shop (where most of the copies will end up anyway when the used cd stores refuse to touch them).  Also, purchase it only because you thought it was another band.<br /><br />A belly full of garlic and beans will ultimately produce a more tallented noise than these incontinent apes ever could with years of musical training (whenever that might be, in some possible future).
B000002IQW|5.0|This is the second Skids album and on tape it was a bit different, there's one song here that I had never heard before (Get The F*** Out).  This album is tough, edgy, social and totally reflects the time it was written in (drugs, corporate greed, futility - all that fun stuff).  I love most all the songs on this CD but I think my favorites are 1) Psycho Love - a whole lot of fun and strangeness; 2) Creepshow - girl kicks boy in the teeth, is she trying to tell him something??  and 3) Wasted Time - a best friend sinks into the deadliness of drugs while those that love him watch - devastating! <br /> <br />Solid second effort from the guys - can't miss it!
B000EJ9VUW|1.0|i tried, really tried to like these guys and understand why so many people say th?y are great and all, but apart from single \\"let?s wrestle...\\" the music here is extremely annoying.  <br />You can do experimental music wisely (like Beta Band) but tweaking  buttons thinking you?re the new Can is simply boring. Zzzzzzz
0793518326|4.0|First, it must be said that this book is extremely good.      To have all of the songs of the beatles transcribed for guitar is a wonderful thing.  The people that have gone to the effort and expended the time in doing must be commended.  The songs are also transcribed in their original keys.     Nevertheless the book is not perfect and there are definitely some errors in the transcriptions.      I've been through a few of the songs and \\"michelle\\" and \\"girl\\" for example, althought right for the most part, have a few niggling errors which need to be sorted out.      On occasion in the book not all the guitar parts are transcribed.  Sometimes the chords are there with some of the guitar fills and some times the guitar fills are surprisingly absent.     The bass transcriptions are also at times not 100% accurate but merely a good approximation.    Having said all this the book is an excellent reference tool and a worthy investment for anyone who appreciates and wishes to learn from the creative songwriting and guitar playing genius that characterised the beatles. They are, after all, the greatest innovators that pop music has known and perhaps will know....
B000E97HIA|1.0|this album is totaly unforgivable, the only saving grace is \\"black sweat\\" which is classic prince, it seems that he has disapeared up his own rear end, either that or he's run out of inspiration. This really is utter trite!

B000AM6OHQ|5.0|The Rolling Stones have created some of the greatest music the world has ever heard, some of the worlds best songs were created by this band as well as albums. Of all the albums I own by The Rolling Stones (and I own a lot), Exile On Main Street is the best. The best Rolling Stones album and really one of the top five albums of all time. Never again or before had the band come together to create so many good songs, in fact 18 amazing songs, when it's truly hard to put 9 decent ones on an albm the Stones doubled that. This is concedered to be the greatest double album of all time, I I wouldnt dare argue with that title.<br /><br />Through this album The Rolling Stones dont venture into new teratory such as Reggea, Funk, or soul like they would later do, but instead they settle down in older familure structures like Country, Blues, R & B, and Rock and Roll and rather then settle realy they perfect. Through out this album featuring the 'classic' stones line up of Jagger/Richards/Taylor/Watts/Wyman, the band comes together and runs all all cylenders.<br /><br />The album opens with two of it's hardest rockers, 'Rocks Off' and 'Rip This Joint' both of which are Stones classics. i used to think If You Cant Rock Me was the best album opener but boy was I wrong, Rocks Off is Perfect! 'Shake You Hips,' an old blues cover is done perfectly here with great guitar worl and mick's signature vocals. 'Casino Boggie' is the perfect song to lead into the timeless 'Tumbling Dice' which just happens to be my all time favorite Rolling Stones song. The guitar is simply amazing and the lyrics are brilliant. The fact that Mick walked into a casino and thought of some way to relate poker to love is simply genius and the greatest primice for a song. 'Sweet Virginia' is a slower acoustic song with a great chorus and sets the pace for the next three songs. 'Torn And Frayed' 'Sweet Black Angle' and 'Loving Cup' are all slower ballads with power, though dont get me confused as saying they are power ballads because they are not. Sweet Black Angle features amazing acoustic playing by Mick Taylor and Keith Richards. Keith steps up to the mic to sing 'Happy,' which became a hit single and is to this day concidered one of the bands all time greatest songs. I have always loved when guitar players step up to the mic and sing because it usually makes for a great song especially with Keith, he never dissapoints! 'Turd On The Run' is a decent rocker but nothing to special. 'Ventalator Blues' is one of the all time greatest songs ever written, Im sure if you asked anyone who has ever heard the song they would tell you the same. Every time that song starts I stop what ever I am doing and listen to the song, which is one of the reasons I dont listen to this album in the car. Now 'I Just Want To See His Face' is a strange song that chants \\"I dont want to prey to Jesus, I just want to see his face' over and over again over some strange sounds. It seems dumb and tedeious I know but it really isnt. 'Let It Loose' is a pretty cool song but it just doesnt stand out on the album. 'On Down The Line' is one of my favorite songs on the album, featuring some of Mick Taylors all time best slide guitar work. This song kind of reminds me of Silver Train off the Stones' next album Goats Head Soup. 'Stop Breaking Down' is a traditional song that The Rolling Stones took and made all their own, I swear you would never know it was a traditional song if you hadnt heard it before. 'Shine A Lite' is a really cool song, Im not sure how to describe it or characterize it but just know that it is a great song. The album comes to an end with 'Soul Surviver' topping the album off at track eighteen. 'Soul Surviver' features some of Micks best vocals and a signature crowl that only he is capable of creating. The album ends where it begins leaving you wanting more!<br /><br />With all of this in mind how can you help dont wanting this album, I mean every song is good and I am telling you know you will never ifnd a Rolling Stones album better then this, I know your thinking well '.........' is a better album because I was the same way but once you give a listen to this masterpeace of rock and roll you will know that Exile On Main Street is the best! And as for guitar players, no guitar player should be with out this album, or at least one that has Tumbing Dice on it because guitar playing doesnt get batter then that. Highly, highly recomended!now you will never ifnd a Rolling Stones album better then this, I know your thinking well '.........' is a better album because I was the same way but once you give a listen to this masterpeace of rock and roll you will know that Exile On Main Street is the best!

B0000509C4|1.0|this sequel in name only is the low end of horror anthologys and the bottom of the river as far as scares. all the fun of the first is gone and what we are left with is this at 90mins.,much to long movie that just sits there and goes nowhere. no stars for this junk!!!!!!
B00000K3UU|5.0|I thought that this was Adam Sandler's best movie he has made.That he played man who's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5-year-old boy(played by Dylan & Cole Sprouse).I think of how the movie should've ended real good is for Sonny to have Legal Custody of Jullian.I laugh out loud when I see this movie!!!!
B000035P5E|5.0|donald sutherland is fantastic as the \\"needle\\" a german spy who coldly does his job no matter what it takes. his code name is given to him because he uses a stiletto as his silent weapon. the needle has found out that the d-day landing are going to be at normandiy and must tell hitler himself(by order of hitler). as he goes to meet his sub. a storm strands him on an island off the english coast where he meets it's inhabitances,the light house keeper,a crippled ex-raf pilot ,his wife,and their son. he is forced to wait for the sub and as he waits he finds something he has never looked for,love. <br />    as his love intrest,kate nelligan is just right,a wife to a man in a wheelchair and also emotionly crippled as well. at first this atraction is fought back but soon the two become lovers. but with people looking for him it's only a matter of time til the war and his real identy catch up to him. <br />     this is both a great thriller and a great love story. the action in the last half of the movie flows nicely out of the love he has for her but it also comes from his job as a spy. if you like love storys,spy thrillers, or just good movies you will love this movie.

B0002KVULG|2.0|in 1979 i saw this movie when it was released and it scared me to death,so when it came out on dvd i bought it,but something has changed(maybe i grew up) but now the movie seams flat and the cast looks like they are sleepwalking through the movie. <br />frank langella is good as the count but the movie is so off that the good job is lost in the hopeless script and mindless direction. all in all wasted chance.
1400032717|4.0|When I was reading the book \\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\", written by Mark Haddon, I was really fascinated by the way introduced the reader into the world of a 15 year old boy Christopher who suffers from a kind of Autism. After I had warm up to this special character, it was really tense about how Christopher behaves in overwhelming situations. <br />All in all Haddon wrote a very interesting book which is helpfully for everyone to understand autistics better.
6305511055|5.0|after watergate the country felt that the goverment had become this lomming preasence in our lives and that when it wanted to it could reach out and distroy you if it wanted to. in this air of miss trust many thrillers came out built around that theory. <br />  as our movie begins redford(very good as the everyman in the story) is a \\"reader\\" for the c.i.a. which means he reads books to see if any secrets or plots that might affect the agence aren't being put out. one day he goes to lunch and when he gets back he finds everyone in his office dead. scared he calls in and the c.i.a. says they will bring him \\"in\\" and protect him. they even send a friend to get him. when they meet the friend is killed and \\"condor\\"(redfords code name) is left on his own to try and find out what is going on. <br />   the movie does a great job of making you feel the pressure and overwelming feeling that a giant has you and is about to crush you. if you like thrillers,or just like good movies this is one for you.
0440418569|5.0|The Amber Spyglass concludes the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, which began with \\"The Golden Compass\\" and continued with The \\"Subtle Knife\\".  This book was huge, spanning 550 pages with 38 Chapters.  But I think that Pullman really did need this length to encompass and explain everything that lead up to this third and final book.  The thing that I liked about this whole series is that you really get to know the characters even though Pullman does not use intense description. At one point I knew what characters were thinking about before the author even made it evident, just by knowing how each character will react to certain circumstances.  I also loved how this book has a deeper theological and philisophical meaning, it is a lot better than just reading a story that some guy just made up for fun.  You are reading someone's beliefs and theories through a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  All in all, reading this entire series was a great decision, it easily rivals Harry Potter and should be on everyone's book list.
0440418569|5.0|Harry Potter has NOTHING on this series... I hate that it had to end though.  As you can tell by my reviews, I read a lot, but there's just something about this particular series that compels me to hail it the greatest series I have ever read.  This is the last book in the His Dark Materials series.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to a heartstopping close, marking the third and final volume as the most powerful of the trilogy. Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and Iorek Byrnison the armored bear, The Amber Spyglass introduces a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spy-master to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. And this final volume brings startling revelations, too: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live - and who will die - for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that - in its shocking outcome - will reveal the secret of Dust.<br /><br />I end with a question:  Do you think that Pullman will write another novel continuing the series?  I do.  Why?<br /><br />1) We need to find out what happens to Will and Lyra.  I mean, the last scene in which they are together, they are on a hillside holding hands, then they go their separate ways... but what happens to them?<br /><br />2)  At the VERY end of the novel, Lyra tells Pan that they have been commissioned to build the \\"Republic of Heaven\\"; do they?  What is it like?<br /><br />All these questions need to be answered.  However, even if Pullman doesn't make another book in the series, the three he has made will go down in fantasy history...<br /><br />From one uber-diehard-afficionado of His Dark Materials to the rest of y'all out there,<br /><br />-Andyre, <br /> <br />-Andy
B0006FFRW0|5.0|This album is a masterpiece I don't care what anyone says. I have had this version of the album for about eight months and always listened to the stero mix cause I don't own a DVD audio player.  <br />  <br /> I decided to stick it into my parents DVD player turn on the good surround sound system they have and cranked it. The regular surround mix of the album sounded pretty good. Now I can't wait to hear it in 5.1 surround. Since my parents don't have a true 5.1 surround system it kinda bummed me out, but oh well. When listening to the Dolby surround stero mix you can hear things that you didn't while listening to the reg stereo mix. This album really comes to life when you stick it  in your DVD player or DVD-A player.  <br /> <br />Anyone new to Nine Inch Nails should purchase this album, and If you don't own a DVD-audio player well this is one hell of an reason to run out and buy one. Hell this was my first NIN album to own and I'm glad I went with this and the SACD release of thils album.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|potential spoiler within...sort of <br /> <br />the earliest fictional work i know of that deals with the maleability of time immediately preceeding death is \\"an occurrence at owl creek bridge\\" by ambrose bierce. since then the idea has been explored, exhaustively, but few as delicately and piercingly as \\"stay\\". whereas the idea can often become a gimmick (i.e. m. night shyamalan), a plot twist to upheave the audience, \\"stay\\" is at core an emotionally driven examination of a mind's final grappling with elusive forgiveness. externally a bloodied body lying in the street...internally an elaborate and beautiful, if tragic, menagerie of imagined city landscapes and vulnerable characters.  <br />that the plot centers around an artist is all the more fitting, considering that the entirety of the movie is a creation of his dying brain. the success of this character is not simply a product of good writing. ryan gosling's henry letham is as nuanced a performance as i've seen, especially in the brilliant-though-damaged-artist role that tends to be overwrought by lesser actors. the contrast of letham's hurried, sputtering last words and the almost serene resolve of his fictionalized persona to shoot himself in the head on the brooklyn bridge are nothing short of poetic. ewan mcgregor and naomi watts are a complemantary, unobtrusive match to gosling, mcgregor's mildly humorous, though not distracting, american accent aside. <br />the hagakure states that we should contemplate death daily. \\"stay\\" surfaced such ruminations overwhelmingly and yet quietly. how unfortunate, though, that our most poignant thoughts and fantasies may come to us only in the moments before we dissolve into darkness.
B0000027RL|4.0|If you want to know what PJ use to be about then purchase this album. This is when they were pretty wild. Everything about their sound was aggressive. This is when they were considered grunge and the press thought they were from Seattle ha!  <br /> <br /> The album sounds great oveall. My only complaint would be the drums could have more ambience to them. They sound a little whimpy to me. This album should be remastered and re-released in a digipak with more photos from that era. For now we all can enjoy this release.
B000002VRZ|5.0|To the staff at Amazon.com: You have fallen prey to the 'lazy reviewer' syndrome by passing along Amazon-approved music reviews from someone with an agenda. Roni's review of the Outlaws betrays quite a bit about him/her (unable to tell from the name - is this your major attitude problem, Roni?). Obviously a Gen-X or Wye (or \\"Why Oh Why\\" as I call them) who doesn't think music is to listen to, it's a video phenom. Maybe this band is indistinguishable from other bands (to you) because you wouldn't know a musician from a ditch-digger. Put a street person in the right clothes, teach them to mimic the same boring moves as all your favorite bands (posers), and your review would be \\"genius; completely original; mind-blowing\\".  <br />All the new bands do is copy from the 60s and 70s originals, except they don't have even the minimum of talent to do that properly. There should be a policy change - how about printing music reviews written by people who lived in the time that this music was made. Also an intelligence test wouldn't hurt.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Prince is in his element. Tamar has a nice voice and that is so nice of him to push her out there (nice little reminder in the sleeve of his cd). Black Sweat is so sensual but not overdone. Beautiful, Loved and Blessed is so for real and hits me to the core. Matter of fact, the whole cd just is just loaded with experimental and unconventional styles of the usual Prince we knew back in the late 70s/80s.
0099450259|4.0|\\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is on the one hand a funny book by reading the thoughts of the 15 year-old boy Christopher from which point of view the book is written. But on the other hand it is also a book that touches your soul deep inside if you warm up with the main character and read about his problems as an autistic in a world full of social communication.  <br />I really enjoyed reading the book from the beginning up to the end.  <br />Very good work, Mark Haddon!!

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have the Japanese version and couldn't wait for the English verion to be released. I just finished watching the US version and was very pleased with it. Being a die hard FF fan for many many years, all I can say is \\"WoW\\". The graphics were awesome, and after watching the making of the film on the bonus track, I was amazed how Square could develop their own software in making this movie.  They said, they wanted to do something that no one else has ever done, and they mastered it, the first time. This is nothing compared to the flawed Spirits Within. Yes, I agree, you must know the characters and the storyline before watching the movie, so I would suggest watching the Reminiscence of FF7 first. The storyline takes place two years after the ending of the original game. Cloud has a lot of baggage, like most normal people in life, and he has not forgiven himself for the losses that took place in his past.  The music is beautiful.  I love Nobuo Umatsu, the music composer. He did a wonderful job with the flow and creating the atmosphere within the movie. I wished that the US could have had the opportunity to see this movie on the big screen; like our Japanese counterparts did last year, but it was worth the wait. This movie will be one of my all time favorites.  I recommend buying this DVD even if you are not a FF fan, because it is \\"one of a kind\\" masterpiece.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was scared when it dropped off the face of the earth.  But I was ecstatic to see that it is coming out on DVD. Everything from the story to the actors is amazing and i wouldn't change a thing.    My verdict: AWSOME film.  Take THAT Don Talon.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Okay this isnt even metal its radio rock im sorry. These guys were a pretty good band before this album. Waking the fallen was a great album one of the better metalcore albums to come out... Now i must say their new stuff is uninspired rehash riffs and solos that guns n roses and motley crew have done before. They even try to look like these bands in their videos. Im sorry this album is a disgrace to metal music cheesy lyrics and all. This day in age melodic vocals can ruin if you wanna be metal and still use melodic vocals try a band like opeth amazing unique and original. There is some cool insturmentation on this album but it still isnt as aggressive and easier to swallow as their previous efforts. The album in a whole to me is just corny corprate teeny boper music that the man wants you to listen to... <br /> <br />If you dont listen to metal and want somthin a lil more fast and distorted im sure you will like or if your a 14 year old girl. If you want to listen to good real american metal get any Lamb Of god album, and look out for their new one

B0000025ZF|4.0|Ok, I grew up on a Pink Floyd music diet and have owned every single album of theirs and their solo offsprings.  But of all, this one has touched me the deepest.  It was the first CD I got when I began replacing my album collection and it is probably the most played ever.  It is musically very talented at times, albeit with some strange moments, but it always manages to take me to that special place, reminding me of the happy times and great memories growing up.  Clapton's work is the best I have heard from him (IMHO), I just wish he played like that more often.  Listening to anything else from Clapton now seems too restricted in comparison.  I recommend this album to anyone that appreciates music from the heart.  Music is the best natural legal drug and this is a perfect example.
1400062071|5.0|Being a reader of historical fiction, I probably would not have picked this book up, but a friend gave it to me; I started the first page and was hooked.  I found the writing style very easy to read and found these \\"ordinary people\\" in the book very appealing. <br /> <br />The minister is so sincere yet so focused on his congregation  that he forgets himself and his own daughter. His young wife fell in love with a young man and finds herself the wife of a minister, a role she is not sure she is suited for.  The housekeeper is a strange woman with secrets. Put these together with a typical small town congregation in the 1950's and the interrelationships become very complex. <br /> <br />Although the plot of this book may sound trite, the emotions, the strengths and weaknesses conveyed by the characters reflect much more than just \\"what happens\\" in the book.   <br /> <br />I would not describe this book as exciting or even what I would call interesting; however, I found it thoughtful and a very satisfying read. This is a story of ordinary people in somewhat ordinary circumstances who discover some extraordinary things about themselves.
B00005JOII|5.0|I loved Matchpoint.  I thought it was the best Woody film ever...ok, I haven't seen all WA's films because I'm a closet Woody-hater. All my intellectual friends go on and on about WA films....but I don't buy it....never have never will.  He is typically mediocre at best....Annie Hall references abound...Annie Hall IMO is just ok...nothing special and I think that Sleeper is ok too...but just ok.  However, I loved Matchpoint. Ok...this is an American Tragedy/Doestevsky rip-off but who cares...and WA added some great twists to the movie.  The acting was superb and the greatest bonus of all: No WA in the movie. <br /> <br />Watch it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was surprised to see that the average rating for the Firefly series was 5 stars. Not because I don't agree that the series is excellent but because I didn't think so many others did. If only the popularity had existed when the series first debuted we'd be on season 4 now. <br /> <br />Firefly is an awesome series not only because of the range of characters that are portrayed but because of the foundation that the world they live in is based off of. One way or another, those who appreciate this series can relate to the actions and ideas of the characters on the screen whether it be Captain Mal Reynolds who keeps his emotions at bay, the headstrong hired gun Jayne, the idealistic Shepherd, the alluring professional companion Inara, Kaylie the overly optimistic mechanic, the tough second in Command Zoe, her husband Wash the wity pilot, or the aloof doctor  and his genius sister River who is more than meets the eye. <br /> <br />The futuristic western setting with the idea that there are now only two major powers (the United States and China) as well as an underlying mystery of governmental conspiracy gave Firefly so much appeal with the potential to blossom into a grand series. Unfortunately, it was never given that chance and now many people are turning to the series on DVD. <br /> <br />Maybe if Fox had been better with marketing the series and had given the series more of a chance more viewers could have fallen in love with Firefly. Hopefully one of the producers notices the 5 star rating that the DVD series is receiving and will take that risk to bring the series back. <br /> <br />I recommend this series for people who enjoy substantial character development with some comic relief, action, and drama. Its well worth the investment and will leave you wanting more.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh provides a more than clear examination into the history and fundamentals of cryptography.  The information is presented in such a way that people of all interests can enjoy the subject. Singh not only covers the beginnings of cryptography in certain regions but also helps to place them in their historical context.  He clearly examines the effects of cryptography on multiple aspects of life then and even now. The book not only describes the origins of cryptography but also the mathematical, mechanical, and analytical aspects of such a diverse topic.  But don't be too alarmed at the presence of all these features.  Singh's explanations are lucid and concise and leave the reader feeling as if they fully understand the principles of cryptography.
0439132533|5.0|Yes, I am a 49 year old man writing a review for a children's book, and, no, I do not think that I ought to be ashamed of myself. A short while ago I stumbled upon a copy of this book by accident and I could't believe the flood of warm and pleasant memories that it brought back. This was perhaps my favorite childhood book, along with the sequels. Maybe this was because from my earliest memories I always wanted to be an artist, and that is what Harold was, an artist with a magic purple crayon. He was more than an artist, he was a creator of worlds. That was important, he wasn't presented as a trivial person doing \\"art\\", he was the creative force behind whole new worlds. Or \\"co-creator\\", for he often seemed as surprised as the reader at what flowed out of that crayon. While I didn't become an artist, I did work for much of my life as a draftsman and designer. I've seen many, many things in the real world start life as a drawing on my board or computer screen.<br /><br />I think that I kept faith with Harold....

B0001HLVSC|4.0|This is a historical costume actioner, and it succeeds very well in filling the screen with spectacle and excitement.  The aerial shots of the sailing ships are thrilling, and the onboard sets are just perfect.<br /><br />As in any historical drama, the audience wants to see contemporary people in period garb, not authentically period people.  So, we have a scene where the lashing of a seaman causes anguish among the commanders, although back then it was accepted as necessary to discipline.<br /><br />There's also a neat set of scenes in which the ship surgeon gets to play naturalist in the Galapagos Islands--a proto-Darwin.<br /><br />The only disappointment is in the final battle scene.  The filmmakers opted to switch from spectacle to POV shots.  So, instead of lavishly choreographed swordplay, we get jerky, close-up jumpcuts, looking as if they were edited with a blender.<br /><br />The full-screen edition of this DVD has no extras, so beware.  The film itself is worth the price, though.
0895260131|5.0|Knowing that the founder of your religion was a hate filled warlord should make you doubt that faith. Finding out that he thought he was possessed by demons that caused him to do terrible acts should really make you nervous. Examining the rhetoric and history of the most murderous religion to ever exist should send you sprinting from the mosque and never looking back.   Like Detective Joe Friday would say, this book presents historical facts and numerous Quran-Mohammad quotes that lead any curious sleuth or historical detective to conclude, \\"the devil makes them do it.\\"
B000EOTAM6|4.0|After reading the reviews that it was like Halle Berry's Catwoman I was nervous to watch it.  But I liked that it was different and smartly done.  I did have decipher some parts and sometimes I had to suspend my own disbelief in certain aspects of the special effects but overall I liked it.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|..but perhaps I am setting my standards too high. After the FANTASTIC Lord Of The Rings movies, I guess I figured Peter Jackson could do no wrong. And make no mistake, his King Kong remake is not a bad movie at all... but it certainly isn't great.     Part of the problem is the original. The original's storyline seems too perfect in comparison. Whenever Jackson's film deviated from the original's storyline, I found myself thinking that the remake was a weaker film storywise because of it. And its not just because I like the original, the 1976 Jessica Lang remake deviated from the original, and it actually had some improved moments (although the 1976 version is not a very good movie over all).      A major complaint I have with Jackson's film is it is TOO LONG. Not that 3+ hours is too long, but when 40 minutes of the film is absolutely NOTHING but padding, just meaningless FLUFF, what's the point of having it in the movie? Obviously, Jackson was wallowing in his joy at getting to make his King Kong, and all that padding seriously effects the flow of the movie. Had 40 minutes been trimmed, the film would be better.     I also must say there is FAR too much emphasis on the effects in this film. There is a particular sequence involving stampeding dinosaurs which was WAY too long, rather stupid, and apparently was included just so Jackson could say 'Look what we can do!'. A very weak and pointless sequence in the movie. In addition, the fight scenes that Kong is involved in are REALLY unrealistic and badly choreographed.     A further complaint (although this one is minor), is that Kong's first appearance onscreen has no suspense buildup, no shock value to seeing this HUGE gorilla. The 1976 version did a great job with this, and I guess I expected at least as good a moment from Peter Jackson. Also, the ending wasn't handled all that greatly, athough it was passable. Jack Black's delivery of the famous last line in the movie was TERRIBLE however, and way off base.      Well, that's enough complaining, here are some good things about the movie! Kong looks great in the film, although it does take some getting used to. After all, THIS Kong looks like a REAL gorilla, not a man in a monkey suit like all previous Kongs.  The acting is generally very good, and the sets look fantastic (the minimalist Skull Island looks exactly like you can imagine it would if it existed in the real world). There are some truly touching moments in this film between Naomi Watts and Kong- hard to believe from a CGI gorilla, but its true. Finally, the story stays quite true to the classic original, which is a good thing.     All in all, Peter Jackson's remake is a good film, but I really expected more. With all the time and money spent on this, plus the considerable talents of Jackson and his crew, I expected a movie on the level of Lord Of The Rings. Sadly this was not the case. While I recommend everyone see Jackson's film just because of the enormity of the project, don't view it with expectations of exceeding the original- you will most likely be VERY disappointed (like I was). I think I'll stick with the original Kong.
B00000I01A|4.0|\\"I must break you.\\" No truer words have come from Rocky IV while reviewing the original motion picture soundtrack. Why re-release a 20-year-old record? However, as I listened to it again, it took me back to my teenage years and remembered that these songs were cool. Anchoring the CD are the Survivor cuts of \\"Burning Heart\\" and \\"Eye of the Tiger.\\" Well, \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" was on the Rocky III soundtrack, too, but it's one of those songs that has forever been burned into high school lore.<br /><br />The only added song is \\"Man against the World\\" by Survivor, a snappy little tune. The song was supposed to be in the movie, but it was cut. So it's a good add-on. \\"Sweetest Victory\\" was also cut from the movie, but it appeared on the original album.<br /><br />I tapped along to the other standards on the Soundtrack, like \\"Heart's On Fire\\" by John Cafferty, the montages by Vince DiCola, and one-hit wonder Robert Tepper with \\"No Easy Way Out.\\" We're not done yet. There's Mr. James Brown's \\"Living in America\\" that makes you want get up and dance and say, \\"I FEEL GOOD!\\"<br /><br />While the relevance of the movie has gone the way of the Cold War, the soundtrack stands on its own as a solid part of the '80s music scene. However, I would've liked to hear the full score.<br /><br />Songs on the album:<br /><br />1. \\"Burning Heart\\" - Survivor<br /><br />2. \\"Hearts on Fire\\" - John Cafferty<br /><br />3. \\"Double or Nothing\\" - Gladys Knight, Kenny Loggins<br /><br />4. \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" - Survivor<br /><br />5. \\"War\\" - Vince Dicola<br /><br />6. \\"Living in America\\" - James Brown<br /><br />7. \\"No Easy Way Out\\" - Robert Tepper<br /><br />8. \\"One Way Street\\" - Go West<br /><br />9. \\"Sweetest Victory\\"<br /><br />10. \\"Training Montage\\" - Vince Dicola<br /><br />11. \\"Man against the World\\" - Survivor [not on original album]<br /><br />Bottom line: Another good replacement for the cassette tape you originally bought, but if you already have the original album on CD/DVD, you're not missing out.out.
B00000I07Q|5.0|Not only is this work a great follow up to the infamous \\"SLIPPERY WHEN WET\\" as another reviewer below so eloquently put it, but it is a great album in its own right. Jon and the guys worked so hard on this album day in and day out and held the longest tour of theirs to date in support of it (over 250 sold-out shows), that they became sick of each other and had to take a three year break until 1992.<br /><br />Have you folks ever noticed anything peculiar about the cover art of these two albums? There is hardly anything to look at. That in and of itself is a musical statement. This band is telling us not to look at their glam-rock appearence and long hair, but to listen to the music because that is what it is all about. And they sure did take us aback...four hits are on this album including, \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\", \\"Bad Medicine\\", Born to be My Baby\\", and \\"I'll be There for You\\".<br /><br />Although this work did not top the charts as high as \\"SLIPPERY WHEN WET\\" did, it is a masterpiece that any other 80's hair band would want to steal if they could. This album solidified BON JOVI's fame and brought them much fortune - and unbeknownst to us - there was more to come as the years came and went...
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I just dont really get the people that are sitting here, bashing this band saying that they suck, that they can't play...and trying to compare them to a bunch of other bands out there and try to call themselves mature just because they listen to older music. If someone really respected music, then they wouldn't try to see which guitarrist sounds like some other guitarrist or compare drummers to other bands. First of all, there is no one guitarrist out there better than all the rest. There will always be a guitarrist that can do something better than the next and it all revolves around in a circle. The same goes for drummers. Alot of people seem to judge drummers without realizing what it takes to be a drummer. Friends...even my older brother...thought double bass pedaling is easy and pretty much just like running in place. It's alot harder than that. Drumming in general is alot harder than most non-drummers seem to realize, so before bashing on a musician, you'd better be able to back it up with your own playing. Third...if, according to some of you, the band sucks...then they wouldn't have made it as big as they did. Bands make it big because people like the sound of their music and it takes dedicated musicians to keep a band together. Just because two musicians are good doesn't mean they'll be able to play together. Its a matter of locking the talents and skills together to create one sound. This band is a prime example of this. Yes, there are other bands out there that have excellent guitarrist duos, but that doesn't mean that A7X (I'll get into something about the A7X after this) has poor guitarrists. These guys know what they're doing and it shows. As for the people bashing on the \\"A7X\\" saying \\"WTF? The initials are supposed to be AS, not A7X\\" then you guys really need to learn to think outside the box. A7X is more creative and capturing that \\"AS\\" and still completely fits the context of the band.
0449002632|5.0|I am not going to write a very long review of this book.  <br /> <br />But, it's one of the best books I have ever read. I loved it. (It helps if you love history and find geneology interesting.) His descriptions are very detailed and the characters and their stories are very good. He just keeps revealing more and more of this amazingly large tapestry.  <br /> <br />After reading Rutherford's books I look at locations differently. It makes me wonder about who lived there before and what they did and thought, etc.   <br /> <br />I would highly recommend The Forest. I have read all of his books and this was my second favorite.  <br /> <br />If you are going to read London and more of his books I would recommend waiting awhile to read Sarum because it is placed in sort of the same area and came off to me as very similar to London.
B000002UAO|5.0|I hadn't listened to Rubber Soul since I owned the album back in 9th grade. It was wonderful revisiting Rubber Soul. The recording techniques used were way ahead of it's day. It was also the Beatles' turning point in creativity.. moving away from the buble-gum pop and into more experiemental song forms.
0312979479|4.0|And Then There Were None (aka Ten Little Indians), by Agatha Christie<br /><br />There is a classic murder mystery story known as \\"the locked room mystery\\". Someone is found murdered in a room locked from the inside. No one could have left the room! How did it happen? In this story the locked room is an island where no one can enter or leave. The ten people on this island are murdered one by one. An old nursery rhyme of \\"ten little Indians\\" provides a blueprint for the mysterious deaths. Logically, the last man standing would be the presumed murderer, by the process of elimination. But what if the murderer died before?<br /><br />This is an example of the classic English murder mystery. The murder exists to provide an intellectual puzzle to entertain the reader. The participants are mostly the middle-class, and not ordinary people. No one works on an assembly line or other manual labor; even if they may be the customers for this product. Children are absent. The scene is a large house owned by a rich man. Raymond Chandler pointed out the differences in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\". Most murders occur because of sex or money, to get it or to keep it. Chandler commented on the highly artificial murder plots which multiply clues that experienced detectives would see through. You can compare these stories to True Crime.<br /><br />Chapter XI references one locked room mystery in America. An old gentleman and his wife were killed with an axe. The maid couldn't have done it. The respectable middle-aged daughter was acquitted. No other explanation was ever found. Who killed them?
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Truly a work of art for any fan of the original game.  Without a doubt do not hesitate and get this movie.  Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix did a fantastic job, all accompanied by Nobuo Uematsu's fantastic score.  However, DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH SPEAKING VERSION.  Watch the Japanese version with sub-titles if you truly want to enjoy the experience.  The orginal Japanese voice acting completely destroys the English speaking version.  The Japanese voice acting clearly has more emotion and effort put into it as opposed to the English version which comes off as stale like it was read directly from a sheet of paper. <br /> <br />Still, I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars if I could since the Japanese version represents the orginal version of the movie in the first place. <br /> <br />I also highly recommend this to those who've never played the game with the caveat that they watch the Disc One \\"Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII\\" extra, FIRST.  It will help set the stage by covering the general story of the Final Fantasy VII Playstation Game and familiarize you with the characters. <br /> <br />Don't think about getting it, just get it!!!!
0609610570|3.0|Both authors have had long careers involving the executive management of large companies.  This book strongly reflects that involvement, and many points are directly pertinent to the world of big business.  But the book can still have value for those not of that world, even for a person in his own individual life.<br /><br />The title itself is a good summary of the contents.  The authors have seen many high-level executives who intellectualize well and develop terrific concepts.  But, of course, that is never enough for the real world of business.  For success, great concepts need to result in action and results, and these authors describe how that can be done.<br /><br />Their style of writing reflects their can-do attitude.  No frills or embellishments here.  When they finish a sentence and it accomplishes what it is supposed to, that is an end of it.  They show little concern for literary style.  Not once did I savor a sentence or even a string of words for its aesthetic qualities. This book is all down to brass tacks.  But, as the book progresses, some pages seem hastily thrown together.  Real-life letters written for a specific context have been truncated and modified for inclusion here.  But these letters are not specific enough, and I often found myself not understanding the situations and the ultimate points supposedly being made (although admittedly more specificity would have been too much).  Sometimes background is reduced to a term like situation B, a term that a lazy schoolboy might use.  I found myself scanning quickly through several pages at a time, because their substantive content did not warrant any closer reading.<br /><br />One thing that concerned me was how they advocate molding people.  People are no doubt important in creating a successful company, and not surprisingly the authors strongly recommend coaching and developing the company's people.  My concern is that such molding does not make these people better in their own right-probably the opposite occurs.  The company's people might indeed improve themselves in such a way that gives their companies and themselves more success--but at a significant cost of other aspects of their lives.  This molding process might even explain why some business executives feel that they have sold their souls.<br /><br />But, overall, this book is worth reading (although a general reader could easily skip the last 100 pages or so).ight-probably the opposite occurs.

0793573750|5.0|This book is a must for anyone that appreciates the '58-'60 burst. It contains anything you would ever need to know about Les Pauls from this classic era. I purchased a spiral bound cover for my coffee table, which lays flat for easy reading. I had to get the hard cover, though, since they were limited to 1000 copies (I own copy #69), and include an extra profile not found in the softcover and spiral bound editions. This is about Ed King (Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lynyrd Skynyrd), and his '59 that was stolen. He did get it back 20 years later, after seeing it in the hardcover edition of this book. I am not sure why it was removed from the softcover or reprint editions.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Finally, after months upon months of waiting, the masterpiece that is Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, has been unleashed upon the world, continuing the story of the Final Fantasy VII video game, only two years after. Now, the first thing I want to comment on is that this movie lives up to ALL the hype it's received since it was first shown off a few years ago. NO JOKE. Next, I have to continue by telling you how perfectly the cgi animation has been done. The cgi team clearly spent a lot of time making sure every character, environment and scene was perfected as much as it could be. If you were someone who didn't know what cgi animation was, you could easily think this was real. As far as the music goes, all of it featured in the movie perfectly reflects the mood of what's happening at the time, with a great, booming, exciting, fast paced score fit for only this movie. Now, for those few people who've never played the game, it does help to know the story of it, but isn't completely necessary, due to the fact that the movie does tell just enough little bits of the game's history to keep those of you completely riveted. As for the voice acting, both the english and japanese actors did a great job, keeping you hooked on the dialogue, as well as keeping it interesting all the way through, which isn't always the case with a movie like this. All in all, I could find only one tiny little flaw in this great work, that being on the english version, the voice acting doesn't sync up with the lip movements very well. However, that's a small, insignificant price to pay to behold such an amazing movie. In closing, I have to say that of the many movies I've seen, this is one of my all-time favorites, not only because of the subject matter, but because of the great cgi work, awesome voice acting, and masterfully written story. I truly hope I've helped anyone considering seeing this movie, or buying it. Enjoy!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar can do no wrong! This follow-up to Toy Story 2 is wonderful.The casting is superb, with John Goodman as Sulley, and Billy Crystal as Mike, his assistant, drawing attention here. The animation shows true progression, with one being able to see each strand of fur separately, if you can look that closely. The story line and set pieces are masterpieces of imagination. Whoever thought this whole thing up should have gotten a very large raise. The story arcs nicely, with the viewer getting attached to Boo, the little human girl, as Sulley does. It does tend to drag just a bit in the middle, but the final third is fantastic. The final scene is pure magic. Overall, this stands as one of Pixar's very best, which, considering Pixar's track record, is saying a lot.

B000F5GJO6|5.0|First of all, let me say that the PSP hasn't had an abundance of good UMD movies come out for it. But every few new releases that come out, there is one great one among them. This time, that great one is Underworld:Evolution. Evolution, for those of you who don't know, is part two of the Underworld story, and an awesome movie to boot. It's very hard to say it, but U.E. is slightly better than the first movie. With even better action, an even more immersive story than the first movie (you finally get to see the oldest and strongest of the Vampire Elders, Marcus, in the flesh), and the same excellent cast from the first movie returning, you couldn't possibly find a better vampire/werewolf movie. Kate Beckinsale returns as well, reprising her role as Selene masterfully. Scott Speedman also reprises his role as the vampire/werewolf hybrid, Michael Corvin, a little better than the first time. I should also mention the great acting job done by veteran actor Tony Curran, who plays the Vampire Elder, Marcus. I would like to comment on the story, but I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this yet. I will, however, say this: you learn a lot about Marcus, his history, and even more of the history that led to the war between the vampires & werewolves. Having said that, this movie is worth every bit of your time and money, whether  you choose the dvd version or the UMD version. I'll say this, if you have a PSP, don't think twice, just do yourself a favor and buy this movie for it. You'l be glad you did, trust me. I hope I've helped any prospective buyers of this movie, and I hope, if you buy it, you love it. Enjoy!!!
B000002B1M|5.0|Nas often claims his work is constantly evolving and many critics did not like this album but God only knows why because it is eons better than most other hip-hop albums and is every bit as interesting as Illmatic was. It plays like a mini-movie with some great narratives and is responsible for creating those intro themes (here we get black slaves in chains who desire escape and change while saying the word 'damn' as they are whipped by their masters) that every other hip-hop album tried to copy after. If you love Illmatic then you will want It Was Written and pretty much everything else the King of NY decides to mic onto a recording device. This is genius at work.
0316172324|3.0|The writing was very good and kept my attention and the book was enthralling. The whole point was how our mind is so powerful that a lot of times it can make instant decisions better than if we thought on something for a long time. It taught that \\"gut instincts\\" are a lot of times our brain making subconscious decisions based on our past knowledge and experience.Also the book showed how prejudice and ignorance can also cause the wrong instant decisions. It is a good read but it really had no final big revelation.
0804115613|5.0|Fannie Flagg gives so much to us in this beautifully written story about a modern-day middle-aged southern couple who discover the stories of Whistle Stop, told by an elderly lady (Jessica Tandy). <br />But even more so, it is about the incomparable, undying love and the bonds of friendship between two women.  <br />After a tragic accident in the family, Ruth is reluctantly sent to help wild Idgie cope with her grief. These two oddly enough become the best of friends, and lovers for life.  <br />I have heard some people say that they do not see any lesbianism between them, but it is obvious to pretty much anybody who reads this book or sees the film. It is more apparent in the book, in my opinion.  <br />Trust me, you will laugh, you will cry, and you will cherish this story always.
0553573403|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal as I enjoy all things medieval, yet this book (and this whole series in fact) is hardly fantasy. I cringe when I read descriptions of this series as \\"high fantasy\\". High fantasy usually involves elves, dwarves, wizards, gnomes, magic, etc. It's the standard definition of 'high fantasy'. This book has one race. Humans. This book involves an *extremely* small amount of magic. Miniscule. This book has dragons in it that are eggs until the 2nd book and immature and unimportant even in the third book. Dragons may become more prominent in the 4th and 5th books (soon to come). So if you are expecting anything comparable to Tolkien-esque 'high fantasy' (true high fantasy), look for another series. As has been pointed out, this is *slightly* fictionalized medieval history. It's a tale of intrigue and kingdoms and warfare. Fantasy? Hardly. A good read but know what you are getting.
1400079179|1.0|Dan Brown may be a good author, but he has used his talent to make money by slandering not only the Catholic Church, but all of Christians and Christ himself.  His claims have been uncovered for what they really are (lies) by REAL historians and theologians.

0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris has written a book about the dangers of faith and how Christian and Muslim fundamentalism are both dangerous for the world. He is very direct and to the point. I found his writing rich and thought provoking. It explains how faith in things that are not true is dangerous and causes people to inflict evil on one another in the name of God. The book reminds me of something I say when people think that fundamentalist false beliefs are no big deal, I say \\"But that is why people fly planes into buildings\\".
0618135871|4.0|The metronome, the passage of time.  The dying animal, in the form of a libertine professor, obsessed with sex, passionate about art.  The book is a novella more than an novel -- focused, sometimes rambling -- oddly enough in the plot sequences, and sometimes gripping -- mostly in long expositions about free love or morality.  There are some gems here, some thuddings.  The plot is outrageously predictable and mundane but we forgive the old man when his language soars.  The ending feels like Roth never quite new how to end it, but this is a problem originating in the beginning, he sets up an overwhelming obsession with C. but the it peters out, and we don't feel the main character is driven by it, thus to turn the story on this point, at the end, is lacking.  I disagree with the reviewer who suggested this is required reading -- it's like Ford's short stories, momentary, sometimes solid, sparking in moments.  A flame burns brighter and more consistently in other works by both authors.

The story is plausibel telling and I enjoied reading it.
1400079276|3.0|Kafka on the Shore is what would happen if Franz Kafka and Chuck Palahnuik got together and had a baby.  <br />This novel is about Kafka Tamura, a fifteen-year-old runaway, and the elderly Nakata, who never recovered from a mysterious coma when he was a child. It is hard to become taken immediately with Kafka (if at all) whom has no recollection of his mother or sister (but definitely has some sort of oedipal complex), however it is easy to fall instantly in love with Nakata. I rarely become involved with characters, I am merely an observer, but when confronted with the brilliant portrayal of Nakata I couldn't help but feel for him. <br />We are presented with both their stories on their journey to one another, or to themselves as the case may be. Kafka is nothing more than a boy who has suffered through the abandonment of his mother, he mental abuse from his father and his terrifying prophecy. He runs away from home and finds drawn to a private library and things begin to fall into place. <br />Nakata on the other hand is an illiterate elderly man living on a sub city, earning some extra money finding cats (because he can talk to them) and finding himself on a journey that he doesn't understand. Fish and leeches fall from the sky, Colonel Sanders is embodied and books are read. <br />The characters all seem a little too erudite, talking like they have all the knowledge in the world and as though the only way that Murakami could get his point across was having someone explain it directly. But that doesn't make it any easier to understand, the book is rife with existentialisms (a subject I will admit to not caring for), hidden meanings and some pretty strange themes that I wasn't all that comfortable with. At times it became a little convoluted.  <br />The books starts off magnificently but starts to slide off into a tangent that is little more than predictable, trying to make sense of everything and tying it into a little bundle but in the end leaves many things inadequately explained. The novel has so much potential such as brilliantly written characters and an interesting scenario, but falters towards the end. This is my introduction to Murakami and certainly will not be the last.
0156027321|5.0|This is a story about a boy, his will to survive, and his knowldege as well as rescourcesfulness. As the book begins the reader is intrigued by Pi's unique way of thinking and all of the different characteristics of his personality. It forces the reader to explore their own decissions that they have made about religion and the experineces that they also had while they were growing up. With the unique life that Pi has had prior to the shipwrek the reader is already intriqued by the notions of what may take place in the future. As Pi has chosen three religions to belong to, devotedly, and has grown up helping to raise animals and run a zoo, there are many experineces that will lead to his life changing efforts that can be gathered due to his life before the shipwreck.  <br /> <br />Not only is the audience intrigued by the knowledge and the experineces that Pi has prior to the shipwreck, but also his remarkable will to live that plays an essential role in the book and allows for the reader to explore their own will to live in desperate situations. The rescources that Pi finds as well as the numbrous ways in which he uses his prior knowledge to his advantage is remarkable. The ways in which he constructs a makeshift raft in order to protect himself from the tiger that has been on board to lifeboat, as well as his ability to feed the tiger to keep himself alive.  <br /> <br />When Pi is intially stranded on the boat with an injured zebra, a hyena, a ape, and eventually the tiger the audience knows that the eventual demise of many of theses creatures will take place quickly and then other rescources would have to be found. With the company of the tiger combined with the will to live Pi is able to struggle through the tragic accident. This book allows for readers to explore within themselves and seek to find the lengths that they would go for survival. This unique book is a fun fast read in which people of all ages could relate to.  <br /> <br />
0440178002|5.0|Fabulous book! The Clavell Trilogy is a true eye opener for those who are unfamiliar with Japanese culture and history. Clavell takes the reader to every possible thought of a people that has remained an enigma to most Westerners. Attitudes towards crime, punishment, daily life, sex are so different from what Europeans and Americans of European descent are used to, that it is at times shocking and frightening. At other times it is so delightful that one wishes it were in all cultures.<br /><br />For readers interested in getting more under the skin of the Japanese thinking the book \\"Reading the Japanese Mind\\" (see my review) might be a good follow-up or companion.

B000050HTO|3.0|Let's face it, folks. Two discs cannot, in any way, cover the highlights of Bob Dylan's career. If you're looking for one or 2 particular songs that your collection doesn't have or you only really like a few of his hits, this is for you. Otherwise, get yourself a box set or his albums up to Nashville Skyline (or both) and enjoy. <br />This collection, on it's own merits, is pretty good. Disc 1 is fantastic. On Disc 2, however, the last 5 tracks are not truly worthy of being called his \\"greatest hits\\". Other than that, good buy.
0804106304|5.0|I hardly ever cry when I read a book, but I did a couple of times when I read this one, just from the tender feelings and differences between mothers and daughters.  Not only did these families have the usual difficulties due to age disparity between young and old, but there was also the cultural differences between war-time China and the modern USA.  Sometimes it was very funny, and it was always spellbinding to me.  It made me feel closer both to Chinese people and to my mother and also my daughter, who's the same age as the daughters in this book.
0099450259|4.0|Mark Haddon's book \\"The curious incident of the dog in the Night-Time\\" is about an autistic young boy, Christopher, who finds a dead dog in the garden and wants to find out who killed the animal.He finds out that his father killed him and what is even worse he lied to him by saying his mother had died although she just left him because of another man. Christopher now escapes from home and wants to go to his mother with the train, but the journey is filled with many problems and the fact that he is autistic makes it even harder.I think the book is very good, because it shows the problems of autistic people like they don't wan to be touched or can't handle human beings in a right way. It shows that it's very difficult to integrate people with such disorders in the community.
0385491026|5.0|Cat's Eye is a descriptive piece about a middle-aged artist recalling her girlhood friendships.  Elaine is refreshingly not a pink, fluffy, girly girl (ie the Paris Hilton type).  In fact, she discusses in the book how much better she relates to men then women.  It is not a suprise, therefore, that she faced challenges in female friendships.  As Atwood described the torment Elaine went through during these \\"friendships\\", and the results of it, I could not help but wonder if this was an autobiographical account.  Her descriptions of Elaine's self mutilation at age nine were impeccable and turned my stomach, and I felt the same emotions the main character was feeling.  But, this is what a good book is supposed to do. <br /> <br />The nine year old Elaine is in a position in which no one can help her in.  Her mother, brother, father,  and teachers cannot help her.  The torment the trio of girls inflict upon Elaine is a silent, sneaky one, the type that only young girls can master.  They always look like little girls just playing, when in reality the wounds being inflicted are just as significant as a broken bone.  The inability of adults to intervene is profoundly realistic.  The isolation Elaine feels as a result is what forces her to fend for herself, and eventually surpass her tormenter in strength.  After which, they become \\"friends\\" again, and Cordelia gets whats coming to her (although this was very heartbreaking). This tormenter-turned friend and her memory haunt Elaine throughout her adulthood. <br /> <br />What Elaine wants more than anything is closure, at this late date.  How many of us have unresolved relationships with former friends?  Probably most of us.  When it becomes obvious that this closure will remain unfulfilled, Elaine's realization of this reality is very well conveyed. I, as the reader, was just as disappointed as Elaine that Cordelia had lost her \\"tendency to exist\\".  The subtle but very real tragedy of lost chances to repair relationships comes to the forefront when we realize that our friend is gone for good, and will remain ever after a memory.  Will Elaine be able to move on?  Like many of us, it appears that Elaine will always carry Cordelia with her as an integral part of her being.   <br /> <br />This book takes patience, and is not an easy read.  However, it is rich in content, description, and imagery.  Atwood has a gift, and I can only thank her for sharing it with us.

0446577383|4.0|After kicking off his literary career with Absolute Power, which was a great book made into film starring Clint Eastwood, Baldacci raised the bar pretty high for all of his novels to follow.     If you can make it past the first 100 pages of this book, give or take a few, then you will enjoy the remainder. The beginning introduces several character-less characters and the plot really doesn't come together. You just have to keep reading because it's Baldacci and you know a good story will eventually unfold.     Once the Camel Club starts to become more prominent and the mysterious characters in Oliver Stone and Agent Ford begin to emerge then your interest will grow. The events described in the book between America and the Middle East mirror those developing in our current times, and this makes this book much more interesting.    Read it with the expectation that it will capitalize on modern-day headlines which provides the entertainment value.
1400032717|5.0|Fascinating - from cover to cover.    A simply written, deeply moving and a refreshingly different book.    It's about this British autistic boy Christopher, and how he solves the murder mystery of his neighbor's dog. Christopher talks to you about himself, throughout the book. And being what he is, he takes everything at face value, no matter how deep feelings associated might run. Kind of like the 'Forrest Gump' that we have seen and adored. To him everything around him is reduced to ridiculous simplicity. For instance, amongst the things he hates most are - the colors yellow and brown, being touched by anyone and the food items on his plate touching each other. Christopher's deadpan humor combined with his childhood innocence give a ring of truth even to his overly simplified conclusions about his surroundings. Christopher is extremely adept at mathematical and logical problems. These are depicted as pictures in the book, which add to the already interesting and extremely clear descriptions. The book lets you take a peek inside the mind of an autistic person and it's fascinating to learn something that you never really thought you'd get a chance to learn.     I would highly recommend the book.
B000003H2Q|1.0|I cant stand this album. I purchased this album as an import when it was first released and I was very, very disapointed.  After such an amazing album like Turn Loose The Swans, they release this crap.<br /><br />WHERE THE HELL ARE THE DEATH METAL VOCALS ??  They are gone, all gone.  Instead we are presented with whiny vocals that totally destroy the music.  The music is pretty good, but I just cant get past the horrid vocals.  One of the best things about Turn Loose The Swans was the interplay between clean vocals and death-metal vocals.  Thats all gone and it has been replaced by whining.

The book tells about a 15 year old boy named Christopher Boone who does detective work to find the murderer of his neighbours dog called Wellington.During the story the boy finds out a lot about the problems in his family and reaches out how \\"normal\\" people behave. The author describes the feelings and views from an autistic mind which affords you many insights.brillinat read...
B000AOLT38|4.0|This is a heartwarming film, made all the more delightful by the wonderful, breakout performance of newcomer, Jamie Bell, in the leading role of Billy Elliot. The son and brother of coalminers, Billy is given boxing lessons by his father but is drawn, instead, to learning ballet. So, he surreptitiously takes ballet lessons. When his father finds out, all hell breaks loose, as in the macho world of his coalminer father and brother, this is tantamount to a sign that Billy is gay.<br /><br />Billy's teacher, however, thinks Billy has talent, and attempts to persuade the father to permit Billy to audition for the Royal Ballet School. At first, the father refuses. He is ultimately won over, when Billy gives him a private dance performance so passionate that even he is moved, So, Billy then goes off to London for the audition. What happens next is sure to move even the most stone hearted viewer.<br /><br />This is ultimately a film about hope and the ability to realize one's dreams. Well acted, it is a film that is sure to delight the viewer. The only real flaw in the film is the sound quality, which tends to be somewhat uneven. All in all, however, this is an excellent film and well worth watching, if only for Billy Elliot's dance scenes.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Not since Violator have I heard such great work from them. For awhile their cds sounded like they were just wallowing around in pain. But this new album is edgy, enegetic and makes you want to crank it up in the car and groove to wherever you're going (but be careful not to lose yourself too much in the music. You don't want a car accident). Pretty much every song is good on this cd. This cd is well worth the money.
B00005MOLB|4.0|This is a heartwarming movie with fine performances by Sean Connery, newcomer Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Nouri, and Anna Pacquin. Well directed by Gus Van Sant, the film revolves around the two main characters, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, and sixteen year old Kamal, played by Rob Brown.<br /><br />William Forrester is a writer who, battling his own inner demons, has remained reclusive after writing a Pulitzer Prize winning novel some forty odd years earlier. Living alone in a changing neighborhood in the Bronx, he makes the acquaintance of Kamal, an intellectually gifted inner city kid, who plays street basketball, loves to write, and does both well.<br /><br />A mentoring relationship springs between the two. Under Forrester's secret tutorship, Kamal blossoms. When Kamal's scholastic test scores come to the attention of a local prep school, school officials offer him a scholarship to attend and, if he chooses to do so, play basketball on the school team. The school also turns out to be William Forrester's alma mater, where he is revered and his prize winning novel is required reading.<br /><br />There, Kamal encounters rank racism, all the more insidious because it is covert. F. Murray Abraham plays a teacher who is very similar to the character, Salieri, whom Abraham portrayed in the film \\"Amadeus\\". A failed writer who became a teacher, Abraham oozes racism as he contrives to destroy Kamal whom he accuses of plagirism, as he clearly believes him to be just another inner city, black basketball player who is incapable of anything more. He cannot seem to fathom that this kid could possibly write as well as he does, because he has Kamal stereotyped.<br /><br />Yet, Kamal is actually all that he puports to be, a gifted writer who just also happens to play basketball. Truly scholarly, he shows up his teacher in class, only to further exacerbate his emnity. This teacher's dislike and covert racism manifests itself in the exclusion of Kamal's entry in the prestigious writing competition sponsored by the prep school. This situation comes to a head when the teacher's racism is exposed for what it is in a stunning, surprising climax.<br /><br />Kamal, however, is not the only one to have a moment of redemption in the movie. Forrester, too, has that moment as he comes to grips with his past, the past that made him shut the world out for so long. It is his friendship with Kamal that illuminates his return to the very world from which he had withdrawn long ago.<br /><br />This film is about a friendship that is borne out of a shared passion. It is about the old nurturing the young. It is about passing the baton from one generation to the next. It is a film the transcends age and race.

078401213X|4.0|This movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us sci-fi geeks.  Here's why:    *creeped out techno music.  not creepy and etherel in itself...but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat.  it's incessant, and a great effect. Max's voice-overs add to the overall creepiness.    *fantastic concept.  brilliant, really.  every pattern can be graphed.  What if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret \\"formula\\" to life?  Max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge...not $$$.  Great stuff.    *tons-o-suspense.  the movie really builds up well.  almost too well, as my one negative comment will show.  you will get a really strong sense that SOMETHING of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching.    *tripped out lead character...complete with hallucinations, quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact.  we're talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls.  The lead character is great...if not a little contrived at times by the actor.  I mean, he's getting revelations to the meaning of life, the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee!  YES!    But, i only gave PI 4 stars for a reason:    *the letdown.  i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it's building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life.  I mean, i was right there...hook line and sinker.  But i was left on the line at the end.  The ending isn't bad...but it seems like a cop-out.  Max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull.  No more special gift...no more math at the speed of thought...no more secret formula or mystery.    Dang, i was disapointed.   I tried really hard not to be, because the movie had me so enthralled...but I didn't get the \\"wham-bam\\" experience i was hoping for at the end.    HOWEVER!  I would HIGHLY recomend you checking it out for yourself.  I've spoken with a lot of folkswho totally disagree with me and dig the ending.      Great addition to your underground sci-fi.  Pick it up!    stem
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is a Motion Picture that has a true Masterpiece aura. This Film was such a Masterpiece that it also would influence other Films and other types of Animation. The Paintings in Sleeping Beauty were of a true master who is no longer with us, when as for the graphic Paintings of Melicifent and her as a Dragon, and as for the Castle that she lived in, as well as the Thorns that defended Aurora's Castle, they are so amazing, that they would all influence any Gothic Painter today.   In a variety of songs by Ronnie James Dio or even KISS and JUDAS PRIEST plus OZZY himself, one can feel a presence of Sleeping Beauty. In the album Dream Evil that I did a review on, this Film gives a huge presence of influence, and especially on the album Cover, when as for OZZy and his albums, one can feel some type of influence on Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon as well as Ultimate Sin. On the album of Music From THE ELDER and on the PAUL STANLEY album, one can find influences from the Battle in between GOOD and EVIL, that are in the Film of Sleeping Beauty, although the music is of the original Ballet, but redesigned for the Film, so the music and the Tale are in no connection with Music From THE ELDER or PAUL STANLEY.   Although there is no connections at all with this album and the Film, I always felt a connection in between Sleeping Beauty and Calling All Stations by Genesis. The swirls of the art on the CD jacket and the multi colors shown when the Gifts are given to Aurora are to blaime, while the Battle sceenes in between Melificent and Philip as well as the sceenes of the escape, are in connection some how for me with the song and musical sounds on CONGO, which is my favorate song on this over ignored Masterpiece. The title song gives me a feel of lonleyness, when dealing with Aurora being drawn into such a long sleep, while Shipwrecked is to me about the heartbreak in between Briar Rose learning that she has always lived a lie and that she will never see her true love again.   One can take these ideas seriously or leave them alone, but this Film has such a strong connection to various Pop icons, if one follows those songs and certain parts of the Tale of Sleeping Beauty, as well as the Art.
B000FA57RQ|5.0|I am very excited about the pending release of the Secret DVD, after having seen it on MTV.  I am hoping the dvd may have some more footage edited from the MTV version.  Anyway, you fans of yesteryear need to stop Vogueing long enough to realize that Madonna has more to say, she has evolved, and is evolving. Maybe there's a message there for us.  She is no longer quite the egocentric diva you long for. That doesn't mean she doesn't have incredible energy and spunk.  She's not a saint for sure. And she is not cramming Kabbalah down our throats; she is being who she has become and sharing the effect her studies have had upon her. Look into your hearts before you stone her guys.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I join the rest of the reviewers in the chorus of demanding that this wonderful '80's movie get released to DVD.  MGM and Virgin really should come to their collective senses and release it already.  About the movie, a great love story described well by reviewer C. Hintzen \\"Movie Fanatic.\\"  For something different from this reviewer, here's a partial list of movies that are available on DVD: <br />Cannonball Run 2, Home Alone 3, Caddyshack 2, Superman 3 and 4, <br />Smokey and the Bandit 2 on. Life's not fair. <br />Back to Electric Dreams, my favorite unappreciated actress Virginia Madsen shines as the love interest Madeline, unknowingly pursued by both lovable loser Miles and his jealous computer Edgar.  Wine spilled accidentally brings out the humanity, jealousy and madness in the machine, much like wine flows and spills causing jealousy and madness in \\"Sideways,\\" also a Virginia Madsen picture.  She provides the happiest and saddest moments in this movie, and is enough of a treat alone to see this movie.  Combine her performance, some great '80's pop songs (\\"Love is Love\\" by Culture Club is a great music-video-within-a-movie), and two or three love stories wrapped into one, and you got a great movie for all time.  Great date-movie, too!
B00006879E|5.0|I figured since they deserved it, I would write a good review for this album. Anyone wondering? Its awesome, and every time I hear a song, its like the first time again
0375701427|5.0|I've read two of his other books (the better of which was Human Stain, although I liked them both), and I must say that this trumps both. The characters, each of them complex and beautifully developed, unfold gradually, and as you learn the secrets of their lives, your heart breaks slowly. I can't say much about this book that others haven't, but I thought it deserved my vote, because this Pulitzer prize-winner is one of the best modern American novels, and it deserves nothing but five stars. Anything less is a travesty. If you're listening, Mr. Roth, I applaud you.
B00005JOYA|2.0|It's hard for me to explain my thoughts on this movie. I have never been so divided by opinions. On the one hand the movie has the darkest most ghoulish touch I've ever seen. It's as if man's mind was split open and evil were permitted to drip across the screen. The visuals are too striking to do them justice with mere words.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the plot and acting were so poorly thrown together you'd think it was a dress rehearsal and they were making it up as they went. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is a bonus as it encompasses a lot of what makes the series shine. Sadly, it is used around THIS cast of characters who aren't fit to be in Silent Hill to begin with.  <br /> <br />My advice; if you are a Silent Hill fan, it's a must see for the sheer backdrops of creation. If you aren't a fan, this movie will likely make sure you never become one.
0393316041|2.0|OK, so Feynman is smarter than all of us. We get it. But I found him to be an insufferable jerk. Pompous and insensitive doesn't begin to describe this man's character. At about the time he started messing with that poor waitress, leaving her tip underneath a tipped-over glass of water so she would wonder how he'd done it, and would have to spill water all over the floor in order to retrieve his pocket change, I'd had enough. But I went ahead and fished the book anyway, because I was so far into it.<br /><br />Quite simply, the man suffers from emotional stunted growth, and I doubt if he pranks have won him very many true friends.<br /><br />Also, I must say the writing leaves something to be desired. It's breezy and mannered, far too coloquial, ridden with cliches, and not at all well-edited. His editor was probably afraid to touch his prose, but it needed a lot of work.<br /><br />Are there some interesting stories here? A few. Thus, two stars. It's not a complete waste of time, but I just don't see how so many people like this book so much.
B000063DHK|4.0|At the time this album was recorded, in Long Beach, California and Hammersmith, London, Maiden were one of the top metal bands in the world. They embarked on year long tour, which nearly send them ,especially Bruce, crazy. The wonderfully packaged remastered album, relates the crazy schedule, the food and drink consumed ,guitar stringds used etc. Plus for the musicians, a fascinating inside,by the great Martin Birch, about the recording of the album. The music itself needs no introduction. Kicking off with Churchill's famous speech into a rip roaring version of Aces High. Terrific versions of 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave, Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and the band are so tight it's amazing. Running Free does outstay it's welcome though. The second cd is from London and has some less well known songs such as Die With Your Boots On and Phantom Of The Opera. I think another slight quibble is the crowd has been mixed so far down, sometimes you don't know they're there. Steve Harris has also said this. This is rectified in the excellant Live At Donnington and even more excellant Rock In Rio albums. However, minor things aside, this is a terrific live album of a great group at their peak.
0517543052|5.0|The message in Ram Dass's first book on returning from India is profoundly simple but enormously difficult to live by-\\"Be here now.\\" Where are you? Here. What time is it? Now. This book has seen over 35 reprints with more than one million copies sold. Reading it can change your life. <br /> <br />Ram Dass, formerly Richard Alpert, was a professor dismissed from Harvard in 1963, along with colleague Timothy Leary, because of his experiments with mind-altering drugs such as LSD. In 1967 he traveled to India, found his guru (Neem Karoli Baba), then returned to North America to share his experience of enlightenment. In 1974, Ram Dass created the Hanuman Foundation, which developed the Prison Ashram Project, designed to help prison inmates grow spiritually during their incarceration, and the Dying Project, conceived as a spiritual support structure for conscious dying. He is a co-founder and advisory board member of the Seva Foundation, an international service organization, and he also works with the Social Venture Network, an organization of businesses seeking to bring social consciousness to business practices.

6302878756|4.0|Tango & Cash brings to the screen the story of two top police officers that find themselves framed by the villain they're trying to catch.   Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Teri Hatcher (!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.    In short, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all very good (keep in mind though, the film has 80's written all over it).    Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!
B000002MY3|5.0|The best debut by a female artist ever, Jagged Little Pill is a triumph for Ms.Morissette. This album is in-you-face, direct, shocking, and brilliantly raw. All the songs are intelligent. All I Really Want has to be the best song on the album:\\"Enough about me let's talk about you for a minute, enough about you let's talk about life for awhile.\\" You Oughta Know, her first breakthrough hit:\\"You seem very well, things look peaceful, I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know.\\" Perfect is so sad and real:\\"We'll love you just the way you are if you're perfect.\\" Hand in my Pocket, probably my least favorite song but still listenable:\\"I'm sick but I'm pretty baby.\\" Right Through You has the funniest lyrics ever:\\"You took me for a joke, you took me for a child, you took a long hard look at my a@! and then played golf for awhile.\\" Forgiven is soooo good, about being held back in terms of religion:\\"We all had a reason to be there, we all had delusions in our heads, we all had our minds made up for us...\\" You Learn is a very low-key a rather simple song:\\"I recommend putting your foot in your mouth at any time, feel free.\\" Head Over Feet, surprisely the only love song but with hestitation:\\"And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are, I couldn't help it it's all your fault!\\" Mary Jane is about a girl contemplating suicide:\\"So take this Mary Jane and be selfish, worry not about the cars that go by, cuz all that Mary Jane is your freedom...\\" Ironic, the song that got me hooked on Alanis:\\"It's like meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife.\\" No the Doctor, just a fun song:\\"Visting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6 I know you'll find a way to sneak me in that door.\\" Wake Up is mellow but still a bitter and angry song:\\"There's no love, no money, no thrill anymore.\\" There is a hidden track so don't skip over it, Your House, Alanis sings it with no music, listen to the power and strength in her voice on this track, it's amazing. This album still holds up after 11 years after is release, she won a dozen or so Grammy's for this album so see what all the fuss is about and buy this historical album from a brainy and ballsy girl, I mean woman.his album still holds up after 11 years after is release, she won a dozen or so Grammy's for this album so see what all the fuss is about and buy this historical album from a brainy and ballsy girl, I mean woman.
0743454537|1.0|I read this book for my book club and was excited to try a new author.  I plowed through it in a few sittings, but overall I was disappointed.  The author uses different fonts for each character's narration, which comes across as gimmicky.  Her writing style lacks fluidity, with recurring flashbacks that do not add much to the character development or plot.  The story is predictable and the ending is a complete cop-out.  This is not good literature, but more like a Lifetime Original Movie.  (And over 400 pages of it!)
B000AA4LAK|5.0|The Killers Hot Fuss is a great and fun album. With three extra tracks included, this 14 song collection is worth the money. My fave track is Smile like you mean it, has a fabulous melody and lyrics:\\"And someone is playing a game in the house that i grew-up in, and someone will drive her around down the same streets that i did...\\" On Top is a perfect love song, Andy you're a star, Mr. Brightside,Somebody Told Me, The Ballad of Michael Valentine, Jenny was a friend of mine, Change your mind, and All these things that I've done are wonderful as well. Hot Fuss is the best album I have heard and the best new band I have listened to in the past 5 years. Hope their next creation is as great as this.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This is a great album.  From Attack through Track 12 (2nd of two bonus tracks),  you'll really enjoy what \\"30 Seconds\\" has to offer.  I think of them as a cross between STP and Linkin Park.
0743537009|5.0|I usually read books but have lately been listening to audio books and thought Campbell Scott's performance was surprisingly good.  Another reviewer complained that it was a monotone performance but I think that a flatter reading is preferable to some spoken books I have heard where some narrators think they are on the Muppets.  I personally think this style - low-key but very steady - is perfect for not letting the narration get in the way of the writers words.  It wasn't that monotone anyway, in my opinion.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|... <br />Rather than write some trite trash I'll just quote William Obscured, who seems to have said it all most sublimly..  <br /> <br />...\\"The album holds fast to the sound of the days we all remembered, and have certainly by now almost forgotten on our way back along the path to the music we love.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Eli Roth is obviously a huge fan of the genre.  This was made clearly evident with his first feature - the fun, ghoulish, but ultimately flawed Cabin Fever.  Hostel is likewise a fun, ghoulish, but lacking movie that is better than Cabin Fever, but missing something.  If this movie proves anything is that in time Roth has the potential to make a film on the same level as the ones that obviously influenced him - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Japanese horror films like Audition - but he's not quite there yet.   <br /> <br />The first half of Hostel is Girls Gone Wild as a trio of friends beggar through Europe.  The movie begins by finding the trio in Amsterdam.  Need I say more?  Soon, however, the movie thrusts its viewer into a nihilistic world where wealthy people pay good money to indulge their need for torture.  And our three drug-addled, sex-crazed heroes are the main course.   <br /> <br />Hostel has a lot going for it.  It's fast paced.  The characters are likeable.  The women are beautiful and barely wearing a stitch.  And that's just the first half hour.  The rest of the film takes place in a kind of hell of earth where limbs are amputated, fingers are chainsawed to the floor and the human body is reduced to the properties of a pin cushion.  People are flayed and dissected with glee.  Eyes dangle from their sockets.  Ankle tendons are severed.  Although the DVD boasts that its unrated, the gore level was not as stomach-churningly prodigious as I had anticipated.  But still.  Pretty much all bodily fluids are on display herein.  The movie, despite all its bloodshed, seems to not take itself seriously.  And neither did I.  I'm not sure if the desired effect was to make the viewer squirm and dry heave or at times to laugh out loud at some of the more over-the-top effects.  I did mostly the latter.  For any horror fan, this is a must see, considering how stale the genre is it at the moment.  More importantly, Hostel shows a horror filmmaker (and above all,a horror fan) improving his craft while delivering the visceral goods to those of us who eat that sticky stuff up.   <br /> <br />Of the special features on the DVD, the only ones of note are the three behind the scenes features and the four seperate commentaries featuring Roth and others, including one with exec. producers Quentin Tarantino and Scott Spiegel.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie since it's original release date was announced back in 2005. I must say it was well worth the wait! I believe this movie will set the stage for future CG movies. It is absolutly stunning! The art is beyond beautiful and no detail was spared.  <br /> <br />The voice actors did an amazing job despite the fact that the animation was designed originally for Japanese speaking actors. There were VERY few times that I noticed any difference at all between the lip movement of the characters and the actual words of the voice actors. Steve Burton, Rachel Leigh Cook and Steve Staley (Cloud, Tifa, and Kadaj respectivly) really deserve credit as great voice actors. Their talents brought the characters to life almost as well as I had pictured in my head when I played the game all those years ago. Other voice talents, including Mena Suvari (Aerith) and Christy Carlson Romano (Yuffie), helped to bring the entire group to life in a way never seen before.  <br /> <br />The story held my attention to the very end. I thought it was very well written and helped to deepen the feelings of the characters that many of us fell in love with years ago. The only downside I will say of the plot was that I did get the feeling that it catered to the group of people that had already played the game. Those that haven't played FFVII yet may be a little confused on some points but it shouldn't distract from the overall enjoyment of this wonderful movie. There is a spot on the DVD called \\"Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII\\" which, while in Japanese with English subtitles, will give the viewer a quick background of the story line of the game up to where the movie opens.  <br /> <br />All in all I give this movie a very enthusiastic rating of 5 stars. A definite must see. Great job to the Square Enix team and the rest of the cast and crew for job well done.
B000ERU6QC|5.0|Similar to The Godfather 2, Death By Sexy outrageously sails past its predecessor Peace, Love, and Death Metal in an epic portrayal of the true, delicious essence of classical rock n' roll. As duo team Gods of Rock, Death by Sexy once again pits lead singer/guitarist John `The Devil' Hughes with fellow friend and Queens of the Stone Age front man Josh Homme, who accepts double duty as drummer and producer of the album. The group resurrects the classical rock genre, their groovy talents showcased throughout the span of the album. The curtains to the Eagles of Death Metal rise during the catchy, toe-tapping I Want You So Hard (Boys Bad News) and close magnificently to an encore on the honky-tonk, blues tribute Bag O' Miracles. As head of the band, Hughes falsetto sounds like a brilliant amalgam of Freddie Mercury and Neil Young, resulting in a significant aftermath that proves Hughes voice to be one of the most vital pieces in completing the Eagles unique sound. Josh Homme expands Eagles distinctive talents by pumping out a solid drum rhythm and filling every empty cavity of a song with his breezy, back up vocals. A definitive gift that the Gods of Rock have bestowed on mankind, Death by Sexy is a pure joy ride that is unquestionably worth taking. For a true journey through the magnificence of Death Metal, hop on the back of the Eagles to fly you there. And hopefully, classical rockers will have enough taste to approve of them as well.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|First the Disclaimer; I've been a Neil Young fan since I was about 15, and discovered CSNY.  That was in 1972.  <br /> <br />It's generally true that Young's albums generally fall into one of three broad \\"categories\\"--his \\"acoustic\\" work, his \\"electric\\" work, and his . . .\\"experimental\\" work (Trans, anyone?).  I happen to LOVE both his acoustic AND his electric music . . .I can usually \\"pass\\" on the experimental stuff. <br /> <br />Through the years, Young's electric music (particulary with Crazy Horse) has always been first-rate, and his acoustic material has often been either *excellent* (Harvest, After the Gold Rush, Comes a Time), or perhaps a bit disappointing. <br /> <br />After listening to Prairie Wind four times this week, I have now come to believe that this one ranks up there with his all-time BEST, and is certainly Young's best work of ANY kind since 1979-80. <br /> <br />If you're a Neil Young fan, don't believe the stupid \\"negative\\" reviews; this one's GREAT.  If you aren't a Neil Young fan, you're probably not reading this; but in case you are--try this! <br /> <br />BTW, the DVD looks and sounds terrific.  Well worth the slightly extra cost.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Its all about these guys who like go to a brothel in Europe and wind up getting tortured and junk.  yeah that's about all there is to it really.  it's pretty gross, like this time when I was in high school cuz you see i like took this crime class and anyway the teacher (a cop) showed us this video of a naked dude getting stabbed in prison--no fooling!--and I said \\"i dont think we shuld be watching this\\" and he was all \\"Shut UP Tad!\\"  What a jerk.  This is like that only its better because you can see it better.  i guess that's becuase its a movie.  Well, the movies pretty good i guess.    See ya!

B000EHRVP6|4.0|In his treatise on horror, \\"Danse Macabre,\\" Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with \\"terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion.\\"  In the wake of \\"Saw,\\" and with \\"Wolf Creek\\" and now \\"Hostel,\\" it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set.  The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.<br /><br />\\"Hostel\\" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with \\"Cabin Fever.\\"  As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe.  As you can easily anticipate, \\"hostel\\" is real close to \\"hostile,\\" so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out.  Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time.  Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent.  Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.<br /><br />Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland.  These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them.  \\"Hostel\\" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences.  Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff.  At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.<br /><br />Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on \\"Hostel\\" for one reasons.  That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me (Roth tells one of his actresses that \\"Hostel\\" is actually inspired by something that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe, and that he wanted to do a documentary about it; apparenly she thought \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" was true too).  I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.<br /><br />In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in \\"Hostel\\" than in either \\"Saw\\" or \\"Wolf Creek,\\" but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger.  The other key distinction is that while \\"Hostel\\" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end.  That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that \\"Hostel\\" is the most lighthearted of the three.  So \\"Saw II\\" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, \\"Wolf Creek\\" will leave you the most empty, and \\"Hostel\\" will give you the most blood and laughs.  Do not say you were not warned.mbination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff.

This books tells the delightful (often delightfully dreadful) story of the 14th century. Black Death, Dancing Madness, burning heretics, you know, the usual stuff. Tuchman's best work.
0307276902|5.0|I don't care what Oprah says, whether she wants him in her club or not, and I certainly don't care if James Frey embellished or lied or made the whole thing up.  I read this book two years ago and back then I thought it was amazing and I still do today. It drags you in and you can feel the character's addiction. The writing is great, the way it's all one big rambling paragraph, with no indication of who is actually speaking.  I adored this book and will continue to feel this way for the rest of my life.  I will buy every book Frey publishes because a good story by a good author = a good book.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|The negative reviews here make me laugh.  These are people who should be watching the latest Reese Witherspoon movie.  Now for those of us who are enjoying the trend of recent sadistic movies like Saw, this movie delivered.  The blood and gore were great.  All hand made, no computers here.  The movie delves into sadism, misery , torture, and the levels of humanity that go below the primal urges of human nature.  This movie was sick, twisted, bloody and hand scenes that make you cringe.  Great stuff.  I'm glad to see Hollywood actually realising that we are all adults here and that they don't need to censor gore scenes in modern movies like they used to.  One other thing, the naked chicks in the movie was a nice touch.  Never have a problem with that!
B00005AFMT|5.0|When many Crimson fans first listened to the band's 1981 release, they were stunned. Stunned for two reasons - one, it sounded nothing like the old King Crimson(s), and two, though its embrace of new wave stylings should have been nothing short of blasphemous, it was in fact a miraculous blessing of a sort.     To address the former, it certainly didn't sound like the 69-71 psychedelic/progressive/jazzish King Crimson, with its infatuation with Mellotron-driven epics and mystical, intriguing lyrics. Nor did it resemble the 73-74 Crimson, which placed the focus on jarring rhythms, improvisation, and all-out experimentalism. But, at the same time, the music on Discipline was undeniably Crimson, in a strange, indefinable way. Intense, exciting, and incredibly odd, this new version retained the previous incarnations' idiosyncratic progressive rock approach, and melded it with influences drawn from the arty new wave of the time (Talking Heads, for one).     Okay, so I've said a lot about what the album is, but I haven't yet given a critique. To put it succinctly, Discipline may be one of the greatest prog-rock albums ever made, and it is surely one of King Crimson's best. This excellent, nearly flawless album never exceeds its admittedly gigantic reach, and utilizes the four current members (for those keeping score at home: Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin, and Bill Bruford)to great effect. While it is true that the band makes a point of being able to play their instruments (extremely proficiently, I might add), it never detracts from a purely enjoyable listening experience. In fact, it only enhances it. Particular highlights from the album include \\"Elephant Talk,\\" \\"Matte Kudasai,\\" \\"Indiscipline,\\" and \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet.\\"    Like any King Crimson, it is only for those who like thoughtful music. However, I'd say it is a fair assumption to say that most of those who prefer dance, pop, rap, or the like, will not be visiting King Crimson any time soon. Essential for any King Crimson fan, or any progressive-rock fan in general.    On a closing note, I'd like to posit a question. What precisely is wrong with being technically proficient at an instrument? Sure, there are instrumental sections on Discipline, but they are not there simply so the band could prove how well they could play. One look at the members' past records could prove that. The joy of hearing these excellent musicians interact is perhaps one of the greatest successes of Discipline. And it makes for excellent listening, as well.

I'm going to miss not reading about Bobo and her family every day. \\"We have moved, mother and father with two children, a couple of cats, three dogs, and one horse, right into the middle, the very birthplace and epicenter, of the civil war in Rhodesia and a freshly stoked civil war in Mozambique.\\"<br /><br />This is a book I slowly read in order to enjoy every word written. Ms. Fuller's descriptions and dialogue are real and captivating. She's an inspiration to read.<br /><br />Most memoirs are tell-alls about miserable family and problems with drugs and alcohol. Ms. Fuller writes of her family experiencing life and death troubles and pain but continuing on in spite of - sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic. In a way, this author allows the reader acceptance of their own nutty family upbringing - to carry on and love no matter what.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I hate films like this. It is very moving and it feels very heavy. I didn't know I was that deep watching until I realized that I was in tears with Ennis in the scene when Jack said to him, \\"I wish I knew how to quit you.\\" To which he replied, \\"Why don't you just let me be? It's because of you, Jack, that I am like this.\\" The feeling-- it cannot be described. Love-- it's the force that stops you, sets you free, makes you somebody, makes you a nobody, makes you see things, makes you blind, gives you hope.     I burst into tears again upon seeing \\"DECEASED\\" stamped on the returned postcard Ennis sent for Jack. I couldn't stop my tears even after the ending credits of the film. It made me think of the things that I should have done. It made me reflect on what factors should I base my life's big decisions on-- friends? Town folks? Tradition? Family? Happiness? Love? I certainly hope that it's not too late... For a movie that has no \\"specific message\\" to convey, Brokeback Mountain gave me lots of thoughts about life and love, and surely, it renewed my hope. \\"I swear...\\"  .  .  .  (Two weeks and a few days later...)  .  .  Brokeback Mountain had me write what I have written above (originally posted on April 12, 2006, unedited, useful to 54/62) right after seeing the movie for the first time. That was my initial reaction. I was greatly moved by the movie and I was inspired to write. Under the influence of such overwhelming emotion, I even wrote some spoilers (my apologies). Brokeback Mountain-a movie about two cowboys who falls in love with each other in the early 60's amidst the conservative, religious and strict society-is such a great film that motivates people. Seeing other people's reviews here makes me shed some tears because I completely understand their feelings in what they have written. It made me feel like doing something about it. I am not a writer so I could not make a good review of the film. But for me, a good film is not about how big the production was.It's not about the monetary budget. It's not about the stunts. It's not about the special effects. It's all about telling a good story and how that story reaches the heart and mind of the audience. How the movie affects people-that's the way I evaluate a film. This \\"review\\" basically reveals how the movie left me a lasting impression.    I liked the whole movie but there are others who question some parts of the movie, like, the growing love between Ennis and Jack in the mountains was not evidently shown. I would say that these people missed that part. The conception of the love between Ennis and Jack was clearly developed and was even symbolized by the scenery. The mountains, the sheep, the weather, the rivers, all of these are not just serving as natural background. They are also symbolic. Director Ang Lee used them to symbolize the passage of time and how Ennis and Jack were spending their time together. The grandness of the landscape and the simplicity of the sheep in the area controlled by cowboys also symbolized our big world and the little souls living in it constrained by the society's norms and values.    By the time the guys came down from the mountains, Ennis was (another spoiler?) already deeply in love with Jack. This was shown in the scene when they went on to their own separate ways-when Jack was already gone, Ennis began sobbing in an alley and hitting the wall. This was a perfect illustration of his love left undisclosed to Jack. Why the sobbing? Because of a true love which was \\"not supposed to be.\\" I should know-I wounded my fist when I was in the same predicament some years ago. I still have the scars on my knuckles.    I had mixed emotions happening at the same time in some parts throughout the movie. Especially when Ennis and Jack was first reunited. While I was deeply sympathetic with Alma looking over the window at Ennis and Jack getting in the pickup, at the same time I was also happy for the two guys being together again. Proving that theirlove for each other still exist after all those years.     As others mentioned that this movie was slow and too long, I tried to watch it for the nth time on DVD, and I skipped some scenes. It didn't work for me. Ang Lee knows what he was doing. Some scenes were thoughtfully placed here and there to break the tension and the emotion building inside the viewer. That's the reason why some people find this boring. However, as the movie ends, the emotion reaches to its climax. And at the last frame of the film, you would not want it to end. That's how I felt.    This movie is brilliant, if not perfect. However, if I am brutally forced to find something wrong about it, I can think of one scene. That is when Aguirre came over to tell Jack about his sick uncle. Jack was chopping wood into pieces with the axe. He positioned a piece of wood on the chopping table then turned around to face Aguirre. They talked in close up shots. When Aguirre left and Jack turned back to the chopping table, the piece of wood was already gone and so he was picking up another piece of wood instead. Who moved the wood? Irrelevant, but I call it \\"the vanishing wood\\" scene. But hey, that's just a needle in the hay.     Not a fan of any of the performers but I think the characters in the movie were all believable. Anne Hathaway-although I didn't believe her appearance, her acting showed that she's grown from being a cute princess to an actress. Michelle Williams-if only her role was a little longer, the best actress award was hers. Jake Gyllenhaal-way, way up higher than I expected. Heath Ledger-he created an unforgettable character whose silent and mostly non-verbal expressions of internal conflict and pain shouts an ocean deep of emotion. My choice for best actor (over the guy who imitated another person who talks a lot and that talking just seemed to cover up what lacked in the acting itself).     A peaceful movie with a more universal theme should have won the best picture at the Oscars (especially if this organization is trying to impress the world as the leading and \\"international\\" film award giving body) instead of the one that I find \\"too American.\\" I find Brokeback Mountain as having a more widespread but ignored theme, more applicable to more people's lives in different societies across the globe. The lead actors did a great, convincing job that if I happen to meet them personally I'm afraid that I would give them a big hug in tears, still believing that they are the doomed Ennis and Jack.    The simple yet powerful music is not to be ignored as it enhanced the dramatic scenes of the movie. And what else can I say? Brokeback Mountain is too good that every time I watch it, it always penetrates into my heart. I hate that. I don't want to be vulnerable. I am a guy, and \\"it should not be.\\" So what exactly is the message that we are looking for here? Nothing specifically. It's out there in the open. If this movie is not a love story, then what is it? If the theme is not universal enough, then what is? In other words, this movie offers a lot of meaningful interpretation. Have an open mind, see this movie and let your heart find the right answer for you.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger) has a problem. The Roman Inquisition is after him, accusing him of perversion, debauchery and moral licentiousness. It is 1750s Venice, and the carousing Casanova has been working his way through the nunneries of Venice. The local Catholic inquisitor (Ken Stott) tells him that in order to save his depraved neck from the gallows, he must marry. So he sets his sights on the city's most eligible virgin (Natalie Dormer).     At the same time he meets the feisty proto-feminist Francesca (Sienna Miller) at a duel and falls in love with her. Because women are banned from publishing, Francesca is secretly writing female empowerment books under an assumed name and is betrothed to the famed porcine lard merchant Paprizzio (Oliver Platt). Her family led by her beautiful mother (Lena Olin) is poor and badly needs the money.     How can Casanova get the woman he loves, whilst staying away from certain death at the gallows? He begins a game of cat and mouse, hiding behind various identities to get what he really wants. But then a new inquisitor (Jeremy Irons) suddenly arrives from the Vatican, determined to clean up Venice, which he sees as the cesspit of fornication. He makes it perfectly clear that he's determined to arrest and hang Casanova, who is the ultimate threat to moral authority.      The film is fun and entertaining. It's also silly and hectic and remarkably sanitized - you won't find much naughty, bawdy sex-fuelled romping in this Casanova.  Heath Ledger maybe nimble and rakish, but he's not that sexy, he's also rather bland and walks through this role. Casanova may be synonymous with sexual abandon, but in this version, he's duty-bound to please the ladies who swoon at his feet and is more concerned with finding true love than looking for his next sexual conquest.     There's no doubt Casanova is gorgeous to look at, in fact, the film is a little too gorgeous, with director Lasse H?llstrom over producing the film to within an inch ofits life. The real location scenes of Venice are fabulous, but it all looks so clean and scrubbed, set-dressed and over-lit that it might as well be in a Hollywood studio. Costumes are elaborate and sumptuous, locations are grand and glorious, but it all strangely detracts from the realism of the story.     Over-production isn't the only problem. The script is downright embarrassing in places, and quirky one-liners that are meant to produce laughs fall flat with the weight of a lead balloon. The humour desperately needs the smart, twisty inventiveness that Tom Stoppard brought to Shakespeare in Love. This script is merely cheeky, never engaging us on any romantic or thematic level besides the general cuteness of it all.    Fortunately the fast-paced plot keeps the movie rolling along. Although Ledger isn't the actor I would pick to play Casanova - Colin Farrell or Jeremy Northam would have been a much better choice - he manages to be charming enough. Sienna Miller looks absolutely gorgeous and overflows with sparkly personality and fighting spirit, even though she never manages to create that much chemistry with Ledger. Olin is luminous as always as Francesca's mum, while Platt and Irons clearly have the most fun with their characters.     There's never a dull moment, even as the storyline gets more and more ridiculous, and there's always a jaunty tone that keeps us engaged. Most annoying is the endless irritating baroque music, that just keeps playing and playing, it distracts from the action and rises in the most inappropriate places.     In the end, Casanova plays more like a watered-down children's film, a type of PG thirteen sex farce, rather than the sophisticated, witty romp the filmmakers were clearly aiming for. It's a pity, because even though there's a real spark to all the silliness, with just a little bit more edginess, the film could have been another Tom Jones, rather than a somewhat bargain basement, and second-rate Shakespeare In Love.

B000002U82|5.0|This one has always baffled the critics. It didn't fit their formula of what a successful album should be, and they still can't quite get their hand around it. This album wasn't riddled with number one hits, it wasn't promoted on MTV, the band members, all but unheard of in the US when it came out in 1973, were not only bashful but downright reclusive, they never appeared on the Ed Sullivan show and for the love of God, it was a concept album, something you had to listen to all the way through, just to get it.  <br /> <br />So what made this, the little album that could, not only pink Floyd's biggest album, but also the biggest rock album of all time? What kept this album on the billboard 200 chart for 15 years and on the Catalogue chart ever since? Because, it takes you \\"there\\", where ever there might be. Quite frankly, it's the soundtrack to life. If you don't believe me, put the album on while you're watching TV. Just randomly flip through the channels, spending no more then a few seconds on any given channel. It doesn't matter what's on the screen, the music fits. <br /> <br />I guess the best way to put it is if you haven't heard Dark Side of the Moon you've probably been doing just fine, although, when you finally do hear it you may just wonder how you've made it as far as you have without it. The music just kind of sits there, perched in your subconscious, and somehow makes sense out of it all. <br /> <br />I could complain about how \\"Money\\" really doesn't fit with the rest of the album and I could talk about how \\"Us and Them\\" might be more appropriate at a funeral precession then at a rock concert but then I'd just be splitting hairs about what is probably the greatest album ever recorded.  <br /> <br />I've honestly never heard anyone say, \\"I wish I wouldn't have bought Dark Side of the Moon.\\", or \\"Boy, that was a waste of Money.\\"  <br /> <br />So, do you own a copy. If not  buy it, listen to it, and enjoy it. And remember, it even makes the \\"Wizard of Oz\\"seem interesting. Now that's a great album. <br /> <br />

B00005JN0T|3.0|I gave it three stars because it's an OK popcorn flick. It's not a horrible movie. The story is pretty weak, but the effects and pacing are pretty enjoyable. Will Smith does a good job- I like his work, and the fights and chase scenes are fun. This reminds me of the more recent \\"Aeon Flux\\" movie- both films are based on wonderful original \\"properties\\" (a book and an animated series, respectively) that tried their best to squeeze through Hollywood's \\"blockbuster\\" nozzle. <br /> <br />As noted by previous reviewers, this film has little to do with book it shares its title with. Asimov was compelled to write his robot stories in the first place because he was tired of the \\"conquering robot\\" cliche as seen in \\"R.U.R.\\" <br /> <br />I think that Anne Robinson (Host of \\"The Weakest Link\\") would have been a much better casting choice for the role of Dr. Susan Calvin, but the script is so far from the book that it probably doesn't matter.
B000002HJA|3.0|Start off with This Kyuss Album, then go to the others, because if you like this one, you will really enjoy the other albums so much more. I usually try to encourage new listeners to pick up the weakest effort (which would be this one) from a band that they arent familer with, because if you can dig an album that is only average, then you will really appricate the band more. Kyuss is a must for \\"Stoner\\" metal and rock fans, and even though \\"and the circus left town\\" is only slighty above average (OK, I will give it 3 1/2 Stars) the other albums are much stronger..ENJOY
1401902197|5.0|I love this book and CD.  I wish I had more time to listen to it more often.  I highly recommend it.
0440224764|4.0|For some reason I found myself struggling with this one. It did not suck me in like his other novels. And, as others said, the ending was a bit of a disappointment (but not nearly as much as some people seem to think. gimme a break.) At the end of the day, it is still J.G., and still a pretty thilling ride, and I'm a big fan, so I give it 4.
0393327655|4.0|The author is as much an extremist as the religious extremists he is saying are so dangerous. While I agree with much of what he is saying, I disagree with his assertion that religion is inherently bad and dangerous (silly maybe, but dangerous?). And I think taking so strong a stance against one extreme only makes the supporters defensive and deepen their stance in their belief. The author should take his own advice about using reason and attempt to create reasonable discourse rather then inflame those with whom he disagrees. <br />All that said, I really liked the book and plan to read it again. I found it refreshing that someone was able to openly discuss opposition to religion. It is disturbing that in our so called Free Society it would be more socially acceptable to be a raciest then to express that you do not believe in god. <br />
B0001AP158|5.0|I have loved Bon Jovi for many years now, and I just saw them twice in concert (which was one of the best experiences ever, I'll now see them on tour every time they tour) They are by far my favorite all time band. I don't question when they come out with a new cd, I just buy because I own all they put out.  So when I bought This Left Feels Right, I wasn't impressed, thought they should have left the songs alone, and hardly listened to it.  Till I rented the dvd.  I loved it!  I realized that I had barely given the songs a chance, and when I did, saw what a cool alternative the songs are.  Granted, it is a big change, but there's nothing wrong with a little change to watch/listen to other than the normal stuff.  And for all those people who felt fooled by it and hated it, Stop Whining!  It's your fault you didn't read what it was all about, you could have downloaded some of the songs first to get a preview, plus they did a lot of publicity so the fans would know what to expect.  They did this for them, because they're comfortable with their music to experiment, and for the fans who would like the change of pace.  Good for them!  If you're a true Jovi fan, then at least give it a try!
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna has really impressed me with this album! First off, \\"S.O.S\\" is a killer dance song which has already achieved great success on the radio. And her second single, \\"Unfaithful\\" is a pretty slow song that showcases her voice.  What I like a lot more with this album compared to her debut, \\"Music Of The Sun\\" is that the slow songs work more on this album.  On her last album, all I could listen to were the dance tracks but everything else was mediocore.  With this album, Rihanna delivers on good R&B songs like \\"(P.S) I'm Still Not Over You\\" and \\"Final Goodbye.\\" <br />     The reggae songs are really catchy once again on this album.  \\"Dem Haters\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" show that Rihanna was born and raised in Barbados.  Overall, it is a catchy CD.  If you didn't like \\"Music Of The Sun\\" this is definitly a step up!
B000003TA4|3.0|First off, I will say that this isn't a bad album at all. Kurt Cobain wrote some great melodies and some great riffs, though they were simple. However, I don't see the \\"lyrical genius\\" that everybody raves about, plus they were hardly original. All Nevermind did was put a commercial gloss on a sound that had already been created by bands like the Pixies and Sonic Youth. The ONLY reason Kurt Cobain was EVER called a genius or \\"spokesman for his generation\\" was because he died young. Now the hype seems to be wearing off. The best things Nirvana did was open the door for other, better Seattle bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, and it gave us Dave Grohl.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild is a book that shows the reader what happens to an outdoor enthusiast who underestimates the sheer brutality of nature. What happens? Death. Was Chris McCandless death for nothing though like so many people claim? I will leave that up to you to decide but the thousands of perspectives from reviewers around North America is enough of an answer for me. Krakauer tries to address what type of circumstances and motives a person needs to have in order to pull off so many adventures like Chris McCandless did. There is so much left to the reader to decide in this book that it is certaintly worthy of being read. But remember, this book is not just about Chris McCandless, it is about the certain personal freedoms we need to live by or otherwise deal with constant monotony and stress. Just bring along more than rice.
B000000OQF|5.0|Most people believe that the much overrated Nirvana were the band that finally finished off glam metal. That may be true, but GnR dealt the first blow, with Appetite for Destruction's  raw, back to basics, Sex Pistols meets Aerosmith rock n' roll. As a previous reviewer state, many of these songs such as Welcome to the Jungle have been overplayed, but you have to understand how unbelievable this album sounded to teenage ears in the late 80's. It was literally like nothing else on mainstream radio at that time. Full of pissed off attitude and the awesome blues rock riffs that Slash ripped out of his Les Paul. GnR definitely took a turn for the worse with Use Your Illusion I and II, but this album is an absolute classic, and if this doesn't get GnR in the RnR Hall of Fame in a few years, then there is no God.
0312323859|5.0|This is fresh and original. It is chick lit but with pepper! Griffin finds a way to maintain a modern, streamlined voice while manipulating the story so it is not the regular rosy chick lit formula. The tension in the romance is great. Good read.
014100018X|3.0|This book is definitely girly but not silly.  Very typical plot, newcomer threatens the structure of the predictable society but the thoughts/letters of the priest are fascinating and the book is rather touching and not syrupy-sweet.  A nice weekender.
0385338686|5.0|She is so witty! I love this new story. Sophie again creates a book that is fast, smart and totally entertaining. I read this in a weekend. It is a great summer read. Sophie's style is so upbeat, it is the ultimate feel good novel.
0099450259|3.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an unconventional book in any respect. This is revealed first of all in the style the author Marc Haddon uses while showing the world from the point of view of an autistic adolescent, Christopher Boone, 15. Christopher`s character conveys various typical features of autism. For example, he doesn`t want to be touched and he has a paranoid behaviour and a schizotypical thinking. His bias to avoid contact with the \\"outer\\" world is stopped abruptly, when he feels obliged to solve the mystery of the curious killing of his neighbour`s dog Wellington. His interrogations and investigations lead him to severe and completely new experiences that change his life extremely and turn it up-side-down. <br />I for one liked the book quite well, as it afforded me some insight into a world that was absolutely alien for me. Due to the use of his special style, the plain sentences and the small range of vocabulary, Haddon creates an own authentic reality.  <br />Though I have to admit, that I didn`t expect any kind of a special ending, I liked the one in the book because it does not have an inappropriate happy ending. Marc Haddon wrote a moving and yet authentic novel that offers scenes, ideas and experiences that only few books do. <br />All in all it`s a very good book. Congratulations, Mr. Haddon.
B0002OERI0|5.0|After producing servicable Rock and Roll for better than a decade, Green Day steps up and gets mad.  With all of the spit of a \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" Neil Young and rage of a \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" Bob Dylan, Green Day produces their \\"London Calling.\\"  The definitive '00s protest album.
B00006EXL5|1.0|i bought this cd way back when i used to like mcr...and i picked this cd up<br /><br />like one person said, this cd is very immaturish. its lyrics, its vocals, its music. all sounds too garage bandish to me.<br /><br />at first i liked the difference, then it hit me that his voice wasnt any better than the new cd, if not worse.<br /><br />i cant believe i wasted my money on this.<br /><br />pass this up and buy Undoing Ruin by Darkest Hour instead.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I Loved Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did a phenomenal job as Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist two cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963. I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives-the only thing I have to say is that Anne Hathaway's hair looked very strange toward the later part of the film.<br /><br />Lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.
B00025ETIW|3.0|im gonna keep this short and sweet.<br /><br />while this cd DOES have good catchy songs like \\"im not okay\\" the band deserves credit where credit is due.<br /><br />Metalheads/hardcore fans, i need your attention if you have never listened to them; dont waste your time on this junk.<br /><br />i do admit, i liked them at first...then i realized that i was just fooling myself about liking them. this is not good music. this type of music just invites poseur bandwagon people along with Fall Out Boy, Hawthorne Heights, and the like.<br /><br />Pass this cd up.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I did not know too much about Johnny and June Carter Cash before going to see Walk the Line. When I left I was a reluctant fan.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon did a phenomenal job as the two lovebirds and I thought that they both did a great job singing in the movie as well considering neither of them had sung professionally before.<br /><br />At times the movie could be sad, sometimes a little boring, but the two actors made me believe that they really were John and June Carter Cash. The rest of the supporting characters were also very good and made this movie very nice to watch
1881273156|5.0|This book has made such a difference in my marriage. We've been married 10 years and have struggled through most of it to really connect with each other.  We didn't know it but we speak different love languages. Other reviewers have said that this book is too simplistic and stupid but if the ideas in this book were so simple and common sense, then why would SO many people say it was life-changing? If giving and receiving love in ways we both appreciate and understand were so easy, I'm sure the divorce rate would be much lower!  Yes, the concepts in this book are simple, but believe me, that doesn't mean they are worthless.  This book has helped me understand the way my husband needs me to show love is different than the way that comes naturally for me and vice versa.  In just a few short weeks things are dramatically different in my house and we both are finally FEELING the love the other has tried in vain to show for 10 years.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Wow!  I bought the new Rob Zombie album \\"Educated Horses\\" and I have listened to it countless times since it was released on 3/28.  I am still listening to it, thinking \\"Wow!!\\"  So I will start from the beginning and go through the album track by track.  I like the Intro, \\"Sawdust In The Blood\\", of course, but then I always think that Zombie's intros are great and set the mood for the rest of the album, and this intro was no exception.  It has a very ethereal and otherworldly sound, with an underlying beat that can be heard and felt throughout the remainder of the album.  The song \\"American Witch\\" follows the Intro.  This is the song that Zombie performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  I love the lyrics, and the samples are hot as always; I think Zombie is a genius when it comes to using samples of hot chicks moaning, and that goes for this song as well as the next track, \\"Foxy Foxy\\"!  Then comes \\"Foxy Foxy,\\" the lead single from the album.  This song is showcased early on, as is \\"American Witch\\" and it makes for a very interesting beginning for the album because both of these songs are more radio friendly and will appeal to the largest audience.  \\"Foxy Foxy\\" will inspire some hot and heavy graveyard grinding for sure, as it's the perfect mix of Zombies macabre lyrics and completely danceable music.  Song four, \\"17 Year Locust\\" has a very cool beat and the lyrics are very good too.  I like it quite a bit because 17 is one of my favorite numbers, and I would definitely like to see the lyrics and listen to this song on repeat for a while to figure it all out.  The fifth song, \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" is one of the two tracks on this album that really didn't jump right out at me when I first listened to it.  There is nothing really wrong with it, I liked the lyrics a lot, but I found the beat to be structured very strangely and I just didn't like its repetitiveness.  Now after a while, I think it is really good song with really good lyrics, and it just sounds betterin my car than it did on my laptop!  The interlude \\"100 Ways\\" comes next, setting the tone for the remainder of the album.  Following that interlude is \\"Let It All Bleed Out,\\" another song off the album that I am already familiar with and already am very fond of.  \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\" sounds a bit like older White Zombie, complete with ample creepy sounds, and a very interesting musical arrangement.  There is a quiet interlude that begins about 2 and a half minutes into the track that builds and builds to this amazing climax, after which the song just keeps pounding on.  \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\" has another great hook which Zombie delivers with stellar vocals, especially his roaring delivery of the lines, \\"Keep on screaming\\" and \\"Let it all bleed out.\\"  Then comes the seventh song of the album, \\"The Death Of It All\\" which after hearing the whole album is probably my favorite song.  It has a very quite, creepy, and wicked beat, as well as great lyrics and perfect delivery!  It gave me cold chills and I had to keep rewinding it and playing it over and over because it just grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  I fell in love with the lyrics of this song, especially the line that goes, \\"I am the brain, Some say insane, Blood is the rain, That's what life's about...\\"  I don't know, but this will probably be the defining track from this album for me!  The eighth track is the title track, \\"Ride\\" and it is very good and also reminds me of older White Zombie, most notably in the quiet, loud, quiet, and so on progression of the guitars and flow of the song.  The next song, track 9, \\"The Devils Rejects\\" is a great homage to the film Zombie made of the same name.  It begins with this crazy country guitar picking, which gives it an immediate eerie feeling.  The underlying country picking feeling stays throughout the entire song, making it stand out musically.  The lyrics of this song are really great, very demented and oh so awesome!  This was another of the stand out tracks to me onthis album and another track I can't wait to listen to over and over.  The final song before the Outro, song 10, \\"The Lords of Salem\\" has very good lyrics and great loud, crashing guitars, and just an awesome Zombie vibe to it overall.    The Outro ends the album in the way that we began with the Intro, it leads us out of the darkness we just visited in much the same vein, daring us to begin again from the beginning.  At only 38 minutes 29 seconds, this album is somewhat short but very, very fulfilling and totally satisfying!  This is a wicked album and it is completely listenable all the way through, over and over again; the sort of album in which there is no need for the fast forward button.  Personally for me, I found this album much more satisfying than \\"The Sinister Urge\\" or the \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\" soundtrack.  Everything on this album seems much fresher, I can definitely feel how Zombie has evolved as an artist, but at the same time I am not left wanting for what I have come to desire from him.  This album totally lives up to all my expectations, actually exceeding them a bit, and that is major since Rob Zombie is my favorite artist, which places my standards for him far beyond those for anyone else!  I would unquestioningly sell my soul for \\"Educated Horses\\"!
B0009NCQJ6|3.0|Okay folks I'm going to dare to be different here, and review this album for the music! Excuse the sarcasm, but I'm getting a little sick of reading Amazon reviews that are based on copy protection and sound quality. If you are going to buy something, how had is it to read the product description? And if you are going to complain about something as petty as sound quality, either upgrade you speakers or send the CD back. Come on folks these reviews are for the content! Having said all that here is my review for the CD.<br /><br />First of all, if you do not like a new take on classical music then none of Bonds work is for you. But on the other side of that, if you are adventurous and enjoy a new twist on the old you will very much enjoy their music. Yes they use a lot of DJ tricks in their music, but to me that is what makes it interesting! Traditional is wonderful and no one is knocking that, but these girls are just paying tribute in a much more unique way. Whether you feel it's a slap in the face is your business. But as I always say, if you aren't sure then listen to samples or borrow a copy from a friend, and make your decision based on your own likes and dislikes. Not what I or anyone else says. Everybody is different.<br /><br />Now as far as the content of this CD goes it's nothing new. I'm sorry to report but buying this CD is a waste of money if you are like me and already own every Bond CD to date. So basically it would be most cost effective for someone like me to just take my Bond CDs and copy the songs and make this album myself. I guess what I'm saying is there is no real motivation to buy this CD. It has no bonus material attached to it.<br /><br />However, if you are a first time Bond listener who can't make up your mind on what album to purchase then I hightly recommend this CD. It covers all your Bond bases and you wont be stuck with three or four CDs that you don't enjoy.<br /><br />My last comment on is yes the disk it copy protected. So if you only own a computer to play music on then don't purchase this release. There are however ways to get around that but those you will have to figure out for yourselves.So if you only own a computer to play music on then don't purchase this release.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a great collection by one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time and maybe ever, Guns N Roses. They rule, and are one of the most talented, and my favorite artists of all time. They just make great music. Let me take you to the compilation now. This is great but it is missing Rocket Queen, <br />and Mr. Brownstone. If those 2 were added, then it would be complete. The best songs on this album are Civil War, and November Rain, because they ROCK and are REALLY LONG. I think <br />there are several really great songs on this, I strongly recommend anyone to get this album because GNR changes your life FOREVER. Please ignore the junk albums from AC/DC, Aerosmith, & Queen and get this album with any Dire Straits, or Green Day, or <br />Appetite For Destruction from the same band. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great gnr are great.... <br />GNR ARE THE BEST..
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I owned an older CD of this from the 80s, one of his rocking-est albums and my favorite, along with \\"Delivery Man\\". The definitely superior sonic remaster (not a lot of obvious re-mixing for a change!), the bonus disc and informative liner notes really made this worth buying. I subsequently bought the other remasters with bonus discs, and now have a huge library of THE Elvis (as I heard him claim on a radio interview in 1977), with loads of demos, alternative versions and tasty goodies.

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Rihanna burst onto the scene last summer with the ubiquitous club hit, Pon de Replay. After that, none of her singles caught fire and it looked as if you would to the one hit wonder wing of the Hall of Fame. Luckily she didn't give up because with a little help from Soft Cell she looks like she will pull off the rare feat of have the summer anthem in consecutive. But the question is, will the album, A Girl Like Me, fall into obscurity much like here debut did as everyone seemed to download the hit single as opposed to the whole album? <br /> <br />To keep that from happening, her record company even withheld S.O.S. from the major downloading services in hopes that people would buy the album instead of the single when it came out. And surprisingly A Girl Like Me isn't absolutely horrible. The album eases you with the 80's influenced smash hit and I wonder if the Tainted Love sample isn't the only 80's thing about that song and the lyrics I'll be you \\"Take on me, take me on\\" are based on uber-80's anthems by A-Ha (she even says the band's name in the song). The next song, Kisses Don't Lie, even has an 80's touch with The Clash lyrics asking \\"Should I stay or should I go?\\" That is followed by the strong, piano and strings based Unfaithful a song about, you guessed it, being unfaithful. And even when the song goes over the top when she suggests, to keep him from hurting, to \\"take a gun and put it to his head\\" it just makes it that much more entertaining, although sadly she decides she \\"don't wanna be a murderer.\\" Oh well. <br /> <br />But the album quickly goes into some clich?s from there with We Ride. Personally I rather have my girls sugar and spice and the such and not hear her say \\"When we ride we ride, it's `til the day we die.\\" I really don't want my girl (another 80's reference alert) going down in a blaze of glory. Have we leaned nothing from When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong? This get back on track with the slow reggae jam Dem Haters with help with some dude named Dwane Husbands. Sean Paul shows up later Break it Off, which is better than anything on his latest effort unfortunately the beat isn't that good. <br /> <br />Everything else on the album is pretty much hit or miss, the acoustic guitar in Final Goodbye sounds like something Dan Fogelberg, which actually isn't a bad thing. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You) is as cheesy as the title would suggest. The album caps off with a remix of the failed single off Rihanna's last album, If It's Lovin' That You want with a beat stolen from another rap song that I can't quite pinpoint no matter how long I play the song and and a rap from Cory Gunz who may or may not be related to Peter Gunz who was last scene being sued by Steely Dan for lifting there hook for the great Uptown Baby. So think twice before Download S.O.S. and maybe give the whole album a chance.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I remember when I bought this album when I was 21. I was so excited to get this at the time. I liked most of the songs and some were so so or sucked.  I used to listen to this album pretty often, but I realized that these guys are really not that good. They lack a front man with any range, Chad writes elementary insipid lyrics, and they stick to the same formula. Silver Side Up is not a bad album by any means, but is it not all that great either. If you are going to buy a Nickelback album, get The State and maybe Curb. Avoid Silver Side Up and the rest that come after unless you are a die hard fan. If you are still a fan of Nickelback, it is time to see the light and do away with the mediocre formulaic outfits of the current era.

B000002H97|4.0|Some of Metallica's best songs are found here on their last great or even solid release. It is all downhill from here. Unforgiven is one of their top ten songs ever done in the catalog. The black album is solid from start to finish, but it never really blew me away like Ride the Lighting or Master of Puppets.  Enter Sandman was and is too overplayed and it is now dated.  Sad but True and Whenever I may roam suffer from the same fate.  Basically a great album, but not near as great as it is hyped up to be. Albums like Ten by Pearl Jam, Temple of the Dog, and Live's Mental Jewelry were all better releases in my opinion just to name a few.  Too bad Metallica would grow huge heads and transfrom into Moneytallica after this album.
0099450259|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night-time is a book which is written in an easy language, so that it isn't very hard to understand. I had a lot of fun reading because it is sometimes funny, but also emotinal. The author offered me a look inside an autistic person's mind and made me understand how autistics think and feel and why they do what they do. In my opinion the story could help persons who have to deal with autistics, because Haddon describes the feelings and the behaviour of an autistic very well. The fact that some autistics cannot read facial expressions makes me understand them better.He also points out that being touched makes an autistic feel uncomfortable, confusing and it sometimes even frightens them. All in all I enjoyed reading this book, because it helped me to put myself in the shoes of Christopher Boone. I think everybody who has to live with an autistic person or who only knows one should read this story, because after having finished the novel and having thought about it they might in some situation understand the disordered person.
B0007ZIYWY|5.0|This would be album number six (depending on your counting method) by the Greatest American Rock Band of the last 25 years.  This particular edition is a super-deluxe two-disc reissue of the album.  whether you're a fan of the original version or a curious newcomer, this is definitely the version to get, unless you have budgetary concerns, in which case the original will do just fine.  Still, my motto is: \\"if you're going to go for it, go all the way!\\"  I realize that's a moronic cliche, but in a country in which morons like Kevin Federline are more famous than Sonic Youth, sometimes it's rewarding to dumb down.  I'll save the lecture about the ethical implications stemming from this for later.  Now's the time for \\"Goo.\\"<br /><br />\\"Goo\\" found the band at the apex of their \\"pop culture can be fun\\" phase from the late 80's/early 90's, when they started dressing more fashionably (well, at least Kim Gordon did) and started storming MTV and the then-burgeoning alt-rock radio format.  It's also no coincidence that \\"Goo\\" was also the band's official major label debut (\\"Daydream Nation,\\" which was released by the indie Enigma, had major label distribution).  Thus begun their long association with DGC, an album that at one point was rumored to be called, um, a slang term also known as a \\"Lewinsky.\\"  The music was also getting slightly poppier as well.  Of course, for Sonic Youth, \\"pop\\" meant taking a standard verse-chorus-verse structure and slathering it with their trademark oddly-tuned and feedback-spewing guitars.  They also embraced pop-cultural themes, or at least those that resonated with them.  The album's lead single, \\"Kool Thing\\" reflected Kim's post-feminist fascination with the male bravado of hip-hop.  LL Kool J is referenced (\\"Kool thing/walking like a panther\\") and Public Enemy's Chuck D does a calculatedly brief guest vocal.  Then there's \\"Tunic (Song For Karen),\\" about the late pop idol Karen Carpenter, who died from complications from anorexia.  Rather than being a snide hipster mock-fest, it's sympathetic to her life and situation.  Later on, the band would record a cover of \\"Superstar\\" that was surprisingly restrained and touching (alas, it's not included here, but you can find it, along with videos for every \\"Goo\\" song, on the DVD collection \\"Corporate Ghost,\\" which makes a fine companion to this release).  Elsewhere, you'll find \\"Dirty Boots,\\" one of Thurston's most accesible rockers, and the classic Hollywood inspired throwaway \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (the video for which features A-list director Sofia Coppola years before her big breakthrough).  Lee Ranaldo's \\"Mote\\" is surely one of his best songs, and was to be the only one of his tracks to make the finished album.<br /><br />Which is part of the reason disc two is so essential.  Here you'll find an unfinished Ranaldo track, as well as \\"I Know There's An Answer,\\" a shockingly reverent Beach Boys cover.  Most important of all, however, is the original 8-track demos the band recorded for \\"Goo.\\"  These have been heavily bootlegged by fans--if internet file-sharing services had been around at the time, this material would have been swapped around like Fiona Apple's \\"Extraordinary Machine.\\"  What you have here is essentially an alternate version of the entire album in a much more raw, and rowdier, form.  Although the songs are mostly the same as the ones on the final product, these live-in-the-studio takes ooze more feedback and grit, and the vocals are more tossed-off and almost buried in the mix.  This, my friends, is the real \\"dirty.\\"  To be honest, and speaking as a huge slobbering Sonic Youth junkie, I kind of prefer this version, which in sound quality also compares with what I consider the band's best work, \\"Sister.\\"  The one (very slight) drawback is  the track order, which is completely different than the \\"official\\" version.  I guess that's only a problem if you're an anal retentive freak like yours truly, and CD'S are, of course, programmable.<br /><br />The deluxe package also includes an expanded booklet with photos not in the original package (check out Thurston rockin' a Roland Kirk t-shirt!) and an essay by music critic/SY friend Byron Coley.  Sorry kids, no lyrics, but those are, as always, on the band's extensive and very cool web site.  While the price may be a bit high (compare, if you will, with the just-as-overloaded reissue of Pavement's classic \\"Slanted & Enchanted\\"), the reward is well worth it.  So is the hearing loss you'll experience when you play it as loud as it should.es an expanded booklet with photos not in the original package (check out Thurston rockin' a Roland Kirk t-shirt!) and an essay by music critic/SY friend Byron Coley.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|My wife bought this DVD for me yesterday and it was awesome!  The animation is superb!  My only problem is that it jumped around a lot making it kind of hard to follow...hence the 4 star rating.   But for any FF fan, I highly recommend this DVD.
078681859X|5.0|Now I have read many books about wizards and magic, but this one is different. You have a smart-talking djinni who is modern and fresh. Bartimaeus is his name and he is the best thing about the book. You will not be able to put this book down and find yourself laughing at Bartimaeus's jokes or quotes at the bottom. I love this book; if you like a little comedy in your books, then read \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" :)
B000002GYI|4.0|Yes. Of course, the original trance music. The visionary electro-pop pioneers. The ur-blazers of the trails of the entire so-called Electronica...Amazing to think they'v done this quarter of a century back...It's a must for anyone who had ever read \\"Dilbert\\" or worked in the office cubicles! BUT---<br /><br />HUGE MINUS to this cd is the meagre, paltry and lazy \\"Elektra/Time Warner\\" presentation. What were they thinking? Not one word about the who, what, when, where and why these brilliant Teutonic androids (with a sense of humor be it said) were, and shall remain, so far-reaching.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel.    *** 1/4.    I've been eagerly awaiting this movie on DVD. I finally had the chance to watch it. The verdict - mixed.    First, Jay Hernandez. I work at a NBC affiliate so I recall his work on the kiddie show \\"One World\\". I got past that though after about 10 minutes in.    The first 35 minutes were hard to sit though. Here are some young men at the end of their college years trolloping around Europe. They are indulging in pleasures of the flesh at ever turn. So essentially the characters are after one thing - sex. I didn't like any of them. Well, Josh was ok because he at least knew this was pretty pathetic behavior. He went along with it because Oli and Paxton were ringleading.    The movie doesn't start to get interesting until Oli disappears. Then poor Josh gets it. The film ratchets up the suspense as Paxton now alone in the former Soviet Union wonders what the hell is going on.    When he is promised to be taken to where his friends are by some local call girl - then the real interesting things start. Appears there is a cottage industry in the town of kidnapping foreigners and using them as torture victims. The twist is the rich and affluent train or fly in and pay handsomely to enact thier torture fantasies. Many people in the town are in on this scheme because it brings home large sums of money.    The concept is shocking.    Paxton's escape I thought was plausable. Going back for the Japanese girl I thought was a stretch. I know it was noble, but in that situation it was risky. On top of that, the same girl with her eye hanging out and half of her face rashed. I doubt she'd have been as lucid as she was. Paxton's rescue of her was intended by the writers to add some light in the sea of humanity's lurid darkness.    This a rental movie plain and simple. Its no great piece of cinema. It does though - with its twist midway get you.    If you make it that far, then you'll probably come out of it with a view similar to mine.
0385338082|5.0|this book kept me up, unable to put it down! it was a little slow at first, but after about 50 pages i was hooked! i litterally took only about 3 days to read this book because i wanted sooo bad to know what was going to happen. i highly recommend!
1573223026|4.0|Hornby's other books didn't really appeal to me.  They just didn't seem to be up my alley, but then I stumbled upon this.  The jacket had a very intriguing description. <br /> <br />It talked about 4 strangers meeting up on a roof to commit suicide.  Now, that sounds increadibly coincidental, but he manages to make it work. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the humor in this, but as other reviewers have said, it does wear a little thin in some parts.  I did get some good laughts out of it though. <br /> <br />Now, I can't say I wasn't slightly hoping, but I wasn't really expecting them to kill themselves.  That would have been too different along with killing off the main characters.  But what keeps this from getting five stars is the fact that while the characters are so different, it's true what they say thoughout the book, there's no real reason for them to be friends.  I suppose there's a bond from nearly committing suicide, but still.  Also, there's no wrapped up ending, which is different in a good way, but the characters seem a bit two dimensional or flat.  Also, while not having cliche characters, the fact that everything, for the most part, seemed to work out, was just a bit disappointing. <br /> <br />Over all, a nice read, but I'd buy it in paperback.  Especially with these prices nowadays!
B000089RV6|5.0|Sexist? Yeah. Simple? Yeah. Fun? Yep! This is a loud, guitar driven, rift crunching monster. One of the best rocking albums of the last century.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I've been a fan since White Zombie. It's been awhile since his last, but I love the new album. It's a little different than the others, but it still kicks ass and yet the songs are very sexy. Songs to play for many occations. Devils Rejects by far is one of my favorite songs of all times.  Love it all!!!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I just loved this movie, it impressed me like no other movie had done it for a long time, thats why i bought the DVD, i just saw the featurettes and are great,and the movie looks great and sounds great.    My only complaints are:    -A lot of previews, but no Hostel trailers and TV clips, it would have been good to have them  -No Spanish subtitles, i am from venezuela and speak english so thats no problem for me, but other people cant, and its weird because ive bought other region 1 Dvds and they have spanish subtitles.    But overall a good DVD
B000000OAC|5.0|This was my first Queen album.  As soon as the radio started playing We Will Rock You, I needed this album.  I am still (30 yrs later) amazed at the sound on this recording.  Brian, Freddie and the guys really showed the world that rock was NOT DEAD!  If you look at the time (1977) we needed to be rocked, and that's what we got.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place. The premise is sillier than the first film (which was pretty silly itself), but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense. Enjoy the ride and try to forget that \\"The Lost World\\" ever existed.
B00005JOE8|4.0|Natelie Portman overacting, as usual (her diapason of facial and body expressions is staggeringly narrow and more than wanting) but the script, photography, effects and the rest of the cast are excellent. Highly recommended, just like the comic book.

0312955006|5.0|The Concrete Blonde by Michael Connelly provides the best of both worlds: a murder mystery that takes place within a courtroom drama.<br /><br />The Concrete Blonde opens with Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective Harry Bosch on trial for murder.  When Bosch shot Norman Church, he believed he was killing the Dollmaker, a serial killer responsible for the rape and brutal murder of eleven prostitutes in Los Angeles.  The Dollmaker's widow believes otherwise, and she sues Bosch in civil court for wrongful death.  Just as the trial is underway, another victim is discovered and this one was murdered after the death of Church.  This 12th victim was encased in concrete and is dubbed the Concrete Blonde.<br /><br />The Concrete Blonde casts a shadow on the trial and gives ammunition to the aggressive and scheming prosecuting attorney, Honey \\"Money\\" Chandler.  Is it possible that Bosch killed the wrong man?  Maybe there's a copycat killer.  Also, Chandler and the press have information that is being leaked from within the LAPD.  Whatever the case, the investigation is ongoing and the judge won't delay the trial to give Bosch time to solve the new murder.<br /><br />Connelly is one of the best mystery writers out there today, and his plots and characters reflect a realism that developed in his years of being a police reporter for the Los Angeles Times.  The Concrete Blonde was written after the LA Riots and Rodney King, and shows the darker side of this city of contrasts.  When Bosch tells his lawyer in the courtroom that he seeks the truth, he is lectured \\"And you're going to sit there and talk to me about truth?  When was the last time you saw a truthful police report?  When was the last time that you put down the unadulterated truth in a search warrant application?  ... The truth has got nothing to do with what goes on in here.  Neither does justice.  Just words I read in a law book in a previous life.\\"  But for homicide detectives, \\"the homicide squad wasn't a job.  It was a mission.  As surely as murder was an art for some who committed it, homicide investigation was an art for those on the mission.  And it chose you, you didn't choose it.\\"  So while Bosch may be cynical and jaded by his many years of wearing a badge, he can't give up his battle of good vs. evil.  But for as brilliant as Bosch is at solving cases, he's a bit of a cowboy and doesn't always follow rules, which often gets him in trouble with his superiors.<br /><br />Connelly is a talented writer, and The Concrete Blonde is one of his best books.  I'm now going to have to fill in the gaps with his other Bosch books.asn't a job.  It was a mission.

B00006GFAB|5.0|I must give a nod on my site, here, to kiss. since this album is chock-full of the best of kiss, i will thus toss this one into my eclectic mix of a review site, here, of the books, music, and movies i so appreciate - and any song that i recall hearing that literally caused me to turn around and  stare at the radio in wonder at what i was hearing definitely gets a top , all time favorite spot on my site. i think i was washing the dishes when i first heard one of kiss' early, trend breaking records . the stucture of the song, the voice, the sound ;  loved it. ( actually , it was \\"calling dr. love \\" .) also, i recently heard the kiss classic, \\"beth\\", playing quietly over the muzak system at the grocery store. that took me right back to the seventies...and i realized that \\"beth\\" -as well as kiss -has quite well stood the test of time.
B00005JOYA|3.0|Silent Hill has got to be the best video game movie yet.  It has what all video game movies should have.  Detail, atmosphere, story and characters from the game.  Every detail from the Silent Hill games have been taken into consideration.  The lighting, direction, cinematography and creature effects.  From the very beginning of the movie, references from the Silent Hill games are very noticeable.  The car journey, the crash, the missing daughter and the wondering into the haunted town to find clues.  The story is very basic and takes the plot directly from the first Silent Hill game.  The CGI and special effects I found were very good, with weird and horrible creatures looking very impressive.  Throughout, this movie is very entertaining and violent but far from scary.  The movie's soundtrack is very good as it sits perfectly with the tone and atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I would have liked this movie to be more frightening and eerie but its entertaining value still holds my attention with a good story and impressive laugh-out-loud climax.<br /><br />The critics have under rated this movie way too much, as they don't understand what Silent Hill is all about.  Thats because they have probably never heard or played the Silent Hill games before and judge this movie with confusion.  This is a good movie (not a great horror) and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />If your not a fan of Silent Hill games, you'll probably hate this but if you are a fan of Silent Hill, you'll love it.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a very entertaining CD.  I love it when two artists from different musical worlds collaborate.  Emmylou Harris has a sweet voice.  I think she  conveys such warmth with it  Mark Knopfler has a deep voice He conveys compassion and wisdom.  This is clearly evident on the title track All The Roadrunning.  This is an excellent song about the physical and emotional toil travelling can have on a person.  This track has a lovely sounding texture to it because the insturments sound perfect.  This is Us is a standout track.  It is  about the  fun memories of two people in love.  Beachcoming is another favorite track of mine on this album.  I think EmmyLou and Mark create very clear imagery of animals of kittens and seabirds in this song with their great vocals.  Red Staggerwing is a very upbeat tune.  The violin playing by Glenn Duncan gives this track such a lively quality.  I also liked the track Love and Happiness.  This is a lovely song about all the good intentions a person can have for someone they love.  If This is Goodbye and Donkey Town are two tracks about how loneliness is a part of life that everyone goes through.  Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is so good on these two tracks and on the entire CD.  All The Roadrunning is the best duet CD of the year so far.
B000002KD9|5.0|I started to buy Neil Young CDs about six months ago just because I felt I hadn't heard enough of him from his big days in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Bought \\"Everybody Knows,\\" \\"Harvest,\\" and \\"After the Gold Rush.\\"  I'm here to tell you that After the Gold Rush is a great album.  It sounds good right now.  It sounds much better to me now for some reason than 30 years ago.  The songs are not dated (to my ears), except for the country-rock style itself; the production very solid, and the style is spare.  Who else compares to him? <br /> <br />In fact this is a masterpiece album as far as I'm concerned, by far his best.  I measure these things by \\"number of good songs or moving songs\\" per album, and in my opinion, except for the Beatles and a few others, most top-flight artists or groups only manage three per album.  If there are more, you've got a great album.  This is one.  I play it over and over and it's not milked out yet.  Also, the songs are short--good and short.  A good combination. <br /> <br />There must be something in the air about Neil Young now, because Letterman a few months ago said on his show he wanted him on.  Then I read that Conan had him on his late show for a whole week in November 06--wish I'd seen it, but didn't know about it.  Saw the movie \\"Heart of Gold\\" about live performance of \\"Prairie Wind\\" in Nashville, which was very good.   <br /> <br />But After the Gold Rush is above just about everything else in my book.  Only the best albums by other artists can compare to it.  It is a gem.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I watched the show recently on the PBS and have recorded it on my DVD disk.  I'm buying one for permanent collection so that I can keep a piece of heaven handy without the people constantly urging me to call for support. <br /> <br />My advice: If you miss this greatest show on earth, you miss a lot of fun in life and you have all my sympathy, poor guys and gals.  The chubby-faced Chloe Agnew is only 16 in this concert and she certainly reminds people that there really are angels on earth.
1563898586|5.0|The book was great!  I thoroughly enjoyed both the artwork and the writing.  This comic takes historical fiction to a new level, both writing fiction in a historical context, and drawing from characters and events in fiction from the past.  I particularly liked the references to Sherlock Holmes, as well as Jekyll and Hyde, Capt. Nemo, et. al.<br /><br />The story is very good, but this is not a book for children.  Adults and teens will love it.
1400079179|4.0|No doubt about it.  Dan Brown knows how to pen a novel.  The Da Vinci Code has all the elements of a great novel.  But truth and facts are distorted and insinuated in this story (big deal, that's what FICTION means).  So if you approach this story as a work of fiction, then it is okay.  But if you truly believe Dan Brown is trying to tell us something more, well, I think you may need to investigate the claims in this book a bit further.<br /><br />But see, us Christians, well we actually believe the Bible to be true.  We believe Jesus did what the Bible tells us.  Yeah, I know we are a bit over the edge, but that's what we believe.  So it is understandable that some Christians view this novel as an attack on our faith.  I just think that Jesus is much more powerful than any fiction novel, so I feel no need to attack Dan Brown's work.<br /><br />I hope that Dan Brown's novel inspires people to read other Christian fiction works like that of Frank Peretti, Randy Alcorn, or C.S. Lewis.<br /><br />See ya next review.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Loud, expensive, computer-generated \\"event\\" movies do little for this viewer, but Peter Jackson's twenty-first century remake of the 1933 \\"King Kong\\" sets this movie apart from the rest of its peers. The 1933 classic had crude special effects and even a vaguely racist undercurrent, but Jackson's signature touch could very well make this \\"Kong\\" the definitive version. You know the story: a filmmaker desperate for a hit (Jack Black) recruits a struggling up-and-coming actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to star in what he hopes will be his blockbuster smash movie. He tricks her and screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into jumping on a ship to Skull Island where they badly clash with the natives who capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong: an enormous 25-foot gorilla. Surprisingly, Kong bonds with Ann, while a frantic search is made to find her while fighting off dinasoars, abnormally large insects, and other creatures. Jackson piles on the action relentlessly, and the special effects are nothing short of thrilling. Kong himself, generated from computer graphics and modeled after actor Andy Serkis, looks amazingly real, quite unlike the cardboard image of the 1933 original. But while this version towers over the 1976 remake, a couple scenes aren't quite believable, such as the moment where the crew frantically races with a pack of dinasoars and end up unharmed. Sorry, I didn't buy it. Other than that, this \\"Kong\\" is very much worth your time. It packs a wild punch and it deserved its three technical Oscars.
B0002EQ7EC|4.0|... the packaging is what earns this a 4-star review.  Paul Simon's music in \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" is top-notch, as are the vocals and track assembly. <br /> <br />\\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" is a CD full of wonder and delight - it is an arrangement of music that is certain to leave a smile on a person's face.  And yet, my purchase of this CD - at a price much higher than I'd usually pay for a CD by other artists - leaves me feeling cheated.  Read on for the full story. <br /> <br />I would caution buyers to a fact that I did not have access to when purchasing this album - buying music CDs has changed even from the late 1990s.  Gone are the days of jewel cases and fold-out lyric sheets with artist bios and such; \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" as well as \\"Graceland\\" comes in a cardboard sleeve.  While honestly being unable to say if there exists a fold-out lyric sheet *inside* the cardboard (as I've not yet worked up the nerve to open the fragile-looking case), there really seems to be a definitive trend towards this kind of packaging in recent years. <br /> <br />The 4-star review has NOTHING to do with either Amazon or Paul Simon, but rather (likely) the record label distributing the media.  As mentioned above, the trend here seems clear and this trend serves to stymie new music purchases - just as my parents have Lps from the 60s, I too would like to keep my purchased music CDs indefinitely.  I view the packaging transition and global reduction in \\"add-ons\\" within the retail package as running contrary to this end.  The one way to assure the inclusion of the material seems to be through buying well-looked-after used CDs, and there has been a rather aggressive movement in the United States to halt the sale of used audio and video media. <br /> <br />In summary - \\"caveat emptor\\"... because buying a compact disc these days for $12 doesn't get you nearly as far as buying a $10 CD did in the late 1990s.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|It's been the butt of many jokes, often told by people who have never seen the movie.  But the truth is, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two men (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) who get a gig as shepherds at (where else?) Brokeback Mountain (based in Wyoming but filmed in Alberta).  Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.  They swear it's a one-time thing, but in reality, they try to carry on a twenty-year affair unbeknownst to the wives they eventually marry (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway).  The beauty of \\"Brokeback\\" is that it doesn't take sides or cast judgement.  Ang Lee lets you feel each of the character's pain, frustration and anxiety.  We sympathize with Jack's longing, and we witness Ennis struggling to balance both a family and the man he so desires.  We also ache with Ennis' wife Alma (Williams), who can't even begin to grasp the words to describe what she sees when she catches her husband kissing another man from her window.  For her, it seems, homosexuality is completely outside her realm of understanding.  But \\"Brokeback\\" wouldn't stand tall without its performances, which are collectively outstanding.  What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40-odd-page short story (written by Annie Proux) and stretched it to a movie that runs for over two hours.  Rush-released shortly after the Oscars, this DVD somewhat skimps on the extras (no director's commentary, for instance).  Still, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a beautifully told movie than lingers in your head long after the final credits roll.

B00005AQE8|5.0|If there is one name that comes to mind when one thinks of martial arts, it is Bruce Lee.  Likewise, if there is one name that comes to mind when one thinks of rap, it is Tupac Shakur.  Why is this exactly?  Well, when it comes to 2Pac and Bruce Lee, they were untouchable, and were masters of their mediums of expression.   <br /> <br />Okay that is enough about Bruce Lee (this is supposed to be a review about a 2Pac CD afterall), but I've stressed my point enough I think.  But why exactly was 2Pac so great a rapper?  Well, for starters his beats were always strong.  A HUGE pet peeve of mine when listening to rap is beats that sound awkward or clunky that don't mix with the rapper's own lyrical flow.  Tupac's beats always flow well with his lyrics.  And speaking of lyrics, 2Pac remains one of, if not the, single greatest rap lyricist ever (the only rapper I would consider close to Tupac when it comes to lyrics is Nas, but he is always hit or miss, while I believe 2Pac's skill was more consistant).  His tracks range from hardcore gangta rap, to catchy dance hits, to thoughtful lyrics about poverty, death and politics, and even to the occasional track meant to make you laugh.  2Pac was perhaps the most intelligent and energetic man to ever grace the rap genre, and all fans of rap should already have this CD as part of their collections.  However, if you are not usually a fan of rap but you are open minded enough to try something new, I still highly recommend this album.  However, those new to Tupac Shakur should probably check out his \\"Greatest Hits\\" Album first.  It is packed with some of his best tracks and is probably a better introduction to 2Pac than this CD is.
B0002IQEHI|4.0|Starting with a pale-green Leo the Lion (the trademark of MGM), Saul Bass creates a vibrant title sequence, seamlessly transitioning from an animated crisscrossing of animated black lines to a real-life skyscraper reflecting the bustling traffic of New York City below, all accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's most underrated musical score. This splendidly sets the stage for the fast-paced action of the film set to follow. It is here we meet Roger Thornhill, the protagonist of our story, played charismatically by Cary Grant, as he rushes to a business luncheon, dictating his memos to his secretary who is feverishly trying to keep up with him. Even from this brief encounter we can sense that Thornhill has an air of confidence about him (too much perhaps) and acts frivolously and boorish to anyone other then himself. To his loyal secretary he sums up the seemingly unethical life he leads, \\"Ah, Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie. There's only the expedient exaggeration. You ought to know that\\". It is ironic therefore that he should later be so trusting of Eve who in turn deceives him through `false advertising' and leaves him betrayed by her `expedient exaggerations'. <br /> <br />As Thornhill arrives for his business luncheon at the famous Plaza Hotel, he remembers that his mother is playing bridge at a friend's house at that very moment and she can not be contacted at home as he has instructed his secretary to do (to reminder of a play they are attending that evening at the Winter Garden Theatre). Unfortunately he remembers this small detail just as the taxi carrying her pulls away. A little annoyed, he shrugs it off and goes inside. It is however this minor detail that will set off a chain of events which will ultimately lead him to a ledge on Mount Rushmore, far from his laidback world in New York City. Before he conducts business with his clients at lunch, he calls for a busboy the precise moment a page for a Mr. `George Kaplan' is announced over the hotel's PA system. Two henchmen laying in wait for this `Kaplan' assume Thornhill is the man they are looking for and as soon as he walks away from his table to send a telegram to his mother, they grab him and take him off in a car to their boss's headquarters. <br /> <br />Grant's dry wit and acid humor is the driving force of this picture and it works expediently well. Upon hearing of a dinner party at the Townsend residence as he is dragged by the two henchmen to their boss's office he exclaims, \\"By the way, what are we having for dessert?\\" And when he is confronted by a man who claims to be Lester Townsend (later we learn that he is actually a foreign spy named Philip Vandamm who has taken up residence at the UN diplomat's home for the time being) about what he, or rather what Mr. Kaplan, knows he replies, \\"Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theatre this evening, to a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that\\". A tall glass of bourbon is then forced upon, making him entirely bombed. The two henchmen then plan to place him in a car and have Mr. `Kaplan' drive himself off a cliff. Things don't go quite as planned and somehow Thornhill is able to grab control of the wheel and drive manically through oncoming traffic. This as well as the booking scene which soon follows are classic. Seeing Grant, an actor notorious for his serious demeanor, pretend he's drunk is priceless. <br /> <br />Hitchcock manages to truly put himself into the mindset of his audience. Having just watched Thornhill weave intoxicated in and out of traffic, the precise moment we query to ourselves as to where a police officer is during all of this, a police car's sirens blare as he is in pursuit of Thornhill. <br /> <br />Having been made a fool of by his abductors (when Thornhill returns to the Townsend residence with his lawyer, mother, and two police detectives in tow to investigate his claim, Mrs. Townsend - in reality Vandamm's sister - greets Roger Thornhill as Mr. Kaplan and coyly insists that Kaplan became quite drunk at their little dinner party the other night), he returns to the Plaza Hotel and breaks into Mr. Kaplan's hotel room to see who this man truly is. He is then chased by the same two henchmen who abducted him the night before from the hotel to the United Nations Assembly Building where Lester Townsend works. However the man he meets is not the same man who had him abducted at the Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, a knife is thrown into the back of Mr. Townsend (presumably aimed for Roger Thornhill but missed) and coincidently (wink-wink) a photographer is right there in the Assembly Building to `capture' Thornhill holding the murder weapon in his hand and standing over the victim's body. Not only does Thornhill have to track down this George Kaplan and figure out why these foreign spies want him disposed of, he must also clear his name of a murder he did not commit, all while avoiding the detection of either the police or the foreign assassins. <br /> <br />After learning that Kaplan is headed for the Hotel Ambassador East in Chicago, Illinois, Thornhill decides to pursue this mysterious man and clear him name. In a quick call to his mother Thornhill tries to convince her that for a man on the run from the law traveling by train is safer then flying. \\"Well, because there's no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me...oh, you want me to jump off a moving plane?\\" which is of course a foreshadowing of the famous crop-dusting sequence later on. Recognized by the sales clerk working at the ticket counter booth, he successfully sneaks aboard the train destined for Chicago and is concealed from detection by the police by a platinum blonde bombshell named Eve Kendell, played scintillatingly by Eva Marie Saint, who he bumps into on his way aboard the train. <br /> <br />The two meet again a few moments later at dinner (we later learn that Eve tipped the waiter five dollars to seat him with her if he entered the dining car). Roger and Eve, perceptibly attracted to one another, exchange sexual innuendos over dinner. She reveals to Thornhill that she knows exactly who he is and what he is accused of, but she doesn't care. He asks her why. She responds, \\"It's going to be a long night\\" and that she doesn't \\"particularly like the book\\" she's started. Inquiring as to whether he has picked up on her sexual proposition, he replies, \\"Uh, let me think. Yes, I know exactly what you mean...\\" She then invites him to her drawing room in Car 3901 (a reference of course to Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps which this film is modeled after) where further double entendres are made by the two lovers to make the censors squirm. As they kiss passionately, she lets him know that she's `a big girl' to which he responds, \\"Yeah, and in all the right places too\\". Wanting to know more about him, acknowledging his taste in clothes and food, he quickly retorts, \\"...and taste in women. I like your flavor\\". However, Hitchcock bows to the censors and forces Thornhill to sleep on the floor.  <br /> <br />Easily one of the most identifiable sequences not only of director Alfred Hitchcock's career but in all of motion picture history, the crop-dusting scene in North-by-Northwest is magnificently choreographed to the hilt. Roger Thornhill, traveling by bus so as to ensure that he is alone, is led to a desolate cornfield in Illinois under the pretext that he will be Kaplan. In reality this is merely a bluff, a plot by the foreign spy organization to lure Thornhill into a false sense of security and eliminate him with the least amount of witnesses as possible. However, Hitchcock does not simply deliver the sequence to the audience, Heaven no. He builds us up with excitement and anticipation when the moment finally arrives. He does so by having Cary Grant stand alone on a deserted dirt road while cars pass by occasionally. Does Kaplan actually exist? If so, will he show? And then what? The tension builds. Suddenly a car drops a man off on the other side of the dirt road and takes off. Is this Kaplan? Hitchcock couldn't make it that easy, could he? He must be an assassin then. But before we even have time to query our suspicions, the man points out to Thornhill that the crop-duster across the way is dusting a field with no crops. As soon as the man boards a bus and is out of sight, the crop-duster proceeds to terrorize Thornhill by running him down. He hides in the cornfield to no avail; the plane sprays the crops with poisonous pesticides, forcing Thornhill out into the open. Thornhill successfully flags down a gasoline truck just in the nick of time, causing the crop-duster to swerve out of control and crash head-on into the gasoline truck, creating a marvelous explosion. <br /> <br />After tracking down Eve at the Hotel Ambassador East, the same hotel George Kaplan was suppose to be staying at (`Kaplan' supposedly checked out a full two hours before Eve called his hotel room and claimed that she had arranged a meeting between him and Thornhill - the encounter with the crop-duster in the cornfield), he pursues her to an auction where he is confronted by Vandamm and his two henchmen. He provokes a fight and uses the police escort to escape Vandamm's henchmen who were lying in wait for him. He is then taken to an airport where a kindly ol' man referred to as the Professor brings him up-to-date on the situation (Eve, Vandamm's lover, was recruited by the C.I.A. to spy on Vandamm who in reality is a foreign spy trafficking government secrets in and out of the country - `importer/exporter' as the Professor refers to his occupation as which is a coy reference to `The Man Who Knew Too Much'). Realizing Eve may be exposed and presumably killed by Vandamm, he flies out to Rapid City, confront Eve, and pretends to be critically wounded by her (a gun loaded with blanks) so as to convince Vandamm Eve isstill on his side. <br /> <br />Leonard, one of Vandamm's henchmen, doesn't trust Eve and for good reason. Vandamm on the other hand believes him to be jealous of his mistress, clearly a homosexual allusion. \\"You know what I think? I think you're jealous. No, I mean it. I'm very touched, very\\". Leonard then exposes Eve for the fraud she is, firing her gun with blanks straight at Vandamm. He is of course left unharmed but stunned and (emotionally) hurt. He knows what he must do, choosing to throw her off the plane as soon as they are over water.  <br /> <br />The crescendo of crescendos in North-by-Northwest is the chase scene on top of (what appears to be) Mount Rushmore (but because the government would not allow the famous director to shoot such a sequence on top of a national monument, gigantic busts created on a soundstage out in California and rear projections were used instead). The film ends with a scene in which Eve, dangling dangerously over the edge of Mount Rushmore, struggling to hold on to Thornhill's hand transitions immediately to him pulling her up to their compartment bed aboard a train heading east after they are married. It properly sums up the entire atmosphere of the film - sadly and deliciously absurd (to quote the federal agent earlier in the film, \\"It's so horribly sad. How is it I feel like laughing?\\").
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD is hypnotic. I can't help myself from repeating tracks over and over again. <br /> <br />The confluence of Knopfler's guitar (best living guitarist in my opinion) and Emmylou Harris's magnificent voice create a magical experience. <br /> <br />Will rank up there at the end of the day with some of Knopfler's best. <br /> <br />Great lyrics, orchestration, musicality. <br /> <br />Wonderful!
B00005OMTT|4.0|LSD is a very good compilation comprising the best of the past Enigma CD's and adding a brand new track to lead off.  Enigma has been a favorite of mine since I first heard MCMXC a.D. in 1990.  I still consider the first and 3rd CD the best however the new single is pretty good.  This compilation will please new listeners of Enigma and satisfy current fans. Also other great and similar to style of Enigma CD's are by artists: Delerium, Digital Moodz and Amethystium.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|taking place two years after the events of the Final Fantasy VII video game, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children reunites us with Cloud Strife, who has since given up saving the world for the life of a motorcycle-riding package courier. but Cloud has been inflicted with a deadly illness called Geostigma, an ailment that now plagues many of the citizens of Edge, the remnance of the formerly bustling metropolis Midgar.    but Geostigma is not the only looming threat. a trio of silver-maned strangers named Kadaj, Loz, and Wazoo arrive, searching for the remains of Jenova, the alien being who nearly wiped out humanity thousands of years ago and whose DNA led to the creation of Final Fantasy VII's iconic villain, Sephiroth. The terrible trio want to use Jenova's cells to revive Sephiroth, and it's up to Cloud to once again step up and save the world from total destruction.    the CG is gorgeous, the voice capture is adequate (this film wasn't made primarily for American audiences, so it can be forgiven) the action is fast-paced and amazing. this is one feature the gravity-defying Matrix-style anime action isn't out of place, since it would be extremely hard to duplicate the number-based battles from the games in a thrilling, visually-stimulating way.     people unfamiliar with the games will find the CG astounding, but will probably not be able to understand the story since it relies quite heavily on the events from the game. but unlike other movies adapted from video games, this film wasn't made to appeal to theatergoers unfamiliar with the games, nor was it made just to bilk money from gamers by making a film with only some passing relation to the game and just slapping the game's name on it.     there's a reason why this film went directedly to DVD - it's a \\"thank you\\" from the makers of the game to the fans who made the game and its characters so popular. they even dedicate the movie to the fans at the beginning and thank them at the end. if you haven't played the game (and why haven't you? it's only considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever made and the video game equivalent to the original Star Wars), it certainly helps to play it first to familiarize yourself with the backstory if you wish to understand most of what is going on.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This is by far, the best video game based movie I have ever seen! The fight scenes make the Matrix look like Barney's playpen. And the animation is perfect, I'm talking photo-realistic here. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 10 is because Sephiroth didn't get near enough screen-time. Sephiroth is my favorite game (and now movie) character of all time, and he only got 7 and a half minutes in the whole movie! Oh well, it's still an awesome movie though. <br />P.S. If any Sqaure-Enix employees are reading this, do you think you could make an action-rpg based on Sephiroth's backstory, we already know Cloud's front and back. I guarentee it will sell millions of copies. Bye!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|There's two ways to watch this one, as a live action version of the animation or as a production of its own, in isolation from the cartoon.<br /><br />As a live action version of the MTV cartoon: it's very different.  It would be better to describe it as 'inspired by' rather than use the same title.  You can see gimmicks and vignettes from the animation series,  but it is not the same plot or story line, and it is not a continuation of the cartoons.<br /><br />Taken as a discrete cinema production, it is a pretty darn good action/sci-fi flick!  What the story couldn't carry,  the action did, and when the action faltered, the story got engaging.  Trevor Goodchild is considerably toned down from the cartoon, and much more human.  He leads a government that is more concerned with its own continuation than the good of its members, and is trying to resolve issues from his personal life in the process.<br /><br />  Charlize Theron as Aeon...  She is a remarkably pretty woman, and has the grace and the moves for the role, but is model/Hollywood skinny :(<br /><br />  If she'd put on 20-30 lb of muscle and go up to about 15% body fat she'd have been perfect, much more plausible for the role.<br /><br />  Aside from this bit of personal bias, she carried off the intensity of a fanatic remarkably well.<br /><br />Over all: One very good movie!  Enough action and plot twists, stylish and well acted.
0345441184|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is a fantastic, magical and spell-binging story about a woman named Morgaine who just happens to be the sister of King Arthur. This is one of my favorite versions of the King Arthur legend. It is full of myth and magic, spirituality and power, and struggle and triumph. This story is told from Morgaines point of view who encouraged the king's rise but also schemed for his fall. It is a breathtaking story full of love and turmoil and you'll never put it down. It is on my top ten favorite book list! I love it!
B00005JNQA|2.0|In the DVD bonus materials, Sydney Pollack admits that casting and shooting on this film started without a script.  His comments suggested that this movie was written as they went.  All the silly plot and character twists are proof that approach was taken to this movie, start to finish.<br /><br />The Interpreter starts quickly, suspensefully, gets bogged down in the middle, and has a corny, boring ending.  The first hour of the movie is promising.  The second hour is almost regrettable.<br /><br />What derails it is the forced twists and turns that only make sense due to the injection of a (rather uninteresting) back story.  Because I do not want to spoil the entire film, I'll leave out details.  Suffice it to say, the movie would have been better had it followed the plotline suggested very early on, i.e. that Nicole Kidman's character, Silvia Broome, simply stumbled upon an assassination plot.  Instead, her past is tied in with the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood writers and/or directors these days cannot resist bringing multiple subplots together to (artificially) create suspense.  Not every so-called \\"action thriller\\" needs an ironic climax.  Most films in that genre do not seem to use the device particularly well -- most seem to overuse it -- and The Interpreter is one such film.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman does a great job with the character and \\"script\\" but her character is ridiculously improbable.  At the risk of giving away too much, a person of Ms. Broome's (political/activist) background would never get a job as an interpreter at the UN.<br /><br />Sean Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is interesting and well-played, but he seems more New York City detective, maybe low-level FBI, than Secret Service Agent.  Looking at him on the screen you can almost smell the alcohol on his breath.  While clearly a bright guy that knows his job, Keller does not seem like the buttoned-down, highly-disciplined prototypical Secret Service agent.<br /><br />The portrayal of the UN as a body that is greatly concerned about \\"genocide\\" in Africa rings hollow.  In reality, the UN has sat by idly while various African nations have torn themselves apart through civil war, inter-tribal fighting, genocide, political corruption, AIDS, and a score of other ills.  Given the reality, Pollacks' UN lovefest is puzzling to say the least.ed prototypical Secret Service agent.   <br /> <br />The portrayal of the UN as a body that is greatly concerned about \\"genocide\\" in Africa rings hollow.

B00004R99F|5.0|The very first time I saw this movie was while I was on a baby sitting job. The kids kept insisting we watch \\"goofy movie! goofy movie!\\" at first I was like \\"Oh great, another little kids movie...\\" but from the very beginning of the movie I was laughing. This is a great movie!<br /><br />Six years had past since then and I hadn't seen it in a while until it came on the Disney Channel. Upon seeing it again I knew I had to own the movie.<br /><br />The plot is sweet, and though Max shows obvious resentment towards his fathers \\"goofy-ness\\" and the obvious effect it has on him too, you get the sense that he really does love his father, he just forgot how to show it.<br /><br />I give the movie a 5, because I value family relationships over and above ANYthing else in a movie. Sure it was funny, but the family qualities in this movie are great.
B0007OCG56|3.0|Perhaps it's Adam Sandler that you want to see in `Spanglish,' James L Brooke's culture-clash drama. Yes, Sandler is surprisingly good with understated acting. He is good enough to make us forget his terrible near career-killing turn in `Little Nicky,' but let me remind you that this film is one of his recent attempts to undo his traditionally accepted image as comedian doing mainly madcap persona. This is not `The Wedding Singer' and it is meant that way. <br /> <br />Young Mexican girl Christina (Shelbie Bruce) recounts how she and her beautiful mother Flor (Paz Vega) arrive at the Clasky Family and their gorgeous house in LA (it's `economy class,' she says), where Flor starts to work as a house keeper for a nervous and obsessive mom Deborah (Tea Leoni). Flor cannot speak English, but the fact is not a big problem among this dysfunctional family - see incredibly patient daddy John (Adam Sandler) first-rate chef so devoted to the family that he cannot say what he should to his nagging wife.   <br /> <br />Flor is after all a capable housekeeper, and of very affectionate disposition for that matter, so John is gradually attracted to her while to her dismay her daughter Christie is drawn to the rich life of the Clansky Family. Though the film gives some interesting supports, especially from deliciously off-beat comic performance as a retired jazz singer from Cloris Leechan, the budding romance between Sandler and Vega lacks chemistry, and is concluded with unconvincing ending. <br /> <br />I know this is a matter of taste, but I found Tea Leoni's acting as the frivolous, self-obsessed mom interesting at first, but her constant one-note yelling and mugging gradually became annoying and irritating as the story went on. The character played by Leoni, who is better in recent `Fun with Dick and Jane,' gets alarmingly close to being monstrous. <br /> <br />But if something or somebody should be praised for her freshness, naturalness, and most of all, radiating charms, PazVega should be the real star of `Spanglsih,' which, though well-intentioned and sporadically funny, is curiously devoid of the originality, or the quirky charms of the characters Brooks has been good at creating. The film is largely well-acted, and also amusing enough thanks to some of the one-liners, but everything about the characters looks oversimplified. And I totally disagree with the stilted and unnecessarily soapy ending.

B00005K9QP|5.0|When one thinks of Clapton, they must try to remember him fondly. I'll be the first to admit that I'd rather shoot myself or eat my own arm than listen to one of his new albums; but this album is truly amazing. The vocals of Mayall are truly exceptional as always. The band is great, but what really stands out is Clapton; he plays like a man on fire. The guitar playing is so passionate, so sublime; Clapton plays on a different level on this album, a level that would he would only surpass on the untouchable Layla album. Every track is great and the overall feel of the album is well-established. Truly a great blues album that I would reccomend to anyone, even people that shy away from the now artistically dead Clapton.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie is actually pretty good - it was amazing to see how the jedi were during their prime! The lightsaber sequences were just amazing, and like nothing that we saw in the previous trilogy. The story was interesting, for the most part, and of course, the special effects were spectacular.  <br />Now for the bad: too much jar jar. Lucas needed to tone him down a bit. He was far too overbearing in this flick and his comedic relief was really not comedic, and really no relief! The acting in this one definitely needed work, but I think the problem was related more to Lucas' awkward dialogue and not a reflection of the actors themselves.  <br />Overall, I can get past those issues. The new movies certainly lack the charm and emotions of the original trilogy, but they are still superior to most sci fi films that are out there.  <br />One more thing - I keep reading how people felt that this movie was racist. I suppose that if you are looking to be offended, you will find 'racism' everywhere, even in a star wars movie.

B000002P5W|5.0|Yup. That's right, I gave an album with an average review of 5 stars the label \\"uderrated\\" and, compared to it's predecessor and successor, it is. No doubt Are You Experienced, the greatest debut album in music history, and Electric Ladyland the highpoint in Hendrix's career deserve every ounce and more of the credit they receive. This album though, is sometimes overlooked. On this album, Hendrix's already good songwriting is taken to another level and the man known to be such a hard rocker writes some songs, such as Little Wing and Castles Made of Sand, that are a million times sweeter than all of the teen bop pop whatever the heck that junk is called combined. Thought Hendrix couldn't get any better at guitar? His playing improves at a rate that is scary between the debut and this. I play guitar professionally and still the rhythm parts on some of these songs are enough to drive one to intense frustration (when trying to play them, to listen to, they are pure joy). So this wasn't the debut that broke down every musical barrier, nor was it the magnum opus, but it was/is one tremendous album that deserves to stand on the pededestal with the other two Experience masterpieces.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|For those of you who loved the 1995 BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth (I'm an avid fan myself), please don't shy away from this utterly gorgeous rendition of Jane Austen's classic.  It isn't an improvement in any way on the 1995 version; it's simply a different interpretation that demonstrates how much richness Austen's book held, with which future adaptations could work.<br /><br />Where the 1995 version is, I believe, more faithful to the book's dignified, staid and old-fashioned but universal tone, this version sparkles with the eagerness and blunt sincerity of youth.  Miss Elizabeth Bennett still is a mature young lady, but she is much more fun-loving and a little less confident than Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth.  But both versions are beautiful.  Keira Knieghtly brings a suprising depth of thoughtfulness to her role, whereas Jennifer Ehle brought a maturity that was beyond maternal to hers.  Where Jennifer Ehle stressed Elizabeth as the lofty standard of reason, poise and discernment, Keira Knieghtly stresses Elizabeth's honest, refreshing, witty and intelligent manners.  Both adaptations are superbly rendered.<br /><br />The scenery in this version was also stunning - you should see this film for that alone.  The scenes are also very cleverly shot, with novel imagery that draws you into this by-gone period.  I walked out of the cinema feeling as though I had just landed back into the 21st century; that's how real it was.<br /><br />I also really appreciated the broodiness underlying this film.  There was a moody, cloudier aspect to the scenery that brought a pensive thoughtfulness to the production.  I felt as though I were really in England.  In the BBC 1995 production, every day was sunny.  The play of the natural elements in this version formed an intricate background to the tumult of inner emotions that the film portrayed so finely.  This film could be analyzed over and over for the many different threads its makers very skilfully used to weave a rich, gorgeous tapestry of an experince.<br /><br />You will be transported.gorgeous tapestry of an experince.      You will be transported.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This album is almost like mostly acoustic hard rock. The feeling, the lyrics, the driving rhthym, this album hits hard, and without an excess of electric guitar. The songs are just masterfully written; the guitar is gritty and nasty; the lyrics are bold and perfect; the vocals... need i say anything, it's freaking Mick Jagger- the ultimate lead singer!!! EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS CLASSIC!!! This was my first Stone's album and is certainly one of the greatest. It starts the unparalled four album run of BB, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile. Not that the preceding albums weren't great, but this was truly the first astronomical Stones album; it was to be followed by the fabulous Let it Bleed, the indescribably sublime Sticky Fingers, and the deity of all rock albums Exile on Main Street.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|I cannot say that I did not appreciate the film and it's intentions, but for the common movie viewer Stephen Gaghan's work is far too complex.  The movie, like his prior work, looks great on paper, but when it is finished it is a jumbled mess, that watching more than once will only serve to confuse the viewer even more.  This film should be filed under art-house.  It is a statement, not necessarily open to interpretation, but definitely not for the casual movie patron.  The movie makes it's point, but the journey getting there hardly seems worth it.  Raising more questions than it answers, this movie was just not worth the hype.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Heath Ledger is an introspective Casanova in this otherwise outrageously amusing conglomeration of events and characters. CASANOVA does not fail to entertain. Oliver Platt as the \\"Lard King of Genoa\\" definitely steals this film from the entire cast as a corpulent suitor. This is one of his best performances leaving an indelible mark for his range of histrionics. Also, Jeremy Irons once again demonstrates his mastery of for the dramatics as the Vatican's grand inquisitor sent to finally put the issue of Casanova to rest. Starting off as a powerful character he ends up in some outrageous buffoonery showing a new side of his array talents. The film is vastly amusing starting slowly but coming to a grand crescendo.
0553583182|1.0|This book offers what appears on its face to be useful advice- believe in your power of belief, which the author claims literally has a magical quality to it and can produce the future you want.  Problem is, this kind of advice can prove VERY deadly, not only mentally/spiritually, but physically as well.  Let me cite two personal examples of people who have practiced this and bore the fruits of its circular illogic.  <br /> <br />My grandmother applied this to her bout with cancer, even refusing to acknowledge it as such (this refusal was part of the positive mental imagery she practiced).  Started as a small skin cancer which we could all see, but she refused to see a doctor, which would have been an admission that she did not have enough faith to remove the lesion.  It then grew to a carcinoma and eventually melanoma, from which she died.  Her belief system, which was very real to her, was just dead wrong.  Turns out, it emanates from eastern mysticism (not Christianity as this book would lead you to believe) which most often holds physical reality is an illusion, and only the universal Mind exists.  This is demonstrably false. <br /> <br />Another family we know personally had a young son who contracted pneumonia.  They followed some of the Word-Faith televangelists (Hinn, Copeland, Hagin) who, like this book, will tell you perfect health and wealth are available if you just believe in them- God will be obligated to do your bidding. Consequently, the parents believed with all their hearts that their faith would cure him and did not take him to a doctor.   The little boy died shortly thereafter.  His father then believed (autosuggestion?) and proclaimed his son would be brought back to life on Christmas and left him in the morgue for several months; when it did not occur, the family splintered badly and turned their back not only on each other, but on God as well.  In their minds, it was not their fault for believing bad advice, but God's fault for not respondingas they believed he would.  Vicious circle. <br /> <br />This book would have you believe a falsehood- do yourself a favor and avoid it and others like it.  Even if the results aren't as horrible as above, the net effect is still a form of self deification where there is the illusion of becoming a \\"god.\\"  Suggest instead Geisler's \\"When Skeptics Ask\\" (somewhat technical) or Strobel's \\"The Case for Faith\\" (very readable).
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  Every song on it has its time and place.  Furthermore, the recording quality and dynamic range on the CD is unlike any I've heard in the past 10 years.  You'll never get tired of this one.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple, quite possibly the greates singer/songwriter of our time, has made another beautiful piece of work. Her title inspires me so much, as does the music within it. She took a huge step as taking a new approach to her music. She decided for this album to not be as, dreary, as the other. I personally like both. <br />The album begins with \\"On The Bound\\" a song I have come to love, not at first though. The album ends with \\"I Know\\"...probably in a close running with \\"Love Ridden\\" for my favorite song on the album. Personally, I listen to her mainly for her lyrics (and beautiful voice). It is like abstract art, you can make her songs help you cope with the pains you go through. That is why Fiona Apple is so important to many. The album is amazing and inspirational. She deserved as many grammy's as she could get for this album.
B00003CXTG|1.0|\\"and I knooooooowwwww that my heart will go ooooooonnnnn\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Oh, this wasn't Titanic? My mistake.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|OK, so what did I expect anyway.  The actors do a good job (which I would expect from this group).  The director, etc also did well, given what they had to work with.  But there was just so much that didn't make it to the screen that the story seemed oddly in media res at every point.  And there just wasn't enough subtext or back story to engage me.  Having said that, I did think the basic revelatory piece of info (which I won't give away here) was brilliant and unusual.  I also thought the effects were very well done.  So, I recommend this film if you like this kind of futuristic, game brought to life, kind of film.
0920668372|5.0|What is with you people ...taking this so literally?  You just don't get it.  This is a mother who loves her child \\"forever.\\"  Parents who love their kids \\"look in\\" on them at night.  How ludricous to have people think that she actually picks him up and rocks him, or that he does the same to her.  Sheesh!  Does the word \\"metaphor\\" ring any bells for you?
B0006J28KU|5.0|This is it. This movie is just like a drug. You cannot control yourself to watch this film again and again.<br /><br />The way of capturing, the dialogs, the cast and senario is just perfect.<br /><br />After purchasing Original Heat, you have to buy also this 2-disc version in order to go deeply how this movie had been created, the locations, actors reviews and of course Michael Mann speechs.<br /><br />The extras disc is fully loaded with knowledge about the film you should know.<br /><br />Because after watching once, you will become addicted to watch every week. Period.
630471193X|3.0|This movie works at all only because of the quality of the acting of Travolta, Duvall, Sedgwick, Whitaker, and the others who really do commit to this incredibly dumb plot.  It is easy to get caught up in the love story, and in the wonderfully nice George Malley (as all his friends do), but every piece of \\"knowledge\\" in this film is as whacked out as Lace Pennamin's stupid chairs.<br /><br />At first, when the light hits George, we buy into something unearthly has given him these powers, but when the truth is revealed late into the movie, well, let me say that what happened to George does not and cannot happen from what the story has happen to him.  If you have ever had that in your family, as I have, you know what really happens and it is not, EVER, an increase in mental ability, let alone something as impossibly fanciful as telekinesis.<br /><br />Then there is the whole sinister government thing.  Why do this?  Why is it necessary that the government is out to enslave us by keeping us ignorant and stupid and yet if we dare rise above the enforced mediocrity, they want to take us away?  This is even dumber than the asserted reason for George's abilities.<br /><br />Even so, I like every character in George's town, especially Duvall's Doc Brunder and Whitaker's Nate Pope.  It is the quality of their acting and commitment to this story that makes the film work at all.  When I first saw it, I suspended belief and common sense all the way until the George finds out about the source of his powers.  Then I got annoyed and the feeling kept increasing all the way to the end.  Still, Travolta and Duvall do have a great scene together at the hospital that would have worked in any movie without all this other nonsense.<br /><br />Oh, well.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|Since I have been a Kansas fan from their first CD...I decided to try and objectively rate this Best Of Kansas CD.  Although, this collection may contain some of their most popular songs...I wouldn't say that these are their best songs ever.  This is just a good starting point! Sure I still love to hear the overplayed, yet great songs Carry On Wayward Son and Dust In The Wind.  Point Of Know Return is a wonderful, yet less played tune.  Fight Fire With Fire is a song that represents a dark time for Kansas with their worst album ever Drastic Measures.  The edited version of Song For America... cost them one star on my rating chart.  This is one of their best songs ever and it was a mistake to shorten it.  They could have left off the live song Closet Chronicles in my opinion and kept the full version of Song For America.  Well, enough of that!  Hold On is a wonderful, pop style song.  No One Together is another pop style song..it's okay.  Play The Game Tonight is actually one of the best songs that John Elefante has ever sung for Kansas.  The Wall is an absolute masterpiece musically, vocally, and production.  This song is great whether in the studio or live.  The Pinnacle is another gem with great lyrics and music.  This comes from one of the lesser known CD's called Masque (It was released in 1975).  The Devil Game is an powerful song from The Song From America release.  The final song is the live cut...Closet Chronicles...I have already wrote about this.  Buy it and enjoy some of the most popular songs from Kansas.
B00000DR8R|5.0|This album was one of my favorites from the 80's and still remains a perennial favorite.  Having loaded most of my albums in part onto my Ipod, I still find myself stopping to listen intently to \\"Perfect Skin\\", \\"Down on Mission Street\\", \\"Rattlesnakes\\", \\"Patience\\" and \\"Are You Ready to be Heartbroken\\" whenever they come up in the rotation.  This album got good college station airplay when it came out but it should have broken through to mainstream with \\"Rattlesnakes\\". <br /> <br />I won't go on and on about this album, you can read the other comments for more.  But you owe yourself - go out and get a copy of this CD - great pop/rock for the thinking person.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|While this may be the sequel to the video game masterpiece Final Fantasy VII, its merits as a movie are few. The plot is void of all key ingredients that make a movie fun; there is no direction in this movie that makes you care about these people; and the acting (shared in part by the movie's direction, its \\"actor\\" voice-overs, and the computer graphics themselves) leaves this piece in the dust. Not even the fight scenes help this movie -- which are not well choreographed or very believable -- even with a dose of fantasy.    While this movie may excel at showcasing computer animation, they almost get in the way of you wanting to put your heart in this movie. The stark contrast between engineering hair to fall perfectly with the laws of physics and the lack of attention to the things that really matter in a movie will keep fans of Final Fantasy VII from putting their heart in this movie.    In short, those that played the Final Fantasy VII game will find this movie inadequate and almost insulting -- resembling a Saturday-morning cartoon based on an epic masterpiece.    Those that have never played the game will be completely lost. At least they can just say its a horrible movie without facing the feeling of a broken heart delivered in the form of watching their favorite gaming epic utterly insulted.
0451191153|4.0|Rand's novel The Fountainhead is a philosophical work. In her philosophical novel, Rand uses Howard Roark, an architect, in order to advance her plot. However, it is important not to get caught up in the architecture because it is a story depicting a philosophy, more than just conflict between characters. Given the book is a philosophical work, the criterion by which it should be judged, differ from the criterion when reading a book \\"just for fun\\". Most importantly, the ideas presented in a philosophical work must stay consistent and must be easily understood. This novel should also give a convincing case through the means of its story. It should also be noted that the reader's personal beliefs will not matter when reading a book of philosophical orientation.  <br />Rand's philosophy is presented in a clear manner throughout the novel. From the first chapter, Roark's unwillingness to compromise is presented. The philosophy however is more than simply do not compromise, but rather includes the reasoning and motives behind those thoughts. Roark refuses to compromise with the dean at the beginning of the novel because it would mean living for another person. Behind the motives we have the deeper meaning behind Rand's novel, and that is to say that each individual is most beneficial to society if and only if he lives solely for himself. This philosophy is clear for the whole of the story, assuming a general outcome is understood. Roark is presented as the hero and so long as he ends up on top, the philosophy is consistent. Naturally, at the end of the book, Roark stands symbolically atop the world, thus completing the uniformity of ideas presented in Rand's The Fountainhead.  <br />Furthermore, the destiny of the other character's of The Fountainhead help deliver a convincing argument for Rand's philosophy. Ellsworth Toohey loses his job at the Banner. Peter Keating loses all of his once potent fame and money. And even Gail Wynand loses the battle he had to win: againstthe strike. All three of these men represented something different and impure in the way man should live life according to Rand. Toohey was \\"selfless\\", Keating wanted fame, and Wynand desired power. All three are wrong and lead one into a life of a \\"second-hander\\". A \\"second-hander\\" can most easily be described as a person living through the approval of others. According to Roark, the worst second-hander of all, is the one who seeks power.  <br />When taking into account that the book was written fifty years ago, the philosophy of the book should not play a role in choosing whether or not to read it. If your are a selfish egotist, great; or a selfless individual, fantastic. From either perspective, new knowledge can be gained. The Fountainhead can help solidify a belief system already in place, or it can provide a gained perspective angle into life. Or, the book may be studied historically and understand that this is Rand's response to communism and collective thinking. Overall, the audience's personal beliefs will not factor into the importance and significance of reading such a book.  <br />Ultimately, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead was a well developed philosophical novel. For the reasons that it is well written, focused, and powerful, The Fountainhead should be read by everyone. On a personal note, I enjoyed reading not only the philosophy intertwined in the plot, but the plot itself as well. For anyone considering picking up this book, I would recommend it \\"just for fun\\" and as a knowledgeable piece of literature.  <br />
B000002UAU|3.0|This album opens with the title track followed by \\"With a Little Help from My Friends.\\" Both of these tracks are great. The album starts to creep downhill after that. The vocals on \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" purposely sound strained, like they held their nose closed while they were singing. Overall, it's still an alright song. \\"Getting Better\\" has a poppy, optimistic tune. It's pretty cool, though the lyrics \\"I used to be cruel to my woman. I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved\\" I find somewhat creepy.    So, there are some cool Beatles tunes on here to listen to. The other half, however, is a burden to listen to. \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is just plain annoying. \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" is an attempt at another \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" but it's not even half the song that \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was. \\"Within You Without You,\\" is an eastern sounding tune. But their previous album, \\"Revolver,\\" already some eastern sounding tune that wasn't very great. Who needs another? This one's even worse. The whole song just sounds like a vocal warm up. And there's just too much to say about \\"Good Morning Good Morning.\\" Roosters crowing, people shouting \\"Good Morning!\\". A lame melody accompanied by blunt brass. It just all makes me tense-makes me want to scream, \\"Shut up already!\\" It's all a bunch of noise. What is this, a sound effects album? Good grief! Then there's nothing special about \\"Fixing a Hole.\\" It's somewhat good, but unfortunately has an annoying chorus melody.    I have nothing bad to say about \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\", but nothing good to say about them either.    The last two songs are pretty good. The reprise is a good rockin' tune. \\"A Day in the Life,\\" is a mellow tune interrupted by a creepy orchestra every so often.    So forget all of the bias about how \\"revolutionary\\" this album was or whatever. I'm giving it to you at face value.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is by far one of the best Hip Hop CD's EVER.. That's right I said EVER!!!!!!!... I was in 10th grade when this CD came out and I can remember cuttin' class just to go to the store and buy the tape.  This CD is a classic from beginning to end.  This is what real hip hop is.  Nowadays people tend to only like hip hop if they are from that region.  If you are from the south, you tend to listen to down south music, west coast is all about the west coast and East coast is all about the east coast.  I'm from NY and when this tape came out, everyone had to have it.  Regardless of where you were from at the time, there isnt anyone that cant pop this tape/CD in and not know, word for word, at least 5 or 6 songs from this classic.  This is by far in my top 3 albums of all time and for the yourger generation, do not let the Snoop Dogg tracks that you hear now deter you from copping this CD.  INSTANT CLASSIC... How anyone can rate it anything less than a 5 is beyond me... I said my peace.. ~ONE~
0684824906|5.0|This is proving to be one of theose books that you just do not want to end.  The characters are real and the story is truly an amazing one.  One has to wonder if todays poitical adversaries could actually work together for the common good...(I suspect that they could not as they are all such small people in comparison to these giants.)  I am loving every minute of this book, you will too.
B000069HZP|5.0|If you have seen some of Michael Douglas'es other movies, such as \\"Romancing the stone\\" and \\"The jewel of Nile\\" -- well, \\"The Game\\" is an action-adventure movie, similar to those. But this time, the adventure happens in a city environment - in San Francisco. The \\"game\\" is organized by a company called \\"Consumer Recreation Services\\", who make your life more \\"FUN\\".<br /><br />This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The reason is that the things which happen to Van Orton (the banker played by Michael Douglas) have happened to me as well - in some way or another. Perhaps they have happened to you too. For example, you visit some company, and at your next visit - the company is gone. Or sometimes, you may experience that someone is draining your bank account without your knowledge. Or, a waitress splashes food and drinks on your suit.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie, because it is captivating to watch. For example, the house in which the banker Van Orton lives, is large and luxurious. It is nice to imagine yourself in the interior of this house. The \\"waitress\\" than ruins the banker's suit is very beautiful. I would say that Michael Douglas definitely has a taste for luxirious living and beautiful women - this shows in most of his movies. Enjoy this film and participate emotionally in the blurred line between game and real life.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I love this miniseries.  It was light years superior to American TV shows like The West Wing.  This series portray politicians and political operatives to be the conniving, heartless, and manipulative bastards that they are.  It's incredibly realistic, sarcastic, darkly hilarious, viscerally intelligent, and honest.  There isn't a false moment in the whole thing.  Francis Uckhart (F.U. as he is affectionately known) is a conservative MP who eventually becomes prime minister.  He does through different machinations, such as flattery, cunning, blackmail (mostly), and occasionally murder.  You don't really hate his character, because everyone else in the series is aiming for the same thing, and they are as nasty as he is.  He's certainly the most charming and interesting of all the characters here, and it's to Ian Richardson's credit for giving such a great performance that you kind of like F.U., even though he's really a vile bastard at heart.  But then, the world of politics is treated here like the morally ambiguous cesspool it is, instead of the idealized crap you get on The West Wing (one character, Stamper, even says it's like crawling through a tunnel of excrement).  How many times do you hear characters on The West Wing give a variation of the \\"we don't get along.  But let's put our personal differences aside and do what's best for the country.\\"?  What a pile of crap.  Polticial operatives are some of the most unscrupulous and sadistic bastards on the planet.  If they are starry idealists, they quickly disappear.  They're there to obtain and consolidate power.  Nothing else.  And this series portrays that brilliantly.  Kudos to the BBC and the British in general for putting out another brilliant miniseries...
B000286RNY|5.0|I first saw the trailer for Shaolin Soccer while surfing around the internet, and thought it might be a fun film to watch with the kids-sort of a live action cartoon. When it arrived, I was stunned to see the brilliance with which this film was put together. Yes, it does capture zany cartoon magic I expected, and my kids loved it, but there was so much more there than met the eye.<br /><br />There are two versions of the film on this DVD. Although it's tempting to watch the \\"Americanized\\" version, you'll be doing yourself a grave injustice if you do. The original Chinese version, subtitled, is a far better experience. Yes, my kids prefer the Americanized vesion, since it's dubbed, but the Chinese version is a much more complete and enjoyable film. (It makes me wonder what happened to the original Chinese language versions of other films, like Rumble in the Bronx.) Watching the film the way Stephen Chow intended it makes it clear why it was the biggest film ever outside of the United States.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I admit it. I'm a recent Johnny Cash convert, inspired in part by the recent Hollywood handling of the big man's life. But the late arrival does not diminish my appreciation for the stylings of Cash's music and the rolling thunder voice in which they are delivered.<br /><br />Cash sings of hard drinking, hard times and hard women. For younger listeners, the sound is one that evokes baritone memories of Christmas parties with drunken uncles doing their best to mimic Cash's cavernous voice. For the older lot, Cash recalls a time when men were men and women were mainly the pillars of sanity that guided them from the path of ruin.<br /><br />\\"The Legend of Johnny Cash\\" is ideal for either group, for new fans or for old ones. It contains a compilation of nearly two dozen songs precisely representative of Cash's work. Even the sad songs will inspire you to tapping the steering wheel and bellowing along on a long drive. The music and lyrics inspire daydreams of dusty roads and smoky bars, where fighting men brood over beers.<br /><br />Cash's genius was that he never tried to rise beyond the world with which he was familiar. He found what worked and stuck with it, singing of Sunday mornings in melancholy notes or in toe-tapping rhythm of shoeshine boys with pearls of wisdom.<br /><br />I should also acknowledge that I typically eschew country music in any form. The power of Cash's work is such that it transcends even that kind of years worn discrimination, making this CD perfect for just about anybody who sings in the shower or at the top of his lungs on the drive to work.<br /><br />Some highlights: Cry, Cry, Cry; Folsom Prison Blues; Walk the Line; Get a Rhythm; Big River; Ring of Fire; Jackson; Man in Black; Sunday Morning Coming Down; Highwayman. Twenty songs in all.
0440241588|1.0|I used to be a Grisham fan, but his last few books, and more specifically, The Broker, have been disappointing. The Broker is a good tour book of Bologna, Italy. In fact, it made me want to go and visit, but the story is weak. There is very little suspense, extremely naiive (almost juvenile), and highly predictable plot, what's more, a lot of it does not make much sense. It is not clear and not convincing as to why the CIA would stash Backman in Italy, spend resources teaching him Italian, just to get him killed. There are a lot of easier and simpler ways to get him to talk and reveal the secrets he possesses. It is not clear as to the objective - the CIA wants to know who kills him, but the book suggests that all of the usual suspects want to kill him, so whoever does is just lucky to catch him first. Again, illogical on the part of the CIA since the would be killer does not carry any information the CIA does not already have. There are plenty of open subplots, which never close. And above all, the reason for Backman's misfortunes, and the details involving the JAM software are particularly silly, and do not stand the test of credibility.
B00005JO17|4.0|Taking the classic children's story of \\"Chicken Little\\" by E.L.Easton and converting it into a visual treat for all ages, the Walt Disneys' studios has laid a golden egg. The talented voice of LaZach Braff as the voice of Chicken Little, is further enhanced by Garry Marshall as Buck Cluck, and the late Don Knotts as Mayor Turkey Lurkey, and even Patrick Steward bring to life the memorable children's story. The tale itself is of a little chicken who having been struck in the head by falling debris, is convinced the sky is indeed falling and runs about hysterically warning everyone throughout the town. Unlike the tragic ending in the popular book, the film version is colorful, comical and light hearted. A film for the enjoyment of both children and adults which lives up to parents' expectations of wholesome entertainment. **
0201633612|4.0|My only critique of the book is that it is very heavy on examples. It is all relevant and if you have the time to read and digest it all you will be a better programmer. However, there are more consice books that do a better job of distilling the important concepts of design patterns and books that provide better modern approachs. This is the type of book that you have to read in school becuase it is a classic. I would equate to classic literature like Homer or War and Peace. They are important in a scholarly sense if you wants a deep historic understanding of the topic. However, you can understand and use design patterns without reading other books and you will save a lot of time.<br /><br />Another good analogy is the way calculus is taught in school. First they teach you in-depth complicated way. They take you through all the steps the inventor went through to come up with it. Then they show you the short cuts that are used in common practice. You have a better understanding of the topic because you know the hard way but you would be foolish not use the short cuts.<br /><br />So you can read this book and get an indepth understanding or you can skip this step and go straight the a consice book that shows you how patterns are used practically today.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to \\"Spiderman\\" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****  <br />
020161622X|4.0|I like how concise this book is. It hits important points in two pages. It's like a cliff a notes to good programming practices. You will need deeper resources to implement the recomendations in this book but it is full of very good practices. I recomend it for any programmer.

B000CNFC76|5.0|Sports themed movies generally do well at the box office because of their often uplifting and inspiring stories, and the ability to connect with audiences, allowing them to vicariously live out their athletic hopes and dreams for 2 hours.  This isn't to say that these audience members need to live vicariously through these inspiring sports movies, because some of these people could become the next sports stars that the rest of the general public will come to know and watch on TV, but for those that don't possess the ability to play professional sports, these movies are an excellent outlet for them to enjoy. <br /> <br />After enjoying great success with several sports themed movies in recent years, from football with \\"Remember the Titans\\", baseball with \\"The Rookie\\", and hockey with the olympic-themed \\"Miracle\\", Walt Disney Studios decided to try their collective hand at the world of golf.  With a terrific script from Mark Frost, an enthusiastic director in former actor Bill Paxton (\\"Aliens\\" and \\"Twister\\"), and an up-and-coming young actor named Shia LaBeouf, who had gained notice from his Disney Channel TV show \\"Even Stevens\\" and his film work in \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"Constantine\\", Disney Studios was hard at work on delivering more high quality sports entertainment with \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\". <br /> <br />Set in 1913, \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" is the story of a poor kid named Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), who worked as a caddy at the country club across the street from his house.  Learning from watching the golfers he caddied for, young Ouimet began to hone his own golf skills, and though his father (Elias Koteas) vehemently disapproved, accepted a chance to play in an amatuer tournament.  Learning from the mistakes he makes, this young golfer and former caddy eventually earns a spot in the U.S. Open opposite his golf hero, and world's greatest golfer Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane).  With his hopes and dreams on the line and a 10-year old caddy named Eddie by his side, Francis sets out to break down the barriers of golf's high society, and do his best to win the U.S. Open Championship. <br /> <br />What makes this movie so uplifting is the fact that young Francis had to overcome so much adversity to get to the U.S. Open.  From his disapproving father, played perfectly by Elias Koteas, to the high society golf members that looked down upon Francis' hopes of playing golf, and even his own self-doubts, nothing about his journey was easy.  But none of this stopped Francis from eventually making it to the U.S. Open to face off against Harry Vardon, who at the time was the greatest player in the game, and even to this day is known for perfecting the interlocking fingers grip used by most golfers.  The entire cast did an excellent job of bringing these real people to life and doing their story a great service by allowing many who'd never heard about the U.S. Open of 1913 to experience it first hand.  Director Bill Paxton does an extraordinary job of bringing the game of golf to exciting life on the big screen, many directors would have simply filmed the golf sequences as straightforward as possible, basically mimicing the PGA that airs on TV.  But Bill Paxton chose to liven things up, by incorporating unique camera angles and mixing digital and practical effects together to achieve a unique vision that portrays a great respect for not only the game of golf, but for it's players as well. <br /> <br />Coming from a person that has grown up playing golf since I was a little kid, I can say that it's always nice when the actors in a sports movie try their hardest to make the movements appear authentic, and \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" features just that type of actors.  In fact, according to the behind-the-scenes featurette found on the DVD, all the actors that had parts requiring them to play golf on camera had to be trained to swing the club properly so that anyone viewing the movie that had any kind of golf experience would know that the swing was authentic, and could achieve the golf shots being portrayed on camera.  With that much dedication put into the pre-production process on this movie, and the high-caliber talent that were involved in the production process, and then the excellent post-production special effects work, music, and editing, it's no surprise that \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" has joined the pantheon of great Hollywood sports movies.  So, the next time you're out renting a movie, do yourself a favor and rent this one, you most definitely will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />\\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" is rated PG for brief language.

B000AMWIVM|5.0|Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero. 2 men (Elwes, Whannell) are shackeled broken down bathroom. Dr. Gordon has to kill his cellmate Adam or his wife (Potter) and daughter (Vega) will die. <br /> <br />Tracking down Jigsaw is a dectective name David Tapp (Glover) and his partner Steven Sing (Lueng).  <br /> <br />This film also stars Dina Meyer as Detective Kerry. Shawnee Smith as Amanda. And Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle. This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. For them to survive, they have to go through his deadly games.  <br /> <br />Performances are very good, some over the top, but very good. The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.  <br /> <br />This uncut edition really has no extra scenes, just an extended scene of Amanda finding the key inside a man's body. <br /> <br />Saw is a must-see horror film. And it's sequel is even more awesome.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Somehow a solo album only covering the American Songbook was expected from Keith Jarrett after the all the extremely successful Standards Trio albums on ECM with Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette. But the moving story behind how this album became a reality for Jarrett (JazzTimes cover story) makes every one of the these beloved tunes on this excellent CD very special.  Jarrett's simple and naked approach with his less-than-usual improvisation to the tunes is beyond believe when he opens with \\"I Loves You, Porgy\\" and continues through jazz standards and adds on few surprises like \\"Shenandoah\\" and \\"My Wild Irish Rose\\" (years since I heard these tunes).  In other words many highlights but if I should pick one it must be \\"Blame It On My Youth/Mediation\\" where Jarrett ends this lovely tune with a meditative improvisation over the chord structure so beautiful that I had to pinch my arm.<br /><br />I have struggled for years making my own personal ranking of the many excellent Jarrett solo albums in my collection, but with this album I'll end this personal project - it's impossible, because there are too many excellent solo recordings out there from Jarrett. If I should pick on something with this CD, it must be the audio quality.  It's a very good recording to be recorded in Jarrett's home studio (and we understand why) but it's not at the ECM audio standard we all are spoiled with. Anyway, I bet this album will open many new listeners' ears to the \\"World of Keith Jarrett\\".
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) brings us another cool gorefest film. Only this time, it's torture. In this film, 3 guys (Hernandez, Richardson and Gudjonsson). are having a good time in Europe. But all that changes when a stranger tells them to go to a Hostel in another part of Europe to get girls.<br /><br />When they get stupid and go there, they meet 2 girls that set them up, and take them to a place where people are paid to torture and kill tourist.<br /><br />In real life, only a fool would fall for a trick like that. It seems to good to be true. But hey, it's a horror movie, can't have a horror movie without dumb victims. The gore in this film is awesome, but there's nothing unrated in this version. Even Roth himself said nothing much was cut.<br /><br />This is a good horror film to see, especially if you wanna have a bloody good time.
B0009SS00A|1.0|I bought this book after based on the hype surrounding Da vinci Code. Back then the subject matter appeared to be cool and the plot seemed promising.  <br /> <br />This book falters on many counts  <br />1) There is very little of suspense.The author lets you in directly onto all the charecters line of thought .Mostly Its a childs play to guess whats coming up next.  <br />2) The technical facts in this book particularly towards the last few chapters are grossly incorrect. Dan brown either hasnt done enough research or does not understand technology <br />3)The end was a major dissapointment too with little left to be relaved. <br /> <br />Overall , its not worth your time.
0792151712|2.0|this movie is good but should not be rated pg 13. it says every curse in the book and has a nudity and sex scene. but again overall this is a good movie
1878424319|5.0|This book was of great value to me and the four agreements are powerful and easy to remember.  The agreement that gave me the greatest shift was \\"Don't Take Anything Personally\\".  This agreement brought clarity to many situations in my own life that have caused me needless inner pain.

B000DZIGDU|1.0|Not a movie to watch with mixed company.  Lot of strong profanity, and sex comments.  Too bad such talented actors had to make a movie and bring themselves into the gutter. <br /> <br />If our military acts like the characters in this movie, we are in deep trouble. <br /> <br />RLHOLMES
0679720200|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Camus's The Stranger. It didn't take that long to read, but gave me many interesting things to think about long after I had finished it. <br />Although some see The Stranger as an \\"easy to read\\" novel, the depth of the main character is astounding. Camus uses Meursault to express his questions about how societies come to be, and how they are allowed to exist. The society in The Stranger condemns Meursault for his crime based off earlier events that do not reflect his real character, and are unable to judge his actions properly. It is also thought that Meursault doesn't have any emotion, which is proven to be untrue on many occasions, such as the courthouse scene and the last scenes of the book. If the reader is simply taking every word for its literal meaning, the book is indeed quite simple. However, on closer analysis, the novel contains Camus' questions about society, as well as the analysis of a character that is more unique than any other. <br />The only downfall to the novel is that most people only read the translated version of the book, which cuts out some of the original ideas Camus may have wanted to use. Overall though, the novel is definitely more complicated than meets the eye, and invites the reader to experience something completely different from other novels. <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD has been written about a lot.  But it's new to me, and I just want to say:  Michael Buble is it.  And the album is great because there are so many different songs from different styles and times.  But it's always Michael - a definite keeper.
0671027387|5.0|I'm halfway done with this novel and I can't seem to put it down either!  OMG!  Dan Brown, you are incredible! I can't wait to read the others!  Your style of writing just keeps me focused and wanting more!  Thank you!
B00006CXSS|5.0|We are anxious to purchase this series, but won't do so until HBO adds the closed captioning (in english).  That is one of the all-time best features of DVDs, being able to turn down the volume on the LOUD combat and aircraft scenes without missing any of the dialog.  With small children in the house, we rarely watch adult content films like this one without the captioning to keep the noise level at a minimum while they sleep. <br /> <br />Other than this one complaint, the series has well earned a full 5 stars.  We've rented the DVD set, and especially enjoyed the Field Guide extras--can't wait for a captioned set to buy so we can fully explore this terrific add-on.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Very boring horror movie that has Keanu Reeves playing a Sam Spade like occult investigator who helps a police officer in death of her twin sister. The story sounds simple enough but it get convoluted in all the supernatural happening that is going on and the screenplay really does not bother to explain itself in those occurrences. The special effects are good but some of them are repetitive and some visuals are not that well done. The acting is decent for a movie of this kind with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be one of the most versatile and talented actresses of her generation. Her performance is actually way too good for this film because she makes you interested in her character and her story while you are rapidly losing interest in the movie as a whole and her performance demands a better showcase than this film. Her character is strong enough to hold a better film by herself but with the inconsistent writing that is in the screenplay, she is reduced to carrying Keanu on her shoulders while he is trying to figure out on which film he's in. Which leads to the film's biggest problem and that is Keanu Reeves himself. He's miscast in the role of John Constantine and a better actor would have been able to show more of his sides than Keanu was able to do. Keanu just comes a cross as a jerk and that would have been alright if he at least showed some humanity but Keanu can't balance that out and he just comes across really bad. A better actor would have done more but with Keanu, you really can't expect much and you don't get anything here. That hurts the creditability that this movie had for the main character and it hurts the way you see the movie as a whole. The direction lacks focus and some scenes don't hold well with the whole film. <br /> <br />Worth a rental for Rachel Weisz's great performance and some of the special effects but not worth owning  <br /> <br />
0783225970|5.0|I just seen this movie and I have to say that while it is a bit long, the movie was definitely worth it. I really like the performances, especially with the last scene, which is one of the most memorible scenes in recent movie history and one that is still being hailed as a great scene even after 23 years. Al Pachino totally nailed the character of Tony Montana and was totally believale.
B000002MIB|5.0|I really like this album, But maybe it was a little bit ofensive including almost the whole F.U.C.K  album. I am not saying that I don?t like it, because I think it is the best Van Hagar album. However, Van Halen has more to perform alive. I think that more songs from the Roth's period would have been cool! Rock N Roll Forevaa!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of the best Hayao Miyazaki's works.  The story is about the adventure of a girl called Chihiro.  On the way she moves to new town with her family, they get lost and step into a strange world.  Chihiro experiences scary and hard times there but also wonderful meetings wait for her.  Through the adventure, she grows up to independent and wiser.  I watched this film so many times and I love it because it's so impressive to see the growth of Chihiro and all characters are so lovable.   <br />

B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I am honestly a persons who likes sci-fi movies, but the bad storyline and stupid script in Advent Children makes it a total waste of your money. <br /> <br />There are MANY parts in the movie that will make you question whats is going on ? and what is the motive for evil characters actions ? You will leave this movie still scratching your head for answers !!! <br /> <br />I recomend that you buy Kung-Fu Hustle instead. Its a lot better and it has some CG animation in it too!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener is by far the best political thriller in recent memory. Fernando Meirelles creates a web of paranoia, political intrigue and a interesting and haunting love story all rolled into one beautiful looking film that captures the spirit and the landscape of the African nation. Rachel Weisz not only cements herself as one of the most powerful and talented actors around with her performance but also raises the stakes highly in this taunt, scary and ultimately tragic love story. Weisz not only makes you believe in her character but also makes you aware of the power of the human spirit. Her co-star Ralph Fiennes is just as good with a role that is a mixture of vulnerability and courage and his performance is the best of his career. Weisz and Fiennes carry this picture into the heart of darkness, corruption and lies and they both bring the viewer along for the ride and Meirelles gives this ride a touch of realism that is refreshing and disturbing all at the same time. <br /> <br />Finally, a bold statement with some heart and soul from Hollywood, a rare thing in this time and age.  <br /> <br />

B00005JOYA|5.0|*  Based on the game series by Konami<br /><br />*  Written by Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction)<br /><br />*  Directed by Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf)<br /><br />It's been a while since I've written my last review, and despite it being somewhat close to Silent Hill's original theatrical release date, I feel it is high time that I write a review to offset some of the rather mixed reviews I've read.  While it certainly became a hit at the box office, critics have been mixed about this horror film, based on the cult game series from Konami, and even fans have started to spread themselves thin over what to make of it.  I was no different when I heard that Christophe Gans was directing, in which I wasn't all too fond of \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" to begin with, and that there were some story points that were changed; however, I still wanted to give the film its chance and in the end, I'm really glad I did.  I would go so far to say that this is the best film adaptation of a video game ever.  Seriously, when has a video game based film been THIS good?<br /><br />The story is changed somewhat; Instead of Harry Mason, we have Rose (Radha Mitchell), married to Christopher (the totally awesome Sean Bean), who adopt a child named Sharon (Cheryl from the Silent Hill video game).  Sharon keeps having bad dreams about Silent Hill, a town with a terrible history that has been locked away for quite some time.  Despite rumors and historical accounts, Rose decides to take her there against Chris's wishes to figure out why she's having nightmares. After an accident, Rose is knocked unconscious, only to awaken in the ash-falling Silent Hill and without Sharon.  Along the way she runs into Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah K. Unger), and Christabella (Dahlia's sister, played by the deliciously evil Alice Krige), among others.  She also is led to many areas that have been a part of Alessa's suffering, and she encounters crazy monsters including the all-too-scary Pyramid Head lifted from Silent Hill 2 for the Playstation 2 (my favorite Silent Hill game).  We are given Alessa's horrible past, being made fun of for her powers (\\"Witch!\\") and eventually burned in a sort of witch trial; This backfires, however, sending the followers of Christabella into a state of limbo in Silent Hill, and the town has gone awry with hellish monsters lurking about at random as the result of Alessa's hatred.  Alessa had drawn Rose there, along with the light side of Alessa's soul (Sharon), in order to exact revenge upon the misguided cult worshippers.  Meanwhile, Christopher fears that something has gone wrong and sets out to discover where Rose and Sharon are, despite butting heads with a detective (Kim Coates), who has a connection to Silent Hill's past...<br /><br />The movie is graphic in its depiction of Silent Hill, basically a world of Hell on Earth.  They went through the trouble of making it LOOK like the games.  I commend the production designer and the art directors for successfully making this transition from video game into filmmaking.  Christophe Gans has strategically placed the cameras to make it seem as though we are playing the game through odd but creepy angles.  We view some of the most terrifying images in horror film history such as when Cybil is mercilessly beaten to hell and burned alive, or when the Pyramid Head rips the clothes clean off a cult follower (Tanya Allen) and slices her skin clean off!  And if that doesn't scar you for life, then the retribution scene (which plays almost like if Christ were pissed off, he'd kick our collective tails) with barbed wire ripping through flesh and bone surely will.<br /><br />I appreciated some of the story shifting, like Dahlia no longer being the villain (in the game, she led the cult to resurrect the demon Samael), and the mythology of the cult has even changed; They're misguided Christians who yearn to cleanse the world of evil, only to have created their own Purgatory in Silent Hill, and refuse to accept fault or redemption for their sins.  They are given the chance, and pay for it.<br /><br />The ending have left many disappointed, but it left it wide open for a sequel.  Plus the fact that each Silent Hill game has a sad ending of sorts, even the best ones.  All the actors turn in excellent performances, especially Laurie Holden and Alice Krige, and I may have found a new hero in Christophe Gans.  He has directed a film so painstakingly similar to the Silent Hill game without giving away too much or shying away from the origins of the story (the music score by Akira Yukumoura is even from the games, particularly 2 and 3!).  He also added little touches like the patient demon from Silent Hill 2, the nurse from the first game, and even getting the street names right (the last names of several horror authors).  This is a beautiful yet almost unbearably creepy film, and I totally commend the filmmakers for FINALLY creating a video game based film worth talking about.ent Hill, and refuse to accept fault or redemption for their sins.

B000EBEHR2|3.0|This album sounds really good. The quality of production, mix and overall musicianship is great.  However, creatively this album falls short of meeting fans' expectations at some points. <br /> <br />First of all, in terms of sound and feel, this album is like a mix of Without You I'm Nothing and Sleeping With Ghosts.  And I think this is the bad part about it.  This album does not really add anything extemely original or surprising to the rest of the Placebo Catalog. It is a GOOD Placebo album, but not a great alternative rock hit. And the sad thing is, if there was more originality and a better selection of slow songs, it could very well be one of the best placebo and alternative rock albums this year. <br /> <br />This is their fifth album, so one would expect them to improve the changes they've been going through since 2000, (starting with Black Market Music), and start writing more original, deeper and mature songs, but despite the fancy production and some elctronic elements, nothing has changed since the first album in terms of creativity in their song structures. <br /> <br />As a Placebo fan, I liked this record, but have to admit that I was expecting more.  Lyrics are immature and meaningless, in general. One can't see the great lyric-writing that was the best part about Without You I'm Nothing, in this album. They had to have better, more mature, more creative lyrics; lyrics that make more sense than telling us how depressed and drugged Brian is; because we already know that, the previous FOUR albums made that crystal clear, they really gotta move on from these subjects. Songwise, Infra-Red, Space Monkey, Drag, Post Blue and Because I want You are typical fast tempo, rocking placebo hits; they are fine but don't expect nothing new. Especially slow songs really bring the tempo down a lot and mess up the album in general (and I think this is always the case with Placebo albums, except for the greatly done, deep and original slow songs in Without You I'm Nothing). Because songs such as Follow the Cops Back Home, Blind and Pierrot the Clown, makes me say \\"are these songs really needed in this album?\\" Because they lack meaning and musical catchiness; and they are well below placebo's songwriting average. Instead of these songs, if they'd put faster and better tracks, that could be a great alternative rock cd. The problem with this cd is, instead of a slow hit like \\"My Sweet Prince\\", there are those weird and boring songs like \\"pierrot..\\" and \\"follow the cops\\"; which really messes up the album and makes you wanna skip these tracks. But again, the album is marked by the huge ego of Brian Molko and his whinings about how depressed he is. I thought the duet Broken Promise is a good song but Michael Stipe sucks in that song, he has such a small part in that song and it just doesn't really work,. <br /> <br />Again, for placebo lovers and \\"depressed teenagers\\", this is a great alternative rock album, but as a hardcore and old placebo fan, I thought that they had to come up with much original and better material than this, especially three years after the lackluster Sleeping With the Ghosts.
B000E41MS6|5.0|firstly, this season of doctor who stars christopher eccleston,not david tennant who is the doctor in the second series. anyway, doctor who is bloody brilliant! christopher eccleston is flawless as the doctor, combining the heroism of the doctor perfectly with his humour and vulnerability. billie piper is a revelation as rose tyler, a former pop star who incredibly can actually act! needless to say, russel t davies's writing is again spot on, as usual, in fact he has made the old doctor who pale in comparison with this reinvention, the best part being the doctor and rose's beautifully sweet and subtle relationship. think \\"the x files\\" combined with \\"buffy the vampire slayer\\" and you will get an idea of how \\"fantastic\\"(you'll get that after you watch the show!) this series really is.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Long been a fan of both, this album has great chemistry, combined with excellent vocals and good music. Find myself listening to it over and over again.

0790729393|5.0|Sleepers is not the right name for this movie, as sleep is the least thing these boys got. Four boys who try to have some fun in New York's, Hell's Kitchen, are now caught in the legal system for a prank gone terrible wrong. The boy's action lands them into a reform school, a reform school with sick and twisted guards who use young boys as slaves and pieces of enjoyment and pleasure. With no detail or piece of action from the reform school missing, this seems to be the hardest part of the movie to watch.     Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt, lead lives of today's norms, one a journalist and the other a lawyer. Two of their other friends lead lives of gangsters and hard-core street bangers. In an act of fate and karma, the two gangsters recognize their former sadistic guard eating at a local restaurant, and quickly take their anger out on him as their revenge.     Faced with a murder case, the prosecuting attorney (Brad Pitt), and the journalist, working together with their former father-like figure, and priest, Robert Deniro, get ready to turn the case around against the guards of the reform school. With everyone's lives and careers aside, they keep their lifelong friendship alive.     Sleepers is one of those movies that you pick up by chance, but it will always remain in your DVD collection once you do pick it up.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Concerning the assassination of President Kennedy, I think it's important to keep in mind the colorful stir created by Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Whether from journalistic diatribe or vitriolic accusations of fraud by certain politicians, it's obvious Mr. Stone hit a sensitive nerve. So many conspiracy theories have been put forth. These groups and the hard-liners defending the Warren Commission's final report seem to actually be converging; the final combination will put the matter to rest. Or will it? Hopefully, this will happen before the documents are released in 2017 or 2029, or whatever date is now in vogue, if for nothing else, to allay the continued torment of American people. But the documents do not hold the answer; or at least, I believe it is unlikely.    <br /> <br />From the X-Files, I think we can now say that, \\"the truth is out there\\". But what most people don't seem to realize, is that \\"The Truth,\\" is not written down in any kind report or manuscript. I am sure there are names, dates, addresses, points of contact, and associations between persons involved in the conspiracy, but many of these men are dead now and cannot be brought to trial. No one except New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison has tried anyone concerning the JFK assassination. This is why his case against business magnet Claw Shaw is so important. Not that Shaw might have been involved in the assassination somehow, but that the case brought attention to the possibility of conspiracy.  <br /> <br />People waiting for the day when we will see irrefutable evidence for assassination conspiracy made public, are, I believe, misled. That day will probably never come. One can imagine how the decision to murder President Kennedy was concocted in someone's hunting cabin in the middle of nowhere, and surely was made by only a few, very influential men. These are men who have been dictating American policy since the economic successes of World War II. I think they call it \\"The Military-Industrial Complex\\", or sometimes, \\"The Power-Elite\\". Certainly, wars had been alive and well between corporations in America for many years prior to World War II. But the vying and maneuvering by industrial giants really got under way during the war, and after. Leaning toward the notion of \\"Social Darwinism\\", we see that the bounty goes to those who are most aggressive and controlling...amid liberal contrivances of political ideology...it's still \\"survival of the fittest\\", according to many moguls.  <br /> <br />Of paramount importance is understanding that JFK had thousands of ardent enemies, some with formidable power and the means to carry out the murder. Imagine, if you will, in that hypothetical lonely cabin in the woods, the decision was made for a coup d'etat, and on November 22, 1963, in the course of about 8 seconds on a sunny day in Dallas, Texas, our government was realigned. Someone felt that John F. Kennedy was not only a threat to national security, but also a threat to continued economic growth. War might be \\"hell\\" for some, but for others, war is a way to make an enormous amount of money. I suppose I do not need to say that \\"money is power\\". The men who made this decision probably feel that they have been correct so far, but the new \\"American Empire\\" is becoming strained, and ultimately it might collapse, depending upon decisions made by the Bush Administration. But the real issue that came to bear upon the decision to murder JFK probably had more to do with Kennedy's insistence of diminishing troop presence in Vietnam than anything else. This is true even if a US military presence existed only in an advisory capacity. It is interesting to note that there were more bombs dropped on North Vietnam than all the bombs dropped during World War II, but the war industry requires soldiers, as well. Who had the most to lose from Kennedy's Vietnam warfare policy, which proclaimed the president's wishes for a large reduction in US presence throughout 1964, and almostall advisory troops being removed by the end of 1965? Obviously, the individuals who make money by funding warfare had the most to lose. Still, there were many discrepancies and contradictions in President Kennedy's Vietnam policy. Many were unsure exactly where he stood, and a few wondered if the president himself knew where he was supposed to stand. In the interim, a machination was launched by the Power-Elite to remove John Kennedy from office. But here again, I think it unlikely that these men acted alone. They simply couldn't. They had to have ruthless, nameless, stateless, and faceless individuals to pull off the assassination. In a nutshell...enter Organized Crime.    <br /> <br />I still believe that the Mafia made it happen, but the decision was one of collective, conscious agreement between parties participating in the assassination. The CIA could not risk the chance of a government agent being implicated. Ironically, Lee Harvey Oswald had major connections with the CIA (he was known as an \\"asset\\" to intelligence officials). But Lee Oswald was considered a double-agent, in that, he was a deep undercover counter-intelligence operative, and was purportedly working in a systematic intelligence operation engendered to attract KGB spies toward himself and his wife. Would a true defector who lived in the USSR for an extended period be allowed to come back to the United States and work in a specialty photographic studio that developed and analyzed U-2 spy plane images? Again, he was there to attract Soviet agents. He was under orders to present contradictory personalities, sometimes being pro-Cuban, and sometimes being anti-Cuban. But Lee Oswald was never a communist. That was his cover. The intelligence community wanted him to appear as two different individuals. He most likely had several designations within the intelligence community, but one final mark became imprinted on his forehead: EXPENDABLE.     <br /> <br />The Mafia (primarily Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante) knew of the Kennedy brothers' plan to invade Cuba and kill Castro in December, 1963, and they used this as a way to keep the government from putting the blame on them. Through their connections in New Orleans with ex-FBI agent Guy Bannister and CIA agents, David Ferrie (Carlos Marcello's personal pilot) and Clay Shaw, they also knew of Oswald and his intelligence orders. Interestingly, the shadow government's complicity in the matter was orchestrated by individuals who were also expendable...characters with much to hide, and many reasons to hold to their Mafia loyalties. Another misconception many people have is that Jack Ruby's murder of Oswald was an impulsive act. The truth is that this lowly figure in the underworld (a drug and gun-runner for Trafficante with ties to Cuba) was also expendable, and more so, since he was suicidal. He wanted to be known for something, maybe loved for something more, but his legacy is now shrouded in the darkest recesses of American history. Jack Ruby was the \\"other\\" patsy in Dallas, but contrary to Oswald, he was aware of his duty. He also knew that the failure to carry out his duty to his \\"mob\\" bosses would place himself and his siblings in grave danger. Jack Ruby was always concerned with the welfare of his family. While in prison, Ruby became paranoid, and truly began going insane, but on several occasions intimated to his involvement in a \\"conspiracy\\", and he begged Earl Warren to allow him to go to Washington to offer testimony involving the Kennedy assassination. One other individual who might have known \\"too much\\" was officer Tippit, supposedly gunned down by Oswald, however, the assertion that Oswald was involved in this crime is now overwhelmingly contested.  <br /> <br />To simply blame the killing on the so-called \\"Power-Elite\\" or the Mafia is incomplete. In my opinion, it's impossible for either group to have acted alone. They needed each other. This is how I think it happened:   When the Power Elite decided that Kennedy had to be removed, they began asking, \\"how?\\" Since the Mafia had already done assassinations for the CIA, they would be the logical choice; it was well known that the Mob brotherhood (Marcello, Trafficante, Giancana, Rosselli, Hoffa, et. al.) hated the Kennedy brothers, and they were given free rein to carry out the deed. But the Godfathers could not use professional assassins from the US...at least not those who were known by citizenship. They had to have men outside the circle. This is why Trafficante utilized his connections with the Marseilles Mafia (French Connection heroin cartel originally based in Havana); it eliminated any connection to the US Mafia (or CIA) with the killing, just in case anything terribly wrong occurred during the assassination attempt. These professional \\"killers\\" floated effortlessly around the world with false passports and bogus identities under the auspices of their drug-trade leaders, and the secret, even if shameless, blessings of the CIA men who were involved. Many assassinations worldwide have been undertaken and carried out by these faceless killers. And this is still going on today...not a pleasant thought. Lee Oswald was necessary to cover the \\"investigation\\" long enough for the true killers to make their escape, and to lend support for Lyndon Johnson's and J. Edgar Hoover's assessment of the crime. The conspiracy trickled from the Power-Elite through the middle-men, and finally to the nefarious individuals who made their living by smuggling drugs and murdering people.   <br /> <br />From an alternative viewpoint, it's important to understand that assassination is an important regulator of government bodies worldwide. Hundreds if not thousands of political elites and their affiliates were executed during the 20th Century, not to mention those murdered in the USSR and Germany. How many people did Stalin murder? It is a known fact that he killed upwards of 30 million people, but many thousands of top politicaladversaries were rubbed out in the name of Stalin's brand of communism. Hitler came to power by the same means. It is important to remember the political ideology belonging to Hitler and Mussolini; it was called Fascism, and yes, it utilized assassination as it's main impetus for change. <br />      <br />Some researchers speculate that the CIA had something to do with the murder of South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem in Saigon on November 1, 1963, but that later, through an illegal alteration of certain documents, it might be investigated and found that the JFK administration had the Vietnamese leader murdered. In truth, the Kennedy administration had planned to fly Diem and his family out of Vietnam to Europe, but this failed and the coup became history. What other documents have been forged in order to implicate John F. Kennedy's malfeasance in both domestic and foreign affairs? This is why, for the CIA to make certain documents available for the public's scrutiny, may or may not be helpful in solving the mystery of the JFK assassination. This is because if \\"Top Secret\\" documents are not redacted to the point of being unreadable, then they can certainly be altered to change history. In reality, many CIA and intelligence documents probably have been altered to \\"create history\\" to the tune of the Power-Elites' selective agenda. Does this agenda reflect the attitudes and values of most Americans? The sad truth is that most Americans are clueless toward the inner workings of their government.       <br /> <br />New evidence suggests that the Kennedy's were secretly carrying out a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro in December, 1963, and the fact that they were doing this outside the auspices of the \\"Power-Elite\\", and the major branch of the CIA and the joint chiefs, again lends credence to the possibility that someone (or group of individuals) decided JFK was a true security risk, since this deeply covered invasion might have easily propelled the USA into a nuclear conflictwith Cuba and the USSR. Under the rules of the disarmament of Cuba (Cuban Missile Crisis), agreed to by Kennedy and Khrushchev in October, 1962, all thermonuclear, intermediate range ballistic missiles were to be removed from Castro's island, and the USA was to be allowed an opportunity for weapons inspections. These inspections never came into being, and for this reason, John and Bobby Kennedy continued with their plans to assassinate Cuba's leader. The Mafia was not included in this plan, but because of the mob's intimate connections with individuals within the CIA, they became aware of the secret plan, and used it to pull off their ultimate intended \\"hit\\". The Kennedy brothers had tirelessly pursued the Mafia dons and godfathers for years, but after John Kennedy's murder, most of Bobby Kennedy's aims ceased. The mobsters were free again. Interesting.  <br /> <br />I believe that the conspiracy, in the end, will be shown to be extremely complex. Intelligence officials became aware of the possibility of assassination attempts on the president while he was campaigning in Chicago and especially in Tampa, Florida, but for some unknown reason presidential security was drastically reduced for the Dallas motorcade. Some secret service personnel were even told to \\"stand down\\", as another group would assume their roles. However, that other group of security personnel was not present on November 22. It is unlikely that Lyndon Johnson and/or J. Edgar Hoover were instruments for decision on the murder of JFK, but the fact that security for the president on that day in Dallas had been significantly reduced, and in some areas eliminated, points to the notion of high-level government involvement. If Hoover had caught wind of an impending assassination in Dallas, then here is where a seriously sinister aspect of the conspiracy kicked into gear. Reducing security simply allowed the murder that would not have otherwise been carried out. Are you with me? With JFK eliminated, Hooveronce again had control of the FBI, and Lyndon Johnson became president. Four days after Kennedy's death, LBJ signed the authorization to escalate US activities in Vietnam, and nine months later the \\"Gulf of Tonkin Resolution\\" was passed by Congress. Although involved with Indochina's affairs since September, 1945...it was in August 1964 that the United States' Vietnam war began in earnest with operation \\"Flaming Dirt\\", a serious air strike against targets in North Vietnam. In another seven months, General Westmoreland's Marines were deployed in force to Da Nang (March 8, 1965). And, at this time, the CIA's role as the operational command in Vietnam was being shared with the military. Soon there would be over 500,000 American troops in-country, in Vietnam and surrounding regions, and \\"before that `no-win' conflict would end, more than $220 billion would be poured into the coffers of the war makers\\"  <br />[ 1996, Prouty, L. Fletcher; JFK, The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy ] <br />     <br />But who was at the top of the pyramid, and why was John F. Kennedy murdered? That's the big one...we will probably never know. The only question left to all Americans to ponder is whether or not the assassination of JFK ultimately was advantageous or detrimental to America. How can we ever really know this truth? Maybe the truth lies within the hearts and minds of the people, and that is where it should stay. The Warren Commission stated that Lee Oswald was the lone \\"nut\\" assassin of president Kennedy. Here in lies the crux of the matter vis-a-vis the sentiment of the American public before conspiracy became a household word. Any other truth is simply too terrible to consider. But we must keep open minds that do consider the possibilities, and no matter how dark the forces, they must be confronted publicly with determination and courage. America belongs to us, the people, and so do our leaders.  <br /> <br />Oliver Stone's movie, JFK, will help to bringsome of these issues to light. Recommended.  <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Why do you think the duet format has been so irresistible over the years? Whether it's Dolly Parton hooking up with a then-recognizable Kenny Rogers or a more unlikely team of Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello, the match-up always seems to intrigue people. I know it does me. From a marketing standpoint, it's also a brilliant move. I may not have bought a Lionel Richie album, but I was certain to if Diana Ross was involved. Duets go way back, and for good reasons. The latest being the wonderful, if not unconventional pairing of Dire Straits rocker Mark Knopfler and the silky voice of country/folk crooner Emmylou Harris. Of the 12 tracks, there are 10 original penned stories from Knopfler himself, while Harris adds one of the most gorgeous tracks, \\"Belle Starr\\" to the set. The only thing missing is that after hearing the Harris original, it makes you wish she would've had a bit more input. But don't despair, her sensational vocals are all over this set, whether it's harmonizing on the opener \\"Beachcombimg\\" or singing full and strong on the spectacular \\"This Is Us,\\" which happens to be one of the best tracks on the CD. Other highlights include \\"Rollin' On\\" with Knopfler on harmonies, \\"Right Now,\\" and the gorgeous and heartfelt ballad that closes the set, \\"If This Is Goodbye.\\" When the pair equally share the stage, the results are truly splendid. If you're a fan of either one of these artists, you will not be disappointed. If you're not a fan of either, I bet you will be after hearing these songs sung with lusciousness. Knopfler and Harris take the duet format and turn it into a wonderful marriage. In other words, it's a perfect match.
B000055Y0X|5.0|It is incredibly hard to get people to laugh at their own stupidity at the very time in which the stupidity is at its height.  This movie is the quintessential mockery of Mutually Assured Destruction.  Humanity's capacity for reason is so great that the products of reason, atomic bombs, can wipe out the very existence of every rational creature.  That this fact is harrowing is clear enough.  That this fact is funny is difficult to fathom, but the absurdity which such a comic insight requires is captured so beautifully in this movie.  No one is so great at being the caricature of a war-monger as George C. Scott.  No one is as capable of making the absurd seem real as Peter Sellars.  Every little detail of the film takes some swipe at the politics and social idiosyncracies of the early 1960's and late 1950's.  I still get kicks out of the famous line: \\"Gentlemen, please! I won't allow any more fighting in here, this is the war room!\\" If I have botched the exact phrasing of the line, it is only that I've adopted into my own vocabulary as a great example of sarcasm and irony.  The Cold War is funny in a very serious way.  It is not trivial, but ferocious.  This is the type of film that makes the audience renew their contact with the politics of the period and laugh at its very serious implications for the current day.  Satire does not get better than this.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I love this movie. The scenery is incredibly beautiful. Twelve-year-old Pai's journey to touch her grandfather's heart and reclaim what she knows is hers is very empowering.<br /><br />Pai, the whales, the spiritual customs of the Maori, the soundtrack and all the other wonderful characters combine to make an amazing movie you will want to watch over and over again.<br /><br />I rate this a must see.
B00005JO20|4.0|A super colossal screen spectacle. There are moments in this film that are so intense, my wife refuses to watch it again. The makeup and special effects are top rate, even haunting at times; giant man-eating insects and really eerie looking natives. Probably a little more than the average under 12 year old needs to see. The dinosaur stampede was a little hard to believe though, well done but hardly survivable. We're talking smash-city for everyone involved! Very touching at times, this Kong probably garners more sympathy than previous screen Kongs, and the New York scenes will keep you guessing; \\"how'd they do that?\\" Especially when you consider it was shot largely in New Zealand. Very well done, but not quite the box office runaway that was expected.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Most of the adaptations of Robert Ludlum's books have either gone straight to TV or sunk without trace that is until now! It was with a mixture of excitement and tredipation that I went to see The Bourne Supremacy, especially since I thought the 1988 TV miniseries version with Richard Chamberlain was so bad. But how wrong I was. And its successor, The Bourne Supremacy was even better. <br /> <br />Here is the basic story - Jason Bourne is living in India with his girlfriend, having escaped the clutches of the CIA. He's still haunted by nightmares of his previous life, but at least he's safe - or so he thinks! Soon he finds himself framed for a murder he couldn't have committed and has to come out of hiding to prove his innocence. He's back on the run - and with even more at stake! <br /> <br />Matt Damon is again excellent as Jason Bourne (or is that his real name???), and Brian Cox is up to his usual fine acting skills in reprising his role as the slippery Ward Abbot. The only thing I was sorry about was the lack of the feisty Franke Potente in the movie - I won't ruin it but she only appears for a bit. <br /> <br />Will Bourne clear his name? Can he evade capture? One thing's for sure, he's not happy. Now it's personal. It's not just a quest for justice - he's hell bent on avenging Franke Potente's death as well. An exciting and thrilling ride I'd recommend it for anyone who likes 24, Tom Clancy novels, or Alias.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is one of those CD's that makes you say \\"I told you so\\" as in \\"I told you this CD would kick major @$$\\"...I mean what else would you expect from Lamb of God?  The CD opens with the brutal 'LAID TO REST' with it's brilliant guitar work throughout and insane chorus lines it sets you up for one of the best tracks on the CD 'HOURGLASS' with impressive quitarwork (I may say that a lot for these guys really know how to play their instuments)  And I LOVE the drumming throughout, the constant symbal throughout the verse is great and the bridge is brutal as he chants \\"It's only getting worse\\"...'NOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DIE FOR' is just insane, it's like emo meets metal...and it's okay, but not a favorite, but as usual, the bridge is KILLER!  'THE FADED LINE' is my favorite track ever put out by the band.  It's just brutal and brilliant and it represents everything that is Lamb of God.  'OMERTA' is a song about violence begetting violence...well, isn't every song here...Great musicionship...again.  'ONE GUN' is freaking brutal, heavy and hard hitting.  Randy Blythe, the lead singer, is just perfect for this music, almost as if he was grown for thsi purpose alone.  'ONE GUN' is truly one of the best tracks here.  The closer 'REMORSE IS FOR THE DEAD' is brilliant, with amazing guitar work and beautiful melody for the intro and breaking into brutality!  A great way to end an impressive album!
B000001GRZ|5.0|My initial introduction, and still my favorite.  When I hear Fournier's playing, it feels as though he's moving in perfect rhythm with the music rather than actively bringing it into being.  Add this transparency of motion to the broad sonority of his tone, and you get something that must come as close to the full depth, vibrancy and expansiveness of these compositions as what Bach must have heard when they first came to him. <br /> <br />
B000BBOUCW|5.0|What can you say for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children? How about this: it's a flawless masterpiece. Taking place just two years after the beloved Final Fantasy VII video game, A.C. continues the story of the game in perfect fashion, keeping true to the roots, as well as keeping the story of FFVII just as compelling as it was in the game. I don't want to say much more about the story(so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet), but I will say that the story you mainly follow this time is once again that of Cloud, his buddies Tifa, Vincent, Barret, etc., and Cloud's inevitable transformation back into a hero, after attemping to live a life of solitude. The story is made even better by the excellent voice acting done by both the english and japanese actors. In a lot of movies of this caliber, you don't always have that, but the way they perform the dialogue just keeps you hooked on their every word all the way through the movie. The music in the movie is done perfectly, syncing up with the action at all the right times, keeping you excited and waiting anxiously for the next action sequence. As for the cgi animation in the movie, it's almost too good to describe, but let me try my best here. Firstly, let me give as much credit as possible to the cgi team. It's clear they put a lot of their time over the past few years working on making everything from the characters, to the scenes, to the areas and environments look absolutely, uncompromisingly perfect. They've succeeded in masterfully making something so visually stunning, you'll want to see it again and again. And having it portable just makes this slice of Heaven even sweeter. The porting of the movie to the PSP is done extremely well, making it just like watching the dvd. All the action, music, voice acting, and visuals are just as equally pleasing on UMD as on dvd. So, overall, I highly recommend that if you have a PSP, and you're looking for a masterpiece of a movie that you can watch anywhere, reward yourself by buying this movie for it. You'll never regret it. Really. I hope this has helped anybody wondering whether or not to buy this, and I hope you like it. Enjoy!!!
B00005GL0W|5.0|MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE Beatles song has got to be I AM THE WALRUS, from this strange Beatles album of 1967. This album was in a small way part of the whole PEPPER experiments of that year. MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was actually released as an EP in the UK, and contained the songs that fill the first half of the US version (Capitol was always cashing in by making their own versions of the records on our side of the sea). Today this US version is the exclusive version both here and in the UK, the only Beatles album to stick with it's US tracklist, over the original UK tracklist. ANYWAY... the first handful of songs are great, some of my faves no doubt come from the bizarre movie from which this album gets it's name. BLUE JAY WAY is another exceptional Beatles track.. the instrumental FLYING is cool.. The songs that were eventually added that were eventually added come like this... STRAWBERRY FIELDS/PENNY LANE was the first of the Beatles \\"Pepper\\" stuff. This single was released a few months before the SGT PEPPER album, but the songs were not included,.. so a few more months down the road they ended up on here.  Though these are some of the best rated BEATLE tunes, I'm not really fond of PENNY LANE.. I find that song makes me cringe... but everything else is worth the price of the album. ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE was recorded live for a world television broadcast in 1967, and ends with a huge sing along of stars, and children, and people and whatnot. Its good stuff. HELLO GOODBYE is a cool tune Basically, this is just another good Beatles album, sort of like SGT. PEPPERS volume II, as it contains all of the OTHER stuff The Beatles did in the psychedelic sixty seven.<br />FOOL ON THE HILL sort of makes me wanna kill myself though, with that melodramatic horn stuff... no thanks. BABY YOURE A RICH MAN makes up for that nonsense, later on of the disc. \\"Keep all your money in a big brown bag, inside a ZOO!... Nothing to do!\\"
B00005JNQS|3.0|Robots is a pretty good film that will probably keep your kids occupied and entertained, at least the first time they watch it. It's a fairly entertaining light family film with some good moments and just enough comedy to hold your attention, even if much of that comedy involves Robin Williams doing jokes that seem like hold-over material from the TV show \\"Mork & Mindy\\". But then your kids aren't old enough to know what that show is, so they won't be aware of the recycling. What this film really did for me was make me appreciate Pixar more. Unlike the maker of Robots and other recent high-tech CGI films, Pixar starts out with a solid story idea and THEN develops the CGI and the gags to support that idea. Technology has gotten to the point where dazzling effects are easier to do and cheaper than ever and filmmakers are forgetting that audiences ultimately want to see an interesting story, not a dog-and-pony show of the latest in graphics effects with a storyline that has the complexity of a 1930's serial thrown in to hold it all together.<br /><br />So, if you have small children, it might be a worthwhile purchase. If you are an adult, however, I think you'll be somewhat bored.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm very dissapointed that Radiohead won't make another album. They graced the world with such wonderful music in their 10-year-reign. But at least they left with a bang. Hail To The Theif was a great follow-up to Amnesiac (Radiohead's most underrated album). Hail seems to be a combination between the poppy grunge of Pablo Honey and the mysterious, electronic beats of their next 4 albums. Songs like Sail To The Moon, Wolf At The Door, and, the best of Hail, A Punch-up At A Wedding, are some of my favorite Radiohead songs. 2+2=5 reminds me a little of their songs off Kid A- particularly Optimistic. Stand Up Sit Downis really strange (but really good!). It seems to be a cross between of Karma Police (Ok Computer) and Pakt In Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box (Amnesiac). When I say that those songs remind me of other Radiohead songs, I don't mean those songs sound like complete copies of their originals, I'm just saying that they remind me of them. Hail To The Theif is 100% original- just like all of Radiohead's other albums.<br /><br />Needless to say, I highly reccomend this to all Radiohead fans, and anyone who has good taste in music!
0399103422|5.0|\\"The Godfather\\" transpires around World War II, following the Corleone family in their quest for money and power amidst rival syndicates wishing to dominate New York.  Even though the era restricts relating the storyline to the contemporary age, the concise chapters flow skillfully between flashbacks and the unfolding events.  The many characters have great strengths along with obvious flaws providing formative alliances and well-crafted conflicts.<br /><br />From a humble beginning in Sicily and rising as a successful \\"olive oil importer\\", the highly intuitive and brilliant Don Vito Corleone captures the reader's attention as if he is present within the room.  Surrounded by powerful catch phrases and subtle remarks while treating others with courtesy and respect are valuable assets in his personal relations.<br /><br />As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movies prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any fan of the gangster genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When I bought this, I was jobless and nearly broke. So what? This movie was worth the money... Take into consideration just how (nearly) broke I was, which made that money worth a lot more. I've watched this movie over and over. I took my parents laptop (without permission) to school on the day which I have classes all day so I could watch this in between classes. I got in trouble I guess, but so what. I can't go more than 3 days without watching this! <br /> <br />The script is wonderful, and all of the actors are perfect for this movie. It's an ensemble, so big shot actors aren't needed. It really helps out the story.  <br /> <br />Sci-Fi, spaceships, morality, no aliens (Star Wars-esque), a BELIEVABLE depiction of the future... What more could you ask for? <br /> <br />That's one of the main reasons this movie is so great - the depiction of the future. Just becase it's 500 or 600 years in the future doesn't mean we've come any closer to discovering aliens. America and China basically dominate the cultures, we have to find new planets to live on. No crazy aliens, just reavers. <br /> <br />Ah. I'm rambling, but I really love this movie.
0671801511|4.0|Ten Little Indians (And Then There Were None), Agatha Christie<br /><br />There is a classic murder mystery story known as \\"the locked room mystery\\". Someone is found murdered in a room locked from the inside. No one could have left the room! How did it happen? In this story the locked room is an island where no one can enter or leave. The ten people on this island are murdered one by one. An old nursery rhyme of \\"ten little Indians\\" provides a blueprint for the mysterious deaths. Logically, the last survivor would be the presumed murderer, by the process of elimination. But what if this assumption was wrong? It may not sound rational but this story makes it appear so.<br /><br />Ten people are invited or hired to visit Indian Island off the coast of Devon. After a good meal there is a recorded voice that accuses them of murder. The visitors begin dying off in the manner of that nursery rhyme. After searching the island they realize the murderer is one of the guests! Knowing this does not prevent more deaths. This story keeps your interest until the very end. Scotland Yard cannot figure out the solution until a message was found in a bottle at sea. The movie version modified and enhanced this story. No plan is ever perfect because of the many things that can happen.<br /><br />This is an example of the classic English murder mystery. The murder exists to provide an intellectual puzzle to entertain the reader. The participants are mostly the middle-class, not average people. The scene is in a large house owned by a rich man. Raymond Chandler pointed out the differences in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\". Most murders occur because of lust or greed, to get it or to keep it. Chandler commented on the highly artificial murder plots which multiply clues that experienced detectives would see through.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon), Walk The Line chronicles the life and times of legendary country music star Johnny Cash with an intense, and sometimes dark, intimacy. Following on the heels of the previous year's Oscar Award-winning picture Ray, based on the life of Ray Charles, I entered the theater under the mistaken impression that Walk The Line would be a cookie-cutter attempt to capitalize on the various themes of that picture's commercial success. But although the dramatic personal struggle with drug addiction is prevalent in both films, Walk The Line was more than able to stand on its own as a powerful and impressionable big screen biography. And just like the aforementioned film, you leave Walk The Line with a renewed interest in the music of Johnny Cash and a deep personal attachment to the lives of Cash and his likeable wife, June Carter. <br /> <br />Directed by James Mangold, the talent behind such notable films as Kate & Leopold (2001) and Identity (2003), Walk The Line begins in the rough and tumble world of Depression-Era Arkansas where a young Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) tends to the family cotton farm with his parents and older brother. Early on, a family tragedy strains the relationship between Cash and his father, providing a glimpse into the epic moment that would shape his life forever. Soon after, the film jumps to the early 1950s where Cash perfects his guitar talents while stationed overseas in the Air Force. His marriage to high school classmate Vivian Liberto lands the two in Memphis where Johnny supports the family as an appliance salesman while pursuing his musical interests on the side. Here, Cash founds The Tennessee Two with bassist Marshall Grant (Larry Bagby) and guitarist Luther Perkins (Dan John Miller), and the trio plays its way to a music deal with local label Sun Records. <br /> <br />As part of a promotional campaign, Cash is put on tour with other \\"rockabilly\\"newcomers Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Carl Perkins (Johnny Holiday). But during his tour with the quartet, the life of Johnny Cash takes numerous turns. He meets the affable June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), begins an addiction to amphetamines and alcohol, and watches his marriage to Vivian deteriorate under the strain of his constant absence. All three would come to define the next fifteen years of Cash's life as he struggled to triumph over his personal demons. Despite his all-encompassing drug addiction, Cash nevertheless manages to crank out hits, but his personal life hits rock bottom following bouts with divorce, loneliness, depression, and his continued drug addiction. When Cash reunites with June Carter in a musical collaboration, the magical bond between the two is amplified. But Johnny's addiction threatens to ruin everything they've built together... <br /> <br />The most impressive aspect of Walk The Line, aside from the storyline itself, is the performance of Witherspoon and her counterpart Phoenix. Amazingly, both provide their own voiceovers, and for the casual listener, very little difference can be detected between the Hollywood talents and the real life country music legends they impersonate. Much was made of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the days leading up to the film's release, but I came away more impressed by Witherspoon. Apparently, so did the Academy because they awarded her their highest honor for the role. What stood out the most was the actress's down-to-earth smile and charismatic mannerisms. She created a character with ample assertiveness, yet one that burst at the seams with an infectious optimism and love for life. As such, the audience can't help but fall in love with June Carter. In addition, Witherspoon displays an amazing singing voice that accurately captures the distinct and unique aspects of June Carter's talent. Overall, Walk The Line is a fine film, and a fitting remembrance to the career and life of country music's greatest icon, Johnny Cash...
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Ok, there's no screaming. <br /> <br />There's been some controversy about this.  Avenged Sevenfold were known as much for their constant screaming vocals as much as their metal thrashing, but on this album, there's nary a shout to be heard, besides the opening growl in \\"Beast and the Harlot\\".  The official explanation is that the singer's throat got seriously injured from all the shrieking he was doing and had to get surgery, and now it's too dangerous for him to continue doing so, so now he sticks to more traditional, sometimes-nasal singing.  Some fans have cried conspiracy, saying it's all a lie, and that they stopped screaming because they've sold out now that they're on Warner Brothers.  I have two arguments against this.  One, there are thousands of witnesses from A7X concerts who can testify the singer was unable to scream properly like he used to without obvious pain, and two, if they're trying to sounds mainstream, why do they continue to make songs that regularly cross the seven-minute mark?  It just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br />On to the record, City of Evil.  It is a little different style from Waking the Fallen, in addition to no screaming, the music itself has shifted from hard/metalcore to something a little closer to speed or hair metal.  It's still very enjoyable and performed admirably by the guitarists, but it's different.  Another change is the lyrics.  They've started to swear now for some reason, and there are some lyrics that are actually culturally relevant, like in the politically-charged \\"Blinded in Chains\\" (which also has a very cool fade-out ending) and the tributes to Hunter S. Thompson and Dimebag Darrell in the single \\"Bat Country\\" and \\"Betrayed,\\" respectively. <br /> <br />Some other good songs are the strong, epic ballad \\"Seize the Day\\", the cool \\"Sidewinder\\" with an awesome intro, \\"The Wicked End\\", which features strong guitars and a bizarre, cheesy, but very enjoyable Lord of the Rings-esque interlude, and \\"Trashed and Scattered\\", which everyone else seems to like a little more than me. <br /> <br />What Avenged Sevenfold has released here is another very strong, technically incredible, and enjoyable metal album.  My only complaints are that some of the songs drag on a little too long and the singer's voice tends to get a little annoying in spots.
B0002IU988|2.0|Myles Kennedy is clearly a better singer than the \\"Barfighter\\" Scott Stapp. They rock out more on this album and mellow out more also. It is lighter and heavier than Creed. Overall the songs are spotty and some are as banal as Creed's were. Here's a rundown of the tracks. <br /> <br />1. Find the Real - Stays trapped in the formulaic nu-metal norm. It never gets off the ground. 3/10 <br /> <br />2. One Day Remains - Swirling guitar riffing and solos and perfect song for Myles vocally.  9/10 <br /> <br />3. Open Your Eyes - Very Creedy with improved vocals from Myles.  9/10 <br /> <br />4. Burn it down - nice soaring ballad with a addicting bridge. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Metalingus - Nice heavy riffing, a little formulaic, but it rocks plenty.  8/10 <br /> <br />6. Broken Wings - Another very well written and sung ballad, another Creedy style number. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. In Loving Memory - Sappy, but well sung and well played  6/10 <br /> <br />8. Down to my Last - Formulaic and done before but it works in their favor. Solid song but disposable.  7/10 <br /> <br />9. Watch your Words - Horrible attempt at a darker song! Comes out boring and does not work for Myles' voice. 3/10 <br /> <br />10. Shed my Skin - So sappy it makes me cringe. 2/10 <br /> <br />11. The End is Here - Almost Listenable at times, not bad. 5/10 <br /> <br />Overall Avg = 5/10 Below Average release <br />Not a bad album! Just finishes horribly and they need to be more creative, like that will happen. Myles kennedy presents great vocal range, but he won't excell too much in this Christian nu-metal sound of Alterbridge. He will be better off in a power or a real heavy metal band where he can shine. All this time I blamed Scott for Creed's downward spiral due to his obsession with religious content in the music. It turns out it was a band effort after all. They are all to blame. Myles leave Alterbridge before their religious influences consume your talent as a vocalist, unless you are into the Christian rock sound.  <br />
B00000IPAX|3.0|There's not really much to say about Enema of the State that hasn't been said.  It's pretty standard pop/punk with pretty standard and unimpressive musicianship and pretty standard attempts at humor.  Blink-182 tries to write funny lyrics and put a bunch of jokes in their music videos, and it makes all the people who watch MTV laugh, but we all know it makes for sub-par music. <br /> <br />It's not really bad, the band is pretty competent at writing catchy, accessible tunes.  It's just pretty unremarkable.  You listen to the album (or, if you're an average fan of this kind of music, two or three songs), enjoy them a little while they're playing, and then you forget about it and move on.  Blink-182 doesn't seek to blow you away or build up to any significant payoffs, they just sing about some shallow topic while playing some chords for a few minutes, and then move on to the next topic. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are interesting enough to warrant attention.  \\"Adam's Song\\", which you've probably heard, is a genuinely affecting somber melody about a suicide, and is unfortunately followed up by \\"All the Small Things\\", one of the most irritatingly popular songs of all time.  It's not that catchy and actually one of the least funny tracks.  \\"Anthem, Part 1\\" is, like its title implies, an anthem, one for teenagers who don't like their parents very much.  It's not that special on its own, but what's cool is that the next album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, starts out with the second part, which creates an interesting link between the two records. <br /> <br />Enema is fairly decent punk, but it isn't really worth spending your money on at this point.  Its cultural significance has passed, and it contributes very little to music as a whole.
B000001ESP|4.0|Moving pictures take Rush into the 80's writing and playing more textured grooves like Limelight and Witch Hunt. I never cared much for YYZ, but the rest is rock solid. Tom Sawyer is obviously one of their best thanks to neil peart's superior drumming. Moving pictures is not quite a great album but it may be their best 80's outing. Limelight is a timeless and classic tune and one of my favorite Rush songs. Camera is too long even though the song is well done. They could had take a couple of minutes off and it would have been better. Overall a very well done effort by Rush, but nowhere close to their best album. Of course that title belongs to 2112, what else!
0393035158|1.0|I wish I could be so kind as to say in regard to this book that there is, \\"...nothing to offend, and nothing to recommend.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately the book succeeds only in offending (thus it receives 1 star), and still has nothing to recommend. It does not provoke discussion or thought; rather it is the end of all reasonable discussion. If all people of faith are at core indistinguishable and undifferentiated from radical fundamentalists (terrorists), then there is no ground for discussion. In fact, the logical thing to do would be to round them up and send them to concentration camps to remove the contagion of faith. <br /> <br />That this book should find a market is an indication of just how profoundly ignorant we have become of the Western Canon, our own history, the history of Science, the role of the Church as carrier of the ancient seeds (books) from which the Renaissance blossomed. <br /> <br />At heart this is a blustering rant of pseudoscientific, and sophomoric ramblings against; religious institutions, mysticism, spirituality, god in all forms, faith in all forms, whole categories of belief systems; and all great cultures (Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Buddhist at a start). <br /> <br />The thesis depends upon the vague notion that if we can forget the past (not a hard thing for those who never learned it to begin with, see Hitler Youth), and start anew with no history (and therefore no religious institutions or habits of thought) that we will more rapidly advance to the bizarre Buck Rogers inspired vision of the future that the author holds as his God. <br /> <br />But, there is no impetus, no imminent threat, no urgent need, and no mechanism for erasing history. Attempts by political leaders to erase history in the last century resulted in Gulags, State sponsored terrorism, governments spying on their own citizenry, killing fields, War, and Genocide. <br /> <br />The author contends that religious institutions are the source of all social and political strife... the root of all social ills. He fails to demonstrate how this explains the long list of wars and atrocities that were the legacy of 20th Century, and that appear to be continuing into the 21st Century <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that the author fails to build his case on historical, rational, scientific, moral, spiritual, psychological, or even neurological grounds. Rather, he attempts to build his case by employing a collection of rhetorical tricks; hyperbole, repetition, the statement of assertions as if they were facts, a whole range of logical fallacies (the apparent success of which is itself a condemnation of our \\"education\\" system), and mostly the deionization of his most hated thing: Religion in all it's various forms and shadings, the thing which must never be defined. <br /> <br />It is easier to attack a thing if it is not defined, easier to hate a thing if it is left in the shadows, in the dark. This is why the enemy must never be seen in clear light, must never be defined. Religion for this author is a base creature of darkness and shadow. This is why the author must conveniently ignore the Enlightenment, and the role that the Church played in birthing, playing wet-nurse to, and funding the development of Western Civilization (Art, Culture, Music, Science, History, Medicine, Ethics, etc. ad nauseum). <br /> <br />The author does not have enough integrity to define his terms; faith, religion, progress, science, spirituality, civilization, mysticism, etc. ad nauseum. Instead he casts aspersions, and by insinuation paints pictures full of emotional content; phlegm and vitriol. In doing so he is demonstrating the great lesson of the 20th Century, that we no longer need God as the touchstone of our prejudices and hatred; all we need is florid language and theatre ala Nuremberg. <br /> <br />Leni Riefenstahl could do great things with a script based upon this book. Tribalism is not the exclusive territory of the Church. It is a base humanurge woven into the fabric of our genetic code. It is an expression of our simian roots, not a product of our mythos. Monkeys engage in warfare, and tribal conflict routinely. If Churches were the cause of this malady, then one would logically expect monkeys to build churches. But they don't, QED. <br /> <br />War, and terror, and suffering would not stop tomorrow even if God were banished, religion expunged, history erased; our pre-frontal lobes wiped smooth and clean. Even in the author's Buck Rogers fantasy future mankind's lizard brain, and vestigial urges would remain. There would however be no place of refuge, no sanctuary, no peace from his relentless verbal abuse. His vindictive diatribe and mean spirited rantings and ramblings; and those of his host of like minded emotionally excitable rationalists, ahistorical historians, and unscientific scientists. <br /> <br />There is nothing to recommend the future this author has in mind, and there is no path from here to there except through the killing fields. What the author has invoked is a new tribe. A tribe of supermen unconstrained by any school of thought, set of values, or institution. Righteous fanatics in Buck Rogers clothing walking, talking, and thinking in lockstep. <br /> <br />The point being that religious institutions are spontaneously self generating. You can ban them, burn the people in the Synagogues, stone the people in the Mosques, and nail those in the church to crosses, but the vacuum left by these institutions will be rapidly filled by something, some new thing, a religion by any other name. <br /> <br />Frankly, this is an inefficient way to get the clergy to wear Buck Rogers uniforms, erect futuristic houses of worship, and support interstellar travel. This has all been done before, in Constantinople, in Berlin, in Warsaw, in Moscow (and in every corner of the United States where Native people once lived). Wouldn't it be easier if the author just formed his own institution, an institutionbased upon vitriol and spite; dedicated to the principle that everyone else is stupid and wrong, and committed to heaping abuse upon them until they either convert or shut-up. <br /> <br />Well, if the majority of other reviews here are indicative, that is what he has done, created a virtual church at amazon.com dedicated to righteous intolerance and the abuse of others. <br /> <br />I for one, will not be drinking any of your cool-aid. I am a product of the Enlightenment. I have been inoculated by an historical understanding, and a liberal education. I believe that spiritual matters are personal, and should not be discussed in mixed company. Would that the author had such a sense of propriety. His prescription offers no remedy, illuminates no course of action, and offers no progress, no hope, no peace. <br /> <br />The key conflation in this book (its greatest sin, to sin is to miss the mark) is between Tolerance and Compassion. This trick appears to be intended to confuse \\"Liberal Tolerance\\" and \\"Political Correctness\\" with Compassion, fellow feeling, or the golden rule. There is no doctrine of religious tolerance in any religious institution of which I am aware. This idea exists only in the author's florid imagination. <br /> <br />There is however, the golden rule, the golden mean, and compassion. This nearly universal concept has somehow escaped the author's ostensibly deep study of history and religion. I am not tolerant of fanatics (even fanatical authors and ignorant hate mongers), but I am compassionate. This is not a contradiction, rather it is at the core of what a spiritual life is about. Pity the poor author for he knows not what he does.
B00097DX3U|2.0|Chris Cornell and company can certainly crank out some really compelling songs. Songs like Your Time has Come work as modern rockers. However, the good songs are predictible and very disposable. They either are playing formulaic rock or trying to become an emo act. These emo type songs are so boring, they should not be played in your car stereo. Chris's voice seems passionless and strained. Tom Morello attempts at playing different and innovative guitar solos outside the norm. There are many times Tom's solos sound nothing like the actual song being played. The solos are awful and make me cringe, it is that bad. Tom Morello is an accomplished guitarist, but he is not as good as Kim Thayl. Kim was able to connect with Chris Cornell's voice with Jurassic riffs and shredding. Tom Morello simply has a different style which does not work with Cornell's voice and it shows on this album as well as their debut. Besides, these guys have become a prototype radio rock band. Chris needs to leave the former Rage Against the Machine and retrace his roots.  I don't ever expect Chris to form Soundgarden again. Chris should go back to creating his solo material. At least his solo album Euphoria Morning was creative and ambitious, notlike this commercial pop borderline emo, nu-metal they are playing now. Please Chris record by yourself, your solo album are much more superior!
B0002IQHY8|2.0|I'm not sure of the percentage, but a good deal of this is just plain crap. You who buy it, even you Parsons fans, get your can openers out to open the can because that is what you are going to get--Canned Music. I give it two stars because there is one pretty decent song, but one pretty decent song does not make an album. If you are into electronica and not musicians playing real instruments, you will really enjoy this probably. If you respect a little electronica, like me, but prefer to hear a lot of real instruments that Bairnson and the others used to provide, go to the back catalog of Parsons.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|this is a pretty good movie. It's very musical and outstanding. I thought it would suck, but it was awesome everyone should see it. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musci in the film rocks. The soundtrack is sweet to, you should check it out. this a a pretty good musical.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Hole's \\"Celebrity Skin\\" was their best creation. I love \\"Live Through This\\" as well but \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is more commercial and vibrant, not so dark like their previous records. It's a real shame that this talented band is not together anymore. They made some unbelievable music as a whole. All tracks are worth a complete run-through. \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is such a cool song, love it first time I heard and saw the video. Dying is the best track,\\"You leave with everything I am.\\" \\"Boys on the Radio\\" and \\"Heaven Tonight\\" are catchy and less serious than the rest of the tracks, but Courtney Love sounds tremendous, vocally brilliant, and oozing with great songwriting ability. \\"Malibu\\" and \\"Hit so Hard\\" are warm and mellow. \\"Playing your Song\\" is one angry song, very reminiscent of Hole's earlier work. \\"Petals\\" is poetic and epic, the album closer, \\"Tear the petals off of you and make you tell the truth.\\" \\"Reasons to be Beautiful\\" and \\"Use once and Destroy\\" are hard-rocking songs. \\"Awful\\" is not awful, \\"He's drunk he taste like candy he's so beautiful.\\" The most haunting track is \\"Northern Star\\", could be about the death of her husband Kurt Cobain, \\"And I beg you, no loneliness no misery is worth you...\\" \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is the sexiest rock album I have ever heard, also check-out Love's solo effort, \\"America's Sweetheart\\".
B000BTJCRM|5.0|The first song \\"Colossal\\" sort of reminded me of a mix between Rush, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath.  From there, the album sort of progresses like an excellent wine.  There are hints of Kiss, Blue Oyster Cult, and Cream noted, with powerful overtones of Sabbath.  The vocals are great, the guitar work assaults your ears, and the bass/drum lines rattle your skull.  You can't help but think of Volkswagen buses, black lights, and the first oil embargo.   <br /> <br />One of the bands these guys will be compared to is undoubtedly Jet, just because of their country of origin and style.  I liked Jet, but they sounded like a 21st century band doing 70s rock.  It was almost like they were trying to sound 70s and forcing it.  These guys sound like a 70s band doing 70s rock and freaking sound GREAT doing it.  It all flows so well and there doesn't seem to be any effort to make it a certain genre or style.  A buddy of mine brought this disc home after heading Down Under for some R&R during the winter, and I had it for about two days before he demanded it back or I was going to lose some tire pressure and a tiny amount of blood.  I gave it back, but already preordered the U.S. release (28 clams is a bit high for me) and have to wait until it lands in my greedy hands and drops into my home system for maximum crankage.  I'm fully anticipating the neighbors knocking on the door wondering what the hell is going on.   <br /> <br />If you even ever thought Black Sabbath, Rush, etc. sounded good at the height of their musical power in the 1970s, GET THIS ALBUM.  It's like opening a Christmas present that Mom left up in the attic way back in 1974.  If you're too young to remember the 1970s, get it anyway and introduce yourself to the genre through Wolfmother.  I hope that this is the beginning of a rebirth in the world of rock....
0375758992|4.0|Generally, I avoid reading memoirs because I find them to be trite and distastefully emotional.  However, Fuller's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, about the author's experience growing up white in Africa, pleasantly surprised me.  Simple and sincere, Fuller avoids judgment of herself and others as she relates her difficult life with neither sugar-coated poeticism nor the sensationalistic `woe-is-me' attitude one might expect.  She is truthful with herself and with the reader: she does not apologize for her family's racist attitudes, but neither does she justify them.  Likewise, Fuller's unconditional love for her mother underlies her necessarily harsh descriptions of her alcoholic mother's mental instability.  Remarkably, the book interweaves crucial social issues-such as racism and the effects of revolution on all facets of society-with universal, yet gently personal, themes of familial love, self-discovery, and a sense of belonging.  This candid portrait of an extraordinary girl's pains and joys is worth the read.  Thoroughly uplifting, it is fresh and full of life.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna has shown maturity over her previous album. My fav. songs are SOS, Unfaithful, Kisses Don't Lie, Dem Haters, Break it off, We Ride, Crazy Thing Called Love. There is something on the album for everyone as it does not cover any one genre. I am particular looking for the release of Kisses Don't Lie as it is a fusion of ROCK and REGGAE ( very interesting). <br /> <br />
B000AA305M|5.0|First, let me suggest to those of you who are pondering whether or not to purchase this CD - purchase IT!  Second, there are many on here who do not think that this CD is better than White Ladder, which it's not, but it is just as good, and in it's own right.  These people have to criticize his newer albums so they can lay claim to \\"being there from the beginning\\" with Sell, Sell, Sell and The EP's, etc... <br /> <br />Well, I've been there from pretty early on, and this CD takes a new turn.  Yes, there is less guitar and more synth, also I think that cellist from Damien Rice's CD is involved as well as her voice.  Many legendary artists change their style, and if this knocks fans off the bandwagon, that's even better.  This is basically a CD you can listen to from start to finish.
B00005JOYA|1.0|Even without knowing the background of this game to movie, it was HORRIBLE.  The acting was so bad no wonder they didn't release this to the critics.  Even the 6 kids that I took to see this, and know the plot, thought it sucked.
0156030209|5.0|Yann Martel is a very witty writer, as he shows with a funny and humble introduction about how he found Pi Patel as another novel he was writing at the time was sputtering out.  In Life of Pi, there are elements of faith, religion, nature, God, and fidelity, yet the writing is never preachy or pious.  The story is gripping at times and serene at others.   <br /> <br />There are many editions of the book, and I liked having the \\"student edition.\\"  It was easy to carry around and read anywhere.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First of all, in order to appreciate Advent Children's storyline, one must play through the PS1 Final Fantasy VII. Alot of the little subtle touches of the movie will make much more sense. <br /> <br />It's not 100% necessary though, since most of my friends haven't played the game, yet thouroughly enjoyed this movie. Everything is beyond perfect, the visuals, the action, the sound effects, the music; everything is oscar worthy in my eyes/ears. Especially the choreography; I have yet to see a movie that uses Nomura's unique style of camera work. Also, don't believe the \\"fan boys\\" claiming that the English version sucks. I've watched the Japanese/subtitled version like 10 times before the US release, and the English track is easily just as good, if not BETTER than the Japanese language track. Even the mouth movements match like 95% of the time! Definitely no complaints there!  <br /> <br />Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks are all like 10 years behind when you compare any of their movies to this...hands down!! <br />I can ramble on for days over this masterpiece of art and sound; just go out and buy it, rent it, do whatever you have to do to see this movie!!!!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Anyone watching this movie must accept it on its own merits apart from any prior expectations.  For example, if you see \\"Constantine\\" with the expectation of Oscar-worthy performances, you are almost certainly going to be disappointed. <br /> <br />\\"Constantine\\" is an entertaining and action-packed ride, and Keanu is a fitting lead actor for the part.  The main source of John Constantine's angst stems from a portion of Catholic doctrine that says that suicide is a mortal sin; thus, he is doomed to hell.  However, after committing suicide, he was allowed to come back and try to \\"atone\\" for his mortal sin in any way that he could.  This backdrop should allow anyone watching \\"Constantine\\" to appreciate the depth of the plot while overlooking occasional bad acting.  The special effects are great as well as believable, and the ending ties everything up nicely with a bow while at the same time leaving room for a sequel. <br /> <br />The fifth star is for the fact that this movie is NOT a remake.
B00005NTJK|5.0|I can't count the hours I laid in my college dorm listening to this album with headphones (well, not *this* one, the original vinyl) and it introduced me to jazz/rock/metal/prog all in one.  So many layers...  Benefit is in my Top 5 of all time albums, and I love Teacher and hate to see that Ian Anderson hates it!
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Music should be something that marks time in a way that to each of us is personal and unique. As our audio wallpaper in life it should be interpreted and celebrated as something we find difficult to impart, yet draws us into a rhythmic cycle that is intuitive to the individual and brings a feast of friends to a banquet of   symphony.  Rock and Roll should defy categorization and genre regardless of the criticism of those who somewhere forgot it's about the feel and not the marketability. Once in a while someone isn't afraid of standing on the centerline defiantly, middle finger in the air, challenging not just the establishment ,but all of us indiscriminately.  <br /> <br />      Rob Zombie simply stands alone on the Rock and Roll highway defiantly watching the sunset, understanding why the road is empty where he stands now. There are no maps, no directions, you do not find this place.......it finds you. <br /> <br />     It's not stepping out of the box so much as making your own box to step out of in the first place.  <br />Zombie doesn't shy away from his influences, he blatantly wraps his arms around them and turns them inside out, creating something unique and undeniably his own. With \\"EDUCATED HORSES\\" Rob Zombie pays homage to those influences by absorbing his influences and giving us something more than memorable. This isn't a pose we are given. This is defiant and this is rebellion, but most of all this is honest. After the long delay between  solo recordings there is the temptation to try and second guess the direction and even the integrity of the film maker returning to the entertainer. Most of us would have been satisfied with \\"HELLBILLY REDUX\\".  Rob Zombie stands apart from us shaking his head, defiant to the end. <br /> <br />    EDUCATED HORSES\\" is \\"SINISTER URGE\\" evolved. It is \\"HELL BILLY REDUX\\" with a twist of  danse macabre and a pinch of pop. Zombie continues to refine and master the art of storytelling whether it is on celluloid or through his music.If you were to doubt the eviloution for a moment, those thoughts would flee with the opening of  \\"SAWDUST IN THE BLOOD\\". The perfect written metaphor could be that Rob Zombie has come knocking at your door with.... \\"AMERICAN WITCH\\" he teaches us a valid lesson in how you get someones attention. Grab them by the ears and pull them in without regard to pleasure or pain. There is no skipping tracks here in anticipation. Rob pulls us in for the ride and we are here for the duration. \\" FOXY, FOXY\\" grooves nicely. If your foot isn't at least twitching to this anthemic rocker than you have some serious issues. \\"17 YEAR LOCUST\\" with its eastern overtones and bombastic beat  should draw you in and spin you round a few turns. \\"THE SCORPION SLEEPS\\" has a rhythmic flow within the  <br />lyricism that transcends pop culture. It's sexy and it puts all pretenders to shame.  \\"100 WAYS\\" gives us creepy and gives us bumps in the night. \\" LET IT ALL BLEED OUT\\"  pours it out in slabs of  attitude as you slip through the pounding rhythms and a hoarse shout through the chorus. If there was an early favorite that haunts me all the right ways its \\" DEATH OF IT ALL\\". Rob Zombie doesn't do ballads, but this is one sexy  ride that needs an open highway on a dark stormy night and a preferably warm companion. We floor the pedal for \\"RIDE\\" after a nice little touch of haunting piano. Pulsating rhythms, walls of guitars crashing down, park that import, this is a muscle car winding down the never ending  highway of night. John 5 does this proud with some great guitar work to close this baby out. \\"THE DEVILS REJECTS\\" is the shadow to the light that was the film. If you can't see the opening minutes of the film running through the back of your eyes with  this sweet little number, than its time for a refresher of the film. Maybe not as perverse as \\"HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CORPSES\\" but just as sexy.  We close out with \\"THE LORDS OF SALEM\\" straight up front with no apologies. As with the recordingas a whole. Its got a more organic feel than the previous solo efforts. The Rhythm section of Blasko and Tommy Clufetos is tight and John 5 shines more than may be expected. Of course it's the vocals with the passion and conviction they carry that overshadow the bands performance.  <br /> <br />    Without Alice Cooper there may not have been a Rob Zombie. Without Rob Zombie we would forget the back roads and highways of Rock and Roll. Everyone else finds a dead end alley, Rob Zombie shows us an open road that is infinite and unforgiving. Take a chance and roll the dice. Step out to the centerline. It's less crowded here and in the dark its always dangerous, but the company is infinitely better. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I bought this album purely because the CD cover looked cool. No joke. What can I say, this band is GREAT. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Nightwish or Evanescence, you'll dig this band. Awesome melodies and great vocals. <br /> <br />Top songs: <br /> <br />Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)   <br />Pale   <br />Forsaken   <br />Angels   <br />Memories    <br />It's the Fear   <br />Somewhere
B000063DGC|5.0|This album established Rhoads as my favorite guitar player. If you thought that his work on the studio albums was awesome then prepared to get blown away. Randy's solos and fills here are amazing. This is a definite must have for any fan of Randy's work. The band on this album is really tight and Ozzy does not shoot out cuss-words everywhere (like he does on Live and Loud) so you can enjoy this with your kids/parents/whoever. The music perfomed on this album is just spectacular. If you are a Van Halen fan then i also highly recommend buying this album. If you are into the whole 80s rock thing in general then this album is one i highly recommend looking into. I do not understand how any guitar player could not have immense respect for Randy Rhoads. This is a great live album from Ozzy but i consider it's main purpose is to be an album to showcase what Randy's full potential was before he died. This album establishes Randy as a full fledged guitar god of the 80s, his squeeling fills are just amazing, if you have not heard them then you have no idea what you're missing. Overall this is just a great 80s metal (except Ozzy won't just sing about sex the whole time like most others of the era) live album by Ozzy's greatest line-up ever, or at least until No More Tears.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|Not sure whats up with Amazon's Reviewer, but in my opinion this album is awesome.  I am a long time Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler fan and enjoyed this album from the first listen.
B000002572|5.0|This is one of the greatest debut albums ever recorded.  It and Foreigner's debut are probably the most perfect first records by any band.  Unfortunately for both Boston and Foreigner, it was down hill from there.  Boston's first with \\"More Than A Feeling\\", \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\", \\"Smokin'\\", \\"Peace of Mind\\", \\"Rock & Roll Band\\", etc. was, in my opinion, slightly better than Foreigner's debut.  Brad Delp's vocals and Tom Scholz's guitar were the driving forces behind the band.  Especially Brad Delp's vocals.  He is one of the best rock & roll singers ever.  John Lennon, Joe Elliott, Robert Plant, and Brad Delp are the top four, as far as I'm concerned.  This is a great, great record and it's a shame that they couldn't keep up the high level set here.
B000001FTD|5.0|I remember first hearing Indians on MTV's Headbanger's ball.  It was so good I got goose bumps and the shakes after the shots of adreneline, wore off.   I popped this cassette into my good friends Chevette, long before Wayne's World ever cam out. We rocked so hard we nearly bottomed out the suspension. Every track off of this CD will make you want to get Caught In A Mosh.  I think this is the hardest album that Anthrax has. <br /> <br />If you like Rust in Peace, Master of Puppets, Cowboys from Hell, Among the Living is on par with such albums.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|the action and effects in this film are the greatest i've ever seen <br />nomovie even comes close. as a fan of the game i was so glad <br />to see these characters again. must buy.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|A pity that both these artists couldnt hole out in a studio for a month and get that energy on this CD. Wishing that would happen in their next venture. A great album overall and a great substitute  for Ambien (sans the side effects). Mark Knofler seems to reserve his best lyrics for a collobarative venture and surely has written some of his best here.
B000EGDC14|3.0|It is a good album, i'll give you that, but the reviews were so extraordinary, i was expecting something out of this world. It's good, a couple of songs are very good, but the rest are kind of boring... sorry, i know i'm disagreeing with almost everybody, but that's my opinion.  <br />
B00005JOIH|5.0|First, I will offer a confession. When \\"Munich\\" first opened in theaters late last year, I was very interested in seeing the film but I was also a bit hesitant. Given the current \\"political correct\\" atmosphere surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - where anyone who is even remotely critical of Israel is immediately branded a Nazi or anti-Semite - I thought for sure this movie would be nothing but your standard Pro-Zionist/Pro-Jew/Pro-Israeli, anti-Arab propaganda as we get on a nightly basis from the Fox \\"News\\" Channel. However, I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumptions... <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised that Munich is even-handed in its approach and does not resort to a one-sided condemnation of Palestinians and Arabs. The film follows the aftermath of the 1972 massacre of several Israeli athletes by Palestinian gunmen at the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The Israeli government is eager to take revenge for the massacre, and forms a small task force of espionage operatives to carry out the assassinations. <br /> <br />The central question this film forces the viewer to contemplate is whether or not the whole \\"eye for an eye\\" mentality is productive? Sure, Israel took out the gunmen responsible for Munich, but in turn, gave rise to an even more militant segment of terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah - which led to more retribution against innocent Israelis (entailing more bombings and killings of Palestinans). The cycle goes on and on and on...and nothing is ever solved. <br /> <br />As you watch this movie, do not expect to walk away with any answers. This is not a film that tells you what to think. Instead, it is a movie that forces you to grapple with a very grim subject matter. In my opinion, Munich is to the Israeli-Palestinian  Conflict what Do The Right Thing is to race relations. <br /> <br />I gained so much more respect for Steven Spielberg for having the courage to make this film. As a Jewish American, Spielberg certainlydidn't win any friends within the Zionist movement, but he stood up for principal and has given us the most timely, best-made film on terrorism we have ever seen.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Take it from someone who grew up with heavy metal and listened to these albums as they were being released, and seen these bands in concert promoting these albums, not someone just starting to listen to heavy metal. This is an album that revolutionized the speed metal genre. There is no simpler way to say this ---  It is by far the greatest speed metal album ever made.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Monday 6th March 2006 was a milestone day in the life of Rock 'n' Roll. It was David Gilmour's 60th birthday, the day he chose to release his third album under his own name 'On An Island'. His first solo album for eighteen years, and his first significant studio recording, since  he recorded with his old band 'Pink Floyd' their swansong album 'The Division Bell' in 1994. The results are staggering, easily the best solo album to be recorded by a Pink Floyd member as a solo artist including his own two solo efforts 'David Gilmour' (1978) and 'About Face' (1984). There was also a live DVD and Video put out. The first two David Gilmour solo works are fine albums, with some good songs, including the first glimmerings of 'Comfortably Numb'. But space is made for the actual song structures leaving little room for David Gilmour's shimmering guitar work. Pink Floyd solo albums have never really caught the public's imagination until now. Pink Floyd's first leader, songwriter and guitarist Syd Barrett left the band in some mental disarray in 1968. Released two solo albums 'The Madcap Laughs' and 'Syd Barrett' both in 1970, and are best summed up by the title of the first album. It would be kinder not to mention drummer Nick Mason's forays into solo work. Richard Wright has released three solo albums The first released just after Roger Waters had kicked the founding member and keyboard player out of his own band, 'Wet Dream' (1978) which while it has it's musical moments is an understandably bitter album, In 1984 Richard Wright released 'Zee-Identity' in collaboration with Dave Harris. Then in 1996 we were presented with 'Broken China' a much happier affair. Roger Waters albums are all a matter of opinion 'The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking (1986), 'Radio K.A.O.S' (1987) and 'Amused To Death' (1992) and this year we have been supplied with an album of Opera music under the Waters banner of 'Ca Ira'. Whatever you think of any of the solo Floyd albums none of them have exactly set the charts alight, until now.<br /><br />David Gilmour joined 'The Pink Floyd' in 1968 when Syd Barrett was becoming just a little too spaced out to work with. Since then he has worked on eleven (If you count the studio half of Ummagumma). Studio albums by the band, although his contributions to 'The Final Cut' (1983) were minimal. As well as two magnificent soundtrack albums. The first six albums were all group collaborations, (after the first album without Gilmour was definitely a Barrett effort). Including the classics 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' (1973) and 'Wish You were Here' (1975). By the following album 'Animals' (1977) Roger Waters had rather taken over the band, and although 'Animals' is a fine album with some excellent guitar from David Gilmour, the themes were all Roger Waters. By the time of 'The Wall' in 1980 Roger Waters was the complete leader of the band dictating every move including the removal of Richard Wright, who was kept on for the Wall tour as a session musician. Mind you the best two songs on the album were co-written by David Gilmour 'Comfortably Numb', and 'Run Like Hell' which featured some of David Gilmour's finest guitar work and vocals. 'The Final Cut' was recorded under the 'Pink Floyd' banner but was a Roger Waters solo album in all but name. David Gilmour played the guitar he was told to, Nick Mason did not even play all the drums, and Richard Wright had long gone.<br /><br />In 1985 Roger Waters declared the demise of Pink Floyd and the commencement of his solo career, it never occurring to him that the others might carry on without him. But after a quick breather that's exactly what they did. Gilmour and Mason, quickly recalled Wright, and now with Gilmour firmly at the helm of the good ship Pink Floyd, the greatest Space Rock band in history started off on another journey where no man has gone before under it's third Captain.<br /><br />Of course there were then many tedious court battles as to whether Pink Floyd could continuewithout Roger Waters and who owned what, far too many to go into here, but suffice to say that the Gilmour led Pink Floyd released two studio albums 'A Momentary Lapse Of Reason' (1987) and 'Division Bell' (1994) both of which topped the charts all over the world whilst the tours sold out all across the face of the planet, and any other planet that would have them, two double CD live albums were released to celebrate each tour, 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' (1998) and 'Pulse' (1994) which also went number one across the oceans finally ending up triple platinum sales, and will only be officially released as an extended DVD this year twelve years after the event. Meanwhile Roger Waters career went slowly down a black hole, with ever decreasing crowd attendances at concerts and dwindling album sales.<br /><br />Hatchets did get buried long enough for Pink Floyd to reunite (Without Syd) for an appearance at Live 8 last year to play 4 songs (You cannot count 'Speak To Me'). But any thought of a complete reunion tour or new Pink Floyd recordings are the mere pipe dreams of the fanciful.<br /><br />But here we have ten tracks from David Gilmour that could be in all but name the follow up to 'The Division Bell'. David Gilmour has surrounded himself with some of his musical friends and come up with an absolute corker of an album. The album has gone straight into the International charts at number one and long may it stay there.<br /><br />Track by Track, the album opens up with an instrumental 'Castellorizon' (\\"What else\\" as Basil Fawlty would say) which drifts in with ambient sounds, which leads us into a beautiful languid David Gilmour guitar, where the notes pour out like liquid gold, pure magic. The title track features the gentle harmonies of David Crosby and Graham Nash, before a big guitar finish. 'The Blue' rather sets the tone for the album leading us away from Pink Floyd and into the blues. 'Take a Breathe' is a fully fledged rock song with the whole band wigging out over the riff with Gilmour's guitar excelling. 'Red Sky At Night' is a heavily orchestrated instrumental with a lot of the credit going to the orchestration skills of Zbigniew Preisner and the production work of Chris Thomas and Phil Manzanera, it is also the first track that David Gilmour has ever played Saxophone on. 'This Heaven' is almost touching rhythm and blues territory, with the band giving David Gilmour plenty of space to show off what a great blues guitarist he is. There is also a stunning cameo organ solo from sixties star Georgie Fame. 'Then I Close My Eyes' leads us back into slightly more familiar Floydish material, part of it's charm comes from David Gilmour playing a cumbus, a, six stringed Turkish instrument resembling a banjo. For 'Smile' the mood stays quiet but uplifting, and for someone who likes Pink Floyd music this could put a smile on your face. 'A Pocketful Of Stones' is the albums central piece around which the album is built and could come straight from 'The Divisional Bell' itself, another great guitar work out number. 'Where We Start' in the cyclical nature of this set piece of an album is borne out by the title of this album closer. David Gilmour wrote all the lyrics, and plays all the instruments apart from the drums, very apt.<br /><br />On six of the songs as in 'The Division Bell' David Gilmour is helped in the lyrical flow by his partner Polly Samson who gives the lyrics a very poetic feel. 'On An Island' is given an extra Pink Floyd touch by Richard Wright appearing on some of the tracks, there are many other star musicians and friends on the album including B.J. Cole, Chris Stainton, Willie Weekes, Robert Wyatt, Jools Holland, and Andy Newmark. But all in all this is a David Gilmour album, and what's more David Gilmour at his very best. 'On An Island' must finally put David Gilmour up there with his peers Eric Clapton, and Jeff Beck, as one of the greatest rock guitarists on the planet.<br /><br />The David Gilmour Band have already started the European leg of their tour from March 10th through to some North American dates finishing on May 31st. Wisely leaving behind blow up pigs and dancing laser shows, and concentrating on the music instead, naturally there will be a lot of songs from 'On An Island' played but leaving room for plenty of old favourites. But if you have not already got a ticket, your to late as all the shows are sold out.<br /><br />By Mott The Dog.<br /><br />Dazzed by Meow The Cat.guitar excelling.

0393307050|5.0|With the death of C.S. Forester in 1967, the publishing industry lost its most popular writer of Naval tales set during the age of sail. In an attempt to fill the gap, J.B. Lippincott signed an unknown writer by the name of Patrick O'Brian to write some novels set in the same period. <br />O'Brian was a good choice. He was quite familiar with the sea and had published a sea story earlier (\\"The Golden Ocean\\"). As for the author himself, he was pleased in fulfilling the request. He began his research and quickly found his model. Basing his novel onthe Mediterranean voyages of Lord Cochrane and his sloop the H.M.S. Speedy, the resulting book, Master and Commander would be the inaugural book of a astounding 20 volume series. <br /> <br />As for the book itself, it's a superbly written story that has all the grace and eloquence of a Mozart violin concerto. I am now reading the series. <br /> <br />A word for the beginner. It should be noted the Mr. O'Brian doesn't just write about the period, he writes OF it. Many critics have noticed the literary similarities between him and Jane Austen. This is a most apt comparison. <br />With that said, someone starting Master and Commander might be put off with his writing style. My advice is to give it a chance, say the first 100 pages. Once you make the adjustment to his writing style, the book flows after that. <br /> <br />Bon Voyage!
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|In a world that rejects the unfamiliar, Felicity Huffman goes against the grain to portray a man who yearns to be the woman inside.  We all have that person inside that we wish we could be, but most of us dont have to life altering surgery to become them.  The movie has its funny moments but its focus is on the internal drama of Bree (Huffman) and the son she didnt know existed.  Just weeks before the big day (the surgery to become a woman), Bree finds out she has a son, and he is in trouble.  She has to put her life on hold to bail him out.  the odd couple then set out on a road trip that leads them full circle to each other and the people they thought they were.  A poignant and telling story about the i inside.  A must see for all.
B00000DQSV|5.0|The song Notorious I think has earned a place in the dictionary of funk, it still sounds classic 20 years later, and ofcourse it's been used by P Diddy and sung on B.I.G.'s Nasty girl giving it some credibility of sorts. Skin Trade, Vertigo, American Science and So Misled are other awesome funk odyssey's that make you wonder what critics were on about labelling them 80's pop icons and pin up idols. After all this is a point where they lost many of their screaming girl fans, but gained new listeners who discovered that they had wronged a great band. Half of the album is more melodic with tracks like Hold Me (I don't know why but I hear Pearl Jam in this) and A matter of feeling, two stand outs which are among their best songs ever. Then there's the dark and wintery, Winter Marches on, my favourite on the album. Just love those cold atmospheric synths and Simon's voice on it. The album flat out rules, every minute of it, so get this one immediately.
B0002IQEHI|4.0|Starting with a pale-green Leo the Lion (the trademark of MGM), Saul Bass creates a vibrant title sequence, seamlessly transitioning from an animated crisscrossing of animated black lines to a real-life skyscraper reflecting the bustling traffic of New York City below, all accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's most underrated musical score. This splendidly sets the stage for the fast-paced action of the film set to follow. It is here we meet Roger Thornhill, the protagonist of our story, played charismatically by Cary Grant, as he rushes to a business luncheon, dictating his memos to his secretary who is feverishly trying to keep up with him. Even from this brief encounter we can sense that Thornhill has an air of confidence about him (too much perhaps) and acts frivolously and boorish to anyone other then himself. To his loyal secretary he sums up the seemingly unethical life he leads, \\"Ah, Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie. There's only the expedient exaggeration. You ought to know that\\". It is ironic therefore that he should later be so trusting of Eve who in turn deceives him through `false advertising' and leaves him betrayed by her `expedient exaggerations'. <br /> <br />As Thornhill arrives for his business luncheon at the famous Plaza Hotel, he remembers that his mother is playing bridge at a friend's house at that very moment and she can not be contacted at home as he has instructed his secretary to do (to reminder of a play they are attending that evening at the Winter Garden Theatre). Unfortunately he remembers this small detail just as the taxi carrying her pulls away. A little annoyed, he shrugs it off and goes inside. It is however this minor detail that will set off a chain of events which will ultimately lead him to a ledge on Mount Rushmore, far from his laidback world in New York City. Before he conducts business with his clients at lunch, he calls for a busboy the precise moment a page for a Mr. `George Kaplan' is announced over the hotel's PA system. Two henchmen laying in wait for this `Kaplan' assume Thornhill is the man they are looking for and as soon as he walks away from his table to send a telegram to his mother, they grab him and take him off in a car to their boss's headquarters. <br /> <br />Grant's dry wit and acid humor is the driving force of this picture and it works expediently well. Upon hearing of a dinner party at the Townsend residence as he is dragged by the two henchmen to their boss's office he exclaims, \\"By the way, what are we having for dessert?\\" And when he is confronted by a man who claims to be Lester Townsend (later we learn that he is actually a foreign spy named Philip Vandamm who has taken up residence at the UN diplomat's home for the time being) about what he, or rather what Mr. Kaplan, knows he replies, \\"Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theatre this evening, to a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that\\". A tall glass of bourbon is then forced upon, making him entirely bombed. The two henchmen then plan to place him in a car and have Mr. `Kaplan' drive himself off a cliff. Things don't go quite as planned and somehow Thornhill is able to grab control of the wheel and drive manically through oncoming traffic. This as well as the booking scene which soon follows are classic. Seeing Grant, an actor notorious for his serious demeanor, pretend he's drunk is priceless. <br /> <br />Hitchcock manages to truly put himself into the mindset of his audience. Having just watched Thornhill weave intoxicated in and out of traffic, the precise moment we query to ourselves as to where a police officer is during all of this, a police car's sirens blare as he is in pursuit of Thornhill. <br /> <br />Having been made a fool of by his abductors (when Thornhill returns to the Townsend residence with his lawyer, mother, and two police detectives in tow to investigate his claim, Mrs. Townsend - in reality Vandamm's sister - greets Roger Thornhill as Mr. Kaplan and coyly insists that Kaplan became quite drunk at their little dinner party the other night), he returns to the Plaza Hotel and breaks into Mr. Kaplan's hotel room to see who this man truly is. He is then chased by the same two henchmen who abducted him the night before from the hotel to the United Nations Assembly Building where Lester Townsend works. However the man he meets is not the same man who had him abducted at the Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, a knife is thrown into the back of Mr. Townsend (presumably aimed for Roger Thornhill but missed) and coincidently (wink-wink) a photographer is right there in the Assembly Building to `capture' Thornhill holding the murder weapon in his hand and standing over the victim's body. Not only does Thornhill have to track down this George Kaplan and figure out why these foreign spies want him disposed of, he must also clear his name of a murder he did not commit, all while avoiding the detection of either the police or the foreign assassins. <br /> <br />After learning that Kaplan is headed for the Hotel Ambassador East in Chicago, Illinois, Thornhill decides to pursue this mysterious man and clear him name. In a quick call to his mother Thornhill tries to convince her that for a man on the run from the law traveling by train is safer then flying. \\"Well, because there's no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me...oh, you want me to jump off a moving plane?\\" which is of course a foreshadowing of the famous crop-dusting sequence later on. Recognized by the sales clerk working at the ticket counter booth, he successfully sneaks aboard the train destined for Chicago and is concealed from detection by the police by a platinum blonde bombshell named Eve Kendell, played scintillatingly by Eva Marie Saint, who he bumps into on his way aboard the train. <br /> <br />The two meet again a few moments later at dinner (we later learn that Eve tipped the waiter five dollars to seat him with her if he entered the dining car). Roger and Eve, perceptibly attracted to one another, exchange sexual innuendos over dinner. She reveals to Thornhill that she knows exactly who he is and what he is accused of, but she doesn't care. He asks her why. She responds, \\"It's going to be a long night\\" and that she doesn't \\"particularly like the book\\" she's started. Inquiring as to whether he has picked up on her sexual proposition, he replies, \\"Uh, let me think. Yes, I know exactly what you mean...\\" She then invites him to her drawing room in Car 3901 (a reference of course to Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps which this film is modeled after) where further double entendres are made by the two lovers to make the censors squirm. As they kiss passionately, she lets him know that she's `a big girl' to which he responds, \\"Yeah, and in all the right places too\\". Wanting to know more about him, acknowledging his taste in clothes and food, he quickly retorts, \\"...and taste in women. I like your flavor\\". However, Hitchcock bows to the censors and forces Thornhill to sleep on the floor.  <br /> <br />Easily one of the most identifiable sequences not only of director Alfred Hitchcock's career but in all of motion picture history, the crop-dusting scene in North-by-Northwest is magnificently choreographed to the hilt. Roger Thornhill, traveling by bus so as to ensure that he is alone, is led to a desolate cornfield in Illinois under the pretext that he will be Kaplan. In reality this is merely a bluff, a plot by the foreign spy organization to lure Thornhill into a false sense of security and eliminate him with the least amount of witnesses as possible. However, Hitchcock does not simply deliver the sequence to the audience, Heaven no. He builds us up with excitement and anticipation when the moment finally arrives. He does so by having Cary Grant stand alone on a deserted dirt road while cars pass by occasionally. Does Kaplan actually exist? If so, will he show? And then what? The tension builds. Suddenly a car drops a man off on the other side of the dirt road and takes off. Is this Kaplan? Hitchcock couldn't make it that easy, could he? He must be an assassin then. But before we even have time to query our suspicions, the man points out to Thornhill that the crop-duster across the way is dusting a field with no crops. As soon as the man boards a bus and is out of sight, the crop-duster proceeds to terrorize Thornhill by running him down. He hides in the cornfield to no avail; the plane sprays the crops with poisonous pesticides, forcing Thornhill out into the open. Thornhill successfully flags down a gasoline truck just in the nick of time, causing the crop-duster to swerve out of control and crash head-on into the gasoline truck, creating a marvelous explosion. <br /> <br />After tracking down Eve at the Hotel Ambassador East, the same hotel George Kaplan was suppose to be staying at (`Kaplan' supposedly checked out a full two hours before Eve called his hotel room and claimed that she had arranged a meeting between him and Thornhill - the encounter with the crop-duster in the cornfield), he pursues her to an auction where he is confronted by Vandamm and his two henchmen. He provokes a fight and uses the police escort to escape Vandamm's henchmen who were lying in wait for him. He is then taken to an airport where a kindly ol' man referred to as the Professor brings him up-to-date on the situation (Eve, Vandamm's lover, was recruited by the C.I.A. to spy on Vandamm who in reality is a foreign spy trafficking government secrets in and out of the country - `importer/exporter' as the Professor refers to his occupation as which is a coy reference to `The Man Who Knew Too Much'). Realizing Eve may be exposed and presumably killed by Vandamm, he flies out to Rapid City, confront Eve, and pretends to be critically wounded by her (a gun loaded with blanks) so as to convince Vandamm Eve isstill on his side. <br /> <br />Leonard, one of Vandamm's henchmen, doesn't trust Eve and for good reason. Vandamm on the other hand believes him to be jealous of his mistress, clearly a homosexual allusion. \\"You know what I think? I think you're jealous. No, I mean it. I'm very touched, very\\". Leonard then exposes Eve for the fraud she is, firing her gun with blanks straight at Vandamm. He is of course left unharmed but stunned and (emotionally) hurt. He knows what he must do, choosing to throw her off the plane as soon as they are over water.  <br /> <br />The crescendo of crescendos in North-by-Northwest is the chase scene on top of (what appears to be) Mount Rushmore (but because the government would not allow the famous director to shoot such a sequence on top of a national monument, gigantic busts created on a soundstage out in California and rear projections were used instead). The film ends with a scene in which Eve, dangling dangerously over the edge of Mount Rushmore, struggling to hold on to Thornhill's hand transitions immediately to him pulling her up to their compartment bed aboard a train heading east after they are married. It properly sums up the entire atmosphere of the film - sadly and deliciously absurd (to quote the federal agent earlier in the film, \\"It's so horribly sad. How is it I feel like laughing?\\").
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film plus Peter Stormare and Tilda Swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles. Weisz, Hounsou Stormare and Swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Rachel Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie.  <br /> <br />
B00005QW5X|5.0|Someone is always trying to shove it into a musical catagory. Or always tying it in with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but Hedwig and the Angry Inch is in a catagory all it's own.  <br /> <br />This is an outstanding rock movie that, even if you are uncomfortable with the sort of gay movie genre, you will quickly learn to accept and love because of Steven Trask's excellent writing ability that makes you feel for the characters and respect the music. <br /> <br />Seemingly, a satire at first, tells the story of a boy who learns about life, the hard way, through a series of misfortunate things that happen to him and a wacky mother, in East Germany. Eventually after a catastrophic event, he finds himself in America, where life doesn't get any better; all the while searching to find himself, while trying to make his fame and fortune in the music world.  <br /> <br />If you're not sure, rent it first. I can guarentee you will fall in love with Hedwig, the men and women, and the music he so dearly loves.
B000002OX5|5.0|This thing is just perfect.  From the awesome songs to the show~stopping \\"opera\\" Rael to the hilarious, bizarre faux commercials, Sell Out is a masterpiece.  Worth owning for Rael alone. <br /> <br />Ivan Rorick
B0009HLDFU|4.0|This is a great double CD, but I'm just going to come right out and say what no one is talking about: there are some very unusual themes in there, I mean for alternative rock at least. <br />If you listen to the lyrics, the whole thing sounds like it's being addressed to a deity, and Dave appears to be working very hard at figuring whether he (or maybe it's really the listener) is serving the good one or the bad one.  Don't get me wrong, I'm no religious fanatic, but these lyrics reference a lot of Christian themes, and it's consistent.  Is Dave Grohl going Christian Rock, or what?  <br />I mean look at what's mentioned in the songs: afterlife, damnation (\\"say your prayers\\"), choosing life or death, mortality, damnation again, making one's peace, being saved from ghosts and visions, being shown the way, \\"every time I wonder I go under\\" (unquestioning faith), being reborn, being \\"forever yours (beneath the dirt)\\", losing all to find \\"you\\", a \\"miracle\\" ... on and on. I'm not making this stuff up - it's in almost every song. I just thought somebody ought to talk about it. The songs remind me of Rumi poems, where you can't tell whether he's talking to his lover or \\"the Beloved\\". -Verrrry interesting. <br />Uh, oh yeah, and it is truly a great album, what an ambitious project, keep up the good work. I'm serious.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|The only problem I have with this movie is the performances of DeNiro and Pesci.  They are just too similar to their work in Goodfellas.  It seems almost like some kind of encore.  Other than that, excellent movie in the vein of Goodfellas and Mean Streets.  Not as good as those two msterpieces but on the same level.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Ivan Rorick
B00005JOIH|5.0|What could you expect from a two and a half-hour picture based on actual events and telling about Israeli government avenging their olympic team members killed by palestinian terrorists during Munich Olympic Games of 1972? Well, not a breathtaking, action-packed thriller, that's for sure. I thought it would be long, boring, didactic and over the top pompous. Even the presence of Steven Spielberg's name in the credits couldn't inspire me. Now I'm glad I was wrong on all counts. Yes, it was long, but of that kind when you wish a film had never ended. It's neither boring nor didactic nor pretentious.<br /><br />Young Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) is given a task to eliminate the members of \\"Black September\\" terrorist organization with the help of a group of fellow agents. And that's what they do during two hours and a half of the screen time - locating and killing Palestinian terrorists one by one. \\"Munich\\" could become one of the many political thrillers about confrontation of different countries' intelligence services. It could raise some serious questions of historical importance and be overly-political. But Spielberg did an amazing thing with this global story - he transferred it to the personal level. So this story turned out to be not about countries, governments and intelligence services but about ordinary men. A country's vengeance was laid upon one man's shoulders, and that's how we see it - through his eyes. Along with him we will question the righteousness of his task, we will doubt, we'll see how a revenge appears to be ineffective and reasonless (as it always happens) especially if it's a revenge in a global scale: terrorism is like hydra - you cut one head off and two more emerge in it's place. We see how Avner who dedicated his work and his life to the country he loved ends up feeling useless and knowing that from now on his life is in danger. Furthermore he understands that for the sake of some illusive goal he put at risk the lives of his loved ones - his wife and child. \\"Munich\\" is the story of another zealous man who was grinded by the millstones of big politics and governmental interests. And finally this story leads to an eternal conclusion that you can't beat violence with more violence. You can deteriorate everything, unleash something you couldn't imagine in your worst nightmares, but you can't defeat violence doing the killings yourself.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg demonstrated his immense talent again taking this epic and well-known story, drawing some ordinary people out of it and still making grand and philosophical conclusions.<br /><br />Great film - awesome acting performances, brilliant cinematography (as always by Janusz Kaminski), interesting subject, entertaining yet thoughtful story-line, clear message which is at the same time not obsessive or annoying - prime Spielberg I'd say. Definately one of the best pictires of the last year undeservingly unmarked by the Academy award.s - his wife and child. \\"Munich\\" is the story of another zealous man who was grinded by the millstones of big politics and governmental interests.

B00009TB5G|2.0|I don't understand the adulation these movies have received from their fans.  Especially the Two Towers.  Lots of fun if you like endless UGLY battle footage.  And mud. <br /> <br />Ivan Rorick
0767827716|4.0|I'm not particularly a fan of horror movies and I couldn't fix an ailing automobile if my life depended on it so the workings of cars don't fascinate me.....but this movie fascinated me. <br /> <br /> The '58 Plymouth Fury, alias \\"Christine,\\" is absolutely gorgeous. What a piece of machinery!  <br /> <br />This is a horror story but there are no ghosts or monsters nor is there any gore. A car is the star of the film, a very jealous and vengeful one at that. Man, that sounds silly but, if you're reading this you have probably watched the movie so no sense going into details. It's hard to describe the story in a paragraph without it sounding stupid....but it's not. Maybe the quickest way to explain it is that it is about a car that is alive, like a human, and you mess with it, you pay! <br /> <br />It is definitely one creepy, well-made, unique and always-entertaining film. By the way, the car is a lot better than any of the people, sad to say. No, I didn't like any of the kids in this film (high schoolers who all look 30 years old!) and the language is a little too rough in spots, but the car, the '50s music, the unique story, the satisfying revenge angle all make this very watchable.
B000286RKW|5.0|I was just blown away by this film when I first saw it and have re~watched it several times since.  Unlike the silly romanticization of the Godfather or the antihero nonsense of Tarantino's films, Goodfellas shows the grim reality of organized crime in all its depressing glory.  The temptation to turn gangsters into romantic antiheroes is great, but Scorsese resists it and goes totally in the opposite direction, and thus accurately captures the true stroy he is trying to portray.  That acting is perfect, and the oldies soundtrack fits the action beautifully.  I can't recommend this highly enough. <br /> <br />Ivan Rorick
630542828X|5.0|On my first viewing of this, on VHS, I thought it okay but nothing special, but when I obtained the DVD and I looked at it again - wow! <br /> <br />The DVD brings out the cinematography which is very, very good and the picture is razor-sharp. One of Hollywood''s Hall Of Fame photographers, Conrad Hall, shot this film. Story-wise, the courtroom scenes were the most dramatic of the film but this story dealt more with the behind-the-scenes digging of information to expose thoughtless businessmen who had dumped poison in an area and people were suffering because of it. It is supposedly-based on a true story. <br /> <br />Another big highlight of this movie is great performance by John Travolta, perhaps his best work ever. Just the pauses and looks on his face alone greatly enhanced his performance. He was just fascinating. Language-wise, this is pretty tame except for William H. Macy, who loses his cool a few times as the assistant lawyer/financial man for the law firm battling the polluters. <br /> <br />It's easy to get involved with the story, but don't overlook the great photography in here.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|He said it is unbelievable for Daniel Craig to play a South African since he is blond haired, blue eyed. That is not unbelievable. South Africa is primarily white people. Charlize Theron is from there.
B000022TSF|4.0|No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already. I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California. <br /> <br />There is nothing confusing about how this DVD looks. It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail. <br /> <br />What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing: a man's nose getting sliced. Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a \\"nose job\\" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing \\"Jake Gittes,\\" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here. I love the way he sounds and acts, and I'm sorry he had such a short role. <br /> <br />Overall, an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Silent Hill takes you from place to place and room to room and maintains a good and frightning story line right to the end. <br /> <br />There are inovations in creatures and CGI effects that I've never seen done before. This is one of the reasons why I think this movie is special. <br /> <br />Instead of relying on gore or in your face horror to scare you, Silent Hill weaves a quality experience that draws you into it's Hell and keeps you there like a game you just have to play to the last level. <br /> <br />Would anyone willingly continue their search in Silent Hill like the mother in this movie does, I think not, but maybe you would? Go see it, and be damned in Silent Hill for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br />
0783116934|5.0|Here's an oddity: a modern-day film about a serial killer which has no fight scenes, nobody is seen dying, no car chases and no loud noises.....and it takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific.  It's based on a very disturbing true-life story. The killer's name was Andrei Chikatilo, a name which will live in Russian infamy.    The film is mostly detective work, and how much red tape the poor lead detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very somber movie, and \\"somber\\" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), as well. Yet, the story is not depressing and it's very interesting all the way through. Rea is outstanding as the determined, harried-looked detective    Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer. Donald Sutherland  plays the only character who has some warmth.    This is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well-known but is well-liked by the people who have seen it.  Don't pass this by just because you haven't heard much or anything about it. I'm glad to see over 80 reviews here. Amazon readers are aware of this amazing story.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie truly is a must see! Not only did I laugh really hard, I stayed interested the entire time...rent it or better...buy it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a late-comer to the party, but since my local FOX network channel played fast and loose with initially airing any episodes of FIREFLY, the only partial one I saw when it was televised seemed like way too much effort to pick up on when I could evel find it, despite my predilection for both science fiction and westerns.  When it started showing on the SCI-FI Channel as a prelude to SERENITY's release I gave it another chance and was completely hooked from episode one.   <br />Love the space-western motif.  Love the characters. Mal has enough of Han Solo's characteristics to be attractive, but is very much his own man---shouldering defeat at the hand of the Alliance and continuing the rebellion in ways big and small (I'm a Southerner, so I know about that.).  Zoe is great to watch because she's such an interesting blend of estrogen and testosterone; she follows orders as long as they're right.  Walsh's Hawaiian shirt says a lot about who he is and his mellow wit---Zoe's a lucky woman.  Kaylee sets up another deconstructive paradigm like Zoe's: sweet, but openly sexual; fabulous with machinery but very girly.  Jayne is the Wookie of the group without a trace of cuddliness---how Adam Baldwin manages to make us like him, I don't know.  Shepherd Book is a study in contrasts as well because, in the midst of his Zen-ness, he's quite a warrior-sage.  Anara's beauty and grace almost blind us to her wisdom, strength, and tolerance.  Simon and River Tam round out the crew, creating a dynamic tension between reason and madness, academic skill and enhanced ability as a walking weapon. <br />Yeah.  I love it.  I love the Western feel---complete with the occasional horse and saloon---contrasted with sailing in space watching out for Reavers.  I love seeing the crew face moral and ethical dilemmas, watching who wins and looses and why.  I intend on enjoying the whole series from time to time as well as watching SERENITY to round it out.  Now . . . may we have another movie, please?
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The reviewer below, I'm sorry but no one wants your opinion. Everyone else loves this great movie. I bought it the day after it came out. It was sold out in the first 3 places I searched. Once I got it, I was blown away from the very begining. Oh, and the voice acting was almost perfect(though it would've been awesome if Mr. T played Barret, but his voice actor did great). The ending touched me, and made me think, \\"Oh, what a great movie!\\" The negetive reviews are by people who just don't get it. The people who made Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children had never made a feature film in their career. And no one has ever made a film sequel to a video game before. So they had no previous work to model on. Just in game FMVs. And they did a great job at it!<br /><br />Overall this is great, although I have a few gripes: The other original characters besdes Cloud, Tifa, Vincent, and Aeris(yes, Aeris) have small roles in the movie. And, the subtitles are usually wrong. But when it comes to the bad parts, that's all folks!<br /><br />(This is just a side note:Tifa is so hot in this movie. And Cait Sith's voice sounds so wierd)<br /><br />I loved disc 2! I haven't checked 100% of it yet, but I love what I've seen. Probably my favorite part is the previews for the new Compilation of FF7 games: Before Crisis(A prequel; cell phone game), Crisis Core(probably a prequel, since Zack is in the anime preview; I aint sure whether it's a movie or a game. I heard a rumor that it'll be a PSP game) and(my favorite preview) Dirge of Cerberus(a sequel starring Vincent!; PS2 or 3).<br /><br />One more thing, I loved the feild shots they did for the credits and the FF7 recap. Buy this. I don't care whether a fan or not. SEE THIS!
B00006JLX4|4.0|This album is a gem... mostly because you can really see the spark of something great in it.. which the band went on to create some wonderful and inspiring music over their 10 year career. <br /> <br /> If i had been the ceo at matador and this album landed on my desk i might have thrown it out, if it weren't for the quirky genious of Stephen Malkmus' lyrics and the nifty guitar perversions the rest of the band keeps up with. Songs like \\"Conduit for Sale\\" which at first agitate you with its lo-fi assault... gradually trains your ears to adapt to understanding that not all music has to be prepackaged and glossed for you to realize how good it is. Songs like \\"Here\\" and \\"Perfuma-V\\" become instant classics, the former for its unconfindent lyrics sang with such acceptance of the subject matter. The end result of the album itself is the equivalent of Star treatment of the B-movie actor (not that i'm saying Pavement is a B-rated band... they're quite an A-list act, if you've heard different you must've heard it from Billy Corgan, and that's because he's jealous).  <br /> <br /> The B-sides, live tracks and Radio ONe-offs are awesome...  restored so brilliantly it really feels like you're tuning into the radio and catching something new by the unheard of band Pavement...and helps send you into deep respect for re-experiencing (or in my case experiencing for the first time) a bands Roots.  <br /> <br /> This album is definately worth 4 stars, and should be enough to push you to their 5 star follow up \\"CROOKED RAIN, CROOKED RAIN\\" which has also recieved the 2 disc special edition treatment that Matador owes them.
1594200653|4.0|Tony Judt raises the curtains on the development of a war torn continent into a modern economic and political powerhouse of the coming century.  Often post-war Europe is passed over in history as an assured event- the Marshall Plan was part of destiny, and Germany's economic recover nothing to be surprised by.  This book does a great job at removing those assumptions, and putting the course of history in the context of its contemporaries.  Judt accomplishes this through an extensive use of primary sources, and a great understanding of the social/political climate.<br /><br />Not stopping there however, \\"Postwar\\" presents a sweeping view of the continent (and the UK) as it progresses through the decades and even beyond the conclusion of the Cold War.  This is what makes the book so interesting and unique- it gives the whole story, rather than breaking it up into bite sized chunks.  And amazingly enough, the reader with a solid base of understanding to begin with will not be overwhelmed by the pace and quantity of events.  Sometimes I found myself struggling with the highly specific political and cultural names and developments- for me it was Italian politics and the European theater scene.  I felt that sometimes Judt became distracted by these very specific items of trivia.  Also, if this is your first look at European History after WW2, you may find yourself wanting more in depth coverage of particular events (ie: the Airbridge to Berlin).  This book has a well deserved place on any bookself devoted to modern history and current events.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|First off, let me tell you that the first time I listened to this album I couldn't even get to the end of it; I thought it was terrible. And I was dead WRONG.     As a Depeche Mode fan who started listening to these guys almost 20 years ago, I should have known by now that it takes me a couple (not much more than that) of dedicated listens before the latest DM offering works its magic. And it has never failed to do so; some albums take a little longer (e.g. Exciter; I like the album, but it's not among my favorites), but all of them are completely worth it.     It was no different with Playing the Angel. I hated it the first time around, but decided later to give the album a second chance; it is Depeche Mode after all! A couple of spins later, I had to revise my first impression. Now? I'm riveted. PTA has now \\"officially\\" joined Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, Violator and Ultra as one of my all-time favorite Depeche Mode albums. Can't stop listening to the thing!    I love the fact that PTA sounds so different, so fresh. This is what sets Depeche Mode apart from many other bands out there: they never repeat themselves. I cannot for the life of me understand the so-called \\"fans\\" who have spent the last 15 years waiting for a new \\"Violator\\". There will be no such thing from Depeche Mode, and BLESS them for that. They are true originals and prove it with every new piece of music they present us with. I would be sick and tired of DM if I had to listen to endless variations of Violator; but that's just me.    Many reviewers have made excellent track-by-track descriptions, so I won't do that now. Let me only add that I was surprised by how good Dave Gahan's songs turned out: great contributions that fit perfectly in the context of the album as a whole. I really hope that he keeps writing songs for future DM albums (of which I hope there will be plenty more!).
B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise, Reise(2004). Rammstein's fourth studio album.    How many bands come to mind when you bring up pulse-pounding rhythms, a steady and heavy rhythm guitar assault, techno-type synths, warish anthems, and a guy shouting random controversey in a lower-register German voice? Just one. Growing up late in the 90s, Rammstein were always a group I'd known about through their smash hit 'Du Hast' appearing in the Matrix movie, but I dismissed them as a one-hit-wonder band because everyone would overplay that song ad-nauseum. Great song, but it definitely needed its rest for a while after that time. Plus, I wasn't really into their sound quite yet back then. Over the years though I gradually developed a taste for all varieties of metal, and eventually more industrial stuff. So one day, I was looking for something new to listen to and for some reason Rammstein just caught my eye immediately, and I could see that they didn't just have one but several different albums over the years. I suddenly had a craving to check out what they've done. Because I hadn't really heard from them since 2000 and I saw that they were still around, I figured I should pick up their then-latest release and give it a shot. Why not?    So after cashing in for a copy of Reise, Reise, I was ready for that old familiar sound to come blaring out of the speakers with German chanting on top of it. But what I didn't expect was how much its change in sound would blow me out of the water. In the 3 year time frame between the height of their popularity and the release of this album, the band decided to focus more on the individual songwriting, further due to their need to progress from the more processed, techno-oriented stylings of the past in favor of a rawer production, bigger sound, more choirs, and heavier guitars.     Now none of this change in sound would matter at all if the songs themselves didn't measure up. Quite the opposite actually. There aren't just a few good tracks strewn around some random filler. These songs never feel like clones of one another. No, Reise Reise is actually a really well put together album! There isn't a single bad song on here, though some are definitely better than others. What's great though is that there is so much variety to be found among this collection compared to the three previous albums. Most of the songs are still very simple, catchy, and anthemic, but they tend to change their tone, tempo, and style so the songs don't just fade together. Honestly, I don't know of a better place for new fans to start than this release.    The title track starts things off rather nicely, pounding in at a slow, yet memorable chorus melody that lets people know that Rammstein is still alive, well and kicking. Plus, I always love to hear great combinations of different instruments together if they are utilized properly, which they managed to do with the guitars and accordian. 'Mein Tiel' pummels in slightly faster, and is definitely the heaviest track on here. The choirs at the end give it a nice fade out. Then the pace slows back down with 'Dalai Lama' which is very subdued with its melodic and haunting tendencies in sound, but is not quite a ballad either. I especially love the part with an airly feel to it where the vocals come in with,\\"Komm her, bleib hier...\\" 'Kiene Lust' is a bouncy metallic number that's probably different than what old fans might be accustomed to, yet it still holds up nicely. Once again, I love the outstanding bridge section on this track. Next up is 'Los' which is certainly one of their more experimental outings. Rammstein takes on... southern rock? Seriously, its got a steady arena beat lined with accoustic guitars and even a harmonica! Dare I say that it almost makes them sound like a German-speaking ZZ Top in places. Good stuff.    Wow... kicking off the second half of the disc has got to be THE catchiest song that I've ever heard that doesn't suck, in the form of the single 'Amerika'. It's so easy to memorize, soawesome, and it gets stuck in your head for days on end! Some people might dismiss it based on that fact, and also for its \\"anti-American\\" message, but look closer. It works because the whole point of the song is to be extremely simple and mainstream in nature, reflecting the excesses of America's impact of mass consumerism all over the world. That's all it is, it's not making fun of America itself. Rammstein almost never does solos, but I enjoy the one they placed after the line \\"This is not a love song...\\"    And if that one isn't awesome enough, Rammstein delivers a nice one-two punch with both 'Amerika' and then 'Moskau'. It turns up the pace even faster, and features several female vocal parts sung in Russian in addition to the usual German. This one also hooks you in with its blisteringly vibrant chorus. Whatever you do, don't try to read her lines unless you know Cyrillic script! Excellent usage of keyboards and driving guitar rhythms. Then finishing off the faster songs is 'Morgenstern', giving off an interesting drum beat during the chorus. From this point on the album, I agree with other reviewers who feel that they shouldn't have stuck three ballads right at the end of the disc because the album's flow drops off right here and finishes it off rather lightly. Not that they're bad songs at all, quite the contrary in fact. It's just that spreading them out earlier would benefit them much better. 'Stein Um Stein' and 'Amour' both indicate the direction that Rammstein's next album Rosenrot(2006) would take.    Okay, enough of my yacking! If you're a hardcore fan, I'm sure you probably have Reise, Reise already, so I don't need to say anything for you. Now for potential new fans who really want to see what these guys have been up to lately, and/or if you're looking for something great to listen to that's more simple, catchy, and heavy enough, then go pick this up right now! It made me a fan, and I've already gone on to collect their other albums. With the exception of Sehnsucht(1998), which is a late 90s industrial techno-metal classic, they're not quite as amazing as this one is, but still definitely worth having once you become accustomed to their sound. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.    Other suggestions:  -Any of their other stuff ['Herzeleid'(1995), 'Sehnsucht'(1998), 'Mutter'(2001), and 'Rosenrot'(2006)]  -'The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste('1990) by Ministry  -'Too Dark Park'(1990) by Skinny Puppy
B000F7CMRM|3.0|The movie basically focuses on corruption in the oil business, from private businesses to the government.    The movie has an all-star cast (George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, etc...) and they all hit their marks rather well for such a complex movie.    In general, I thought the movie was pretty good as far as the ideas that it puts forward, it's quite thought provoking and it brings up some important issues.    But while the ideas are good, it's hard to follow.  The movie is very fast paced, from the dialogues to just cutting from scene to scene.  It's not helped with the fact that some of the economic theories and ideas that are brought up are sometimes hard to understand, and since it goes so fast you don't always have time to understand them, which I thought put a damper on the film because it then becomes harder to follow everything that's happening.  But in a way, it makes sense, because like the characters, we don't fully realize what's happening right away.    But overall, it's a movie I'd recommend, and I think definitely worth seeing, as it tackles important issues that we face today and faces them head on, and with a second viewing, everything becomes a lot clearer and easier to understand, which gives the movie a whole new perspective and makes it all that more important.
B000028U0Y|5.0|The movie Walked the Line put this album back in the charts. Proving once again how timeless and essential this record is. Folsom Prison found Cash at the height of his career and, other than the film suggests, at the height of his misery. June Carter just threatened to walk out on him, although Cash was shaken by this threat he still needed his pills to get through this concert. It took the next year to clean up is his act. By the time Cash did his second prison album for Columbia, San Quentin, he was finally walking the line.  <br /> <br />Where San Quentin leaned heavier into his gospel and his pop material Folsom Prison still very much leaned into the outlaw image Cash created around himself. Although Cash never did any hard time himself, just an odd night in county jail, this image really struck a chord with the inmates. Especially since Cash and his audience realized that the line between him and the prisoners at Folsom was a very thin one. Throughout the concert his voice is gruff and grainy from to many pills and to harsh a life. <br /> <br />Folsom Prison would become his biggest selling album of all time. Not only would it become his biggest, Folsom would become one of those essential albums any music fan should have in his library. Cash had the gift to transcend the medium he was operating in. During the fifties his country gained great popularity among R&R audiences. With Folsom he would solidify his acceptance by the protest generation, just as the record would be picked up by the Punk Rockers in the eighties, the Gangsta rappers in the nineties and the Alternative audiences at the turn of the century. More than any record he released Folsom came to symbolize what Cash meant in the public eye. <br /> <br />Folsom also shows the debt of his material. Although musically nothing really happens, Cash didn't call it Boom Chickaboom music for no reason, the stories take you away out of your own life to the world of others. His baritone voice is monotone yet hypnotic. You can't help but listen. His song seem real, emphatic reflections of life. Though often somber or melancholic of tone filled a comforting quality.  Thought often funny Cash never ridicules. His songs take you through the human experience with a down to earthiness and simplicity that a lot of other performers lack. If you don't get Johnny Cash, you've got a hole in your soul.  <br /> <br />Johnny Cash was a complex man in life. Often torn between the attractiveness of sin and redemption, light and darkness or trauma and release. This conflict shines though his music. On the one hand there is murder in Folsom Prison Blues on the other there is submission to the Lord and his teachings in Greystone Chapel. His tales of sin are filled with regret, his songs of redemption filled with temptation. Never it becomes clear where Cash is on the divide, just that there is an ongoing struggle. This is to me what makes Cash so humane and is probably why he was accepted so easily in Folsom. Through his songs Cash never judges. Cash just shows us the struggles we all go through and how frail our lives are. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|...Final Fantasy VII is one of those experiences that only comes but once in a lifetime...Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is a faithful tribute to Square-Enix's Magnum Opus.<br /><br />This is another of Square's projects that seemed to sit in Developmental purgatory.  Whenever Square announces a new Final Fantasy project (game or in this case movie), the whole world seems to be put on hold and people are transported to a land of magic, swords, and wonders beyond their wildest imaginations.  Unfortunately, it has never been right away.<br /><br />I remember my first true experience with Final Fantasy. About two years ago when I was watching \\"Cinematech\\" on G4TechTV, I saw a series of shorts showing various parts of different games.  The one I enjoyed the most was the opening cinema from Final Fantasy VIII.  Then, I remember going to get that game the next day from my local EB Games and unfortunately the copy I bought was defective.<br /><br />When I took it back, the store clerk said that they had sold me the last copy.  Fortunately for me the clerk working that night told me they had plenty of copies of Final Fantasy VII in stock (ironically now you can't find it brand new or gently used anywhere but on ebay).  He also mentioned that it was a better game in terms of storyline and gameplay (indeed).  Since it was only two dollars more, I decided to pay that extra two bucks and use my return credit to give the game a whirl.  And boy am I glad I did!  It was different from anything I had ever played before.<br /><br />I was immediately captivated by the story of ex-SOLDIER turned mercenary, Cloud Stirfe and the eco-terrorist group (good terrorists), AVALANCHE fighting to save the planet from the threat of the evil Shinra Corporation.  But the story was so much deeper than that (and you all know that).  I played for months and months getting even deeper into the story as I went.  But then something bad happened.  I had been using a Gameshark to max my limit for each character during boss battles so I could make every attack a Limit Break (CHEATER!!!! tsk! tsk! I know, I know) and I lost 20 hours of gameplay and killed my memory card.<br /><br />So I haven't truly finished FFVII but I have had many great friends who helped me by explaining the story to me and even helping me get back on the FFVII horse so to speak.  But at the cost of spoilers...it was weird when I found out that Aerith would die at the hands of Sephiroth (I'm not giving any spoiler warnings because if you don't know this by now then you are either an idiot or you have never seen a video game in your entire life), because I barely knew her as a character so I was not sad as many FFVII fans were when it happened (mostly because they had spent all that time leveling her up only to have her get killed off).  Same with Zack.  He was an unusual character that Cloud idolized and used to fill in his memories following his idol's death.  Cloud wasn't a former member of SOLDIER, he was just a lower ranking grunt who had a run-in with the great warrior Sephiroth on that fateful day five years ago...<br /><br />When I traded in my PS1 for a PS2 a couple summers ago (so I was a little late in doing so, video games rape your wallet!!), FFVII was the only game I didn't sell as I was determined to finish it someday.<br /><br />Then, I heard about this film and my interest in FFVII was newly piqued and I plan to begin playing it again this summer.<br /><br />In addition to FFVII, I am also a fan and avid player of Final Fantasy X.  It was the first game besides GTA: Vice City that I bought for my PS2 a few summers ago.  It is similar in gameplay and features polished graphics and the first use of voices in an FF game but as far story goes FFVII still takes the cake.<br /><br />I'm not going to write a summary of the movie (because Amazon did a decent job already), but I am going to say one thing.  If you enjoyed FFVII nearly ten years ago or are new to Final Fantasy or even ananime fan, give Final Fantasy VII Advent Children a chance.  It is a beautiful story with beautifully animated characters and environments and it is a treasure to be cherished by all.<br /><br />If you need help understanding the story check out this FAQ:<br /><br />[...]%20misc/advent_children_FAQ.html<br /><br />As for the story of the first game, The short \\"Reminisence of Final Fantasy VII\\" featurette on Disc 1 should fill in any gaps or questions you might have about the original story.  Wikipedia also has a pretty extensive explanation of the Final Fantasy VII story as well as characters, locations, and events of the story.<br /><br />If only they had released this instead of \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\"... :-Dinal Fantasy or even an anime fan, give Final Fantasy VII Advent Children a chance.

B00008BXJG|5.0|The Bon Scott era of AC/DC is one of the rawest forms of Rock 'n Roll you will find. No frills, no deep messages, just mean guitars, driving drum beats, and lyrics about sex, violence, drugs, and booze. There was no ego; they never took anything too seriously(which seems to happen painfully often with rock stars). This band was all about having fun and playing some @ss-kicking Rock 'n Roll. And what the hell is a Green Day fan from Bakersfield doing rating this masterpiece? Leaving everyone who reads it dumber and less qualified to identify good music. Comparing Billie Joe Armstrong and Bon Scott is a sin. So, if you want to listen to pathetic wanna-be punk than follow that fellow's review and listen to some Greenday. But, if you want to listen to some Rock 'n Roll at it's finest, than this is just the thing you're looking for.
B000001FDQ|2.0|I am a guitarist, and I can vouch for Malmsteen's astounding technique. However, that only takes you so far.  The songs should come first, and the songwriting just isn't there. Endless solos get boring and old after a while. You can either play for other guitar players to show off how fast you can go wheedily wheedily whee up and down the fretboard, or you can write songs and solos that hit people in the gut and touch their hearts.In my opinion, Malmsteen had an overwhelmingly NEGATIVE influence on rock guitar in the 80's. It became a competition. So many players were worried about speed and technique rather than composition and playing from their souls.  As another reviewer said, if you want emotional instrumental guitar music, pick up a Eric Johnson or a Joe Satriani cd instead.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I had no idea what to expect going to the theater to see this movie.  Not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was blown away.  I laughed the entire time, and the film is just really well made.  I have wanted to own a copy myself since the night I saw Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in theaters.
0446530573|5.0|I love all italian food, but have been hard pushed to find a cookbook that really makes the food the way it was meant to be.  The ricotta pie with pineapples is to die for.  If you love food, this book is a must.
B000001ESJ|4.0|The term \\"Xanadu\\" is defined as \\"a place of great beauty, luxury, and contentment.\\"  <br /> <br />That's the kind of place I've found on A Farewell To Kings. <br /> <br />Ok, that's a bit thick on the melodrama, but Rush has definitely turned a distinctive and definite corner on this record...one started a tad more subtly on 2112.  <br /> <br />For one, this is the first quality production on a Rush record. You can actually discern the instruments and for the first time Geddy is present up front..and this would mark how the band would sound on vinyl for a few years to come. A real treat to the ears. (His playing, too, is starting to become more noticeably varied and stylish as well). Musical personalities are really coming in to form here. Alex is playing less rock riffs and experimenting more with the guitar as an instrument of tone and vibe...beit it volume swellings, hammer-ons, or more melodic single-note picking <br /> <br />The title track is a nice treat, starting with the very Renaissance-esque acoustic treatment by Alex. Midway through we get a nice jazzy break with Neil working the snare and Geddy carrying the tune to Alex's tasty guitar fills.  <br /> <br />Xanadu, however, is to me where the literal line in the sand occurs and the band goes someplace it's not treaded before. They walk \\"towards the light\\" and never look back. A friend of mine described the opening to 2112 being that thing that raises the hair on his arms and says \\"this is Rush.\\" To me this happens with the opening to this wonderful epic. The soft but eerie keys, Lifeson's wistful single note swells, and Neil's haunting chimes and tolling bells....seguing into Alex's goosebump-raising guitar intro that carries us into that massive power chord.  <br /> <br />Wow.  <br /> <br />This is Rush to me in a big way. <br /> <br />And this is what a monster opus should do. It's a cohesive musical narrative, natural, never gets boring and all the parts gel together...change tempos and keys at all theright time, etc. Seriously one of the great Rush epics.  <br /> <br />Closer To The Heart I'm sure raises the groan of bored Rush fanatics, but despite perhaps the oversaturation on the radio, it's simply one of the best songs they've ever crafted....with one of the best sounding 12-string intros in the history of rock. Seriously, this is without a doubt a top 10 Rush tune of all time....wonderfully crafted, skillfully and emotionally sung by Lee. There's nothing to not love here. <br /> <br />Cinderella Man is another keeper, with an intro riff that reminds me of Iron Maiden for some reason. But quickly we're into acoustic chords and the vocals. I like the lyrics and sentiment here quite well. The song also has a bit of Kansas and Styx in it too...in terms of melody.  <br /> <br />Madrigal is often ignored or put down from the things I've read, and while it's nothing earth-shattering -- so I'll not pretend otherwise -- it's a nice wistful tune....featuring some tamed singing from Lee. The vocal melody here is rangy and beautiful....and way underappreciated. (Hidden gem # 3 along this journey...yeah, another ballad kids). It might be forgotten because at a meager 2:38 it's shorter than some Rush intros.   <br /> <br />Cygnus X-1 takes me back to that weird place with Rush I'm always sort of hesitant about....but it works here fairly well. Granted it's my least favorite overall track, but for a heady, bizarre space-themed something-or-other it's pretty compelling. The intro is quite effective....with Ged's thumping bass slowly swelling in and taking over the song. I'd by lying if I said I wasn't thumping the steering wheel all six times I listened to this album today. Ultimately I think the song kind of dissolves and ends a bit shriekily and disappointingly with this pretty sad fade out.....but overall it's a keeper. <br /> <br />This is clearly and easily the best Rush effort at this point in their career. It's diverse....it's melodic....it's weird but with a purpose. The songs have a cohesive feel. Most (tho' not all) the problems I had with the previous releases are well on their way to being ironed out on A Farewell To Kings and the changes are both noticeable and appreciated. <br /> <br />
B000007S5B|5.0|I would be hard pressed to name one Doors album the best. I could never ever call one the worst, because I think every one was great. This is a perfect album if you ask me. Not one average song on the list, they are all great. If you don't like it, you don't like the Doors. I do not consider it too mellow or light, where does that come from? \\"Five to One\\"? \\"Unknown Soldier\\"? Great great album from America's greatest ever band.
B000001ESN|4.0|Permanent Waves opens with just that.....a rockin' wave of back-to-back radio staples The Spirit Of Radio and the awesome Free Will. This is probably the strongest opening to a Rush album so far thru seven studio albums. From the opening riff of Radio the album promises not disappoint and it rarely flags. Tired of `em or not, Radio and Will are must-loves in the Rush catalog.    From this point we segue into perhaps the weakest song on the record, Jacob's Ladder....which, I might add is still quite good. Nice riffing here from Alex as well as some tasty soloing. It's a little slow in parts but still enjoyable. (It could be a couple minutes shorter).    Entre Nous ushers in a couple back-to-back laid back tunes and takes the album down a notch, but one that increases the melody. Entre Nous is a wistful, feel-good song about relationships and the delicate ties that bind people to one another. Great lyrics here and light melody to accompany. And holy crap, Different Strings really is an exceptional little piece (hidden gem # 4 - god, I'm a sucker for the slow stuff) set to melodic plucking from Alex with impressive vocals from Geddy. \\"All there really is....the two of us\\" portion of the lyrics is really, really well done. I'm actually quite moved by the song and hugely impressed with Lee's vocal performance. Just...wow.     Natural Science is also a pretty nifty little tune overall....(again I hear Dream Theater stealing). I like this song quite a bit. Was awesome to see this show up on Rock In Rio. The closest thing the band comes to one of their epic pieces, but with noticeably less pomposity. In general the album as a whole is pretty straight forward and lean, which is a nice change.     Hey kids...I'm diggin' it. The band has really found their footing at this point, that much is clear. Not without some annoyances, but at this point I'm lying if I don't confess that those are mere quibbles. How much has this band grown over the six years between this and the firstalbum, eh? Tons.    I'm probably a few years worth of saturation away from making this a perfect 5-star record...(I mean, how much can you truly learn/absorb in even 4 or 5 listens?) So until it all sinks in and I'm singin' Different Strings in the shower.....    PERMANENT WAVES: 4.5 stars of 5    ([...])
B0006M4SO6|4.0|You can give this one the Forest Gump treatment: It's like a box of chocolates, when you bite into it you just don't know what you'll get.  And that's what happens here as the songs are long and divided into movements, sort of as a symphony.  While there are themes that run loosely through the compositions, though, the tunes are all quite variable, although they retain that Pat Metheny Group sound throughout.<br /><br />The Way Up is indeed a concoction as another reviewer called it. But, after a few spins, I actually started liking it quite a bit.<br /><br />I like Yes, and Kansas, and Emerson Lake and Palmer, and this is probably what those bands were trying to achieve at the time of their heyday, although Pat and the group outrun the progressive pack with ease.<br /><br />I found the time changes to be just fine, and I heard plenty of jazz thrown in between the progressive stuff. I found the textures quite interesting, and have grown to like the album quite a bit.<br /><br />Some of the cooler passages, for example, feature very neat stuff for those with finely tuned ears, such as lead instruments  soloing using major scales, as the accompaniment moved smoothly through minor chords.<br /><br />The album seemed to lean heavily on Lyle Mays, as well as Cuong Vu's trumpet along with Gregorie Maret's Harmonica, and not as much on Pat's soloing, although there are some nice surprises along the way.<br /><br />I even heard slide guitar and a few tugs on a tremolo bar along the way, something rare for Pat Metheny.<br /><br />There were plenty of nods to Metheny tunes of old, and plenty of conventional sounding melodies, Lyle Mays fluorishes, and cymbal splashes along the way.<br /><br />As with Pat's most recent stuff though, there is no commercial breakthrough candidate here, which may be intentional, but also bittersweet for those of us who draw blank stares when we mention Pat's name to anyone when we talk about music.
B00005JOYA|4.0|Alright, for people who plan on seeing this, don't expect your traditional slasher pic, as this is more of a traditional Japanese style horror film, the kind that makes you think about what you're watching. <br /> <br />Setting - 5/5:  I think the setting for this movie was perfect.  The way they depict Silent Hill is almost spot-on with how it is depicted in the games - filled with fog, devoid of people, and cut off from the rest of the world.  However, this is only half of the setting.  The other half, the \\"nightmare world\\" that it transforms into at times, is also superbly done.  The rust, blood, and dirt that covers the walls and floors of common everyday places, mixed with the feel of machinery in disrepair, make for a truly disturbing place. <br /> <br />Characters - 4/5:  The choice of characters is great, but I think they could have done better by changing a few of them.  I think people who have played the games recognize the names of Cybil, Dahlia, and Alessa and as such they expect the plot from the original games.  I feel if they changed the characters a bit they could have avoided some disappointed \\"hard core\\" fans, but if you've never played a Silent Hil game before, then this will all be fine.  The rest of the characters were done perfectly, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Theme - 5/5:  I think the theme came through pretty strong, which was to leave the viewer in the dark for most of the movie.  The games convey the same theme, where all will be explained in the end, but even after the climax, there's still a few questions left unanswered. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a great horror movie with equal parts physical horror and psycological horror.  If you like movies like the original Japanese \\"Dark Water,\\" then this movie is for you.  If you're expecting a group of 20-somethings getting hacked to pieces while in the middle of a drinking party, then this isn't for you.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|When I heard that Rob Zombie was returning to music I was thrilled. Not that I don't love his movies, because I do, but because I love his music and his music is what made me first fall in love with him in the first place. In a purely heterosexual way... When I heard this I wasn't exactly blown away but that doesn't mean I don't like it. I love it, in fact. This album has been getting a few bad reviews but I think they're being a bit harsh and not understanding what Rob is trying to do. Anyway, I'll get to my track-by-track review.  <br /> <br />Sawdust in the Blood - Just an intro. It's quite creepy and atmospheric, but honestly the most striking thing about it is that it sounds so much like Marilyn Manson's \\"Godeatgod\\".  <br /> <br />American Witch - This song is more of a throwback to his earlier songs. Definitely one of my faves on Educated Horses. Instantly lovable. Rob's voice is right on the money here and John 5 shows his skills well. Single worthy.  <br /> <br />Foxy Foxy - I, like so many others, heard this song first. A different feel to previous songs but I love it. I listened to it over and over when I first got it. A very catchy song.  <br /> <br />17 Year Locust - A slow, but heavy song. Rob's voice has a very good range here. Easy to get into.  <br /> <br />The Scorpian Sleeps - A much more pop-oriented song but that's not a bad thing. I can't help bobbing my heard to this one.  <br /> <br />100 Ways - This instrumental is kind of a continuation of Sawdust in the Blood. It sounds different, but again, reminds me a lot of Manson. Could it be John 5's influence?  <br /> <br />Let It All Bleed Out - Along with American Witch, this is one of the heaviest songs on the album. I was headbanging all over the place when I first heard this. Classic Zombie.  <br /> <br />Death of it All - This song is probably the closest thing to an acoustic track that was mentioned when this album was first talked about. A very catchy song with a good beat. One of my faves.<br /> <br />Ride - This song starts the last three songs which I can't help grouping together. They all just seem to have a similar structure. I do like this song a lot but it doesn't feel very inspired.  <br /> <br />The Devil's Rejects - Being in love with the movie, I had hoped for something better but I still love the song. Parts of it definitely do capture the essence of the Firefly clan.  <br /> <br />The Lord of Salem - Probably my least favourite of the album, not counting the intstrumentals. Again, a good song but not a particularly great one for Rob Zombie. The outro to this song is quite strange...  <br /> <br />So, perhaps not Rob Zombie's best but definitely worth buying and being part of the Rob Zombie legacy. <br />
0688014291|3.0|B.F. Skinner, K. Breland, and N. Guttman discovered shaping in 1943 at a General Mills flour mill. Oh, the excitement they must have had teaching pigeons to do funny tricks like bowl, peck discs, and pull strings. Now, you can share the fun. Let your employees be the pigeons and you can use Skinners 60-year-old principles to teach your employees tricks.<br /><br />Kenneth H. Blanchard and Spencer Johnson shamelessly repackage Skinner's operant conditioning as a management tool. Even the examples are the same: Pigeons and bowling. Told in parable form, the \\"employees\\" of the imaginary company love their successive approximations (\\"One-Minute Goals\\"), positive rewards (\\"One-Minute Praisings\\"), and aversive stimulus (\\"One-Minute Reprimands\\"). Using operant conditioning principles to control humans is not new; in fact, B.F. Skinner himself suggested that the principles of operant conditioning can be used efficiently to control a society. In his 1948 novel, Walden Two, he presented a utopian society guided by operant conditioning principles. His 1971 book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, caused a controversy by presenting his ideas on how operant conditioning could be utilized in an actual society. Although most people are not willing to accept Skinner's utopian ideal, the principles of operant conditioning are being applied in our everyday lives. Apparently, DRS. Johns and Blanchard feel employees, as pigeons, can be controlled with simple antique behavioral modifications.
B00005JOYA|4.0|Movie Adaptations of video games tend to fall into two categories.  Those categories are bad (the Resident Evil movies, The Street Fighter movie, Double Dragon, ect.) and worse (House of the Dead, Blood Rayne, and Alone in the Dark).  The Silent Hill movie adaptation is one of the only video game based movies outside of Mortal Kombat that is actually good.      Fans familiar with the video game will be impressed by this movie's visuals because they are absolutely stunning. They succeeded in capturing the look of the town.  Fans will really appreciate the scenes were Rose is at the school, when Rose along with Cybil realize they are cut off from the outside world by the cliffs, the fog in the other world, and the look of the nightmare world.  The monsters that are featured in the movie have been taken from both Silent Hill1 and Silent Hill2 games and might I add they look phenomenal especially Pyramid Head.   The visuals in this movie, along with a few scenes that were borrowed from some Silent Hill games, the hauntingly beautiful music that is used in the film since it is actually the music from various Silent Hill games, and the overall sound help to capture the look and feel of the games.     Another thing in the movie that will be familiar to Silent Hill gamers is the way that this movie ends.  Remember the first Silent Hill game had 4 possible endings depending on what you did or didn't do.  The very first ending I ever got when I beat the end for the first time was the bad ending.  You get this ending when you do a whole lot of the wrong things.  This is the ending that appears in the movie.  So this along with everything I mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph make it clear to me that the director Christophe Gans from Brotherhood of the Wolf (Le Pacte Des Loups) has respect for the source material; however if I was him I would have chosen to end the movie with the good ending and in the DVD I would've included 3 alternate endings for the game fans.  One ofthose endings would be the way the movie currently ends along with a not so bad ending, and a joke ending.  Perhaps something like this will happen in the DVD.    Getting back to my review as great as the movie looks, feels, and sounds fans of the video game may find themselves disappointed by the changes to many aspects of the storyline.   Personally, I understand that some of the changes are necessary, because everything that happens in a game doesn't translate well in a film especially since the game covers a span of several hours worth of information-events while the movie is limited by a 2 hr run time.  So some aspects of the original story including characters were removed and changed to simplify things.  Some of these changes that gamers can expect are the following: Dahlia isn't portrayed the way she is in the games, and some important characters are missing Dr. Kaufmann, and Harry Mason (he is replaced by Sharon DaSilva).  Cheryl Mason's name has been changed to Sharon DaSilva and she's an older child in this movie versus the games.  Alyssa's background in the film differs from that of the videogame and not whole lot of time is spent developing it. The true mythological and historical history of Silent Hill isn't shown in the movie, which is a shame because that's some fascinating stuff..  The Silent Hill cult known as the Order is also gone and so is their history of facing persecution from Christians.  In the movie they are replaced by some other religious group that isn't fleshed out very well who are persecutors.  They go around labeling everyone that doesn't fit into their ideal of what a good person is as being a witch.       So are these changes enough to make it another bad video game based movie?  In my opinion it isn't but I think it does hurt the movie a bit with some Silent Hill gamer fans since it was advertised as being true to the game's storyline.  To those people I say before you label this movie as bad keep in mind that this is a movie adaptation of the Silent Hill game this isn't a movie version of the game.  I'll also ask them to look at the limitations of producing a story as deep and complex as Silent Hill in a movie format.
B000AXSN5G|1.0|What a disappointing CD. I have been a Neil fan for 'decades', but this one should have been left in the studio. The instruments, tempos, and cadences are all lifted off of Harvest Moon. It is sad in a way that something more original could not have been produced. This cd cheapens the great work he has done in the past. I heard that this cd has been critically acclaimed, but I don't think the reviewers were very 'critical'. I would not recommend this album to anyone. In fact I wondered if it were possible to send my copy back to the record company with a nastigram and a request for a refund. Neil - I love ya, but its time to step away from the mike.... <br />Oh - I might add, Living With War sounds like a real treat as well. Does Neil really think that all the liberal hippies he used to write for have not grown up into conservative rednecks? (it comes with having children and taking responsibility for your life). Bush bashing and America hating doesn't sell to middle America. What's more pathetic is using the war against the terrorist butchers and the emotions of the Antis to create record sales. Shame. Shame.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's insightful portrayal of the life of an autistic child allows the reader to see the different ways that an autistic brain works and raises awareness and sensitivity towards autism. Haddon effectively uses a distinct voice that makes the tone of the novel portray the way that a child with autism might think.  This voice reveals a new perspective on common and everyday experiences that are so much more overwhelming to a person with autism.  Haddon also develops the plot line of the novel in a very clever and intriguing way that reinforces the different perspective of the things that are actually important in life and the things that really have no importance.  Christopher Boone, the boy with autism, is a very well developed character as the book is told from his prospective and supposed to be a book that he is writing himself.  His character is shown through the stories that he writes about as well as the way that he describes certain events and his feelings toward them.  By getting into the character of Christopher Boone, the reader is able to experience the challenges that autistic people face everyday and hopefully become more aware and more sensitive to people with autism.
0743454537|5.0|I read this book over a two day period. It is definitly a page turner, and you learn to love each of the characters. It is very well written, and I love that you are able to see all the characters points of view. The ending is unpredictable, and all in all it is a great read!
0688170528|4.0|This is an easy read, and it is a great story. I read the book before I saw the lifetime movie, and the book is much better. I would recommend this book to a younger group of people (teens-early 20s) because it is a GREAT love story, and I think they would respect it.
0399143904|4.0|Minor spoilers below if you haven't read the book.<br /><br />Tom Clancy's literary reverence for things military is overtly evident through his books from Hunt for Red October onwards. In Rainbow Six, he indulges in small unit tactics for a whole tome. In many ways typical Tom Clancy, the book is instructive at a layman level about anti-terrorist tactics as practiced by special forces units. I have little doubt that the usual level of research went into this book that Mr Clancy usually carries out. I admit to being an unabashed fan.<br /><br />So why not five stars?<br /><br />Well, to be honest, nothing ever goes wrong for these guys. The books continuously alludes to the virtual certainty of problems with operations, but then nothing really does. I kept waiting for the problem and the subsequent analysis, but it never happened. I realized that, among the other obvious things that I like about Clancy, the recognition of the failings that people have and the way these play out on a broad stage are much of what I enjoy about his books. This one doesn't really have that.<br /><br />Good Clancy, but not the best Clancy
B00006I53S|4.0|This lens has a great range especially when combined with a 1.6X camera body such as the XT, 20D or 30D where you end up with a 216mm equivalent.  It works great for macro work due to its relatively close minimum focusing distance, you can enhance this by using extension tubes also.  The IS is nice if you don't feel like taking along your tripod.  It is not too heavy even when carrying it around all day.  The only other lens I would consider in this range, if you have the cash, would be the 24-105 L series.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you haven't seen Lost in Translation SEE it.  It's a beautiful film.  It'll leave you misty at the end.  And the end is absolutely wonderful.  All I'll say is that Sophia Coppola lets you make up your own mind what happens.  Is it tragedy or joy?  You decide.  Something so delicious in this age of spoon-fed endings.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the Sci Fi/Horror genre's greatest films ever. It set new standards at the time and has been a major influence on many films that have followed. I first saw Aliens in 1986 on its cinema release. Being a fan of the original made me have very grave doubts indeed about just how good a sequel could be, let alone approach the standards of the original. Well those doubts were simply blasted away by what was up on the screen. Aliens is simply that rare animal, a sequel that is better than the original.<br /><br />James Cameron takes up the story, 50 years on from the original which sees the rescue from deep space of the two survivors of the original film's Nostromo - Warrant Officer Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver and the ship's cat - Jonesey.<br />Ripley is taken back to Earth and finds her account of what happened to the Nostromo dismissed out of hand by the authorities, and her own motives and sanity questioned. To her horror while she acclimatises to a life fast forwarded 50 years, she also discovers that terraforming colonists have settled on the forbidding planet that held the ship full of Alien eggs which led to the destruction of her ship and crew. News then comes of a total loss of contact with the colony, and Ripley reluctantantly agrees to go along as an advisor on a military mission to see what has happened to the colonists....<br /><br />Aliens succeeds brilliantly as an out and out action film which on a first viewing, will leave viewers with white knuckles as they are taken through a series of terrifying sequences, all the way to that amazing confrontation between Ripley and the gigantic Alien Queen, a scene that has deservedly taken its place in movie history....<br />Along the way, Ripley takes an orphaned girl under her wing and their growing mother/daughter relationship is convincing against the backgound of what is going on, and becomes an integral part of the film's plot.<br /><br />Aliens is one of James Cameron's very best films. It is an exhilerating ride from start to finish. Some of the sequences with the marines are a little camp at times but add to the enjoyment factor anyway. As for the inclusion of the 20 mins of 'lost footage', I think it enhances the film and gives the viewer some insight into the lost colonists which was lacking on the original release of the film.<br />A must see film which I recommend very highly, indeed.ing ride from start to finish.

B000BOH8XW|5.0|The cover featuring Shakira 'Eve & The Original Sin' is a classic theme that basically attributes to Even one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit-that would be her oral fixation: That's Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, Latin America's most successful pop female crossover artist and my fav, I rave for Shakira! She sways so provocative with the most sexiest dazzling flare but thats how she grew up dancing as music flow naturally in her veins. Her Hips don't Lie is number one song in my Chart followed by Hey You and Illegal with the classic Carlos Santana playing on sexiest guitar strings. Hips don't lie is Rapped vocals from Wyclef Jean and Shakira's familiar Spanish-accented is rocking, Dance like this....very groovy. The way she rolls her back and moves her hips, well it's a workout all in itself in its latest video of Hips don't lie. How do you do is just a bunch of questions we wonder as human beings. Animal city chills with inventive moments with her loud vocals too good to resist. Overall, I'd say - Laundry Service was Great but Oral Fixation Vol 2 (included Hips don't lie) is Best of the Best and *Five Stars* A more matured and focused Shakira who is much in touch with a woman inside her - delightful to the sense. A must Pick. Just Chill.
006054094X|1.0|I have put off reviewing this monstrosity for a long time. As a card-carrying Sinophile, I started heavily prejudiced in favor of Chinese discoveries. I was quickly disappointed. Menzies simply isn't qualified to write this book.<br /><br />It would take hundreds of pages to list all the mistakes he makes. He is crippled by his total lack of knowledge of China (he can't even pronounce Beijing, which is easy.) An example: he refers to the Yunglo Emperor by family name and personal name. In Chinese society, even today that is extremely disrespectful. In traditional society, it would have been so heinous that I cannot think of a single instance of anybody speaking aloud the Emperor's name; it was not even written. The punishment for such behavior would probably start with exterminating the entire clan. Menzies was probably unaware that he was showing great disrespect. He is unaware of a lot of things.<br /><br />When he came to Taipei to launch the Chinese translation of his book, Menzies, not understanding a word of Chinese, was unaware that even the publisher way saying that the book was more science fiction than history. If you are interested in reading more about the promotion, please read my blog for November 12, 2003.<br /><br />What Menzies smothers in all his malarkey is the great contributions China did make to seafaring, starting well over a thousand years before Zheng Sanbao. Sanbao Taijien (AKA Zheng H) was a great explorer, but Menzies simply does not tell the story right. List the book's mistakes? I just don't know where to begin. What do you do with someone who lists as a source `a crossword puzzle expert'? No name was given. I have no idea what qualifies one as a crossword puzzle expert, who that person is, or how such an expert is qualified to do research on Ming dynasty China.<br /><br />Finally I have hit upon the perfect phrase to describe this book: hu shuo ba dao: a barbarian discusses eight ways (roads). It means `absolute nonsense,' and fits this travesty to a T. As 'history,' it's right in there with Chariots of the Gods.s travesty to a T.

B00006GO7T|4.0|This has always been a favorite Miles album. The SACD brings great separation and detail - but is marred by the presence of significant passages containing too much hiss. I am getting gunshy about these Late 50's - Mid 60's SACD reissues. Am beginning to think, overall, that the RVG, Connoisseur, Legacy, Verve, etc reissues deliver sonics that leave very little room for improvement - so that the SACD 'upgrades' are not really necessary.
B000003TA4|5.0|From the opening chords and primal screams of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the closing strings and melancholy of Something In The Way, Seattle band Nirvana's 1991 modern classic Nevermind stands as the most important rock album of the past 2 decades. Upon its release, the album instantly boomed, making Nirvana the biggest band in the world, popularizing alternative rock, or what was later known as grunge rock (a Seattle sound combining heavy metal, punk and indie rock), paving way for many bands to rise up to the big time (e.g. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Bush, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, and Stone Temple Pilots), and labeling the band's frontman Kurt Cobain 'the voice of a generation'. The album became so huge in such a short time that, within a month or two, it kicked Michael Jackson's then Number 1 album Dangerous off the top of the Billboard Album chart.    Nevermind is a mindblowing 12-track album featuring the band at their peak, and Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's late lead singer, songwriter and guitarist, at his most vulnerable and, ironically, best.     Smells Like Teen Spirit, considered to be Nirvana's most popular song, is an ambitious rock 'n roll anthem marked for its memorable intro and rebelliously loud screaming guitars and vocals, Dave Grohl's vicious drumming, and some of the wierdest but sharp-as-nails lyrics. Other tracks worth mentioning for unique quality are Come As You Are, a gloomy bass-driven track with Cobain falsely admitting that he \\"don't have a gun,\\" (note: Kurt shot himself to death in 1994), the mesmerizingly confusing Lithium which features some of the best guitar work on the entire album, the little ditty Polly, the bluesy On A Plain, the satirical, and one of my personal favorites, In Bloom, the cutting edge punk numbers Drain You and Stay Away, and the wonderfully written Something In The Way.

B000BNX3B4|3.0|\\"Must Love Dogs\\" turned out to be somewhat better than I expected, especially given the way it's been trashed by many here. Since amazon reviewers have done such a good job pointing out the movie's flaws (and rightfully so, in most cases), let me briefly state why I think it still merits three and a half stars: 1) The Genre - This is \\"romantic comedy\\", folks. Methinks that by definition that means that it's a silly, dopey fluff piece; not something deeply inspirational. Adjust your expectations accordingly. 2) Though not featured as prominently as one might have hoped, the dogs were great. 3) There was actually some considerable humor involved. No, not the 'condom' chase (which was pretty tacky), but several subtler moments of wit.<br /><br />Hmmm...I guess that's about it, though I still enjoy seeing Diane Lane all grown up. But for a better 'love' story, actually one of the best ever filmed, see \\"A Little Romance\\" starring Diane Lane when she was a mere adorable adolescent (1979). By the way, when did John Cusack morph into Bill Murray (in demeanor, not appearance)? It's not becoming. But yeah, I guess he was better than the other guy. But Thelonious Bernard from the 1979 movie could run circles around all of them. Whatever happened to him, anyway?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity has a grittiness about it that is absent in many science fiction movies. The realm of science fiction being concerned with the future and improved technology normally carries a progressive message and constructs utopian societies in which people are 'better' than real-life people are today. In serenity there does exist such a society but it is counterbalanced with the relative anarchy and savagery of the outer worlds, this is a refreshingly realistic viewpoint in my opinion. The crew of the film come across as real people, not at all like the crew of a Star Trek vessel anyway, the captain is abrasive, ruthless and capable of immoral actions yet is also heroic. <br /> <br />The film itself is concerned with this question of the scientific enhancement of our quality of life, the dangers of what might happen when authorities try to re-make humanity into a less violent form. The question of individual freedom versus Authoritarian benevolence. The film does a splendid job of bringing together many interesting characters (none more interesting than The Operative played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and locations and breathing life into this interesting world. The effects may look a little amateurish at times though the interplanatary scenes are beautifully rendered. The story is a real gripper, at the part were the Reaver fleet emerges from the nebula i found myself cheering out loud. Packed with suspense, mystery, camraderie and even quieter moments of mystical awe (during the awesomely understated scenes on the surface of Miranda where they discover the bizarre and horrifying secret) this movie excels in every area and i was really surprised at how good it was.
B000002UJQ|5.0|People(well,music magazine editors)say that the beatles album revolver is the best album of all time.They're wrong.As depressing a album you'll find anywhere,you hate this album when you hear it first.But you just can't help falling in love with its brillance after you get over the shock.I bought this and after listening to it first thought I had made a big mistake.Compared to the bends this is a totally different album.However the songs just started to grow on me.Thom Yorke has a sort of whineing voice that suits this type of music.Airbag is a totally depressing song but I love it.Talking about recovering from a car crashyou hate this song at the start and you find it hard to hear what Yorke is saying.After a few listens though you begin,as with the whole album how good this song really is.Parnoid android is a classic song.In my view one of Radiohead's best song.Its  six minutes long but is class from start to finish.Subterranean homesick alien(whew!)is a good song.A bit weird granted but good.One of the highlights of the album has to be exit music(for a film)a song about elopeing from a crazy father is nothing short of brillant.\\"We hope that you choke\\"moans Yorke.Let down is a unique song about moderen life.I suppose it just shows how crazy our life really is.Karma police is a song where Yorke works himself into a great huff.At the end he calms down\\"Phew fo a minute there i lost myself.Fitter Happier <br />is the weirdist song you are ever likely to hear.Electioneering is great song as is climbing up the walls.No suprises and lucky are both well written songs.Lucky is brillant.The tourist finishes it with a flourish.Overall a great,brillant,fantastic and legendary album.
0783233477|5.0|There is little about this movie not to like, unless you just love non-stop action.   Even so, there is at least one scene that may satisfy that craving.    <br /> <br />This is sure to be a classic if not already.   Anthony Hopkins is superb and Brad Pitt is excellent.  Its one of those movies you want to see over and over curled up in a blanket with your partner.  <br /> <br />I highly reccommend Meet Joe Black
B000EGDB10|4.0|Mission Impossible is the type of movie that can entertain you even if it doesn't make much sense. It bugs me that they made it a total \\"look at me I'm Tom Cruise\\" movie though. I mean the tv series was about agents working together and the movies turnt Jim who was the main guy in the series into a bad guy. With the whole team getting wiped out like not even 20 minutes into the movie. Hell I'm not even sure if there was an Ethan Hunt in the original series.<br /><br />  In the beginning it's nice seeing Emilio Estevez getting a part as one of the team members. He's entertaining and then he gets crushed on top of an elivator. Even the talented Kristin Scott Thomas is killed off in the beginning. With Ethan's team dieing he becomes the prime suspect and has to clear his name. I think that works and this isn't a bad movie even if it doesn't make sense. Still though Tom Cruise is such a pure ego actor. He produces the movie so of course the whole movie has to be his.<br /><br />  He has them hack up the original show story and center everything around just one character....that he just happens to play. I always liked the 2nd film too but that's even more of a \\"look at me I'm Tom Cruise film\\". Look at Tom on a motorcycle with cool sunglases on, look at Tom do spin kicks, look at Tom think he's James Bond as he chases a hot girl in her car, look at Tom climb a mountain\\", well you get the point lol. I'm looking forward to the 3rd film but I still wonder what the movies would be like if they were more about teams working together and not just one super agent that likes to show off his teeth every 30 seconds with big stupid grins.<br /><br />  What I do like about this original film is Danny Elfman's excellent score which is faithful to the series. Brian De Palma's direction since he trys to be faithful to the series by making us think instead of just throwing mindless action at us like John Woo does in the sequel. I also absolutely love the train scene at the end, probably mostly due to Danny Elfman's score. It's also a fun action scene. De Palma gives us a confusing story that leads to one fun and wild action scene. John Woo's sequel is just a goofy and sorta fun mindless stunt show of a film and that's why I like that one. This film is the complete oppostite, it has  a brain and it's brain is way too big for human life to understand. It was probably written by an advanced life form.mostly due to Danny Elfman's score.

B000E5N62U|2.0|I almost feel guilty giving this a poor review.  I love everything Becker and Fagen have done, together and apart.    The vocals aren't quite right.  They're too straight.  In the past, Fagen always embellished the melody rhythmically.  Here, he follows it way too rigidly for my tastes.  Tonally, it used to be that they were more bare, more piercing, they had some kick.  Maybe it's his age, but Fagen's vocals slip farther back into the mix here, especially when they're multitracked.    Rhythm section is good, but could use more life, more grease.  It's not alive.  What makes Steely Dan's rhythm sections great isn't the rhythmic flawlessness.  It's the interactions between each of the players' idiosyncracies.  It's that stuff that makes it a different listen every time.  You hear things you hadn't heard before.  You don't use a studio cat because you want it perfect - you want his thing on the track.  It's a good rhythm section here, and it grooves, but not in that band-playing-together-in-the-same-room way.    Horns are methodical.  Again, needs more grease.    The guitar player's tone on Morph The Cat (the title track) sounds just like Carlton's, only the solo is all stuff I've heard before.  I miss Walter.  Even if his playing wasn't perfect, you could always hear him strive for something he had never heard before, and when he nailed it, it was incredible.    Edit: the solo on Great Pagoda of Funn is amazing.

B0009A40ES|2.0|I was so excited to watch this movie- well I wasn't impressed at all. The entire movie was predictable- and the fact that it was all in his head wasn't a very good \\"twist\\" at all. Besides Christian Bale, every other actor and actress was very annoying in this movie. In the end he goes on a killing spree that is more hilarious and over the top than shocking and horrifying like this movie wants you to think it is.  <br /> <br />I think this movie could have been made much, much better- the killing scenes could have been more violent- the sexual scene in there I thought was totally unnecessary, the girls weren't even pretty. Although I do have to say the sex scene does get the point across how sadistic and disgusting Bale's character really is- and that is what basically is the only good thing about this movie- Christian's character and the way he plays it. The plot line is bad and needs to be redone or made better.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.  From the very first couple of seconds of putting on, I was taken aback...it was just something i picked up at the library after seeing it on the shelf time and time again, but after hearing the opening bass and drum lines I was like...[...]...OH, this is REAL music... I mean , when I listened to it I got the same feeling as when I heard some of the stuff from Pet Sounds for the first time...you know, the \\"shock of recognition\\" when something makes total perfect sense, and it sounds like something you've been listening to all your life even though it something new.  By that I don't mean it's derivative or a rehash, it's more like when you get deja vu -- something just feels familar from nowhere and fits.    The pop and the noise, the harmonies, singing, bass, drumming, everything on this just fits perfectly..Kamera and I'm the Man Who Loves you are absolutely perfect pop gems... the same three chords but overlaid with such perfectly unobvious melodies  and arrangements ...every song evokes a different feeling....Jesus etc has a  heartbreaking melody and chorus... it's beautiful and it really is outside any straight genre of music (not country, pop, jazz, or anything else).     there's a little bit of annoying fluff on this album, but i can overlook it because i suppose it makes the whole thing more thematic.    I listened to summerteeth after this -- a lot of cool songs, but this is on an entire different level -- it makes summerteeth look like ditties made by teenagers.
6305807930|5.0|Having just viewed Dario Argento's \\"Inferno\\", his follow-up to \\"Suspiria\\", I must say it was fantastic. This film is a real banquet for the eyeballs. The use of color and lighting in this film is magnificent, and the cinematography first-rate as well. The story is dark and ominous and you quickly find yourself immersed in it. I rate it right up there with \\"Tenebre\\", \\"Suspiria\\", and \\"Deep Red\\" as one of his finest cinematic achievements. Just awesome. Dario is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. Period. An uncompromising visionary of stellar genius. He has a vision and he does not deviate, he is unconcerned with studio execs approval or public perception of his films. Unwaivering, he makes the kind of films HE wants to make. He doesn't set out to make a commercially successful film. He doesn't compromise his ideals and sacrifice the integrity of his films by allowing their content to be edited just to please producers, or in a pathetic attempt to try to appeal to a more mainstream audience. Perhaps that's why some of his releases have been cut by nearly an hour! (In the U.S. and other countries outside of Italy.) Sadly, \\"Phenomena\\" was originally released in the U.S. at just 82 minutes. The U.S. version from Anchor Bay is 110 minutes. (It should be noted that this is not the complete version either. The \\"integral version\\" available in Italy, Holland, and Japan runs 115 minutes.) That's 28 to 33 minutes that was cut previously!! That's absolute butchery and that's sickening! The Director's original vision needs to be preserved at all costs. At any rate... Dario is an immensely talented director and \\"Inferno\\" is a prime example of the man at his best. No true Argento fan, or horror film buff in general, should do themselves the injustice of not owning this movie. 5 Stars, hands down. Highly recommended viewing if you enjoy dark, morbid stories with dazzling visual imagery. I wish that even 25% of the directors in Hollywood had the talent, the vision and the balls thatDario possesses. Maybe then we wouldn't be bombarded with the gutless, unimaginative, uninspiring trash that is heaved upon us month after month, year after year, by the Hollywood filmmaking community. But, I digress. Definitely buy this one if you like Dario or horror movies. You won't be sorry.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I have to admit, when I first heard that Rihanna was coming out with a follow up CD to last years, Music OF The Sun, hardly a year after it's release....I was nervous. I thought: That is just stupid and it's not going to be good. I thought that they are just trying to WAY overmarket this girl. Which usually means a bad product in the end.<br /><br />Well, to my suprise this CD surpasses Music OF The Sun by a landslide!!!  This CD is quite solid.

Talking about what people will do to try and bring you down. A decent song.  6/10<br /><br />2. \\"Final Goodbye\\" - Mostlt a nice, slow, acoustic ballad. Adds a few layers of bass and a dumb beat. Good vocals.  9/10<br /><br />3. \\"P.S I'm Still Not Over You\\" - Another slow jam that really shows that Rihanna does have more dimension to her than just a dancehall voice that sounds good layered over bass, synths and drumb beats. Good lyrics.  9/10<br /><br />4. \\"Unfaithful\\" - The BEST song on here!!  WOW!!!  I believe this is going to be her second single off this CD. Showcases what a great voice she has.

The words are great and the arrangement is remarkable!!  10+/10<br /><br />5. \\"Million Miles Away\\" - Another AMAZING ballad!!  Great vocals!!  Who knew??

Nice!  10/10<br /><br />6. \\"S.O.S\\" - Great song to get a dance floor moving that just makes anyone want to dance. With a great use of a sample from the 1980's hit from Soft Cell: \\"Tainted Love\\". A great lead off single for the new CD.  10/10<br /><br />7. \\"We Ride\\" - A good jam. A nice funky hip-hop beat to it. MAkes you want to dance. I like.  10/10<br /><br />8. \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" - A hint of an island sound to it. Good beat. Good vocals. Catchy hook and chours.

A relative forced me to start reading and I was hooked. <br /> <br />I won't go into plot, characters, etc. etc as that has been covered many times here.  What I found really interesting was that at the end of the book I was dropping tears like there was a faucet left wide-open, but I couldn't explain to myself why.  There is something very deep and elemental in this book that touches the center of what makes me human.  I don't know how to name it, but would highly recommend the experience of finding it.
B000BC8STC|4.0|Here is the best James Brown concert available, not for the repertoire, which has no songs (save for two non-listed interjections) not found on the many other DVD/VHS JB offers, and in fact does not contain \\"bonus tracks\\" *or* the listed \\"Hustle (Dead On It)\\"  - the 1975 Disco-Soul semi-hit I'm sure was a major selling point for buyers. If it's here then it's possibly in the form of a very familiar sequeway - maybe a few notes from the tune validate its' listing.<br />What makes this item standout is the fine technical direction, lighting, sound, and more significantly, the chance to watch a great artist, obviously up for the occasion and in great voice. On \\"Please, Please, Please\\" he jumps into the audience (noticeably short on lady fans for some reason) and gets down deep on the classic that put him on the road.<br />There is some consolation for fans here in that \\"It's A Man's...World\\" incorporates \\"Lost Someone\\" and \\"Fever\\" - the only segment which collectors can really enthuse over.<br />This is an excellent companion to the '79 Comeback show (\\"The Lost James Brown Tapes\\" aka \\"Bodyheat\\") and the '83 show with B. B. King at the Beverly Theatre in L.A., which are better musically but do not have the production values of this '81 event.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|One day, something shaped like an octagon and resembling the sky fell on Chicken Little's head.  Frightened, he rang the school bell and proceeded to warn everyone that the sky was falling.  Then the strange thing disappeared, and he became the laughing stock of the town.  But a year later, when the same incident occurs, can he prove to the town and to his father that he's telling the truth? <br /> <br />At first I wanted to see this movie, then it got so much hype that I decided I didn't want to see it.  Ultimately, I did see it, and it was both cute and funny.  It seemed rather short, but the characters were adorable and charismatic, and the animation was fantastic.  I'm really glad that I gave it a chance.  It may frighten very small children in certain parts but for the most part I consider it to be a great family film.
0393327655|1.0|I don't suppose \\"simpleism\\" is a word, but even a casual reader will get the idea. One has to admire Harris' enthusiasm but not his scholarship. His reading of history is one-sided. His appreciation of the philosophical, even mystical, elements in contemporary science is lacking. And his understanding of faith is mis-guided. Faith, in whatever its form, will still be alive when the book is long forgotten.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|i had the pleasure (i'll never tell how) to see this fantastic two disc transfer of ford and wayne's greatest teaming.the movie has never looked better,almost like it was made yesterday.the color and sound leap off the screen at you and the extras are all that a ford or wayne fan could want. <br />      the story(part of which inspired star wars) of a returning civil war vet eathan edwards(wayne in a stark unforgiven role of the racial intolornce of the western hero).after  indians raid a settelement the men ride out to catch them. but it is a ruse as the indians attack the homestead while the men are away. edwards brother and family are killed and his young nince is taken hostage. <br />   edwards then sets off on a mission to find the girl and much like capt. ahab nothing,not time,not money,or the fact that she may be a wife to one of the indians will slow him down. as the hunt goes on it becomes clear that eathan plans to kill her when he finds her,not the wayne hero that we are used to. <br />    with a very famous last shot (that looks better than it has in years ) i can't say enough about how well they have done puting this two disc set together. <br />     if you love westerns or just love great movies,YOU MUST HAVE THIS SET!!!!!!!! <br />

And I love this cd.  It sets my overgrown heart fluttering like the Mexican flag during a US pro-anti-cinco-de-puto-rally.

There's not a bad song in the batch and the howling, sensual screeches of Ms. Bush do make me love Bush more than ever before.  Bravo Kate.  Viva la bush!!!
6305692572|4.0|This was much, much better than I expected it to be.  A real tear jerker.  If I was to let myself cry, this movie would've been it, not \\"The Joy Luck Club\\".  Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination.  He was simply great.  I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me.  Of course, he was also terrific in \\"The Godfather Part 3\\".  Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films.  But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8.  Also, the look of the film, set in San Francisco, is good, especially the interiors of their house.  Garcia really seems to care about Ryan.  This movie is about love, and how it doesn't always carry the day with alcoholics.  I also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things, they've been married and had a kid (you don't learn til much later that he is not the older kid's dad), and we see her drink a lot.  They don't start with how they fell in love, or even attempt to explain why she's an alcoholic.  Smart.
B000000WHC|5.0|I discovered this powerful album four years ago, and as a blues lover I was instantly impressed! Anyone who thinks Stevie Ray Vaughan is as good as it gets in the world of blues-rock needs to get their hands on this sizzling album by veteran rocker Gary Moore.  Gary was a hard rock/heavy metal musician in the 70's and 80's who recorded a string of albums in that style for more than a decade. He is still overlooked and underappreciated here in America, but is a much more popular musician overseas.     In 1990, Moore decided to express his love for the blues with this album which was a departure from his usual heavy metal style. With high-voltage guitar playing, good singing, and a great set of songs, Still got the Blues is surely one of the best blues-rock albums of the 1990's. Gary is equally adept at searing uptempo rockers and passionate ballads, and great examples of both can be found here. This CD is top-notch from start to finish.    \\"Moving On\\" is a great rocker with sizzling slide guitar that kicks off the album nicely. The Albert King classic \\"Oh pretty woman\\" is next and it is another dynamic tune that features Albert playing along with Gary. \\"King of the Blues\\" is Moore's tribute song to King, and Gary also tips his hat to Stevie Ray and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top in the song \\"Texas Strut\\". \\"Midnight Blues\\" and \\"As the years go passing by\\" are both sultry and atmospheric ballads, but the highlight of this album is the spell-binding \\"Still got the Blues for you\\". This track contains some of the most captivating guitar playing to ever be found in a modern blues song, not to mention Gary's most soulful vocal performance. It is one of those songs that reaches out and grabs your appreciation when you hear it, and it rightfully stands as his biggest hit.    Blues purists are not usually fond of Gary Moore or this album because of the fact that Gary basically takes blues songs and injects them with searing heavy metal guitar solos. Moore is really a rock musician rather than a blues musician, but that doesn't matter to me because his remarkable guitar skills and love for blues music is undeniable. Gary is doing exactly what Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd have done.  They are all exposing great blues music to the rock audience who will never hear anything this good on MTV or modern rock radio. Music is music, it's either good or bad, and if blues music can sound this great all the time then I'm all for it!    Any blues or rock n' roll fan who hasn't heard this excellent album is missing out on some hot music and even hotter guitar playing.  Get a copy of this CD and turn it up!

B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton has always embraced blues music since the beginning of his career, and most of his pop/rock material simply pales in comparison to his rare blues efforts.  Clapton has admitted to being blown away by the overwhelming talent of Stevie Ray Vaughan in the 80's, and it seems Clapton has directed his attention toward the blues a lot more ever since Stevie Ray left us.    From the Cradle is an album so brimming with passionate guitar playing and blues music of the highest calibre that it simply blows away nearly anything else Clapton has recorded since the late 60's or early 70's.  What is impressive about this album is how it isn't a \\"blues-rock\\" album at all like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Gary Moore, or even Stevie Ray would do.  This is pure classic blues played very faithfully to the original versions of these songs, and yet it still sounds like a modern blues album!  It is really the fire in Clapton's guitar playing here that makes this sound more contemporary than Muddy Waters or Elmore James, even though these are traditional blues arrangements all the way.  This proves that the only thing that really keeps the original recordings of these songs from being embraced by more people today is the lack of modern recording technology and stereo sound that Clapton had the benefit of here.    The album starts off with Elmore James' driving slide guitar tune \\"Blues before sunrise\\" which is a note for note copy of Elmore's version, and Eric's version of the Muddy Waters classic \\"Standing around Crying\\" is frighteningly close to Muddy's 1952 recording as well.  Jerry Portnoy's harmonica playing on this track sounds IDENTICAL to Little Walter's playing on Muddy's version!!  It is almost as if Walter's harmonica was lifted from Muddy's recording and inserted into Eric's recording!  This shows the great respect Clapton has for this music to be able to recreate the sound of the original versions with such stunning authenticity.    Other highlights of this album are the Otis Rush tune \\"Groaning the Blues\\", another Elmore James classic \\"It hurts me too\\", Freddie King's masterpiece \\"Someday after awhile\\", and Clapton's fiery take on the Chicago blues standard \\"Five long years\\" where his guitar solos are so sizzling hot it reminds you why he is considered one of the best guitarists in the arena of rock and blues!      Another thing about this album that is noteworthy is the unexpected passion in Clapton's singing for a change.  When you hear him belt out songs here like \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" and \\"It hurts me too\\", it confounds the general notion that Eric isn't a good vocalist.  Perhaps his singing sounds too forceful on a couple of tracks, but it is great to hear him finally breathe the same passion into his vocals that he breathes into his guitar solos.    Clapton has recorded several classic solo albums over the years, but if he has recorded one that leaves a bigger impression than From the Cradle I haven't heard it yet.  This has to be the best album Eric Clapton has done in the past two decades or more, and it proves without a doubt that he is a better blues musician than anything else.  THIS is the kind of music Eric Clapton should focus on more often.  I think many people would agree.
B0000683DH|5.0|One of the great idealist themes of the Star Trek series is that in times of crisis, your friends will stand by you and believe in you when all appearances are against you.  Any teenage social outcast growing up in the 1970s & 80s could tune in to their local UHF channel running classic Star Trek reruns on weekday afternoons (when we only had about 5 total channels on TV) and immerse ourselves in this fantasy.  Star Trek II is the quintessential melodrama for this theme.  \\"It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times\\" is a theme in the movie.  And in the Star Trek universe, in the worst of times, your trusted friends will step up to assist you.<br /><br />The movie asks the following question repeatedly.  What would you do if faced with a no-win situation?  A Kobayashi Maru?  Do you concede the loss?  Do you redefine the rules?  Do you cheat?  Or do you sacrifice?  What steps do you take to protect yourself & your allies?<br /><br />In the real world, we rarely find friends that will stay around during hard times.  That ideal exists more in the world of fiction.  But if you find a friend who sticks by you during genuinely difficult times and who stands by you when most others step away, then treasure them, because they are one of the rarest assets you will ever encounter.<br /><br />When faced with a no win situation, Lt. Saavik fights fair and loses.  Captain Kirk cheats and wins.  Spock redefines the terms and sacrifices.<br /><br />Spock doesn't talk about all he would sacrifice for his friends.  He doesn't say one thing and do another.  The fact that Spock directs his chosen fate at the end of the film is not primarily what makes us cry.  What makes us cry is that we knew his quality of character all along, yet we didn't appreciate it until it was fully realized and he was gone.  He was uncharismatic, logical, insensitive at times, & frank - not particularly endearing qualities.  But to those who knew him well, Kirk's farewell words break our hearts, \\"Of my friend I can only say this, of all the souls that I have encountered in my travels, his was the most . . . human.\\"<br /><br />Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related movies.is, of all the souls that I have encountered in my travels, his was the most . . . human.\\"    Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related movies.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|with his last CD Screen Behind the Mirror Enigma(michael Cretu) had gotten so great and impressive that it seemed that his genious was about to burst and that there was no more he could do that was of great quality. But that was wrong doing the smart thing Cretu decided to tone it down and go back to basics and thus he has come out with Vouyager.  <br /> <br />The use of chants has lessend tremendously in this cd and cretu has decided to go more melodic and trance like while still holding the dance floor sounding beats that made his music so tremendously popular. While manny of the songs hold true to the sound of Enigma Cretu has moved to a more ambientelectronica sound that gives his music a more livly feel to it (a good thing). the beats are amazing and the music is all that one could hope for. <br />I can honestly say that it is one of his best cds a must have for all enigma listeners.
B00004RJ74|5.0|ok.. I absolutely loved this movie but went expecting vampires..<br /><br />IF they had advertised this movie as a typical Tarantino Action/esque type film and then they hit you with the vampires it would have been so much better..<br /><br />sort of like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS if they could have kept the punch line out of the media etc.. It would have been awesome..<br /><br />the moment they tell you that the calls are coming from inside the house it would have been priceless..<br /><br />With this movie.. they advertisted it as a VAMPIRE MOVIE but if they could have kept that surprise away from us it would have been awesome..<br /><br />I mean.. I watched it with my step dad and he had no clue it was about vampires.. he thought it was a Crime/Action type movie.. then all of a sudden BLA-DOW!!! VAMPIRES and hew as like what the...... and it was beutiful<br /><br />but regardless of my little rant this movie rocks! saw it in the theater and own it on VHS as well as DVD<br /><br />can't go wrong!
B000002URV|5.0|Before I started listening to Enigma I was the type of person that listned to korn, Rammstein, Disturbed and so on but then my russian friend who'd been listening to it sience he was like 7 gave this cd to me not expecting much I poped it in and was imediatly amazed by the sound of it. The musical side of me had been awakened I could not stop listening once it ended I just started it again and again. The song Principles of Lust was by far the best song on the entire cd its dancefloor beat, its grgorian chants the flute part it was all done flawlessly and amazingly. This cd is amazing.
B0001I561E|4.0|I watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter just tonight. It is supposed to be the story of Aladdin from the \\"Thousand and one nights\\" also known as \\"Arabian nights\\". The problem is that it deviates from the true story in many ways. For example there is no \\"ring\\" or its Genie in the movie at all. There are additions such as the monkey turned elephant as well. In fact there are so many other deviations that it would take me a whole day to mention. However to be fair, this is not unique to this movie. Most movies, Disney in particular tend to rewrite master pieces resulting in vastly modified stories.<br /><br />Now this modified story, is perfectly OK by itself and my daughter loved it. There are some clear attempts to make the story appealing to adults. But then it helps to have parents interested! The songs are good and kids love them.<br /><br />As for the politically correct change from the first Disney release i.e. replacing the  arab stereotyping, it is not unique. Disney also replaced a particularly offensive (stereotyping of africans) part of Fantasia in their DVD offer. My feeling is that we could all do with less racism and if it means  removing offensive scenes and language we should do so. Besides this movie was never the real story anyway and the \\"non-PC\\" part hardly contributed anything. After all the value of the movie is not in how many people it hurts. My advise is: If you want the real story, please read the book.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a great movie, just not the real story!

6302732778|3.0|A classic?  That seems both premature and a bit of a stretch.  Perhaps the film reviewers in Los Angeles are so used to their dry climate that the mere thought of a LA where the rain is constantly falling is science fiction to the max.  With that said, the issues that keep this movie from moving into the classic category are many.  How does a genetically engineered replicant decide to go from the Outer Colonies to be a snake dancer in a sleazy strip club?  Programming?  The others sure seem to have rejected their programming, especially the \\"First Law of Robotics.\\"  Note the hint of an abundant fossil fuel economy, lack of vision for cell phones, excessive drinking and smoking (really reminded me of Casablanca, but Casablanca wasn't mimicking the future), and two-tiered society (\\"If you are not police, you are one of the little people.\\"<br /><br />One the positive side, I can see there were a number of interesting and cutting edge directing issues of this story for the time (1982, I believe).  No big focus on explosions, a lot of \\"human\\" tension, actors who weren't all \\"the beautiful people,\\" gloomy sets, thrilling chases, and more.<br /><br />This is a good movie to see once every decade.
0812550706|4.0|A winner of multiple science fiction awards, its back cover says that the American Library Association listed it in \\"100 Best Books for Teens.\\"  I have nothing but respect for the association, but they're mistaken.  It's good, make no doubt about that.  Ender, a permitted `third' child in a world of childbirth limits, is removed from his parents' home to train in the hopes of becoming the great military leader that the powers that be feel is so badly needed.    The character development is great for Ender and subtly strong for many secondary characters.  The pacing is compelling.  The future that Card creates is not unlike others, but is clear and well made.  Truth be told at this point, I enjoyed it.  I would, however, be very reluctant to lend it to a teenager.   <br /> <br />To quote a different kind of authority: \\"What's done to children, they will do to society.\\" -Karl A. Menninger, psychiatrist (1893-1990)   I agree and it's what the book's adults do to Ender that makes me so wary of lending it.  They model and act as if the ends justify the means.  They often believe that misleading children is necessary for growth.  They frequently overlook or tacitly encourage violence if it suits their purposes.  They function on the premise that support and love are counterproductive to the growth they want.  These are difficult enough concepts for an adult to be able to set aside as fiction, but they're entirely too challenging for a young mind to try to incorporate into a meaningful world.  Those and the whole premise of the value of pre-emptive strike based on past actions and not current threats make a chilling package.  The end does reveal some of the fallacies of those actions, and in some ways suggests that another ending, one which relied on cleverness and communication, would have not only been possible, but wiser and much more suitable to a young adult audience.  I'd recommend it to an adult who has the wherewithal to cast a jaundiced eye on some portions of thetale, but would probably not recommend it to anyone below college age.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Unless you are a closed minded fan of one genre music you should own this album.  It's not metal, it's not punk or hardcore..it's a mix of everything from the aforementioned genres and way beyond including amazing string arrangements to an erie Danny Elfeman-esque piece.  Every band member is a master at their instrument.  I have had this CD in my player from the day it came out.  The only thing I can say that some may not enjoy is the singing.  But it will grow on you if you give it a chance.  Just remember the first time you heard GnR's singing, or ACDC (if you are old enough).  I hope this is just a start for bringing guitar rock back from the grave.  Every CD this band has released is worth owning.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|While I think we all agree that the game was a landmark and an engaging piece of fiction, I can't go along with the statement that this movie doensn't milk the series at all.  What new dimensions to the plot or the world or the characters does the film add?  I can barely think of a single one.  It seems to me that the only reason Final Fantasy 7 was chosen as a substrate plot (or hijacked plot, maybe) was because 1) it is so well known and beloved by fans and 2) all the character development and motivation had already been taken care of, so the directors could pursue the \\"all-action\\" approach for their demo of new CG technology. <br />I also disliked when all the FF7 characters appear out of nowhere to fight the big monster who also appears out of nowhere.  I remember the child saying to Tifa, \\"Who are all these people?\\"  and Tifa sheepishly responds, \\"Some friends\\", as if to betray the director's guilt for abusing fan charcter worship.  Not only was this whole sequence meaningless to those not familiar with the game, but it detracted from any possible storyline the movie could have pursued.  The only emotional moments of the film were  mere references to FF7, for example the several scenes with Aeris, as opposed to emotions that arise naturally from a well-executed story.   <br />I actually liked the end of the FF7 game with respect to Cloud's character.  It ended with him finally coming to terms with himself instead of the sugar-coated end of AC, which turns him into cardboard.  I wish movies would go back to having well rounded plot development with varied pacing.  Sigh.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It is wonderful to see Ang Lee come back with `Brokeback Mountain,' beautifully-shot, heart-rending drama about two cowboys and their forbidden love. Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too. <br /> <br />The quiet opening section is the strongest part, where Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to guard the sheep in the mountains in the early 1960s. The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain, <br />  <br />Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children. While Jack considers the possibility of living together, Ennis, who recounts a horrible episode from his childhood memories, evades the topic altogether, suggesting his repressed fear about the consequences of such a life. However, as time goes by - and the film covers about 20 years of their life -- their hidden (so they believe) relations inevitably influence those around them, especially the life of Alma (Michelle Williams), Ennis's wife.  <br /> <br />First and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack. Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers. Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past. <br /> <br />Female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis. Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC-born actress is miscast as Texas girl. (And there are brief nudity of them, which is totally unnecessary here.) Anna Faris, Linda Cardellini, and Kate Mara also appear, but with the exception of Kate Mara, who plays the daughter of Ennis and seeks for the love of her father, the good cast is largely wasted. <br /> <br />`Brokeback Mountain' is not without flaws. Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.

B00005JOFQ|2.0|OK, I know I am breaking the mold here for all the rave reviews, but I found this film long, slow, and somewhat dull(Big gasp!).I rented it because of all the hype and all the controversy generated when \\"Crash\\" won best picture over this movie.  I have to say, now that I've seen \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" that \\"Crash\\" deserved to win.  I won't go into all the plot detail as most reviewers feel compelled to do, but I did feel that, although the scenery is beautiful and the acting is believable, the story is not compelling.  Jack and Ennis are not terrribly sympathetic characters, and I felt the most empathy for Alma (Michelle Willliams), Ennis's long-suffering wife. The movie is not romantic at all, even though the director tries to bolster this view by setting the majority of Ennis and Jack's love scenes in the majestic, wild, and free Montana mountains.  To create a contrast between their love affair and their \\"real-life\\" (read \\"forced\\") relationships, the director made sure that scenes of Jack and Ennis's married life were set in oppressive, flat, ugly, and characterless towns drawn staight from \\"Urban Cowboy.\\"  No wonder they longed for their days on Brokeback Mountain! Movies with little action can still be mesmerizing (see \\"Lost in Translation\\"), but this flick borders on the anesthetizing and devolves into a sort of gay \\"Same Time Next Year.\\" I can't help but wonder: If this  film had been about a heterosexual couple, even a 60's era interrracial couple, would it have generated anything near this level of hype?
B0002HYC8C|5.0|We had an older model Pirate Ship (bought second hand) that I was very impressed with so we forked up the cash and bought my son the Noah's Ark (something he wanted for 2 years).  We were all very impressed with the wonderful quality and details that make this toy so outstanding.  It just doesn't compare with the plastic toys(figurines and animals) that he usually plays with.  Both the Pirate Ship and Noah's Ark float on water, which just adds to the fun, and have different levels and compartments with so many related accessories that just makes playing a more authentic and richer experience.  We all know that for young children, pretend play is important in fostering imagination and creativity.  Just in case you're not familiar with the toys...we have lots of fun swapping the hats, hair, beards & some clothing accessories around with different characters.  I just get so impressed with all the different accessories that are made with great detail.  I think that it's worth the price: high in quality and imagination and fun.  Next year, we'll collect the ZOO!!

0783114893|5.0|How about both. Reading through these reviews, I don't think people have properly emphasized that this is a work of art, and displays a more deft hand in story-building and characterization than you might think you're getting from what appears to be on the surface another brainless 80s thriller.     But it's so much more. It's almost like an old existential play in a way, with parts of feeling like they could've been penned by Beckett or Sartre.    There are essentially 3 characters. C. Thomas Howell as Jim Halsey, a magnificent, yes, Oscar worthy performance by Rutger Hauer as John Ryder, the hitcher, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Nash, the waitress. Jim is driving a car from Chicago to California, part of a service where people were hired to drive cars to locations of places they wanted to go anyway, a service you don't see too much anymore. Along the way he picks up Ryder. In a scene that unravels in a horrifying way, Ryder reveals that he is a murderer and Jim will be his next victim. Jim manages to dump him. However, Ryder turns up again in a truly chilling scene that made my blood run cold the first time I saw it.     Ryder frames Jim for murders he commits, further entangling Jim in his web. Yes, Ryder appears to have supernatural powers at times, and the cops do seem excessively stupid to advance the story, but it's worth it to see first rate acting and characterization like this.    Hauer should've won awards for this movie. He is nightmarish, an absolute monster as Ryder, an enigmatic and almost spectral killer, with yes, a funny, but horrifying and black sense of humor. His diner scene is one of the most powerful pieces of acting I've ever seen in any movie, ever. If you have the movie, queue it up to that part. Look at the look on he gives Jim when Jim looks up to see him sitting across from him at the diner. Dread-inducing evil, and the coldest, most sadistic blue eyes you'd ever not-hope to see. He is handsome in a cruel, terrifying, yet captivating way.His ambivalence towards death is frightening, and never before in movies have pennies seemed so fraught with symbolism and menace.    The relationship between Jim and Ryder is one of much speculation and debate. It is wonderfully mysterious, puzzling, warped, and compelling. Even the sherriff notes something strange is going on between them. Does Ryder have a [...] attraction to Jim? Or some sort of death wish he wants Jim to fulfill? Did he just randomly pick some kid and decide to wreck his life with this game? It seems sadomasochistic in a way, like Ryder wants to inflict as much pain as possible on Jim, but he doesn't want to kill him, he wants Jim to kill him, to become him. This is just one interpretation of many you could make.     The stark California desert makes an excellent backdrop for the movie, and the mood is well enhanced by the excellent symmetry; the movie begins with the flares of the Hitcher's match and ends on the same note with Jim Halsey.    In conclusion, \\"The Hitcher\\" is one of the best thrillers of all time, in addition to having some of the best characterization, and one of the best acting performances (Hauer) *ever* in cinema. It is not without some forgivable flaws, and it does have a couple of stomach-churning scenes (one of them quite famous) so I can't recommend it to the faint of heart, but for everyone else, see this movie as soon as you possibly can.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is the epitome of Stephen King's writing method. It's King's forte to turn a simple idea into a fascinating world--one that maintains a relatable identity while mangled by horrible situations.  I've read a lot of King like a lot of others have, and I'm sure that his works are as addicting for me for that formulatic reason.   <br /> <br />However, addicting as haunted hotels and post-apocolyptic America is, the style gets as tiresome as it is powerful.  He gets to be an over-descriptive wordsmith with gargantuan thickets such as It and The Stand.  <br /> <br />When Mr. King decides to humble himself and write a more meager novel, as is The Long Walk, his effect becomes all the more haunting, moving, shocking and resonant.  Often, it's what one doesn't say that is just as (or in the case of horror: more) important than what one does.  I fear Stebbins, the mysterious ironman Walker, much more than the Spider in It.  The Spider may have pages illuminating it as the most unimaginably insidious beast...but what kind of society has such animalistic urges engrained into its veins that the Crowd and the Major can allow--no, love and spectate--this Long Walk?  When King can allude to some dark force without actually showing it--as he does with The Long Walk--his work becomes magical enough to turn all the playing cards comprising his novel into a haunted castle whose halls echo indefinitely, and whose doors slam shut when they please. <br /> <br />Read The Long Walk.  The bottom line is that it's short and sweet...and sweet in King's world can tingle your blood cold. <br /> <br />

Well, it is and it is surely one of my favorites, but it also makes a wonderful gift. I have introduced this book to every child in my life from my nieces and nephews to children of friend to my own children. This is a classic, defined by each meaningfully simple word and eloquently illustrated page.

0140182829|5.0|This is the only novel of a young French writer - his real name was Henri Alban - who died in the First World War at the age of twenty-seven. The narrator is a young boy, the son of a schoolmaster in provincial France in the late nineteenth century, and the story begins when a new pupil comes to the school, the extraordinary Augustin Meaulnes. Taller than the other boys, stronger, more daring, Meaulnes seems destined for adventure; and adventure soon comes when he absconds from school and discovers the mysterious \\"lost domain,\\" deep in the countryside. There, guests gather for a strange and enchanting party - and Meaulnes meets the beautiful Yvonne de Galais, who is to beguile him for the rest of the book. Thus begins one of the great romantic novels of adolescence and a brilliantly magical fable, filled with mystery and longing.  <br /> <br />A great many writers have citied this as a favourite, notably John Fowles, in the preface to the 1977 revised reissue of his novel The Magus (1965), who claims that he sought, in this justly celebrated novel about the mysterious goings-on on a Greek island, to create the same effect of enchantment achieved by Alain-Fournier. (Interestingly, Fowles says that he missed a trick: he should have made his main character a teenage boy, instead of a young schoolteacher.) In English translations, Le Grand Meaulnes (the narrator's bantering term of affection for his intrepid friend, as in \\"The Great Meaulnes\\" or \\"Meaulnes the Great\\") now usually appears under the French title, but has been known in the past as The Wanderer or, more commonly, The Lost Domain. Read it. This is a book you will never forget, once it has enchanted you with its strange magic.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I watched this 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice some years ago and then forgot all about it. I guess I wasn't really paying attention to it, and decided to give it another go last night. Now, I am an ardent fan of the BBC adaptation starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]], and the other adaptation I have a fondness for is the one starring David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet, [[ASIN:B000244FDW Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)]]. Both are faithful adaptations of the novel and I've worn out my DVDs watching them over and over whenever I have the time.<br /><br />This 2005 adaptation is a film version, so it is predictably an abridged version. It stars Keira Knightley (who does well in period dramas, e.g. [[ASIN:B001L57ZZG The Duchess]], and [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement (Widescreen Edition)]]) as Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew McFadyen as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Long-suffering Mr. Bennet is played by Donald Sutherland, and Mrs. Bennet is played by Brenda Blethyn. The other daughters are played by Rosamund Pike (Jane), Jena Malone (Lydia), Carey Mulligan (Kitty), and Talulah Riley (Mary). Elizabeth's best friend, Charlotte Lucas is played by Claudie Blakley (who went on to do an amazing job as Emma Timmins in the beloved BBC series Lark Rise and Candleford.<br /><br />So how does this film version measure up to the full-length BBC series? There is truly no comparison. Many liberties have been taken with the storyline such that the essence of the story is there, but many of the finer nuances of Austen's writing and social commentary is quite lost in translation. Both Knightley and McFadyen deliver credible performances, though Knightley's giggly and bewildered looks do tend to get a tad tiresome after awhile. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are sufficiently adequate in their roles, but the actors portraying them fail to capture the true essence of these two ridiculous characters, especially in Mrs. Bennet's case. Jena Malone also fails to convince as the flirty, silly, and impulsive Lydia Bennet (she really can't compare to Julia Sawalha's infuriatingly convincing performance in the 1996 BBC adaptation). The actor portraying Mr. Collins delivered a tepid performance. Luckily his counterpart in the movie, Charlotte Lucas nee Collins as played by Blakley, is compelling. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the snobbish wannabe mother-in-law to Darcy, is well-played by Dame Judi Dench (who never fails to deliver in any of her roles).<br /><br />Despite these flaws and the liberties taken with the plot, I did like this adaptation because of several things. The two leads beguile viewers with their strong chemistry. There's a sexual tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy that practically simmers on-screen and draws viewers in. The love-hate relationship and longing that is so evident is credibly portrayed by the two leads, each look, gesture, etc. The cinematography is breathtaking. When I first saw Pemberley in this movie, it just about took my breath away (though the Pemberley featured in the 1996 BBC adaptation will always be my favorite). My favorite outdoors scene in this movie was of Elizabeth standing on the cliffs with the haunting music playing the background...it was just transcendent! Then there's the amazing score. The music is so perfect for this period drama, and Dawn is one of my favorites. The music is memorable and can very well be a classic, just as the score to the 1996 BBC adaptation is.<br /><br />All in all, I was glad I watched this again, and will add this adaptation to my Pride and Prejudice collection.of these two ridiculous characters, especially in Mrs. Bennet's case.

B00005JM02|2.0|I'll start with the visuals which obviously led people to so overrate this middling effort. The visuals were indeed technically impressive and beautiful at times. But to me these  synthetic, digital images are hard on the eyes after a few minutes, and just plain grating. Take us back to real drawings. <br /> <br />But I suppose the delightful scenes of the reef are what led people to so overrate this movie. The basic story line of finding the lost son is so simple it is hard to call clever. The purported tension of the movie -- repeated life threatening encounters -- became tediously predictable. The humor was usually strained, and supposedly funny riffs (memory loss, whale talk)were repeated to the point of tedium.
B00005MP58|5.0|I own both the A&E Special Edition (1996) as well as the recently purchased Restored Edition. Though the Special Edition has some bonus features which I appreciated, I prefer the picture quality of the Restored Edition. The print quality is crisp and clear, compared to the slightly faded picture quality of the A&E Special Edition. In addition, the bonus features of the Restored Edition include:<br />Completely Digitally Remastered version of the movie<br />Anamorphic Widescreen Presentation<br />Featurettes: Lasting Impressions; An Impromptu Walkabout with Adrian Lukis and Lucy Briers; Turning Point: Uncovering the technical Restoration Process<br />English subtitles (which is especially beneficial for the hearing-impaired)<br /><br />I have watched this BBC adaptation of Pride & Prejudice more than a dozen times, and I still love it! It never fails to transport me into Austen's world, & makes me yearn to remain there for as long as I can. My fantasies notwithstanding, I must say that the cast of this adaptation do an excellent job. The roles are matched perfectly to the actors & actresses, and the two leads are PERFECT!I would not wish for another Elizabeth or Darcy...and I think these are the defining roles for Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet) & Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy). A gem indeed!
0739326740|4.0|A very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Well written. Brown presents an engaging murder-mystery plot with interesting characters, intriguing puzzles and solid historical references.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|At first glance this movie is simply a heap of incredible graphics.  And i'll admit that it is that.  The graphics of this movie are so wonderful that there is no word in the English language to desrcibe it.  You say, \\"Are they really that good?\\"  The answer: yes.  Underneath the fancy graphics is a fairly decent storyline, however it doesn't quite live up to the game's storyline.  Of course the movie only has two hours to express it in and throws in lots of action as well.  Speaking of action... here's another place where this movie shines.  It's all so perfectly placed (the movements) that's it's like a violent dance... with big swords.  It's spaced somewhat strangely in between parts with fair amounts of dialogue and seems a bit strange... but you kind of don't care.  Seeing your favorite old characters in the way they shouyld have been displayed is also great.  Barret, Tifa, Red XIII, they all look incredible in the AC world and the voice acting, though criticized by others, seemed perfectly fine to me.  The music is incredible.  Orchestrated and it always fits the mood.  The return of \\"One Winged Angel\\" in an orches-rock set was wonderful as well.  I still can't get it out of my head.  I was in total awe at the end and I'm sure you would be, too.  A perfect film for action fans, animation fans, and Final Fantasy fans.  People not even into these genres will at least be astounded by the graphics.  Buy it now.  You won't ever regret it.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am 23 and have loved U2 for just over 10 years now. 'Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me' was the first single I bought which led me to discover 'Achtung Baby', their true masterpiece. 'Pop' was the first new U2 album I bought and is now my second favourite album by them. I was initially upset with their post-'Pop' direction with 'The Sweetest Thing' single and the mellow 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' album but that album's highlight's ('Beautiful Day', 'Kite', 'New York') and seeing them on the 'Elevation' tour won me over and I now appreciate their poppier but still soulful and passionate post 'Pop' sound.<br /><br />Which (at last!) leads me to 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb'.<br /><br />This album has caused a lot of controversy amongst casual and die-hard U2 fans and I don't understand the low rating's this not perfect but still brilliant album has been recieving!<br /><br />The first time I heard it all the way through, I was disappointed- I was expecting a more up-tempo heavier album after reading some of the reviews. I thought I could never love it but of course, repeated listens over several months made me re-evaluate it. My opinion now after living with it for nearly two years and seeing them perform a majority of the album live on the 'Vertigo' tour is that over half of it is a classic album and the remainder of it is solid but not great U2.<br /><br />The first six songs are up there with U2's greatest material and could make for the best 'Side One' of any of U2's albums- seriously! There is only one equally great song from the second half and that is the sublime 'One Step Closer', a song that moves me to tears and a song that I definitely want to be played at my funeral, it means that much to me both lyrically and musically.<br /><br />'A Man And A Woman' has grown on me though I prefer the acoustic version found on the b-side to 'All Because Of You'. It has a wonderful chorus and I love Edge's falsetto vocal on the \\"You were already mine\\" section!<br /><br />The remaining tracks on the second half are the solid but not great songs I was referring to earlier. I'm not including the fun bonus track 'Fast Cars' by the way!<br /><br />Going back to the first half, 'Vertigo' and 'All Because Of You' are electrifying rock 'n' roll songs and are a massive improvement on the catchy but relatively naff 'Elevation' from the previous album. 'Miracle Drug' and 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' feature some classic Edge slide guitar and passionate vocals from Bono. Once you know that the latter track is about Bono's father and the inspiration he had on his son, it hits you even harder emotionally.<br /><br />'Love And Peace Or Else' could have been better produced (the guitars aren't punchy enough) but it's a superb album track and a live highlight.<br /><br />Which leaves one more song and the best of them all- 'City Of Blinding Lights'. This has become my favourite U2 song full stop. Blinding guitars, beautiful keyboards, fantastic lyrics about trying to maintain some innocence and naivety as you grow older, incredible chorus and a stunning intro and outro, even better then 'Where The Streets Have No Name'. Another 'Vertigo' tour highlight that I hope remains in their live set for years to come!<br /><br />Overall this album is a top 5 favourite of mine in terms of U2 albums and that top 5 in order is 'Achtung Baby', 'Pop', 'October', 'The Joshua Tree' and 'HTDAAB'.tracks on the second half are the solid but not great songs I was referring to earlier.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I had no idea this cd was even coming out. Then one day I saw it on here, and I rushed out to buy it. I have been an Emmylou Harris fan for years now, and I rush out to buy every cd she releases. These days she doesn't release them as frequently, so it is always a treat to her new music. Emmylou has the most beautiful voice in my opinion, it's very ethereal and she always brings so much to any collaboration. I admit Mark Knopler is not an artist I am too familiar with, but I find this CD thoroughly enjoyable. They compliment each other so well, and the songs are well done. There isn't one bad song here, but my favorites include \\"Beachcoming\\", \\"Belle Starr\\", \\"This is Us\\", \\"Donkey Town\\", and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\". A great album worth having a place in your collection!
0812975219|2.0|Mr. Taleb seems to spend half the book patting himself on the back for being a trader who actually reads books.  If you can put aside his annoying, self-congratulatory tone and tiresome class snobbery, you will be treated to a meandering, unfocused collection of half-developed ideas that ultimately leave you unsatisfied.  I made it through half the book on the promise that something interesting was to come, but despaired soon after.  Perhaps there is some great insight in the second half of the book, but I didn't think it was worth the effort to find out.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|Pink's strength has always been the depth of her writing, although her unique voice comes in a close second. At the time of her debut, Pink was viewed as just another disposable teen singer, although she sang R&B rather than straight pop. However, with each album she has grown and asserted more and more of her own personality. On her third offering, Try This, Pink strayed even further from the R&B her record label had originally pushed her to do. Instead, she takes on the pop-rock approach, and manages to pull it off convincingly. There are not many singers who can sing this style without it sounding contrived. Luckily, Pink is one of the few who can. <br /> <br />Lead single, \\"Trouble\\", brings the album off to a good start. One of the more heavy rock tracks, most people viewed this song as a poor choice for a single, if not a just bad in general. Far from the best song on the album, it is catchy and likeable enough to start things off well. \\"God Is a DJ\\" was accepted more widely as the second single, although it took a while for it to grow on me. This song works on several levels. Firstly, it is a fun song and quite danceable which is generally the formula for a good single. Secondly, it's a metaphor, although most didn't pick up on it. Here, Pink states, \\"If God is a DJ/Life is a dance floor/You get what you're given/It's all how you use it\\". I've heard many people pass this off as nonsense, however it is really quite logical. Essentially, what Pink is saying is that despite what life we are given, it's the way we use it that matters.  Switching back from the pop side into rock on \\"Last to Know\\", Pink angrily sings about a guy who stood her up because she wouldn't sleep with him on their date. The emotion here seems genuine, thus making it one of the album highlights. <br /> <br />\\"Tonight's the Night\\" is possibly the weakest offering the album has to give. I'm not quite sure what style Pink was going for here, and although her vocals are great, the song just doesnot work. Pink sings about just wanting to have fun to escape; yet this is the only song that comes across contrived. \\"Oh My God\\" featuring Peaches is the easily most heavily criticized track, however I don't really see why. The vocals and production match impeccably, although Pink doesn't so much sing as speak in a rhythm. Regardless, this is a great track and even the guest rap from Peaches (who I've never heard of before, or even after this song) does nothing to hinder it even though she is far from an exceptional rapper. Teaming up once more with Linda Perry, who handled most of Pink's sophomore effort, Pink brings us \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\". Despite her seeming aversion to slow songs (there are very few on any of her albums), they always suit Pink's voice incredibly. This is definitely a highlight. <br /> <br />Following an album highlight is always a risky affair. The artist always has the chance of putting an average track that would have sounded good anywhere else on the album, but sounds lacklustre when placed after a highlight. However, this is not the case here as \\"Waiting For Love\\" is equally as great, if not better than, the previous song. Pink has a knack for adding genuine emotion to her songs, and this one shows that to its fullest effect. The lyrics are simple, yet deep and the vocals understated (for the most part) yet powerful all at once. \\"All the changes and all the mistakes/Foolishly laughing at thing that/Words that she says\\" is a perfect example of both an excellent vocal performance, and the lyrical quality and depth. Unfortunately, \\"Save My Life\\" is a perfect example of the aforementioned problem with tracks after highlights. While good in it's own right, it was placed after two of the album's best, it fails to really stand out. I will emphasize once more, however, that this is in no way a bad song, thus it is definitely worth a listen.  <br /> <br />\\"Try Too Hard\\" is commonly viewed as hypocritical. In it, Pink comments on people who try too hard to fit in (\\"Everything you feel, everything you know/You found it on your favourite TV show\\"). With statements like, \\"And it's people like you that make me sick\\", Pink would have, and unfortunately did, set herself up for criticism. However, what most people fail to notice is that Pink makes the same comment about herself in the end, reflecting \\"And it's people like us that make me sick.\\" Great message, and very entertaining song. \\"Humble Neighbourhoods\\", while entertaining, is a step backwards lyrically. The song isn't really about anything, yet it is catchy enough that it someone manages to work well anyway. \\"Walk Away\\" discusses a lover who just gives up when things get too difficult. Toward the end, Pink decides that she's fed up with him, and now she's the one to walk away. (\\"You had my heart, you had my soul/You had it all-didn't you/Cause I'm sick of trying, I'm going home\\"). Overall, a great song although not the best she has to offer. <br /> <br />Going back to the rock sound once more, \\"Unwind\\" is what \\"Tonight's The Night\\" was attempting to be, except this time it works better. Here, Pink sings about her need to unwind after hiding her pain and troubles. A decent song, but still ends up being a step down from the one before. \\"Feel Good Time\\" is most recognized from its spot in Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle. I did not really like this song at first, but it quickly grew on me. Of the three songs with similar messages (\\"Unwind\\", \\"Tonight's the Night\\", and this one) this is easily the best. Although it serves mostly as only a catchy single, it shows of Pink's vocals quite well. The final album highlight comes in the form of \\"Love Song\\", one of Pink's few ballads. The lyrics are deep and honest, and the delivery is the most passionate of all songs here. Unlike previous slower songs, this takes a more acoustic-sounding approach, toning down the production so that all we hear is Pink and the instruments. Easily one of the best tracks here. Unfortunately, the album does not end on the high note that it should have. Pink, for reasons I still cannot comprehend, decided to include the biting \\"Hooker\\" as a hidden track. This song comes across as an excuse to swear as many times as possible, and does nothing to support Pink's talent. Although not as bad as I originally thought, it is far from the quality of the rest of the alubm. Artists have got to remember that if they are going to include a bonus track, they should at least make it a good one so we can understand why they decided to include it.  <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 4/5 <br /> <br />Pink is one of the most consistent artists in terms of album quality. All of her albums take different approaches, yet still capture Pink's unique personality. It also doesn't hurt that she has genuine writing talent and a powerful, slightly raspy voice. Easily one of the most underrated talents to come out of the vast group of singers in the 90s, Pink should definitely not be overlooked. Most believe she is fake and trying to fit in to whatever is trendy, however if you watch how she acts in interviews and the like, it is evident that none of her personality is fake. She's about as genuine an artist as you can get. The image she had on her first album, which most people seem to agree is the style she needs to go back to, was not her. It was the way her label chose to market her, and she had to go along with it to maintain her deal. Give her a chance, you won't be disappointed.  <br />
B00005V9IL|2.0|I agree totally with most of the great reviews below. However, after buying this DVD locally and now on Amazon.com, I keep getting a defective DVD. It is defective in the fact that it IS NOT widescreen, and it DOES NOT have the extended and regular version of the movie on it. For those looking for these, be aware of this issue. I have no idea how many of these DVD's are like this, but I'm 2 for 2 so far. Mine is going back!    Note - this applies to the 1 Disc version of the DVD. Since the 2 disc version is hard to get and high price, I cannot say if that one is good or not in regards to the above issue.
078401213X|2.0|When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.    Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".
B00008BRBG|5.0|When The Police released their first punk single \\"Fallout\\" in the late 70's and at the height of the punk explosion, everybody thought they were just another wannabe punk group who would have a few hits but no more.  Their early singles were different, however, from other punk records of that time.  Guitarist Andy Summers was more virtousic than most punk guitarists, often exploding into near heavy metal shredding on some of the Police's harder rockers.  Steve Copeland could keep up amazing tempos on his drum kit and lead singer Sting simply had to good of a voice to be a punk vocalist.  The truth is the Police weren't really punk at all but had helped usher in New Wave which could both be more arty than normal punk as well as have more accessible pop elements to it. <br /> <br />Their first album \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" was primarily an AOR (Album Oriented) album which was unheard of in the singles dominated world of punk.  AOR albums were albums that were artistic statements as a whole and often the filler tracks were just as good and important as the singles.  Some of the tracks were post-punk (arty form of punk) such as the opening rocker \\"Next To You\\" and the ska inflected closing track.  The most famous tracks, \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", however, were popish new wave tracks with memorable hooks and lyrical content that was a darker reflection on the old school themes of early rock-n-roll.  \\"Roxanne\\" for example has become a classic tale of a plea to a prostitute to settle with a permanent lover and stop her criminal ways.  \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" is a comical, almost parodic take on a break up song.  Interesting territory is covered in tracks like \\"Be My Girl Sally\\", a raunchy, quasi rap number and the group kept the spirit of punk alive in the album's harder rockers. <br /> <br />The lyrics may not have been as sophisticated as later Police releases but this was a very good start.  This was their most Pop/Rock oriented album and they would later explore areas of ska, jazz, and atmosphere and so on.  And very important release for the New Wave movement and a great introduction to the group.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Having been born in 1979, \\"Capote\\" didn't strike much of a cord with me that way it might for Gen X-ers (or even older).  Hoffman was incredible through out the whole movie (even at the end I couldn't believe it was really him) and was the obvious choice for Best Actor.   <br /> <br />This movie will make you want to run out and buy \\"In Cold Blood,\\"  Capote's Non-Fictional book which the movie is centered around.  It was also the last book Capote even finished.   <br /> <br />Well written and masterfully portrayed, this movie literally takes you into the heart of Capote's life between 1959-1965 as he befriends two killers for are found guilty of murdering a farming family in Kansas.   <br /> <br />This may not be the movie for everyone to own, but it is worth watching.
B00008BRDX|5.0|After The Police released their debut album \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" they released the single \\"Landlord\\".  Quite possibly the hardest they ever rocked the single only appeared on the Police box set.  It would had been nice if they had tacked it on to their second album \\"Reggatta de Blanc\\" but it would had seem completely out of place.  Thats because the group had, in some ways, moved away from the high energy post-punk of their debut and instead concentrated on making atmospheric and more moody reggae pop/rock. <br /> <br />The opener \\"Message In A Bottle\\" for example is not only more mature lyrically but also has a more smoother, studio touch to it musically.  A moody ska and jazz rocker about isolation from love and society, it rightfully became one of their biggest hits of all time. The group could still rock hard on tracks such as \\"It's Alright\\" and the album closer, but other tracks such as the dreamy space pop of \\"Walking On The Moon\\" led a new way for what New Wave could achieve.  The title track refines this idea even more so.  It's an instrumental track that features advanced studio florishes and bizarre chants from the group members that even won a Grammy for best instrumental.  Other notable tracks include the Stewart Copeland original \\"On Any Other Day\\" which sounds like a Cheeche And Chong left over.  Highlights also include the paranoid swings of \\"Contact\\" and \\"Everbody Stares\\" which are the icing on the cake to an already excellent album. <br /> <br />Overall, somewhat of a difference from the rockers of their first album but in a way this is a more challenging and rewarding listen.  At the very least this is only a prelude to the Police's next masterpiece album.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|If this isn't a B-movie, then it is right on the verge.  At best the special effects are okay (other times they look like something straight out of a Troma movie).  If you are looking for a movie with excessive nudity and bloody violence then \\"Hostel\\" is for you.  This movie will leave you feeling distrubed as some of the scenes are extremely intense.  More freaky then scary this movie is not for the faint of heart.  Jay Hernandez is excellent as he and his buddies go in search of the Sex Mecca of Europe (the rest of the no-name actors do a pretty good job - the girls are super good-looking).
B00004VXF2|3.0|Man, this gets me hot, and everyone I've tried to score with...<br /><br />64:04 of feedback and distortion....<br /><br />I'm in the mood for love....<br /><br />But seriously...<br /><br />It's hard to tell whether Lou meant this seriously or as a joke.  Lou's explanations over the years for releasing this have been erratic and ambiguous at best.  He owed his then record label, RCA, 2 albums, and so he recorded four sides of unparalleled distortion and feedback running just over an hour.  So either it was a great, brilliant, misunderstood artistic testament, or it was a joke to his record label and his fans.  Say what you will about it, Metal Machine Music is unique, and  there's never been an album quite like this one.  I got this CD for a penny on amazon (I figured someone listened to it, hated it, and put it up for sale very quickly, so I bought it very quickly for a penny).  As for me, I like the album.  I find its noises fascinating.  I also love atonal, disssonant free jazz, which this album reminds me of a bit.  At 64 minutes and 4 seconds, it's best to listen to it in its four \\"movements\\".  It's an interesting, fascinating artifact.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Tim Burton really is a great filmaker. I say that this his best film ever! Just like the last one, get this movie on this special two disc edition. If you still want to see a good Batman movie, see the all new BATMAN BEGINS and stop there. Batman 3 and 4 are two of the worst movies ever made.

Also, do not forget the sequel BATMAN: RETURNS and stop there (sorry, I for got to mention you should get the classic BATMAN BEGINS). Batman 3 and 4 suck.

0790731002|1.0|What was Tim Burton thinking when he allowed this franchise to be directed by Joel Schumacher. If he had known that he was going to make a mess like this, he would never have allowed it. Bottom line; stick with the first two and Batman Begins. See you later.

B000B5XOYI|3.0|Take out four and three, and we will have the true Batman collection. Enough said.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|This movie is fairly funny and very predictable.  Numerous stereotypes and decent acting.  Plot below average but it's a remake so shame on them for taking a bad plot and remaking it!  The truly funny lines made it 3 stars instead of 2 stars.
B00005JOYA|4.0|I have to say I was very impressed with how well this movie was executed at the start.  There are times when the visuals are so amazing that I actually got very excited and wished more movies could be like Silent Hill.  It generally has a decent pace working for it until about the last third.  Then it seems to become a tangle of plot explanation, dragging it slowly down and un-doing all that came before it.  The ending of the game version was far better I thought, but I suppose because this is a movie aimed at fitting the criteria of a film, the director, screenwriter and producers would have been broke if they had attempted to re-create the game entirely.  Honestly though, they hit all the deeply disturbing spots from anything and everything Silent Hill.  I was glad to see that this wasn't another sell-out to make it a PG-13 movie and simply reap the finances.  It is disturbing, very gory and should please any horror fan.  I wouldn't reccomend taking the little ones to this one.  There are some very dark, nightmarish sequences that would seriously scar them for a long time.   <br />      For gamers who love this game, you'll like it I think.  Like I said, the ending is the only let down and it seemed like getting there was a bit painful.  The Pyraimd -Head was absolutely amazing.  Forget all of the garabge that both Resident Evil films were.  This one smokes them both.  It hits the atmosphere on the ball, it usese the music from the first three games and pulls you straight into Silent Hill, the nighmare world where two separate planes keep switching.   <br />       Overall, I'd say 3.5 stars, just because for the writer and director to have pulled off the first 2/3 with such proficiency and effectiveness made me think they didn't put in their full effort to end it more effectively.  Plenty of people at the theater voiced their negative opinions quite loudly as the credits began to roll, but I knew better.  Most Americans expect the in-your-face-horror-movies like Saw or Hostel.  Silent Hill is more subtle, yet far more disturbing and much better done than any horror movie I have seen in a long time.  It's sad that people who saw this discarded the first two-thirds of the movie simply because they hated the ending.  I am able to appreciate, forgive and forget.  Hopefully the sequel will be a little better meditated on.   <br />       If you like horror flicks, you'll be impressed by the music, gore and overall creepiness.  If you like the game, I'm sure you'll be as equally impressed.  If you don't like either, or you only have a very shallow understanding of horror, you will be disappointed and upset.  It's great on the big screen, but I don't see Silent Hill winning any awards.  If only Resident Evil could have been this good.
0596009208|5.0|This book is unquestionably a winner in this aspect. The authors, *Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates* are both experienced java trainers and it shows in every page of this masterpiece. They have attempted a meta-cognitive style to teaching a technology subject and in my opinion, it worked well, not just because they used meta-cognition, but because they applied it correctly. But beware, since this book is geared towards beginners, experienced java programmers might not find a lot to learn from here; unless you want to do a fun revision on the subject. <br /> <br />The authors commence by providing a chapter full of advice about how to read this book to get best results. From there, they walk you through Object Oriented Programming. They talk about *What Objects Are*, *What is State*, *How the same behavior in different objects behave differently based on its state* etc and provide you with a very impressive primer on OOP concepts. <br /> <br />From there, it is all java. They cover basic syntax, powerful java library features, Inheritance, Interfaces & Polymorphism, Constructors, Math, Exceptions, Swing, Serialization, Threads, Networking and IO at a balanced level so that a beginner doesnt get overwhelmed, and at the same time they do justice to the concept as well. They skim through some of the advanced J2EE related concepts like Servlets, JSP, EJB and Jini which is understandable.  <br /> <br />The author's portray the 80-20 rule very well by sometimes saying that, \\"This technique is what you will use most of the times\\" and \\"dont worry about the hard part because you might not even use it\\", which is really encouraging for beginners.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is *Java made easy* and written in such a fashion that anyone who is willing can learn java. I highly recommend it.
1592402038|2.0|It looks like such a winner of an idea - the \\"zero-tolerance approach to punctuation!\\" But as it turns out, it's not very witty or funny (no good satirical punctuation freak English teacher voice), and most of all, not very focussed.  <br /> <br />It turns out to be mostly a guide to punctuation - of very simple aspects. It's not specific enough or detailed enough, however, to be sold as a guide for writing or writers, or as a reference. It's more anecdotal than comprehensive. And the kind of person to be attracted to a book like this most likely doesn't need a guide this basic. <br /> <br />Another point it markets itself on is being a historical review of punctuation. Well, it's not really historical enough for that either - a few notes here and there (\\"This guy invented the colon\\" etc.), but certainly not a survey of the history of English punctuation.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, much of what she says and argues is just plain wrong for an American audience. The book is full of things that made me go check up, because I was sure I was right (examples: final periods outside of quotation marks if the sentence in the quotes doesn't include them; or the rule that \\"however\\" can never follow a comma, but rather requires a semicolon). Turns out, these are Britishisms that really should have been edited or at least addressed for an American audience. They ended up making me have to run around verifying things in frustration. <br /> <br />Overall - great idea, poor execution...not fun to read, not that interesting, and not a helpful reference.
B000002AS3|5.0|It's hard pressed for me to think of another album that effortlessly captures the emotional rollercoaster of youth better than Oasis's debut album. Here lurks evidence of the highs of youth, that feeling of energy,optimism, experimentation and invincibility that is ever-present within a young adult, embodied perfectly in songs like \\"Live Forever\\", \\"Columbia\\", Cigarettes & Alcohol\\", \\"Rock and Roll Star\\". Also present are songs of a contradictory nature, showing a youngster's frustration and uncertainty as to the way their lives are going to progress, such as \\"Slide Away\\", \\"Digsy's Diner\\", and \\"Married with Children\\".  <br /> <br />No matter your age, there is something about the raw energy of this album that makes you forget your daily strifes, age and past conquests; taking you to a place where hope springs eternal. New listeners to Oasis, this is the place to start. Listen to a more honest Oasis, who are uncertain about their future and happy to be young. See them in a new light, before they became \\"bigger than life\\" (at least in their own minds) with the release of \\"WTSMG\\" and subsequent, less powerful efforts. In my opinion, this is how Oasis was meant to play, hard and fast, just how they lived (a style they didn't successfully recapture again until 2005 with \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\").
B000094Q3I|5.0|This was Terry Callier's first album, recorded in 1964. Singing and playing guitar, and accompanied by upright bass only, the recording is a straightforward, laid-back rendering of mostly traditional folk material. His voice is clear and melodic and expressive, and he infuses much of what he sings with a touch of the blues . Highlights include superb versions of COTTON EYED JOE, 900 MILES, and JOHNNY BE GAY IF YOU CAN BE. The most impressive track is the lengthy blues ballad I'M A DRIFTER, which tells a personal story of woe in a slow, dirge-like fashion that is almost hypnotic. But every track on the CD is interesting and pleasurable to listen to. Definitely worth checking out.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I liked this movie. I love Ralph Fiennes as an actor. He's utterly brilliant, so restrained and intense - enough to give a girl shivers every time. But.<br /><br />But this movie is so heavy-handed it was painful. It bleeds for Africa, from the European man's point of view. It's brilliant of course, but it sees things so definitely through the lens of middle class guilt that it's hard to cope with if you've ever actually been poor.<br /><br />It's about pharmecutical companies doing illegal things with a TB cure in a third world country, the death of a woman and the lengths her husband goes to when he finds out he hardly knew this woman he loved and married.<br /><br />And it's so overwrought, so fast-paced when it should have been slow and meditative.<br /><br />I'm a little disapointed in it. But I did like it.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|`AeonFlux', directed by Karyn Kusama and produced by James Cameron colleague, Gale Anne Hurd, starring Academy Award (Best Actress, `Monster') winner Charlize Theron is, in spite of all earnest efforts, a mediocre Sci-Fi action flick. That is not to say this DVD is not an interesting purchase, as it is one of the first I have seen where the extras add as much or more value to the purchase as the movie itself.<br /><br />From long years of reading `Heavy Metal' and similar `adult' comic strip fare, I have developed the opinion that both the art and the plots in these works tend to be very derivative of more original works, especially very popular movies. And, since `Aeonflux' is based on an MTV animated feature, I find that it too is very derivative of more original works, in spite of the principle's protestations of originality.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that the primary inspiration for the general situation is the film, `Logan's Run' and the heroine has strong similarities to the video game adventurer, Laura Croft. And, I am sorry to say, that Ms. Theron simply does not carry off the distaff daring do as well as the excellent Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />My primary problems with the movie are that first, it does not fully set the premise up well enough early in the movie, unlike the excellent `Blade Runner' or `Minority Report' for example. Second, I develop no interest whatsoever in the fates of any of the characters. They stay flat against the screen, as do most comic book characters. There is none of the angst we feel for the cinema incarnations of Spiderman or Daredevil or Superman. Third, the world in the background is almost totally sterile. There are none of the rich textures of `Blade Runner' or even `Alien' or `Predator'. The extras do a lot to explain this, but do not relieve the tedium of the movie.<br /><br />I was quite surprised to discover that the movie was shot entirely in Berlin, which turned out to be architecturally even better than their first choice, Brasilia, in spite of the fact that Brasilia is almost identical to the fictional city in the film, as it is set deep in the Amazon jungle. The advantages of Berlin were that there was a thriving movie industry in the city that could supply all sorts of support crew, not to mention a wealth of great costumers and set decorators. And, the scenes were not all-modern post-World War II concrete. Some scenes were done in the gardens of Frederick the Great's summer palace and some other scenes were done in a pre-World War II build aircraft testing tunnel.<br /><br />I was also delighted to see that many of the costumes were inspired by the 1970's Bernardo Bertolluci film, `The Conformist', which I was also pleased to see was to be released on DVD soon, as it has always been one of my favorite Italian films. There were several video documentaries on the sets, costumes, special effects, and stunts, plus my favorite extra, two voice-overs, one by the star and lead producer and one by the screenwriters.<br /><br />One of my least favorite aspects of the movie is the fact that the great Frances McDormand appears in a role that totally wastes her talent. That comes on top of the fact that the rationale for the role is totally inexplicable, and connected to virtually nothing else in the film.<br /><br />Like so many comic book movies, including the Lara Croft epics, poor plot and characterization may be forgiven if the visceral impact is good. I found nothing here that got me the least excited about what was happening on the screen. All I could think about were the errors in science where, for example, they give the impression that characters somehow become immortal because they are cloned from one generation to the next. I'm afraid it simply doesn't work that way. A clone shares no more in the personality, memories, or `spirit' of the original than a naturally born baby shares any intellectual material from natural parents.<br /><br />In the end, this DVD is literallymore valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience.DVD is literally more valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience. <br />
B000E97Y6K|2.0|Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.  <br />The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him. Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache.  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It was very sad when I read in a P.S.M. (PlayStation Magazine) <br />that it comes out in August I went to the store... The Cashier laughed at me! and said \\" It comes out next year!\\" So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then Finally... April 25th! I got it and put it in my bose and watched it. Astounding Graphics that will leave you in Awe. And also pro voice overs and some of the best Actors.(Steve Burton, Rachael Leigh Cook, etc.) And does follow the game, and you even get a fantastic veiw of Jenova, unlike in the game when you see about a minute total in the whole game. I was amzed after the movie was over. I couldn't belive what I just saw. The best movie ever!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|So, there's a lot to say about this movie. One thing being: it is simply incredible.  Now, buy this movie because it may be the best thing you've ever seen.  Listen to what everyone here has to say on amazon.com- but this is the only thing I want to tell you: this movie is like a giant jigsaw puzzle.  It's gorgeous to watch and hugely entertaining, and the whole time you never wanna miss a beat.  However, it's very confusing at first.  But slowly and slowly the pieces come together and by the time the movie ends you sit there thinking \\"Wow...\\"  It's very fast-paced, very riveting, and just an amazing punch of WOW to the face.  Buy this movie.  But don't let it confuse you- it will wrap up in a beautiful way.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|This is truly a great CD.  Mark Knopfler is a guitar genius and his work with Dire Straits defined a generation on MTV.  The songs are timeless- both the oldtimers who grew up listening to this music as well as the youngsters experiencing 'Sultans of Swing' in guitar class will love it.
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is awesome.  But it's neither traditional Linkin Park nor really a traditional remix CD.  And I wouldn't call it \\"rock\\" but more something like a blend of rap, techno and Linkin Park-style rock.<br /><br />For one, there isn't a huge amount that is different about Linkin Park's vocals (that is, the lead singer's) from the original songs and this CD.  What does change is the background music (changes a lot, moving more towards techno, drum-and-bass and hip-hop) and the addition of several guest artists (great rappers like Chali and others).  So if you're looking for a CD that duplicates what you've heard Linkin Park do elsewhere, this isn't it.  It's closer to Collision Course w/ Jay-Z than to Hybrid Theory.  But, as a hip-hop fan, I like this CD more than anything else LP has done.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the sample tracks and see if you agree (especially if you aren't a hip-hop fan).  If you like rap, listen to Frgt/10 first (track 5)- though the sample they give you does so little credit to the track, especially since they don't let you hear Chali's amazing verse.  If you like Techno or Trance, try My{Dsmbr first (track 15).  If you want to try more sort-of-classic LP stuff, try Rnw@y (track 14).<br /><br />I was surprised to read the other reviews which don't seem to agree with me.  But that doesn't change my opinion that this is one of the best CDs, if not the best, that Linkin Park has put out.  And I should note- if you like this, check out Fort Minor's stuff.  I don't like it as much as this, but when Mike broke away from LP for the solo project, I think that it hurt the chances LP would do many more projects like Reanimation.  Collision Corse is worth checking out too, but it's not as solid as Reanimation is.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|When I first watched this movie, I was sorely disappointed. There seems to be hardly any context for the events taking place in the AC story. For instance, Cloud, the protagonist, is pursued by three young \\"larval\\" versions of Sephiroth. However, there is NO explanation for where they came from. (What's to stop them form reappearing for another sequel?). After watching the movie a couple of times it became clear, their origin: they were clones of Sephiroth created by the Square-Enix marketing department. Brilliant! That aside, the look of the movie and pacing of the fight scenes is amazing, rivaling the best work of Hollywood-produced CG films. Also bad is the English language VO. In fact, the people who put the DVD together understood this so well, that they left the default language track as Japanese. Leave it on Japanese, trust me. After you hear Tifa say \\"Dilly-dally, shilly-shally\\", not once, but twice, you'll wish you did! The composer, Nobuo Uematsu, also drops the ball. Too many of the scenes in this movie contain generic, heavy-metal inspired compositions--if you're willing to even call them that. But not all bad. The movie also features male characters so androgynous, you'll be left asking \\"Why did they give all these women men's voices?\\"<br /><br />Watch the creator interviews on Disc 2 first, and you just might enjoy AC. Therein, the director and others explain what Cloud and the other characters are going through emotionally, etc. They shed some light on the events between the end of FF7 and the movie sequel, providing context--something they should have done with the script, I think. I'm not trying to rain on anyone's \\"This is a 5-star movie\\" parade, I just want to prepare others with high expectations for what they're in store for.
B00005J6UP|1.0|Don't believe the PG rating.  This movie came out before PG-13 was around and should be changed to PG-13.  This is not a Family Movie.  In the first 10 minutes there are several curse words, several drug references and sexual comments.  This is not a family movie.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I simply love this movie. I also like the BBC version with Colin Firth and J.Ehle but honestly this version is my favourite. Although the adaptation of the novel is not really faithful to the novel(unlike the BBC one) I think that Joe Wright, the director, still did an amazing job by making a two-hour movie with all the major passages of the book. The first thing I noticed about this movie is the unique, wonderful atmosphere that the director and his assistants managed to create, with a beautiful-yet-down-to-earth setting, the movement of the camera (I was impressed by the way the camera moves, turns or follows the characters through the ballroom at Netherfield) the long shots mingling with close-views of the actors. Even the sounds are perfect -you can hear birds singing in the morning, rain pattering down- and just for that, the movie is a pure joy for me because it feels somewhat real. The atmosphere in the Bennett's house is so familiar and pleasant that you feel almost immediately a connection with this family. I just love every moment of the movie, I love the dialogues even if they don't correspond to the ones in the book (the Darcy's proposal is a moment of anthology! as this `lovers' spat'- kind of argument between Darcy and Lizzie gets more and more intense) The pace of the movie is fast, the good thing is that you don't have time to get bored, there is always something going on in every scene, the bad thing is that there are not enough scenes with these wonderful characters and I don't want the movie to end!!!   Right from the start, you feel so close to the characters that you don't want to leave them. They seem so alive (Lizzie Bennet has never been so flamboyant!)I couldn't help feeling as emotionally charged as them. All the actors are great, not only the leading ones but also the minor ones: the younger Bennet sisters -Jena Malone is so funny-and R. Pike is perfect as serene, beautiful Jane -.It is a pity though that we don't see some characters likeCaroline Bingley or Charles Bingley or Wickham very often.      And of course Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are really perfect for me as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. Keira Knightley gives energy and a mix of wit and mischievousness to the heroine. MacFadyen's Darcy is different from the book, I grant you, but this shy, love-struck and vulnerable is simply irresistible!! OK, maybe you don't have Colin Firth's wet shirt but you can still see MacFadyen drenched to the skin at one point while he is proposing to Lizzie and he is downright sexy too. Plus, his deep voice gives me the shivers! Knightley and Macfadyen have powerful chemistry, and when Darcy proposes to Lizzie in the rain, you can feel the heat, the passion growing more intense between them. The long stares between them, the way they passionately spar and their near-kisses are so sexually charged that they make me almost swoon with delight. One particular moment that I like too is when he helps her getting into a carriage and by doing so, he touches her hand. This is such a magical moment because it is not something you would do at the time especially when you've just met. And the climactic scene , oh boy, this scene in which Macfadyen appears in the misty dawn, desperately seeking Lizzie is so beautiful and rich with sensuality that it always makes me sigh just as it does Lizzie. At that point, I always feel the urge to tell Lizzie that she would be crazy to say 'no' to him now! I think that for once there is the perfect combination between Lizzie and Darcy: (They are both young), he is shy, reserved and socially ill-at-ease while she is free-spirited, flamboyant, lively, always speaking a mind of her own, and so they seem to complete each other very well.   The DVD, the English version,is worth the money because the special features are very interesting and ...there is also THE ALTERNATE US ENDING with the balcony kiss. About this US ending, I still think that they could have made a better scene although it is downright sweet. I can feel that Wright wasn't a 100% behind this last conversation between Lizzie and Darcy. Not that I am really complaining, it is still very nice to see them together one last time. One regret, where are the cut-off scenes? I am probably asking too much since the DVD features are already excellent but I 'd love to see the deleted scenes. And I am sure that Joe Wright must have deleted some scenes... Let's hope that there will be one day a special edition with two DVDs. This 'Pride&Prejudice'movie has become one of my favourites (I think that I must have seen it 4 times in the movie theater before buying the DVD.)I am definitely a big fan because not only I have the book and the music but I 've also been to England just to visit Chatsworth/Pemberley,the Peak District and Burgley House/Lady Catherine De Bourgh's house!!!
B000EYK4KI|5.0|I am upset, like most of the rest of the reviewers of this version of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, because the PG-13 rated single disc edition came out last December, and, of course, I bought it because it was a good film. I wish that Fox would give an advanced that they were going to be releasing a 2-disc unrated version of the film, but they did not. I will buy the 2-disc edition and still have the single disc one. I don't know what will be different for the film now that it is dubbed UNRATED, but I think i have an idea. There were a lot of rumors going around about this film that it had numerous sex scenes in it, and I hope they do not make the film trashy and add them, but it would be a better version if they included some of the unrated scenes that just show Pitt and Jolie talking to each other to show that they have amazing chemisty together and they deserve to be together. The film is amazing, and it deserves the 5 star rating. Reviewers should not give a film one or two stars because they did not see the release of the film coming when the original release came out. Review the film not the version of the DVD. It is the studios fault for this, not the film's fault.
B00005JOYA|4.0|If you're going to this movie because you want to see a plot-thick, dialogue heavy masterpiece, you aren't going to get it.  I'd rate it a 2 in that genre.<br /><br />If, however, you're going to see a creepy, bloody, atmospheric horror movie, this is fantastic.  I give it a 5 in that category.  And, having never played the game or seen it played, you don't have to be a fan of the PS2 series to think this.<br /><br />This movie is very light on dialogue, but the special effects are beyond fantastic.  They very accurately create horrific, nightmare creatures that stalk the main characters.  The raining ash and gray smog/fog throughout are great.<br /><br />The acting in this is good at times, mediocre at others.  When it is good, you won't think \\"wow, that was good acting\\" because you'll be too busy thinking \\"Ahhhh!  What is that thing?!?\\"  When it's mediocre, well, it's a movie based on a game so it happens in this genre.  It does have some memorable actors, including Boromir's actor from Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Finally, I should note that this movie gets pretty gross at the end.  Artisticly, maybe it needed to, because the plot creates a situation where the most-reasonable resolution is pretty twisted and brutal.  But for the movie-goer, the result is you're thinking \\"what a creepy movie\\" for 4/5th of the movie, then suddenly, you're thinking \\"Wow... did they really just do that?  They did... oh, and look, they just did it again, and again.\\"<br /><br />In summary, it's a good movie for what it is (a creepy-mood-creater) but is not really scary.  Just the same, I think it's a movie worth owning whenever it comes out and I hope they make a sequel.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and found it to be completely moving. An amazing movie in all respects. I never read the book just because I'm not into most of the \\"classics\\". However, now that I've seen the movie, I absolutely want to read the book, just to see what couldn't be included in such a perfectly pure romance.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|America (and most of the world) has a romance with the ones who lose, the underdogs, the fighters of lost causes with a true merit of their own. Firefly was a very short-lived TV series that was based on one basic premise: the world in the future, will be just about the same, but with fancier technology. The show was well-written, with inteligent (but somewhat naive) plots and very decent visual effects. Firefly wasn't a big-names show, as for most of the actors, this was their really big break... and they got cancelled. So again, the underdog motif is lingering around.<br /><br />Let pass some years. Firefly has a huge fan-base that rivals that one of Star Trek and Star Wars. In some ways, even more dedicated, because just a season isn't much to brag about and they had to build their own fandom around the Firefly universe and mythos. So, the dedication of those fans and Josh Whedon (a true underdog by all means) gave birth to Serenity, about the only movie based on a cancelled TV series, not made with footage pieces of the series. Raw, new material for the browncoats around the world.<br /><br />The spawn of such devotion is a true quality product. Good acting, an intelligent script (in some poetic ways, above average for a Sci-Fi movie) and better visual effects than the actual TV show (created by Zoic, of Battlestar Galactica and Children Of Dune fame). Unlike many Star Trek movies (and I'm myself an avid ST fan), Serenity doesn't feel like a feature-lenght episode at all. About the only flaw that can be found in this product is that it needs an in-depth knowledge of the TV series. This movie isn't for the casual viewer without a Firefly Boxed Set at hand.<br /><br />Regarding the DVD itself, the extras are less than expected, with the director's commentary about the only pleasant surprise in this DVD. I wonder if a 2 discs set would have been any better than this.<br /><br />It's sad that this movie did not-so-well at the box-office, but that's because the lack of support from the studio and the awful timing for the release. Such as Firefly, it deserved better.<br /><br />My advise would be: buy it. You'll get an excellent story, packed with action and stunning visuals. You won't regret it. Nuture the browncoat inside you... because, in the end... we're all underdogs.he lack of support from the studio and the awful timing for the release. Such as Firefly, it deserved better. <br /> <br />My advise would be: buy it. You'll get an excellent story, packed with action and stunning visuals. You won't regret it.

B000002MX7|4.0|I love Chaka Khan - her album I Feel For You is one of my alltime faves.  I remember listening to it in school and thinking how amazing her booming powerful voice was & wishing I was old enough to go clubbing...  This is a good compilation of her best of, although many of my faves are missing.  I love I Feel For You & Ain't Nobody - both classics.  I wish This Is My Night, Destiny, Love of a Lifetime, Can't Stop the Streets (from Krush Groove) & Own the Night (Miami Vice) were on it...  Maybe someday!  anyway, this is a great collection to get to know Chaka's material from the 70s through early 90s.  5 stars for Chaka, 4 stars for the missing tracks
0452283760|5.0|I just re-read Fountainhead after 30 years. And enjoyed every moment of it.<br /><br />Ayn Rand's protagonist is Howard Roark, a maverick architect, who lives by his own rules and is passionate about what he creates. Most of the World are the antagonists, living to please others rather than standing up for their principles. The World tries its best to destroy Roark, but he survives and gives birth to Modernism in Architecture.<br /><br />It is, indeed, a timeless story. Despite deep philosophical anchors and long dialogues, this novel is more un-putdown-able than any Ludlum. The pace is mind-boggling. The flow is incredible. Above all, the characterization is so powerful that some of the plot weaknesses (like the tame end) are barely noticeable.<br /><br />Fountainhead is a modern classic that will survive. It is indeed a MUST READ.
0767834739|3.0|After getting dogged by many Resident Evil fans about the 1st film not being truly true to the game, Anderson decides to make the sequel more closer to the game's sequels. Didn't do a very good job of doing that.  <br /> <br />The fools from Umbrella Corp. unleash the dead in the hive, and now the T-Virus is spreading through out Raccoon City. Citizens cannot leave the city, and now are trapped with the walking dead.  <br /> <br />Jovovich returns as the dull and boring Alice, who now has super powers like a fake ass Albert Wesker wannabee from Code Veronica X. Along trapped in Raccoon City is Jill Valentine (Guillory), a reporter (Holt), 2 Umbrella soldiers (Fehr, Ward), a citizen (Epps) and a few others I don't care mentioning. <br /> <br />On their tales is a killing maching called Nemesis (Taylor). Once again, no gore, dull characters, and boring Alice taking away the spoylight from real characters from the game. Nemesis is a weak sissy in this film, and he looks cheesey. Nicholai in the game is a old and evil man. In this movie, Nicholai is a young man on the good guys' side.  <br /> <br />The slow-motion scenes of the zombies' walking looks stupid, and once again, these zombies are pitiful. This film does have a few good scenes, good fight scenes, and the ending isn't bad. However, it's just like the first film...disappointing.  <br /> <br />Resident Evil really needs to be redone soon. And when I mean redone, I mean no Anderson, no Screen Gems, and no Alice. At least these Resident Evil films are good for one thing...they entertain.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I gave this film 4 stars because it confused me a little too much for comfort. I had to watch it a second time to understand the bit about how the people back in \\"our time\\" were trying to fix the wormhole. Aside from that, I hated when they made Francois say that he was a spy and then kill him for it. STUPID 14th CENTURY FRENCH PEOPLE! oh well. can't be helped. Anyway, I liked it because, of course, Gerry's in it. The genre does seem to be getting a little worn-out though, especially seeing as how almost all he does is period pieces. Good effort on everyone's part, but not something I'd recommend to someone looking for a time-travel film that makes decent sense.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I enjoyed the special effects, but I didn't think the casting was appropriate.  Jack Black had moments where he really fit the part, but at other times he simply suffered from type-casting in his frat-house movies; and that really comes across in this film.  The self-absorbed lead actor and the leading lady faired much better.  Story sticks to the original from the 1930s, and that is probably a good thing.  Initial scenes on Skull Island were awesome and frightening.  The script moves from a tongue-in-cheek version of the original to some lame efforts as a serious epic production.  The movie was probably about 30-45 minutes too long.
0440180295|5.0|This book is not only a staple of american literature, but also a modern classic. SH5 is a simply breath-taking anti-war novel. what made this book such an enjoyment for me was the fact that vonnegut used equal elements of humor, visualizations, compassion, all without ever breaking off from his main point. vonnegut's style is like nothing i have ever read, or will probably ever read. it does take a little getting used to, but it is well worth it. this is an excellent novel, it may even change the way you view your life. so it goes.
0440180295|5.0|The story itself was great.  But what made it great was Vonnegut's writing style.  He takes a man's life, spread out the events of his life like a deck of cards, then shuffles the cards, and spreads them out again.  At first it is confusing, but once you catch on, it is a magnificent journey.   <br /> <br />But beware.  This isn't a straight, WWII book.  You have to have a little taste for science fiction.  And a sense of humor.
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead. <br /> <br />Milla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive. <br /> <br />The characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt \\"R\\" for language and the little nudity.  <br /> <br />This film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game. <br /> <br />Another lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?  <br /> <br />Resident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film likethat.
B0000D96NW|5.0|More than a review(cause u dont need a review of this one, just hear it)I will like to say to the young ones that this was what the old school metal used to lack of, the FAT guitars, the round body, and this album has it, thats what makes it so incredible for me, sth I was wanting a long time ago, fat sound with speed and double bass thrashy riffs,  and why does this album sounds so old school missed thrash metal? easy!, the prescence of Rob Flynn's VIO-LENCE guitar mate, Phil Demmel, I love Vio-lence and having both in the same band reminds me of what it was back in the day... unbeatable!
B00005V9HA|2.0|I'm going to assume you've read the plotline above, so I'll skip it and provide my two cents.  I'm a huge sci-fi and horror movie fan and this is a movie that I've always wanted to see, but for some reason, I never go around to it.  I finally rented it 6 months ago (8/2005) and was very disappointed.  This is a movie that has not aged well at all.  I'm sure the special effects were state of the art at some time, but they are clearly a joke now.  If you've been a fan of the movie for a long time, I apologize.  I'm sure it has lots of nostalgia value for people who saw it when it first came out.  I feel that way about a lot of movies from the 1980s, like Prince of Darkness, The Thing, etc, so I'm not knocking the film from this perspective.  If you haven't seen this movie and you're thinking about breaking down and buying it to fill out your collection hoping that it will be good because all of the other reviews here are 5 stars, please don't.  It's not worth it.  This movie is only for long standing fans who saw it first \\"back in the day\\" and want to relive a good memory.
B00005B36H|5.0|There are literally no words that would do justice to the music of Tool. If you are one of those people who think metal is nothing but screaming vocals and loud guitars, then Tool will prove you wrong. Not that they are the stereotypical metal band anyway. There really isn't one genre to describe Tool. They far transcend any label that a genre could put on them. They are one of a kind, and the only way to describe Tool is through their music. So buy this CD, but all their CDs if you have the money, and it will change how you look at every other band you have ever known.
0060730552|4.0|This book is worth reading & Joe Simpson is without a doubt a great writer. I do recommend this book if you like survival / adventure stories.<br /><br />  I do have a  couple of minor criticisms. First off I think you would get a little more out of this book if you are a mountain climber yourself. It seems every page has something about an a couloir, an abseil or a belay. So while you can try to picture it in your mind if you aren't sure exactly what Joe is describing it makes it a little harder to imagine what was going on. I have also read other mountain climbing books by Jon Krakauer & Chris Bonnington but I still think someone unfamiliar with the jargon may not enjoy it as much.<br /><br />  I also think that he does get into minute descriptions where it seems you are reading the same thing page after page at times. Again I want to say my criticisms are minor ones & I do recommend it as a worthwhile read.
B00008G9JO|5.0|I really love this CD. Every song jumps out and grabs you. From the intricate Mouse Police song to Weathercock, this is a feast for the ears. Moths is an unbelievably beautiful song. Awesome- shame on you so called Tull fans that ignored this great music for so long. Underrated and sadly Unappreciated.
0060786523|4.0|I had heard this book, on public radio (its abridged audio version) and just listening to it a bit intrigued me, so I bought the book and read it. It is no doubt very interesting (in particular to somebody of an IndoPak origin as myself); along with other reviewers' comments. However, a couple of points that keenly struck me as problematic:  <br /> <br />1. The author, Seth, after doing some research (see the wikipedia entry on him), is a bisexual, and this comes out in this book at different points. In the incident with Maan and Firoz in the bed, my eyes popped out after reading this. I had to re-read it again to get a firm grip on what was going on. There are a handful of incidents scattered throughout the book of homosexual tendencies, as well as premarital intimate relations. So be sensitive to this, in particular for any teenagers or other youngsters who may read this. <br /> <br />2. The overall depiction of Muslims in this volume is quite one-sided; they are either viewed as savage or lawbreaking, mean, inept (see his completely one-sided description of the Muslims on the day of the Hindu festival during the clash); suicidal, and more.  There are some good points in this regard, as his inclusion of select, pertinent verses from the Qur'an, but the overall gist passed on to the casual reader was disheartening. <br /> <br />Aside from the above 2 points, the book was an excellent read, though it drags on at a few points, in particular when it came to the Indian politics.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Some of my earliest childhood memories include watching this version of \\"Annie\\" with my older sisters and cousins. We could never get enough of it, and quite frankly I think this movie is what spawned our rather humorous attempt to act out the play ourselves in the basement.     In any case, this film has been brought back in a Special Edition DVD for whole new generations, as well as previous generations who remember it from their childhood. It seems a lot of people have given this version heat, mainly for deviating a bit from the original Broadway storyline, but I believe this is arguably the best \\"Annie\\" you could get your hands on, for a reason that another reviewe here, \\"Kelli,\\" already indicated.    The acting is passionate. Purely, genuinely, and undeniably passionate. I don't know where they found that little Aileen Quinn, but she embodies absolutely everything that this character is supposed to symbolize. She is plucky, sweet, tough as nails, and underneath it all, she's just looking for a family to call her own. She probably fits her given role better than any other child actress in any movie I've ever seen, and I mean that sincerely. She is just amazing. For that matter, every single cast member appears to have poured their entire soul into their roles, with acting that contains remarkable depth and incredible spirit.     The song and dance numbers, too, are a phenomenol addition to this film. A few original new songs are added to this version, including \\"We've Got Annie\\" and \\"Dumb Dog\\" (which I personally didn't love and found to be a bit out of place, but it was still pretty cute). There are clearly professional dancers and talented voices galore to accompany every song, making it an ideal musical experience for the whole family.    It appears that many people prefer the recent TV version of \\"Annie\\" with Alicia Morton because the plot is faithful to the Broadway musical version. That may be true, but in my opinion that remake did not stand the slightestchance against the acting of this 80's version. Albert Finney and Aileen Quinn work beautifully alongside one another, with Finney giving a perfect portrayal of a workaholic man who is constantly seeking to push Annie away but eventually recognizes that she is the daughter he always needed. Ann Reinking (Grace Farrell) plays the nurturing motherly role to a \\"T,\\" and of course, the classic and hysterical Carol Burnett helps Miss Hannigan steal every single scene she is in. The orphans are all well cast, each with their own distinct personalities and all notably expressive in front of the camera. (They really did get lucky with the kids in this movie; all of them were very genuine and a talented group of little actresses). A beautiful story indeed, brought to life impeccably on screen and a pure joy to watch. It's one of those movies that truly does just make you smile, and the approach these actors took with their roles is the main reason for that.    As for the Special Anniversary DVD Edition...it is not anything major, but it does include some good stuff. The popular teen group \\"Play\\" sings their own version of \\"Hard Knock Life\\" (which, if you know the 4 teens who make up this girl group, it is a perfect song for them), there are some \\"Sing and Act Along with Annie\\" sections, and most notably, you get a short featurette with an all-grown-up Aileen Quinn. Long-time fans of this movie will absolutely love to see her come on-screen and talk about her experiences with the film and how the newfound fame impacted her life afterward. (I personally love the flashback video segment where Carol Burnette hugs Aileen and says \\"Aileen, can I put you in my bag and take you home with me? I can't be mean to this kid!\\") Judging from this featurette, Quinn seems very personable and easygoing, and there's no doubt that playing Annie must have been a very special memory from her childhood.     The DVD is absolutely worth getting if you love this movie. It has some nice special features and, of course, the actual film will always remain a classic in itself.
B000002UAF|5.0|'A Hard Day's Night' is not only a great rock album and great soundtrack, it is rightly regarded as the best of Beatlemania itself.  There is enough of the familiar and hidden classics to make this puchase worthwhile.  Certainly the title track, \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"And I Love Her,\\" and \\"If I Fell\\" are worthy classics. (\\"If I Fell\\" is one of the best of the Beatles' love songs--maybe one of the best love songs period, for that matter.)  Rock songs and ballads are masterfully made and mixed on this, their first album to contain all original compositions.  The quality is consistent throughout.  To paraphrase British writer Roy Carr, the second half is even more worthwhile.  \\"Any Time at All\\" is great hard rock; \\"I'll Cry Instead,\\" is a fine country-rock song  (foreshadowing the next 'Beatles for Sale' album) and the closer \\"I'll Be Back Again,\\" is a classic Lennon ballad waiting to be unearthed. The second half also has a fine McCartney ballad, \\"Things We Said  Today\\". The exhuberant spirit never wanes on this CD and is extended with songs like \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better\\".  Song for song, the mix, the quality, and energy are solid on this album.  For those who only buy Beatles' collections, this C.D. will not seem redundant.
B000CNFC76|4.0|Hey, I'm a sucker for the underdog movies- Rudy, Bad News Bears, Texas Western(Glory Road) etc. This is a great story and  reveals a genuine love for the game in its presentation- which is what great sports movies do. Tiger and Phil: beware of those caddies!

B0000844I8|5.0|I bought this movie as my first coz I found it at a cheap price and I wanted a dvd to test my home theater and had none of my own.The whole idea of ancient egipt mixed with a portal seemed so cheap and stupid I?d never even bothered to watch the movie when it was released.<br />Man was I wrong,this not only is one of the best sci-fi/action movie I?ve ever seen but has one of the most powerful and exquisite sounds ! This is now my reference dvd for testing equipment.It?s never grown old on me,I could watch it a million times.For the plot,see other reviews,I don?t want to be repetitive,just my 2 cents.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I may be wrong on this, but I believe that this edition of Dumbo is  aimed at children.  I am led to believe this for the following reasons:  This DVD includes a children's game called \\"My First Circus\\" a story book \\"Dumbo's Big Discovery\\" and sing-along-songs among other things.  I give this DVD a five star rating based on the fact that this particular version would be more appealing to children.  That being said, i must say that if you are an adult you're better off buying the 60th anniversary edition of Dumbo, but if you are purchasing for a child i would highly recommend Dumbo (big top edition.)
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am not a regular listener to Don Imus but I do find myself more often than not agreeing with his musical tastes, if not always with his political views.  I had heard him mentioning this particular CD for some time in glowing terms.  Quite by chance, wonderful chance!!!!, I happened to catch Emmylou and Mark singing several songs from this CD on his show this week.  I was blown away then and have been blown away all afternoon as I have played and replayed this wonderful collection of music.  Emmylou's \\"Love and Happiness\\" is, in my opinion, worth the whole collection.  It is an extraordinary piece of songwriting.  I am nearly as much in love with Knopfler's \\"All the Roundrunning\\" and the concluding, \\"If this is goodbye.\\"  Until I read some of the other comments here on Amazon I did not know that this was a song related to the 9/11 \\" left behind\\" messages.  It had enormous personal power for me even without knowing that and I will now relisten with that new information  in mind. I have loved Emmylou for 30 years and to hear her voice blending with Knopfler's guitar on that final song is just awe-inspiring.  Superb work, just superb!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|\\"Elf\\" was everything I hoped it would be. Will Ferrell does a great job as Buddy, the elf that wants to find his real dad and home. This will surely go down as one of the classic Christmas tales. Ed Asner makes a great Santa. The story itself is touching and not at one time boring. Somethings in the film are childish, but the movie is intended for children. Just the whole fish-out-of-water story, as someone said, is what makes the film. Buddy just can't seem to fit in anywhere, but he does make a lot of friends. Recommended!
B00004RFFI|4.0|This was not a movie I particularly wanted to see but I'm glad to have seen it. It was good in terms of both story and effects. I wasn't blown away to the degree of some by the effects but they were good and they did get the point across. <br /> <br />The story is of a young researcher of tornados played by Helen Hunt. She runs a budget operation trying to study tornados. She has invented a gizmo to actually get into the heart of the beast and get incredible amounts of data. The catch is that you have to get really close to deploy it. In competition with her is a blowhard who is well financed, arrogant and who has stolen the plans for her gizmo. Into this state of affairs comes the husband, played by Bill Paxton, who wants her to sign the papers to finalize a divorce so he can re-marry. He too is a former tornado researcher. As he tries to get her to sign the papers, he gets sucked back into storm chasing and it is practically required that he get sucked back into the marriage as well. <br /> <br />It's well done, interesting, at times funny and at times exciting. Its worth the rental and the purchase. <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best series' that I have ever purchased.  Every episode could be a totally stand-alone story, but I found myself falling more and more in love with the entire cast as I coasted through episode after episode.  The production value of this series (don't even get me started on the movie, \\"Serentiy\\") is unreal; easily big-screen quality. <br /> <br />I am an early-riser, always have been.  Watching this series in the morning got me in more trouble at work than I care to elaborate on.  I just couldn't tear myself away from the screen to get to work on time.  And I am not a huge sci-fi fan.  This one really crosses all demographics.  A great buy.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotize and Mezmerize are similar in style, which is different from past albums. Whether one likes these two albums or not, might have to do with what they liked about the band's previous work. If you're like many of us that still listen to punk after many years, the message, or story is as important as the catchiness of the tune. If philosophy in music is important to you, you may like the change, and these two albums. If not, there are plenty of mindless pop-rock bands to choose from. <br />
B000E5N684|4.0|At the time, Basic Instinct was considered shocking and new. In retrospect, in a world where much harder pornography is so commonplace, it's not got much sex appeal going for it. What I do like is the OTT game of cat and mouse between Stone and Douglas.<br /><br />Catherine Tramell is a writer of sleazy novels who lives out her pulp trash after she's written it. This would be fine if she wrote about saving the children or building churches but Tramell writes about sex, murder and betrayal. She's accused of murdering her Rock-star boyfriend by icepicking his head 86-times during a massive shagathon. She feels no guilt and no sadness and Detective Nick Curran regards her with utmost suspicion even though she passed a lie-detector test.<br /><br />Determined to find the truth among Catherine Tramell's web of pork-pies, Curran falls into her world of sin and seduction. Already a bad cop well on the way to cleaning up his act, all of his nasty habits come flooding back to him. The drinking, the snorting, the smoking...all because of a blonde. I would be impervious to this.<br /><br />In fact, Jeanne Triplehorn, who plays Curran's psychiatrist, is a billion times more sexy than Sharon Stone. Especially when she wears her glasses. But that's just my thing.<br /><br />One can accuse Basic Instinct of being contrived, overly-complicated and over-plotted but they'd be missing the point. I do feel that the irony of gutter-level fiction becoming real within gutter-level fiction would have been more appropriate and perhaps louder if Basic Instinct were a book, but as a movie it makes its point despite the high level tawdriness that most audiences are going think is all the film has to offer.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven takes a Hitchcockian approach to the material as there are already a few connections to Vertigo. At one point in the film, Sharon Stone even dresses up in an outfit identical to Kim Novak (hairstyle and all). You can't help but notice the sleaze sometimes though. Like Michael Douglas walking around a nightclub in a horrible V-neck sweater or the 'infamous' leg-crossing scene with is only really notable for its unsubtlety.<br /><br />There are also some parts of the film which kind of date it badly. The production design and fashion is sooo early 90s. It's not the kind of story that oozes class but the outdated look kinda distracts. But the one amazing thing Basic Instinct has going for it is Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully haunting score. Truly one of his best in the latter part of his career.<br /><br />Add it all up and Basic Instinct is wildly inconsistent in terms of quality but the sheer OTT nature of plot is enough to keep it afloat. And all these years later, when we have mostly become impervious to titillation, people still remember all the skanky publicity and the aroma of sleaze will never quite die away. See past all that and you'll find a clever thriller underneath.though.

B0001Z2RUK|5.0|...Because they are in a league of their own. Here's what Keane and Coldplay have in common:  <br />1.They're British <br />2.They use pianos <br />The comparisons end there. Keane have caught and conquered many ears in the short time that their music has been played on the radio, and if you own any of the ears that have been caught and are debating as to whether or not to buy this album, do not hesitate any longer, and buy it. I debated with myself when I was at the music store, not sure if I should buy it or not. Now, when I look back on that day, I shake my head and scold myself.  <br /> <br />Keane have been targeted by various sources as Coldplay imitations, as well as the next big thing, and thankfully the latter seems to have prevailed. I don't know very many people who listen to Keane (or, I should say, people who listen to Keane and are dying to tell everyone else about them), but since they have opened concerts for huge named like U2, you learn that all of these fans are somewhat hiding undercover. But yes, about the album.  <br /> <br />Hopes and Fears is, in my opinion, brilliant. Listening to this, I do not consider my 45 minutes worth of time wasted. I bought this CD after hearing \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on the radio, once. I wrote down the name and bought it a few weeks later. So, here are my opinions on the songs: <br />1.Somewhere Only We Know: This is, and will possibly always be, my favorite song out of everything I have ever listened to. When you first play this song, you've got to be careful about what level you've got the volume set at, because it starts with pianist Tim Rice-Oxley pounding mercilessly and beautifully on the piano, accompanied by drummer Richard Hughes bashing on the drums, then calm, as Rice-Oxley calms and vocalist Tom Chaplin starts to sing. Now, I may be a little biased here, seeing as this is the first CD that I've purchased and been able to `understand', but Chaplin's voice is the most amazing thing that I have ever heard. As he first sings, \\"I walked across an empty land...\\" you seem to calm, and after this stanza is sung, the drums pick up again and the song regains some strength, discreetly hinting that it will grow quickly. As you reach the \\"And if you have a minute why don't we go...\\" part, you can tell that Chaplin seems to be holding himself back, as to the amount of power he's putting into the song, and only until the last 20 seconds or so does he calm again. A song allowed to be played at high volumes. <br />2.This Is The Last Time: My first listen of this, I wasn't particularly dazzled, and only after many listenings of this song have I truly warmed up to it.  <br />3.Bend and Break: Personally, I seemed to think that Bend and Break sounded a bit too much like TITLT, but have come to discover many small differences. Another play-loudly song.  <br />4.We Might As Well Be Strangers: The first solidly depressing song on the album, Strangers is lovely, despite its bitter message. The song's musical attitude is like a couple on the brink of being finished, starting out as just sad, then gaining a sort of anger at the second playing of the chorus, and then the dam breaks, all of the tears and fury breaking out at once. Then, depleted of power, the song ends as it started, but with a touch of more sorrow.  <br />5.Everybody's Changing: A perfectly placed song after Strangers. I've never really cared all that much for this song, but still enjoy it whenever I hear it.  <br />6.Your Eyes Open: Immediately catchy, and its story is quickly laid out, although its emotions are not easily marked. A great display of Chaplin's vocals. If you've got a connection with the song or just really like it, his vocals will tear almost painfully at your heartstrings. My third favorite song on the album.  <br />7.She Has No Time: The longest song on the album, She Has No Time is the best example of what Chaplin's voice can really do. His high-flying, faultless falsetto laments over love not shown back, in singing \\"She says she has no time for you now\\", and it being a personal experience for him, can easily sing his heart out.  <br />8.Can't Stop Now: A terribly good song. When I went to see Keane in concert, they opened with this song, and since then cannot help but smile when I hear the starting drums. It's a catchy, lively song about loving someone, but still want to keep on moving (\\"Well I know I said I'd wait around till you need me, but I have to go, I hate to let you down\\"). Yet another play-loud song.  <br />9.Sunshine: Out of all of the songs on Hopes and Fears, Sunshine seems to be the only song that is (mostly) calm as well as optimistic. Starting out, it sounds as if it will be a lullaby-ish song, and it pretty much is, but it gets a little louder as it continues. A very peaceful and calming song.  <br />10.Untitled 1: If any song had to be removed from the album, I'd have to choose this one. I don't dislike it, not at all, but it's the most out of place song on here. It seems to be a testing of what they can do, or rather what they could do as well as how far they were willing to go. The song, in its combination of both music and lyrics is quite mysterious, painted out in darker shades, but stunning nonetheless.  <br />11.Bedshaped: If ever there was a better finale track, I have yet to hear it. Bedshaped, it's sort of difficult to explain, I suppose. Whenever I'm listening to all of my music on shuffle, whenever I hear the start of this song, I pause, let it wash over me. It starts out with this softly rising music effect (I still don't know what it is) until soft piano and drums start up, soon followed by Chaplin's singing, its highest yet. It's like that for about the first half of the song, but it's the choruses that hold the song's power. By the second playing of the first part of the chorus, \\"Don't laugh at me/ Don't look away...\\", you can detect the faintest waiver in his voice, as if he had just before broken down into tears but got back upfrom the ground and started to fight back. The last stretch of music before the last verse is played, if you are listening, really listening to the song and have been pulled into its spell, all of the shivers in the music will just tear at your heart. And if the song has also pulled you into a sorrowful trance, the song ends in the same way that it started, with the music effect fluttering and fading upwards in an optimistic tone. On the right day, this becomes my favorite song.  <br /> <br />But, if you are in a music store, threatening to buy it but see another copy of Hopes and Fears with extra tracks, an import, buy it. Here's why: <br /> <br />12.Snowed Under: A track intended to be on the original Hopes and Fears, Snowed Under is a terribly catchy song, telling you to not let anything pile up on top of you and not get snowed under with anything anyone says to you. Fun to listen to on rainy days (\\"You know sometimes I feel like I'm/ Getting snowed under with the things you say/ When I open my eyes and its a lovely day\\").  <br />13.Walnut Tree: I first heard a 30 second preview of this song on a fan site and bought it from a free download. Oddly enough, not too soon before I first heard this song, I had written a poem about waiting under a tree and couldn't help but laugh when I found this one. Walnut Tree is another lullaby-ish song, a calm, quiet and steady rhythm, very relaxing.  <br />14.We Might As Well Be Strangers - DJ Shadow Remix: I really dislike this version of the song. It ruins an already great song.  <br />15.Allemande: Another peaceful song, with only vocals and simple piano playing. This isn't the best recording that I've heard though. The live version is much better.  <br />16.To The End Of The Earth: My third favorite Keane song. Before I got this particular copy, I had not yet heard the song, but read its lyrics over and over and could only dwell on those. After hearing the song, I could not stop singing it to myself, no matter how bad I sounded. Despite how obvious the lyrics may seem, I still don't know the song's exact meaning, but I love it all the same.  <br /> <br />Before I bought this CD, I knew nothing of music, nothing. I had heard of various band names and such, but I couldn't identify who sung what. I couldn't even identify Coldplay. Now, thankfully, my knowledge has drastically increased, and without Hopes and Fears, I wouldn't be the person I am today. I bought this a little over a year ago, and my CD collection has greatly increased since then, with most of them being similar to Keane. But Hopes and Fears? Absolute brilliance.  <br />
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I was reluctant on seeing this movie at first, but the story just sounding so interesting that i had to give it a try. The reason i was reluctant on seeing it though is because i really did not enjoy Roth's first film 'Cabin Fever'. I thought it was an idea that was used often, you know: teens on a trip get attacked by a town of hillbillies, and i just thought it was strange. But anyway, i ended up seeing Hostel because unlike Fever the idea was not overused, or really used at all, and i was very surprised that i actually really enjoyed it. If you dont know what the film is about i'll explain: the film follows a trio of teenagers who are backpacking through Europe and end up getting involved with a place that people pay at to torture and kill a person. The set up for the main conflict is very interesting and new. At first it almost seems like another version of the movie 'Eurotrip', but it quickly changes when the torture comes into play. It's almost like it goes from a teen comedy to a seriously sick and demented horror movie. Some people hated this idea, they thought it was strange for a movie to start that way and then suddenly change. I thought it was a really cool idea though.  <br /> <br />Now, there are many mixed reviews for this film, it's almost like you either hate it or love it, and i loved it. Some people just thought it was too gross and demented and it is pretty sick (like the eyeball scene), but if your willing to get through the gore and see the art of Roth's film, I think you will really enjoy it. The characters are very well set up and the way it changes from a comedy to a horror to a revenge film is very clever and unexpected. So if you are willing to give it a try, go for it, i think you will be pleasently surprised. Oh, and as for the unrated aspect of this film, dont dawn too much on it because its only like 30 more seconds of violence, so dont expect much difference. <br /> <br />Aside from the film and all its clever and unique-ness, there are also some really cool special features. There are four different commentary tracks, so if your into that, its really cool. And then there is a three part featurette on how they made Hostel, from the cast to the special fx, and everything else, this featurette shows you it all. Those are really the only special features on this disc, but its really worth the money and time. So i guess my bottom line for this film is you should definately buy it if you are up for all the sick gore that is included. I give it four stars though because although it is a really good sophomoric effort and clever film, its just not absolutely 100% perfect. Still really worth the time. Whether you enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, or like me: didn't, i think you will like this film.
0425152251|3.0|ok,say you want to teach your or another child about philosophy, is this the book to use? Yes and no. Yes it can be good to use, but not alone, you must use other books too, because muchinfo the author presents is biased. Really book is not so well writen like some reviewers here would like you to think, but still it is nice and worth the while.
B00005R1N3|4.0|\\"Black Christmas\\"is one of those handful of movies that inspire imitators galore.  By today's standards, it seems a bit dated and not all that graphic - since most of the violence takes place off screen.  But what it does have - psychological suspense, it has in spades.  Those phone calls!  They are disturbing to hear today as they were to listen to years ago when \\"Black Christmas\\" was first released.  The rage and violence of the killer's voice is so explosive, so disturbing, that it elevates the typical formula of the movie (sorority house, isolated chicks being picked off by a psycho killer, clumsy cops) into the genuine \\"cult\\" zone. \\"Black Christmas\\"deserves its reputation not so much because of anything new or groundbreaking as far as thrillers go - but because it remembers the one thing you need in such a movie (with all its limitations): a truly frightening killer.  It's not a far leap to imagine that the guy screaming into the phone is Ted Bundy - and THAT is scarey.
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust is simply a classic recording. It's wacky, hilarious, genre bending, and simply a pleasure. It blows the overrated Real Thing right out of the water. The only track I don't like here is Be Agressive, it has a chrous too annoying for even this album.  Otherwise perfect and never gets boring. They hop genres with great ease and it never gets old no matter how many times I listen to it. Buy this album if you want an entertaining album. It is simply one of the most wacky and fun albums I have ever listened to.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I drove home after buying this album and played it with no outside distractions. I then played it again and listened closely to the music, voices and lyrics and I was stunned at the beauty and balance of this CD. Every song is crafted to perfection and there are no two songs alike. The last CD that impressed me this much was Eva Cassidy's \\"Songbird\\".    Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Prairie Wind return Neil to his folk-country material. There's a few minor differences with this release compared to the rest of his folkier outputs. Neil employs horn sections on a few of his best cuts like Long Way Home, and He was the King. The songs are stalker and more mature than the rest of his folk records. It works like a charm with the wheezing harmonica and banjos Neil sounds pretty good for his age, but you can tell he is an old man. His voice does not have the same energy and punch anymore. Yet, for a person in his early 60's, he can't be touched. Take for instance, Eric Clapton's Back Home. Clapton's voice is gone and his music has been contemptorary for a long time. The rolling stones need to retire. They still commercialize their music like they acutally need the money, it makes me sick. So,if anyone is going to tell Neil to hang it up, you should tell many of the others in that age cateogry to do the same. Neil's material despite his age is still better than anyone else his age.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I saw YES live back in the early 70's everytime they came to Philly. No band ever topped them except Pink Floyd when they played \\"Eclipse - A Piece For Assorted Lunatics\\"(Dark Side of the Moon, before it was released, 4 channel sound, crowd under 5000). Well this show brings back the quality of those first shows. While I always thought \\"Yessongs\\" was pretty good(and some of ABWH), most of their live stuff was never quite as good as I thought it could be. Maybe it's the combination of sight,sound and new technology(the surround sound is great). Well, all I can say is this one is worth the money. They may look older but \\"And You And I\\" was good for a few goosebumps again.
0679735259|4.0|This book is not an easy read.  Its stream of conscuiusness writing and wandering storyline are both its strongest qualities and sharpest point for criticism. <br /> <br />But even upon reading it multiple times all these years later, I still find it a compelling read. In a sense no wrtiing style has better captured the madness that apparently was the war as seen by the boys on the ground who fought it.  The fast pace and jumpy storyline can leave the reader breathless and confused. Sounds like the author captured it pretty well.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|This is an example of when good(or in this case Kick ass) artists go bad.  This is like Zombie, only watered down.  There isn't a track on here that starts your blood pumping and takes over your soul.  I have been a fan since White Zombie, I have all CDs and movies, and been to see every concert that came my way.  I sure hope this isn't the end.
0060930187|5.0|It's a great book for sure, one of the best books I've read from this century. However, I've noticed that many say this book goes into a \\"dark scary place\\" or something similar. I did not see it that way at all. You follow the course of Esther Greenwood's thoughts, and though she does get depressed, I never found the book to be dark or in a morbid mood. It always seemed somehow cynical and lighthearted to me.<br /><br />maybe spoilers following..<br /><br />it even has a happy ending. Plath's life did not, though.
B00000064F|4.0|To the guy below, this cd came out in 1970, Boris just coppied this cd's cover but with a double neck guitar in 2005.   <br />So please next time before you say anything think a bit.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Wow! Who would have thought listening to an obscure song from George Harrison's 1973 \\"Living in the Material World\\" on Bowie's latest Cd? This version alone pays having this CD! A kind of Spectoresque wall of sound is present on the version, but Bowie reinvents the song keeping the beautiful harmony (which somehow comes more alive in Bowie's version than in George Harrison's one), but covering it up with interesting layers of soundscapes that put you somewhere else from \\"the material world\\". The last song of the album is also exquisitely crafted; a totally unexpected fantastic  surprise. Highly recommended!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater has been making progressive metal albums for years and people are still buying them, so I figured they must be doing something right.  I picked up Octavarium without hearing any of the songs first besides the single \\"I Walk Beside You\\", and while I wasn't blown away, it's still very good. <br /> <br />One thing you should be aware of is that these songs are long, and I mean LONG.  Not wimpy six-minutes long, more like, the final two tracks run over a half hour combined long.  Dream Theater takes their time getting where they're going, and they spend significant time milking the better hooks they come up with.  If eight songs that are over an hour in length combined don't sound like your thing, then don't get this record. <br /> <br />\\"Root of All Evil\\" is a good opening track which shows the band's metal sound, and is followed by \\"The Answer Lies Within\\", which doesn't.  \\"These Walls\\" contains probably my favorite guitar line on the album.  The aforementioned \\"I Walk Beside You\\" doesn't sound much like the rest of the songs, but it's still enjoyable and has a great pre-chorus.  \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is a strong track about 9/11 with perhaps the strongest rock out section on the album.  The title track is an absolutely mammoth twenty four minute, five part epic.  The first and last few minutes are mostly instrumental, and in between, Dream Theater manages to hold your attention amazingly well with a series of changes in style and tempo.  It's a great way to end an album for a band that is primarily defined as progressive.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|\\"That's the thing you come to learn about Carl. His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.\\" <br /> <br />The same is true about directors who remake their favorite films. Once the mystery is gone and the essence has been altered to suit their needs, there's nothing left of the legend. That's the case with Peter Jackson's big-budgeted, over-hyped, over-long remake of the 1933 immortal classic \\"King Kong\\". Too much is revealed, too much has been altered. What was once a brief, frightening excursion into the realm of horror has become a sentimentalized pretension; a lofty fantasy that cannot possibly hope to live up to its namesake. As is the case with many of todays remakes, if this film had been a separate entity, it would have worked extraordinarily well. Take away the fumbled, boring ending in New York and focus the entire feature on the island and its many wonderous inhabitants. Find a message about leaving the last remaining untouched mysteries of the world alone and convert this from a tiresome remake into a new work of art. What saddens me is that this mess came from a director whose legend precedes him. The epic scope of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was breathtaking and inspired awe. The epic scope of \\"King Kong\\" left me yawning and looking at my watch. That's the way it is for those of us \\"pre-millenium\\" horror enthusiasts. Nowadays, if you don't have outrageous special effects and innumerable plot points per film, the audience won't pay attention. These \\"post-millenium\\" movie goers have been tarnished by the simple fact that they don't have to rely on their imaginations anymore to have a good time. Everything is laid out for them from point A to point B. There's no thought behind it anymore. No beauty. No truth. Certainly no art. \\"Post-millenium\\" movie goers can keep their Peter Jackson with his flashy CGI gorilla...I'll waste away with a true cinematic delicacy, reveling in the days when he brought us one of the greatest horror masterpieces ofany generation...\\"Dead Alive\\".
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie has it all, artistically speaking. The directing is stunning, to say the least. And I'm not even that huge of a Coen brothers fan. It's this movie that really does it in for me, though. The lighting is perfect. The color scheme that they used in the filming, whatever they did, perfect also. The transitions, the composition of every scene. Absolutely amazing work. The movie just flows, from one scene to the next. No abrupt changes that make you question the transitions. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is perfect. The entire movie goes along with a soundtrack, almost making it a musical, without you even knowing. You think you're watching a movie, but I also have kept this movie on in the background, while doing work, and I can actually listen to the movie. It's as entertaining to listen to as it is to watch. <br /> <br />I'm not much of a judge of acting, but I would assume that the acting is great, also. Most people here seem to say it is. I'll have to ask my wife, that's her cup of tea. <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, if you haven't seen this movie, then what are you waiting for? I'm telling you that it's perfect, in an artistic manner. And quite funny, also.
B00005JOYA|2.0|The word running through my head during this entire film was, \\"Atrocious\\". After we sat through this monstronsity, my brother looked at me and said, \\"Well, the popcorn was good.\\" There are so many things wrong with this film, it's hard to choose even where to begin. <br /> <br />First of all, nobody acts like these characters in real life...hell, nobody acts like these characters in a video game! The acting was terrible -- everybody overacts. Sean Bean would've gone into an utter rage if the restaurant would've said they were out of complimentary toothpicks or mints. <br /> <br />The special effects were incredibly good, but there simply was no script. I got the feeling they created all of these creepy effects shots and then just told the actors to improvise. In the beginning, there was an actual place that was a gas station, restaurant and tattoo parlor rolled into one. I said to my brother, \\"It has everything you'll ever need!\\" At times, the scenes were so absurd, that I started busting up laughing -- so hard I was in tears. <br /> <br />The first hour, in spite of the absurdity of the story, does have several creepy scenes that weren't all that bad, but during the second hour, the film completely changed with a whole new plot even more insane than the first! I got the impression they could've finished the film after the first hour, but since it needed to be longer, they just threw some even more crappy plotline together. Not even the presence of Alice Krige (Borg Queen, ST:First Contact and VOY), or Laurie Holden (Marita Covarrubias, The X-Files) could save this trainwreck. I wasn't even scared once! <br /> <br />Save your money and wait for this when it goes on the cheap shelf at the video store, and it's only worth that for the effects.  Thank god I used a pass to get in to see this, because if I would've paid to see this stinkbomb, I'm sure I would've asked for a refund.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|While certainly not for everyone, this movie definitely wraps up the FFVII story in a way that will please most fans.  The story may be a bit hard to follow, especially if you aren't familiar with the game, but the animation is gorgeous and the action is intense.  It really is a treat to see all these beloved characters together again and to finally see Cloud get some resolution.  I highly recommend the Japanese language track, as it puts the English dub to shame.  Also, the transfer is amazingly crisp and clean; this movie should look great on any HD television. <br /> <br />Just as FFVII was the first video game to make me cry, this movie managed to bring a few tears to my eyes.  Recommended to all fans of this great game!
B000007T1M|5.0|This CD is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the BEST hard rock albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. That said, people who are new to System of a Down's style should start by listening to Toxicity, to get you comfortable with SOAD's unique sound. This CD is what got me into a REAL System of a Down fan. 'System of a Down' blows ALL its successors out of the freakin' water. SOAD's old stuff far surpasses its newer stuff. Its flawless, from the lead singer Serj Tankian's amazing, amazing, AMAZING vocal range to guitarist Daron Malakian's rough, heavy, incredible guitar solos. This is like something you've never heard before. You can't really put SOAD in a genre.. they're just SOAD. They confront an array of problems in their music; From religon, to sex, to drugs, to suicide, to humor, System incorperates almost everything into their music, and you can tell from this album that these four men make music for the benifits of making music, not to get on MTV or sell a billion albums or any of that. Their fame is well deserved and earned. Because they are on the radio does not lessen their talent. So, go out and buy all of their albums.
0689859414|5.0|Oh, where to begin? This book is a sure-fire literary classic, reminiscient of Tolkien and Lewis. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see Spiderwick made into a movie, and be reprinted in novel form for centuries. The serial really is that good. The artwork is above any I've ever seen, the writing is entertaining and even somewhat educational, and the whole project is just beautiful. Highly recommended. Don't even bother getting this from the library-it's too good to return.
B00003CXSM|5.0|This is the movie where I began to love Matthew McConaughey, and where I began to see that Jennifer Lopez is not a bad actress (in this type of role).   <br />Basically she meets him and they have a connection, and little does she know that she already knows his fiancee because she is planning their wedding.  <br />It's a cute light-hearted romantic comedy and if you like that genre, you will love this.  Yes there are corny lines and outrageous situations, but that is part of the fun.  It's a great movie that all romantics will love.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|This movie cost millions and millions.  How could it have been better?  Different director of course.  Helen of Troy?  Even Paris Hilton might have launched a few more ships than this low budget babe.  And Orlando Bloom.  Paris Hilton wouldnt give that wimp the time of day.  He doesnt even have any lips.  Obviously she would have to have a magic spell cast upon her to run away with him.  And Hector with his mullet hair style is just too banal to look at.  Brad Pit is always a pretty wooden indian so he's no surprise as Achilles.  He really is a bit reminiscent of Charlton Heston in the wooden quality of his acting. But why does Patrolus look like an ugly girl? This movie is sure a flashback to ye olde Charlton Heston extravaganzas.  The wrath of Achilles never materializes but he does like to fight being so godlike.  Thats clear.  It would have been so wonderful to have given it a contemporary spin.  The choice of a director would have been a start and a costume designer and a hair stylist.  Peter O'Tooole should have stood in bed. Too many fat old men.  Menalaus was a good guy.  Not a bad guy. How do they make decisions in Hollywood?  All that money spent and such a lousey result!
B000A5044C|5.0|The issues this movie raises are relevant for parents and kids anywhere- my son is under 5, but I intend to watch this with him if there is not something better out by then when he is around 10 to be able to discuss all the issues this raises. I think it is good for kids to realise that this happens and once they are aware that not everyone can go to school when they want to, or not everyone has parents, I think it can bring up some healthy discussions. It is also a must see for parents, it is not overdramatised and really gives you a sense of what kids feel when they are abandoned and how we as a community can try to watch out for kids in trouble- not only our own.<br /><br />This movie is so powerful and focuses on the positive things the oldest boy of 4 siblings did to keep his family going once his mother abandoned them. They were able to survive for almost 6 months without anyone seeming to notice their showers in the park and not going to school.<br /><br />In the true story which you can find some information about (in Japanese) on the internet (Asahi newspaper story 1988) which paints a much darker picture of the actual events which are never represented in the movie. For example, as far as I can tell, the oldest son actually beat the youngest girl because he thought she ate the last of the food and she died from the beating- a very different story occurs in the movie. The mother also had killed one of the children in an accident involving hiding him in a suitcase (so there were originally 6 kids according to the papers).<br /><br />However, the director and script writers chose only to portray the oldest son's character as a struggling, but protective one- I guess they decided it made a better movie, but the fact that he stuck around and did not abandon his brothers and sisters despite being the most capable and able to survive on his own, is truly representative of his good character which was well represented in the movie. One thing I wish they had added at the end of the film was some kind of summation of what happened to the kids like many movies based on real stories do, I think many viewers want to know if the kids are now doing okay, in foster care or whatever happened to them in the end.<br /><br />You can read and join in on a discussion of this film and the issues surrounding it (in English) among parents living in Japan at my blog &lt;A HREF=\\"[...]\\">hiroshimaoyako&lt;/A>d added at the end of the film was some kind of summation of what happened to the kids like many movies based on real stories do, I think many viewers want to know if the kids are now doing okay, in foster care or whatever happened to them in the end. <br />You can read and join in on a discussion of this film and the issues surrounding it (in English) among parents living in Japan at my blog &lt;A HREF=\\"[...]\\">hiroshimaoyako&lt;/A>
1594200823|5.0|Pollan's investigations into corn, organic agriculture, and hunting/gathering/gardening are fascinating.  He writes very well, and even though I've been reading on agriculture for more than 20 years, and growing a lot of food for 13 years, I learned some new things, particularly about the pervasiveness of corn in the American diet (and the reasons for that), and about the astonishing scale of \\"industrial organic\\" food production.  The book is flawed, however, by numerous editorial mistakes--through much of the book, there are errors every few pages, most noticeably in subject-verb agreement.  This is quite annoying and disappointing.  My impression is that this sort of carelessness is becoming more and more common in publishing (because of over-reliance on computer assistance?). <br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book highly.
B000002868|3.0|I'd like to start saying this is not a disc for beginners. If you don't have listen to what fusion was becoming in late 60's you won't be able to understand this record.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not able to catch this as a whole. Someone have said \\"Milky Way\\" could have been composed by Tangerine Dream. I could even say this one is even closer to Karlheinz Stockhausen or Pierre Boulez in also in many other pieces.<br /><br />Yes, I think this could be said alleatory jazz or serial jazz, not exactly fusion jazz (one may say fission jazz). I can see Miles Davis' heritage in \\"Eurydice\\" and \\"Umbrellas\\". I can see some groove and some relaxing landscapes in some other cuts.<br /><br />But this album is really compromising and difficult. Besides, some of the things this group wanted to do were not available for early 70's. The sound is poor and it needs a huge remastering.<br /><br />Definitivley, not for beginners (maybe I am one of those beginners), but it is a great effort in exploring new ideas, new sounds and new music concepts. Too revolutionary...
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This superb movie has notable edges, a solid script, a talented director, a splendid cast (the four main characters were superb). You should never forget that after that memorable and anthological film: who `s afraid of Virginia Woolf? In 1966, Mike Nichols simply reencountered with himself. He is one the most brilliant and propulsive directors of the last Century, thanks to him Jack Nicholson's career achieved a special peak.<br /><br />Four defined characters will meet in London. A frustrated male photographer(Julia Roberts), a dare devil writer(Jude Law) who pretends to reach the sudden notoriety through his emotive biographical memories with a girl with serious affective problems and limited self stem who aspires a major status in this society, and finally a bore dermatologist (Clive Owen)who works out as the opposite mirror like image of Law (notice how they exchange high tension dialogues while they are chatting).<br /><br />These are the defined pieces; and since that dramatic premise there will be an anthological game of wounded wills, emotional double crosses, emotive blackmails, oppression and reinsertion of new patterns of behavior before these serious affective lacks.<br /><br />Try to pay special attention respect a very brief but emblematic lines in the motel, when Natalie Portman says: \\"Where is the love?\\" And she concatenates four verbs in tandem: See me , feel me , touch me , hear me. Does not this sequence sound familiar to you? Well let me refresh the dramatic nucleus of Tommy: the famous Rock Opera. I guess this was a fabulous touch of genius by the screen writer, as well as the prologue and epilogue: can't take my eyes over you, another emblematic homage to that famous song of the late sixties.<br /><br />One of the most original pictures in that year and a marvelous tour de force, that rejoins us with those golden years where the chamber works of overwhelming theatrical stages became successful films (A streetcar named desire, A long day journey through the night) are by themselves the best evidence.<br /><br />\\"Love is the eternal toy that the women pretend to give and the men assume they receive.\\" (Nietzsche)mselves the best evidence.      \\"Love is the eternal toy that the women pretend to give and the men assume they receive.\\" (Nietzsche)
0440241588|1.0|It is not Grisham I admired and enjoyed to read in his first three novels. It is someone else, but who?  Yes, who is the writer, what's his real name?  Maybe it's an advetising agent from Bologna, Italy, posing as John Grisham, an impersonator? A fat Italian chef-turned novelist??  A tourist guide-turned novelist???  Or maybe it's that girl who likes to borrow sentences from other authors' books...  Nooo.  Ha, I've got it!  It's that greedy, sneaky Mr. Publisher capitalising on a good author's name again.  It's that smell of green that buys appearances--yachts, palaces--I don't want to say what else...  But, whatever, this one is a waste of words, and paper, and green...
1878424319|5.0|When I first read this deceptively simple book I thought what a shame it was that I was never given this as a \\"Users Guide\\" to a good life when I was in my teens. I was in my 40's when I first read it and had figured many of the rules out with much needless pain and effort. The way they fit together helps me make profound shift in my relationship with myself and others. This is the book I use most often in my Psychiatry practice to help people think through their interpersonal problems and find healthy solutions to their lives. Almost any conflict can be viewed by looking at the agreements and seeing which one you need to remember to keep.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Ahh, Avril Lavigne... where would punk rock be without you? Your musical genius has torpedoed punk rock muzik from pozerz like the Sex Pistolz and the Ramonez to artists like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. More on the point, this is one of the best albums I have heard n a while. Rock in the 70s was when rock was at its low point, with the Eagles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Who (the Limp Bizkit rip-offs), etc. Now, we no longer have ot worry about them- thanks to people like Avril. Her guitar playing transcends time. She balances her rebellious nature with deep, insightful lyrics.  <br /> <br /> <br />Avril Lavinge is without a question the greatest guitar player of all time. Ashlee Simpson is in 2nd place, and Lindsay Lohan in 3rd. And no, I am not forgetting those old \\"musicians\\" like Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and \\"Slash.\\" Those guys were pozerz, anyone who watches MTV, like me, knows that. If you don't watch MTV, you won't know anything about muzik.  <br /> <br />Thi is highly reccomended to anyone who wants to break away from their shackles of boredom and rebel against the establishment. Avril is more of a rebel than thoze pozerz in Rage Against The Machine could ever hope to be.
B00009MEKF|5.0|Definitely a very good movie, Basic, is a military mystery that brings to the screen the story of a U.S. Ranger training mission gone awry in Panama.  Subsequently, an ex-Ranger is teamed up with the base investigator to try and shed light on the mysterious circumstances that led to the near annihilation of the entire squad.  <br />The film combines drama, mystery, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind. <br />John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Connie Nielsen, Giovanni Ribisi, Brian Van Holt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! <br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching!  Strongly recommended along with Black Hawk Down, A Few Good Men, Rules of Engagement, and Courage Under Fire. 4 1/2 Stars <br />
B00004XOWM|5.0|If you have read my title, it sayz that Limp Bzkit are the kreatorz of thrash metal.... And that's a fact! Thoze pozerz like old Metallica, Pantera, and Slayer were nu-metal you idiotz. Thrash metal didn't come around until KoRn and Limp Bizkit came around and came up with the great of idea and actually including SOLOZ in their songz. Thrashing guitar soloz that show pozerz like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and \\"Dimebag\\" Darrel how to play a guitar solo. <br /> <br /> Fred Durst is a musical genius- that showed on their debut. It showed he was a tortured artist whoze genius could only be understood by other tortured artists, like me, who watch MTV and TRL.  <br /> <br />Limp Bizkit will go down as the greatest heavy metal band of all time. <br /> <br />PS: If you want REAL Metallica, try St. Anger.
0743550927|5.0|There is no substitute for hearing Frank McCourt speak to you, in his own voice, his own words, his own story.   Even if you have read the book, you will find fresh enjoyment and an incomparable entertainment experience through listening to Angela's Ashes on audio.   McCourt breathes warmth, humor and personality into his reading in such a way that is is more like having a cup a tea -- or at times, a pint of Guiness -- with the author in person as he recalls both the humor and tragedy in his life with neither guile nor bitterness.   Anything more I can add to this review will be superfluous after this caveat.  Do not deny yourself this (albiet onesided) conversation with a truly admirable man.
0767802519|5.0|I completely fell for Jean Reno in this movie, and have been a true fan of his ever since. This movie is great.
B000002H33|1.0|Someone really needs to put these low-lifes in their place once and for all.  The members of this band have to be the weakest posers on the planet.  It doesn't get any lower than this ladies and gentlemen.  I've hated these cowards from the very moment I heard them back in the \\"Ride The Whatever Era\\".  Their music is the weakest garbage I've ever heard (metal ballads?)  I loved it when they cut their hair off and were trying to be all 90's, completely abandoning their prior fanbase...I haven't laughed so hard in my life.  Joining forces with MTV?  WHAT WEAKLINGS!<br /><br />When they attemted to change their persona they should have  changed their band name too.  The \\"Prep-Rock Posers\\" would have been good.  At least that would have been a more accurate and honest image for these crybaby scumbags!<br /><br />Metallica sucks...and all you little preps and jocks who dig them are the marketing gimmick target they were aiming for!

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System Of A Down have done it again. Four years after the incredible \\"Toxicity\\" album, which has sold over six million copies worldwide, SOAD pull out another masterpiece. <br /> <br />The C.D takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion. From the hard hitting, Grammy winning \\"BYOB\\", to the almost solemn \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", you get the feeling that System Of A Down have packed a lifetimes worth of passion into one 36 minute C.D. <br /> <br />Quite a few songs on this C.D don't really seem to have meaning - eg. Cigaro, Old School Hollywood, but really, their powerful messages are hidden just a bit deeper then the other tracks. <br /> <br />I have taken the time to try and interpret the messages in these songs as best as possible, but if anyone disagrees, or wants to leave feedback, they can email me at teachers_ruin_lives@hotmail.com. <br /> <br />Here goes: <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side Intro: 9/10: The intro to Soldier Side (Hypnotize Album) is about the pointlessness of war, and about how soldiers are sent to their death. <br /> <br />2. B.Y.O.B: 10/10: This song is about how the Presidents and leaders of certain countries, don't fight their own battles, and send the poor (soldiers) to fight for them. The lyrics \\"You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth\\" reinforces the fact that world leaders are sending in troops to kill people, without even telling them the real reasons behind doing so. <br /> <br />3. Revenga: 9/10: This song is about a man who is in love, but she doesn't want to be with him. He thinks of all the ways he can seek revenge eg. \\"Poisoning a drink, Bleeding in a sink, Choking with a link, Killing with a stink\\" but in the end he doesn't have the strength to go through with his plans. <br /> <br />4. Cigaro: 10/10: The lyrics \\"My c*ck is much bigger than yours\\" and \\"My sh*t stinks much better than yours\\" are about how people try and use stupid things to show-off and gain respect.  <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video: 10/10: \\"Hey man,look at me rocking now I'm on the radio\\" is about someone who only wants to make music to get rich and famous. About half way through the song people begin to lose interest in this person, so he starts screaming to get their attention, like, hey, look at me, I'm on the T.V, pay me attention. <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: 9/10: This song is about a being a Cocaine addict, and how it makes you act crazy and erratic. <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography: 9/10: This song involves two sides of a heated argument about pornographic images being shown on television. One side wants to condone it, but the other tells people to boycott television <br /> <br />8. Question: 10/10: This song is about a soldier questioning war. He wants to know whether he will survive when he goes to fight. <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue: 9/10: This song is related to war, a leader is talking to someone and is telling them that they are all going down in history, but for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood: 8/10 I heard somewhere that this is about Daron Malakian's experiences at a celebrity baseball match, and about how uncomfortable he felt. <br /> <br />11. Lost In Hollywood: 10/10: This song is about someone who is a big celeb in his/her own town, and tries to make it big in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br />This album is a work of art, anyone who even remotely respects decent music should buy this album. The best tracks are BYOB, Question, and Lost In  Hollywood. <br /> <br />There are heaps of reviews that are just like `aw this is mad buy this album' I thought I might go a bit more deeper than that, that's the least the masterpiece that is \\"Mezmerize\\" deserves. <br /> <br />All these song meanings are my own interpretations, whether these are the actual song meanings I do not know. <br /> <br />Note: If you found this review interesting, or learnt something, however small, please just take a second to rate this review as being helpful. <br /> <br />Thanks in advance <br />
B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman seems to climb inside the skin of Truman Capote in his depiction of the author of \\"In Cold Blood\\".  A troubled, alcoholic, gay man in an era when homosexuality was not widely condoned, Capote becomes engrossed in the story of the brutal slaying of a Kansas family of four.  He travels to Kansas with his friend Harper Lee (author of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\") and witnesses the arrest, trial, and imprisonment of the two men responsible for the murders.  At first Capote plans to write a short story about the killings, but as he digs further into the circumstances, he realizes that it has the makings of a great novel.  The film focuses on his conversations with one of the killers, Perry Smith, who has a background which is remarkably similar to Capote's.  A friendship develops, which surprises both men.  Ultimately, however, Capote becomes anxious to finish the book and this can only happen after the men are executed.  Capote treads a fine line of friendship vs. his own convenience and the viewer sees his moral fiber quickly erode.  This is a well-made film which poses some very interesting ethical questions.
1400079179|5.0|This is a great novel-period! It's fiction, and meant to be fiction. Forget about all the hype about it being anti-Christian or being an attempt at revising truth. It's a fast paced novel with an intriguing story line-and FICTION at its best. A must read bestseller for four years. There's a reason for that.
B00004RJEG|5.0|I love this DVD, it is my second favorite DVD performance The Corrs have put out (with \\"Live at Lansdowne Road\\" being my favorite).  Before it had a North American NTSC region 1 release I ordered a region 2 PAL version from Blackstar in the UK.  I knew it was worth the trouble to import it and to get a player capable of playing it.  I ordered it without having seen it and I was not disappointed at all.  It was worth every bit of the trouble.  Of course now it's available as region 1.      While I like the full-blown concert at the Dublin's Lansdowne Road Stadium, hearing and seeing The Corrs perform in a studio setting backed by an orchestra a great.  The sheer beauty of Andrea's ethereal voice really shines in the performance, but Sharon and Caroline also get to do some singing, and Caroline's singing voice is absolutely beautiful.  If you're a fan of The Corrs, this is a \\"must have\\" DVD.
0553382179|5.0|I've been following Marla's system and wanted to counter some of the other objections to this book. <br /> <br />1.  It's \\"preachy\\" or \\"too religious\\" -- I've seen heard Christian women saying it's \\"not religious enough\\"!  This is silly.  Flylady is clearly a believer, but her references to religion are vague and general.  I'm sure you can deal, unless the mere mention of God offends you terribly. <br /> <br />2. It's \\"only for stay at home moms\\" -- Not so! I'm going into teaching next year, and I have my morning and evening routines all set up and ready to go!  Plenty of Flybabies are working mothers who find that Flylady's routines give them MORE, not LESS time to relax with their family.  This is because there is no more \\"crisis cleaning\\" but just small amts of maintenance cleaning to keep your home beautiful and you FREE. <br /> <br />3. It's hokey/syrupy -- Oh, sorry, she's NICE.  Didn't mean to offend you!  Ha! But seriously, Flylady's inspirational tone is just what a lot of us self-critics need to release perfectionism and procrastination, and to realize that we're blessing our families just doing what we're doing. <br /> <br />4. It makes it sound like the wife should just take care of her husband and kids -- Flylady discussed this recently.  It's not that you SHOULD do all the work around the house.  It's that you are ABLE to and should NOT let the division of responsibilities be an excuse to cause conflict in your family (i.e. no martyr attitude).  Put it this way: if your routine takes care of everything in 15 minute snippets (your bathroom stays clean because you swipe it for 2 minutes each morning, your laundry stays done in 15 minutes a day, your kitchen stays clean because you put dishes in the dishwasher as you use them) there aren't those HUGE complications to cause familial discord.  And flybabies have been reporting that having a control journal gives their husband a means of helping with the work, since he knows what to do. Overall, in the testimonies I've read, this has lead to happier, healthier marriages and families -- and I know it will in my family too, because unlike with my parents, there'll BE no undone housework to be bitter ABOUT! <br /> <br />Basically, if you feel depressed and out of control in your life, STRUCTURE will HELP you, not bog you down with more perfectionism and disappointment!  I highly recommend Flylady's program.  You'll FEEL better as you take the baby steps to making your environment conducive to PEACE and contentment.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys is like my top favorite singer IN THE WORLD, her music and videos dont have anything like beyonce would, its so smoothing and calming. For example: <br />1.

B000BEZQ18|2.0|While Santaolalla's score is not bad, it is not exceptional either.  Not what I would call Oscar-worthy, and more importantly, not comparable to the other nominated scores, most notably those for Pride and Prejudice and Memoirs of A Geisha.  (In the case of Pride and Prejudice, the piano-like the guitar for Brokeback-takes the forefront, but the composer for that film crafted a score that was true to the historical period, but also instrumentally modern.  With Geisha, John Williams successfully reinvented himself and delivered an effective foreign-sounding score without it sounding clich? or affected.  These two scores were both deserving of an Oscar.) <br />It is beyond me why the voters chose this to win the Best Original Score award, though.  The only above-par moment is the last track, \\"The Wings,\\" which seems like it will finally take you places before it cuts short at under two minutes long.  It's the finest score moment on the cd, but considering that all the other pieces are melancholy and somewhat repetitious (not to mention, reflexive of each other) guitar \\"ramblings,\\" which have their place in the film no doubt, but the voters should have chosen the best soundtrack, not just the soundtrack to the most controversial movie.  Besides this, the score seems incomplete (there are only six score tracks and each is very short) and the only reason they could release this album was if, and they did, add a bunch of song-filler.  That part of the album is not covered in this review.   <br />All in all, it's a decent achievement, but nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly not deserving of something as prestigious as an Academy Award.  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|If you are a PS2 Final Fnatasy gamer, then you'll most likely understand this movie. <br /> <br />Otherwise... continue reading. <br />The CGI in this movie is just amazing. Of course. It was done with Maya 7 Unlimited with custom plug-ins. But, the storyline was so weak that it didn't make sense in making a movie. <br />Even Appleseed which had \\"3D anime\\" concepts, had a better storyline. It was average, but 100 better than \\"Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children.\\" <br /> <br />I give this movie 2 stars because of the CGI. If that wasn't a factor most likely would be 1 star.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This movie has a lot of things going for it:  a superb script (that's just as accurate in its portrayal of human shortcomings, as it is delightful in its humor, which is very well written, but the acting is good enough that it gives it an air of fresh casualness) and excellent performances by all four actors (though Portman and Owen's performances stand out a little more), and a nicely mature feel that alternates between being comically offbeat and impressively sharp. <br /> The script is good not only in its humor, but, to put it simply, it's just good writing, which, sadly, for movies of a romantic nature, nowadays at any rate, is rare, and therefore a great source of enjoyment when it is stumbled upon.  The dialogue is effective:  it feels like someone actually knew what they were doing when they wrote the scenes, and the injected humor is always funny without awkwardly disrupting the \\"drama.\\"  The perfect example is when Law's character is trying to persuade Robert's character to see him on the sly (while his girlfriend is yards away), saying with determined resolution:  \\"You `kissed' me!\\"  To which she retorts lazily, \\"What are you, 12?\\"   <br /> The acting is also top notch.  Jude Law manages to create a character so innocently selfish (and likable) that by his final moment of pain, I couldn't help feeling sorry for him and feeling gleeful.  (While I'm on it, the plot really kicks off around his character.  He meets Portman's character (Alice), an indescribably American stripper, they get together; later, he writes a book on her and meets Roberts' character (Anna), and attempts to get her.  He fails.  At first, by a hysterical chance meeting Anna then meets Clive Owen's character, a doctor, and they get together.  A year later Anna and Dan begin cheating.  They eventually tell their respective lovers.  Alice leaves Dan, taking up stripping again, whilst Clive Owen's character spends his time making a go for Alice-and failing-before finally getting Anna back.After that, Dan returns to Alice, who welcomes him lovingly-she's crazy about him-only to find Alice literally momentarily exterminate her love for him when she realizes that he knows she slept with Anna's then ex-boyfriend while still stripping-and then the movie ends.  Anna's back with her boyfriend, now her husband, Dan is alone, seemingly ok, and Alice is alone as well.  Her condition is left for the viewer to conclude.)  Julia Roberts turns in an elegant performance, also managing to summon sympathy despite her indiscretions.  Owen is charming and witty, and the most decent person in the film (despite a few moments of weakness), but he is honest and committed.  Portman, however, is the one who really turned in an unforgettable performance.  Part Clementine from Eternal Sunshine... (less eccentric, yet just as original) and part Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and part something indefinable, she's funny and tragic.  She seems to relish the role, never straying out of character, and portraying masked vulnerability and unmasked pain brilliantly, all the while managing to come across believably as a stripper.  Her scene with Owen, in which she and he are alone in a private room at her strip club, is one of the best of the film, and not at all because she's barely dressed.   <br /> The only real problem with the movie is the ending.   Anna returns to her husband, but not because she knows and regrets that she did something wrong and wants to correct it, not even out of pity.  She just realizes she prefers him to Dan, which is all good and well until you realize it's possible she didn't learn anything.  Dan seems to have come a little more full circle by the end, but this is unconfirmed by dialogue or revelation in the film and is left to the viewer's assumptions.  Alice seems changed yet sad by the end.  The only clue to her new life is a shot of walking down the street (which, on a side note, is one of the most beautifully-done scenes I've ever seen in a movie) withan air of sorrow.  Perhaps the point of the scene is just to assure us that she is alright.  She made it through, even though rather scarred.  That is my only complaint with the film.  It doesn't completely tie the knots of the story.  But it's a good way to end a story, in a way, because it gives the witness of the story freedom to suppose.  But no matter what the conclusion of the viewer is, it doesn't change the fact that, in the end, even though the movie is well done and funny, it portrays truly stupid people whose only interests in love are selfish and disoriented.  Thankfully, the film doesn't seem to necessarily justify this (using the slogan \\"When you believe in love at first sight; you never stop looking.\\") or rationalize it.  I'd like to think of it as a satire.  It may be, it may not.  I don't know.  But it should be clear that even someone like me, who hates movies about this sort of thing, enjoyed the movie as a film, though the story really is about people who (in most cases) shamelessly make their mistakes.  I think of this as a (probably not what the writer had in mind) of a reminder of what true love is and to avoid people like the characters in the story.  That is the story's greatest flaw.  And even though I am reviewing a movie and how well it was made, not necessarily the story, it does keep the film from having five stars in my book.   <br /> In short, a great movie that is superbly performed and delivered.  Just don't be expecting a chirpy romantic comedy (at least not by the end) or a story upholding virtue or unselfish love.   <br />  <br />
B00004T9VY|4.0|...and I am glad that I did.  Even though it's out-dated by today's standards, it's actually held up to the test of time.  The first song I heard was \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" as it was played during each episode of Extras (on HBO).  I heard a few more songs as they were featured in Harold & Maude (another oldie I just was made aware of).  I don't think that there is a dud on the album, and compared to the few other Cat Stevens albums that I have listened to, this one appears to be the most consistent.  The remastered version is the one to go for, you can really hear the difference, especially on the song \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\".
