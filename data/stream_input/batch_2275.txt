B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was good. I played it on my ipad before. Hope it could loving as gamecenter apple account. All mine family liked it.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|A little slow in the beginning but eventually picks up.  Good story line and overall well put together.  Gave one hope of this concept one day being picked up by a big studio.  That would be great!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|It was a really cute, laugh out loud funny and fast read. The story line is really clever. I only give it a 4 because I would have preferred more depth to Emma and Jack's spark. You can clearly see why they like each other, but I felt it was shallow and left me wanting. The story would have been better written as a series with more coverage of the 2 of them. Just my opinion. Overall, lots of lol moments! I highly recommend as a light and fast read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Probably the most fun game on a tablet :) Great to play during physics class too! Even my teacher loves it! :D
B009KEN87O|5.0|I really doinn't rate a lot of games, but I think this one is worth the time to rate. If you like classic arcade style games...this is a must. It is fun with a 3-D twist to it. Everyone can enjoy it.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Completely underwhelmed with this album. It is incredibly boring and repetitive. I don't know how this album can possibly get this many accolades. The best song is \\"Suit and Tie\\" and even that leaves a lot to be desired. There are no club hits on this. The whole album is full of that annoyingly fake and squeaky voice JT makes.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The story just gets better and better.  The best part? The last 20 seconds of the season are pretty epic.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|this app does not provide access, that i can easily find, to the basic of functions i use on linkdin.  specifically the accept  invite function.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Perfect fit for the new Paperwhite Kindle.  No frills, just a plain neoprene case with a side zipper with pretty good protection if dropped.  I bought one for my larger KIndle DX and it's just a mini version.  Easy to carry and not bulky!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I love that I can play it on my kindle fire. Plus easy to manuever like an actual action game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season Three of Downton Abbey continues the saga of the Crowley Family. This is probably the best &#34;soap opera&#34; on television as it provides historical insight for the early part of the 20th century as well as the sometimes steamy and definitely seamy adventures in the lives of the upstairs family and downstairs staff. You've got to be familiar with Seasons One and Two to appreciate this!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I can't get enough of Jane Austen.  Love all her books and have seen many, if not all, the screen versions of her work.  This is my favorite &#34;Emma&#34;.  I enjoy Romola Garai and especially like Jonny Lee Miller.  Supporting cast is equally as strong.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you're not familiar with Downton Abbey, now is the time to acquaint yourself with this exciting soap opera from Great Britain.  If you are a fan of history, you will love it!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Saw the \\"twists\\" coming a mile away. Not a bad story, nice to have one from the point of view of the murderer's parents, but the book read a little too much like a script instead of a novel. Even the narrative from the father. Overall, ok. Just kept hoping for something unexpected.
B000001FW9|5.0|love this eclectic album. so far from pop, it varies style with each song. golden age stuff. complex and interesting from beginning to end.
B008FC4WA4|4.0|Hornby isn't really my kind of writer - more of a Neal Stephenson/ Thomas Pynchon type, myself - but I enjoyed being able to buy one of his short stories, thus avoiding the commitment of a novel. The story is cute; it has an interesting, if largely bourgeois, premise, and it's well executed.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun! Easy to get used to and very creative take on a classic arcade game. Great for killing time on the go.
B004SBULWE|5.0|It is saving me some valuable battery time.  Since I installed it, I haven't had to charge my phone nearly half as much. Great product!
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I bought this cause its one of my favorite groups and I like all the song on this disk. If you like the Foo Fighters you will like this oneits a  good group of music.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I only have 2 problems with this-1.)according to me Craig is too serious to be James Bond and 2.)instead of 1 mission,1 plot,the plot is ever changing
B00A3YREFM|5.0|This movie was incredible! Already saw it in theaters, but wanted to see it again. Now i watch it every day becuase i love it!!!!!!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you are a space invaders, asteroid type, this is your game. Give it a spin, it is fun.  Reminds you of the old arcade shmups.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|George C. Scott's best performance! Battle scenes are very realistic and the action is well portrayed.<br />German is spoken by all the German soldiers which gave it more meaning.<br />All the acting was top notch. Most of all it brought a strong emotional portrayal<br />of George Patton.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|.This is one of the most awesome games.  If you are going to get this game I suggest you getting Temple Run first and play that a couple of times then get this game.  Don't worry.  Temple Run is free so it doesn't cost money.  The reason I want you to get just Temple Run is because I want you to see the difference between the two.  Once you get just Temple Run and then play this game, you will get what I mean.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|enjoyed it very much,its a very interesting book,would recommend to all book lovers,i give it ten out to ten.Excellent!!!! Enjoy
B00846WWVM|4.0|The water seems to run out quickly. Maybe a few more seconds would help on the more difficult levels while playing.
B00BF11STU|1.0|We have very fast internet through our cable company and have enjoyed several movies to date. However this movie was constantly subjected to interruption for downloading throughout. Terrible experience
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|App provides the basics need of an alarm, which is all I needed. I quite like it, its nothing fancy.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I recommend this game to all, it is a great fun to play game and I play it almost every day
B003SNKBXW|3.0|I read this movie after watching the film, wondering what exactly was going on. The book is very interesting, explaining a lot about the occult, but it left a few loose strings behind. Was the girl really a demon? Why did Fargas and the old woman have to die? And the like. I would say this is a fun book to read on a long flight, or trapped in a cabin in the woods. Otherwise, let this dog sleep.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I recommend this game to all. It is a blast to play and I love playing it. It is fun
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore, the mastermind behind Lord of the Rings, has made another masterpiece with this soundtrack. If you are looking for all of the music from the movie, then you had better wait until they come out with the Complete Recordings, which, I am sure, they will. But if you do decide to get one of the soundtracks, I suggest you get the Special Edition. \\"Blunt the Knives\\" is worth the extra money you will pay, all alone. Yet you get more than just that. I find myself listening to this soundtrack, along with the Complete Recordings of Lord of the Rings on a regular basis. I can't wait to get more from Howard Shore!
B0068TL23G|5.0|I recommend this game to all. It is a blast to play and I love playing it. It is fun
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Some people wanted The Hobbit to be just one movie. What they may not understand is all of the stuff that has been added from other works. It's not like Harry Potter (a good series) where everything happened at Hogwarts. But what happened in the rest of the world? Secondly, when Tolkien wrote the Hobbit, that was all he had written. The Appendices and other works (some have been added in this movie, like the White Council, and Radagast The Brown) and Lord of the Rings came later. In my opinion, you could not have asked for a better interpretation. This movie made me feel the same as when I saw Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the first time! I couldn't believe the movie was already over, and I was excited to see what would happen in the next! The only people who have told me it was a bad movie, were already thinking negatively about the movie and where they are going with it. I'd say, if you are optimistic about it, then you may actually enjoy the movie. For me, I think Peter Jackson and crew know what they are doing. Like I said before, I can't wait to see the next installment!<br /><br />Edit: Something I may have left misunderstood was the part about Harry Potter. That is one of my favorite film franchises, and all I meant by it was that J.K. Rowling is still at the beginning of her writing career. If she wanted to, she could create a world of Harry Potter. One other thing that I meant on that comment was more of the fact that you don't see hardly any students or people from the other schools. It seems they are all, or mostly all, from Hogwarts. Lastly, if you really have doubts about the movie and where it is going, simply rent the movie.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I recommend this app to all, it is a great fun to play game and I play it almost every day
B000058983|5.0|While I listened to Love in college a long time ago, I had never heard this album until a week ago... and it was really a fluke as to how that occurred. My college tune mavens and me were in a week long email discussion over the very controversial Rolling Stones T0P 500 albums of all time list. Supposedly, a hundred or so music experts -- musicians, producers, record execs, etc. were consulted on this and submitted their favorites. How the order came to be is a mystery of the highest order.<br /><br />My music maven buddies and I tried to focus on the TOP 100, as that is about as much data as our feeble brains can process in one sitting. While this is not the place to list the TOP 100, with some of the totally idiotic and bizarre choices that were made by RS magazine, as well as many of the glaring omissions, I will just list a few of the bizarre and ridiculous inclusions in the TOP 100. The glaring omissions are too many to even discuss here ---<br /><br />#13 - Velvet Underground - really? This 60s group that I barely heard in college has the 13th best album of all time?<br />#33 - The Ramones - punk NJ rock - actually pretty good but not #33.<br />#41 - Sex Pistols - seriously? this is garbage.<br />#44 - Patti Smith - saw her in concert ages ago. She's alright, nothing more.<br />#45 - Public Enemy - angry rap album. Its Rap and its Crap.<br />#60 - Captain Beefheart - uh, who? -- Only decent if you're on an acid trip. I'm not.<br /><br />So I then go to #40 on this list - Love - Forever Changes. To think that the above mentioned albums could even be mentioned in the SAME PARAGRAPH as this record, let alone for several to be rated higher than this album is a total joke. But listening to the above recordings, as well as a bunch of other ones on the RS Top 100 list did do one thing for me -- It made me realize even more what an astonishing piece of genius that \\"Forever Changes\\" is.... after the first listen I was totally blown away. After the 3rd or 4th, I was totally in awe.<br /><br />It is not that often that music really moves me, or evokes emotions in me that may have been dormant  for many years. I can only think of two albums in the last ten years or so that did this - \\"Travesura Chilie\\" by the amazing flamenco guitarist Jose Luis Encinas, and \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", maybe the best solo album by the sensational Mark Knopfler. But Forever Changes evoked these emotions in me and more. I've listened to it at least fifteen times in the last week, and I am not done yet.<br /><br />The music of Arthur Lee is so beautiful and haunting, I can't get enough of it. His melodies, arrangements, his beautiful voice and singing style all contribute to a work of amazing perfection... and the way his songs build,, you're listening to one of the tracks and you think he's done, then the song takes a twist and keeps on building, until it ends in a crescendo of horns, strings or guitar... you think Arthur Is done, but he just keeps on delivering.. and THAT is what makes this recording so amazing. Arthur Lee just keeps on bringing the goods, and the more he brings them, the better they get.<br /><br />#40 on the RS Top 500 list is too low, as I truly don't think there have been more than 10 or 15 recordings in history that are better than this one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I actually did not use this for a kindle but for a regular samsung smartphone, it worked without any problems. Yes the quality of the cable is not amazing but for the price it cannot be beat
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I re ordered this for the first time ever and was absolutely amazed at how easy and convenient it was.  I also love this series and now can watch it whenever I want.  For all adults who like things mid-evil.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I recommend this game to all, it is a great fun to play game and I play it almost every day
B001U7B4T8|2.0|If you bought the original cassette back nearer to the original concert(s), you'll be flabbergasted at what's MISSING here: Johnny Winter's torrid rendition of  'Highway,' Clapton's 'It's All Right&#34;....and too much to mention.<br />This is like a cliff's notes of this tribute concert, all tangled, presumably, in copyright quarrels and other blarney. Save your money. Please.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I recommend this game to all, it is a great fun to play game and I play it almost every day
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The controls are very easy, but the game is still challenging. Great graphics. It looks awesome on my kindle fire. It is well worth the price. Get this app today.<br /><br />.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|It is great for what it has, but should be the entire show.  Buy it to get the flavour of the show.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed seeing the progression of the relationship between the two main characters. Not as good as the first book but still a good read.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is the penultimate series.  Well crafted, well acted and achingly well presented.  One that can be watched over and over.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|The main reason I got that app was for the calendar that it doesn't have. I am really disappointed! If it had the calendar it would be perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really love this book,I keep reading it over and over again.If you love a romance book this is a great one to read the whole collection is great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a very well done retro game that brings back some great space invaders memories.  A great free app of the day!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I HAVE SEEN SEASON 1 AND NOW SEASON 2,,,,,,,,,,HARDLY WAIT FOR SEASON 3............<br />IT'S A VERY CLASSIC , EXCELLENT OF ITS KIND,,  I LOVED THE LIFE STYLE AND THE WAY THEY LIVED<br />AND RESPECTED EACH OTHER................AND LOVED THE BIG CASTLE...........Downton Abbey is in a Categorie of its Own.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Game is okay but not anywhere as good as their Atlantis game.  Not as easy to tell which special Icon you have and seems to be more difficult to tell where the matches are going to end up after a play._
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have had a lot of fun playing the game. It helps to kill extra time. And I like the sound effects.
B004NZ64GC|5.0|We adopted a 12-year old boy from China and we put this on for him and his English speaking sisters to watch together.  I can't speak to the quality of the Chinese but he sure enjoys it and it is great to have something they can watch together.
B009KEN87O|3.0|Good game, graphics nice, smooth game play. Weapons do not last nearly long enough and are taken away between levels. Not so fun.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|I watch this repeatedly, love it! It is a must for Bon Jovi fans new and old. I Love it!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I think the LOTR movies - especially the extended versions - are very good, though disappointing in many small ways due to many unneccesary changes that were made to the story, characters, motivations, etc.  The Hobbit movie is very similar.  The included additions are silly and add nothing to the story.  Peter Jackson and his writing team need to understand that they're not \\"improving\\" The Hobbit, they're just adding filler.  Also, see my additional comments below re: the \\"Extended\\" version.<br /><br />I can see splitting this into three movies, but why add the filler when there's so much worthwhile material to use?  This isn't about being a \\"purist\\", it's about telling the story that the studio supposedly found so compelling that they had to tell it.  I know it's an empty complaint, because that's how Hollywood works, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.<br /><br />This is a good movie, it's worth seeing, but it's also a bit silly how the story has been changed<br /><br />******************************************************************<br />Edit 11/12/13:  Amazon won't allow me to review the Extended Edition separately, so here're my 2 cents:<br /><br />If you enjoyed the extended LOTR movies you'll likely enjoy this.  Is it \\"better\\"?  I don't know that there's more detail to flesh out like in the LOTR saga, but I was still hoping that this would feel a bit closer to the book.  It doesn't, really.  It feels a bit like a cash-grab, but it's still fun to see.  But I've finally put my finger on one of my issues with the Peter Jackson movies:  he doesn't know what tone to take regarding the dwarves.  They're short, see?  So they must be comic relief, right?  Er...um...well, no.  So there are these odd tonal shifts - they're solemn warriors trying to regain their lost kingdom (and fortune), there are these moments of earnest, grave hand-wringing of the their past and the plight of their people.  Then they're all comical buffoons played almost as broadly as the 3 Stooges.  That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too much of one.  So, essentially, Peter Jackson is incapable of having these dwarves on screen and \\"playing it straight\\", so to speak.  A bit of whimsey is fine, but it feels like this underlying disrespect for the characters is built into the script.<br /><br />I don't know, it's a semi-fun adventure film, but to me the tone is just off.  Plus the \\"Elves vs. Dwarves\\" stuff is played up way too much.<br /><br />I'd say this movie is still worth watching, but I'm not really expecting much from the overall 3 movie cycle.e 3 Stooges.  That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too much of one.  So, essentially, Peter Jackson is incapable of having these dwarves on screen and \\"playing it straight\\", so to speak.

0062007297|5.0|The pictures are great. The interview / conversations are heartfelt and behind the scenes. They are open and honest about each other and their feelings - a great read!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Cute movie great for kids :-) It had very good animation and really draws you into the story....not to mention the Easter bunny is adorable in this movie.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Hard to put down and twisty, great read.  Mrs. Flynn can really create some good characters, they are all flawed, unlike other crime novels where the sleuth is perfect and 'normal' hers are not!
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Nothing to Envy does a good job at keeping its views on an even keel.  It does not create caricatures of the people whose stories were told, nor does it demonize any side of the many influences on North Korea and its people.  Each person's journey is well told and woven together to show how they got from point a to b, all the while painting a picture of their environment and its effects upon them and their families.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a great movie.  It shows the faithfulness of a dog toward his owner.  It teaches people about dog's nature and compassion.  Also, it teach us the reason dogs are frequently called &#34;Man's best friend.  A great movie for the whole family.  Highly recommended.
1451695195|5.0|But so far the book is great.  I can't wait to finish it. I'm sure the rest of the book will be as good as the beginning of i t.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|loved the price of this game and now love to play the game. the graphics are good and the three star rating that allows replay is great for an A type person.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|DVDs came on time, everything was as described. Shipment came on time, I have six more words to say, but already said it all
B005CFWICG|5.0|I have this in three different colors. I know its ridiculous but I had to buy two more<br />after falling in love with the light blue one. It is great. I love everything about it,<br />doesn't look like a typical Crocs either. My feet are slightly wide, the straps don't dig<br />into my skin. The heels aren't too high, just enough to give me a lift. Some people might<br />want to see this updated with buckles or adjustable straps. This pair worked for me.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie was excellent. I had been waiting for it to come out on DVD it was well worth the wait. I would recommend seeing it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read it in a day....couldn't put it away. Cried most of the time.<br /><br />A beautiful lovestory. Humor, philososphy, lots of love and loving and cruel reality.<br />How do you cope with dying? Will you leave your mark or will you leave scars?
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This movie arrived in a timely fashion and was as described.  This movie was recommended to me by family and I have since recommended it to others.
0140283587|5.0|Amazing book. The author, Sutcliffe, is a smart realist who puts things in novel ways without being loquacious about. He makes the most poignant statements in the fewest words than I have ever read. Insight to word ratio is extremely high. The book is hilarious too. If you want to read about Larry David going to India, read this.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is a very funny book I am very excited to read the next books. Jeff Kinney,  way to go!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|easy to play,  older person and not into zombie games<br />or cartoon games also colorful on screen the game also has different levels
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has got to be the most versatile Bible. It is awesome quite the same as God.,his Son.. and through his spirit his Holy Word.  Irregardless of what version you select his true meaning never changes nor fail to brighten your day as you move along life's way.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The amazon kindle is so easy to download! Luv it! Thank you Amazon :) Love the book. Would highly recommend.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|This artist was in the background during a meeting, I was in awe of the pieces. Since I have come to know many pieces and am in love with the tone it sets. If you like a bit modern classical, you should consider this.
B000NY12LO|3.0|The book was good but some of it felt like a journal.<br /><br />I am sure a lot of the experiences of the students and their interactions were pertinent to the story, but it seemed to drag on a little long.
6305508550|4.0|It is funny and frankly kind of ridiculous; however, the ridiculous moments only make it funnier.  I now really want a red stapler.  It is not for kids though.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Amassing by Jonah one of his best stories I have read.th b the the the the the the the rje
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It may really be geared towards kids, but it is still can be applied to all ages.  I'm a college student and I loved it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love game like from the 80's and this game is fun to play...You will love this game too if you where into arcade games.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I like Ryan Reynolds so I'm a tad bit biased; however, I thought the movie was very good.  I can't wait for the next movie to come out.
1616550414|5.0|Great for Legend of Zelda lovers. It tells the ins and outs of the games and the timeline. It also have drawings, storylines, and a manga preview for the Legend of Zelda manga.
B000RJO578|4.0|If you're looking for something that is action-packed with realistic injuries, don't watch this.  It simply is just not that type of movie.  None of the deaths look real, but that is part of the humor, along with all the ridiculous things that happen.  Still, it is a perfect movie for laughing at stupidity.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|Was a great show as a kid! Still great to this day. Today so much TV is nonsense. Many shows of the 70's - 80's have more going for them with better characters and acting than todays shows.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I have not read any of the books, so I do not know if it is a good representation of them.  Regardless, I love the movie and I am anxiously awaiting the next one.
B005OP71GC|5.0|\\"Revenge\\" is definitely the best new show that's been on TV during the last few years. I like that characters are different and everyone has their own story. Emily is by far the most interesting one. She's smart, sexy and has everything planned. She's always a step ahead and no one can beat her.<br />In this show you can see good vs bad and it seems the story is endless. Right when it seems that all questions are solved, there will be new info and it's not even close to the end. It is a show that you have to pay attention to, because sometimes you have to use your brain and do inferences as well. I recommend it for people who like to watch something a bit difficult.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This story was a fight to the finish with a knock out twist that I never saw coming.  Hats off to Suzanne for blowing predictability right out of the water.  Thoroughly enjoyed this thriller!
B009OYTOA0|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first started watching it, but it got my attention. It turned better and better after every episode. The storyline is fascinating and always mixes things up to keep you watching.<br />Characters are all different, but they make it wholesome. Stephen Amell is an amazing actor, he plays the role very well. I like that he seems so confident and it's not this way only in the show, but in real life as well . There hasn't been a boring episode of Arrow yet,, they are all very catchy and every episode finds some solutions, but still ends with leaving many questions. I recommend it for everyone who likes shows that are keep you guessing!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put the book down, it was so good!!! I can't wait to read the next book and see how everything ends up!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was just as good as the first.  I love the characters, love the writing, love everything about it.  Cant wait to read the next one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you should try it(:<br /> yu get yur own horse and yu get to take care of it and yuget to do races an stuff i love this game
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was magnificent.  Well written and poignant, you could feel everything the characters felt.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent British series.  Both my wife and I are still addicted to the show.  The location scenery, period dress and autos, along with great acting made this a must see.<br /><br />Each episode has it's unique &#34;twists and turns&#34;.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I was introduced to Lindsey by listening to Pandora Radio station Electronica For Studying.  Each time a Lindsey song came through the rotation of music I had to turn up the voulme.  It is fantastic and fun.  Her You Tube video end with her genuine thanks to her fans.  Let's get Lindsey's name out there and get her on tour so we can see this great talent live!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time! From start to finish I could not put it down. Awesome book, a must read.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|This is one of my favorite anime movies. It's about race cars. Honestly, I thought it was completely weird before watching it. It reminded me of Speed Racer.<br /><br />After watching it, I have only but good things to say. The plot was fast, quick, and really simple. The characters were vibrant, and the animation was absolutely amazing.<br /><br />If you like anime, watch this one! It's a work of art!<br /><br />Also, just beware of the random topless scene halfway through the movie. Doesn't last long, but the scene can be uncomfortable.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|CGI, increased framerate, cheesy lines and story embelishments.<br /><br />Jackson should have stuck to the formula from LOTR. I was very underwhelmed.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun game and the graphics will be wat better than you think. A nice 3d effect. :) Old school meets new school.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a fun game and is interesting.  Fun for all ages. Me and the grandkids think it is an awesome game.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|At first I thought it was awesome and then I discovered that the characters I had bought her for were gone my money was gone the only thing I had left was my high score
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept a good pace.  It also kept me guessing, and twisted when I thought it would turn.  Highly recommended.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|First off, I'd like to mention that Target has the same CD for $9.99 and includes TWO BONUS SONGS.  Dress On and Body Count are included in this \\"Deluxe Edition\\".  The artwork is different on the CD cover as well.  I think it's worth buying it at Target for the extra songs.  The packages say this is only available for a limited time.<br /><br />I think Justin Timberlake is an amazing artist.  After waiting 7 years, the wait was worth it.  In my opinion some of the songs get better the more you listen to them.  He did an amazing job on this CD.  He changes the genre up throughout the CD from R&B to Hip-Hop to Pop.  I listened to the album most of the day it was released.  I also love the length of the songs and how the song changes as it goes.  It feels like a different experience than your usual music.  It has a lot of depth and sophistication to it.  Everyone has their own opinion and likes so I suggest trying them out on something like Spotify and listening to them a couple of times to see if you will like it, I think you will.<br /><br />My personal favorites are Mirrors, Spaceship Coupe, and That Girl.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I had the BU-353 previous version, and can tell you this one locks on faster and can track alot better. It was worth the upgrade for my carputer.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|loved it. me and the fiance just rented it on a whim, and could not have been happier. may buy it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|i only have this two days and i've watched it 2 times....what fun it is to be back in middle earth. now i'll have to go back and watch the lord of the rings set again..........peter jackson and to all the people who worked on this just WOW!..........can't wait till Dec. for part 2.
0316017922|5.0|I am on a big-time Gladwell kick right now. I use this book as a non-fcition text with my high school students. I love his detailed narratives mixed with carefully explained data. He does a great job of explaining complicated points and then thoroughly supporting them. This is a great way to show students how to support  the ideas in their writing.<br /><br />He also has me viewing the road to success differently, which is his point. I love it!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake can do no wrong! His voice is heaven sent. I am loving every song on this album. It gets progressively better track by track..Very mellow and relaxing vibe to this album and has a smooth sound that music has been missing. I have no problem with him extending the tracks - just gives us more to love... Buy this album! It does not disappoint if u are a true JT fan and appreciate him for his talent, creativity and originality!!!! Also props to him for sticking with musical genius Timbaland as his producer. Well done JT! Looking forward and patiently waiting for Part 2 of the 20/20 Experience...
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I thought it was okay.  I guess, I was expecting more.  Maybe I need to see the movie to appreciate it more.
1401307450|5.0|If you enjoy reading biographies and like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you should get this book, you will love it. Great read
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love this book. I was a little dissappointed by the ending but it was still very good & unsuspecting. I am about to start readnig another Gillian Flynn, she is a fantastic author.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I just found this a bit too full on, and not the usual stories I read, I purchased this after all the hype in the bookstores.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|After seeing the Lord of The Rings Trilogy in all its glory, I was not expecting any less from Peter Jackson for the Hobbit.  I was a bit aprehensive about how it would come across in 3-D (some 3-D movies are great, but some really fall short of being successful).  This movie was phemomenal! It is the best 3-D movie I have ever seen, and the action is non-stop from beginning to end. Special effects have gone far beyond LOTR in this film and I am really anticipating what they do to Smaug. It has to be the most fantastic dragon ever created.<br /><br />I first read the Hobbit and  the Lord of The Rings trilogy back in the sixties, and still own the original paperbacks, as well as some very nice hardbound collector sets. I never expect any movie to be just like the book. It would be impossible. As a serious LOTR fan, I was very pleased with the LOTR trilogy on film, and I am equally happy with the way the first segment of the Hobbit was translated to the screen. It is just so exciting seeing so many of the characters I read about come to life. And the best part of owning a movie like this is being able to watch it as frequently as I wish.<br /><br />I have been waiting patiently for the release of this movie in Blu Ray 3-D.  I have invested a great deal in a big screen 3-D TV and home theater system and even though there aren't many truely great 3-D movies available yet; this one has moved to the top of the list! It is an outstanding film and I can hardly wait for the extended version to be released. I don't mind investing in both the theatrical version and the extended version. I am a LOTR collector and have every version of the trilogy that was made. I will most likely do the same with the Hobbit trilogy.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|when is the next book due to for release?<br /><br />I can't wait to see where these characters end up and what the final outcome is for everyone in the story itself.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very nice blast to the past! Nice combo of space invaders and asteroids. The graphics are fun too. Enjoy it quite a bit!
B007TK77QE|4.0|This was an easy book to read and felt like you were part of the village and the characters lives.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great for adults and kids-great humor and AMAZING graphics.  My son is OBSESSED!!  We can't wait for Rio 2 to come out.  Great film for the entire family-a must have!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I hardly ever write reviews but I just have to warn people about this, please don't ignore the bad reviews like I did!! PLEASE save your money and DO NOT buy this case! Mine developed a crack in the clasp that goes over the charging port after a little over a month and not long after snapped off completely, rendering it not waterproof any more, which was the primary reason I bought the case. I did not drop it from a distance, it just happened from normal wear and tear which is unacceptable. Amazon don't refund after 30 days which is ridiculous. Trying to contact Lifeproof directly is a nightmare, I've not received a reply to my emails and I am permanently on hold when I try to call their '24/7' customer services. I am still trying to sort this out. I only have another 30 days until the 90 day warranty runs out. There is an option to extend it to 360 days but you have to fill out some long winded survey and it kept saying the serial numbers were wrong.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />HORRIBLE quality case. HORRIBLE customer service. BUYER BEWARE!!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|What more can I say ?  Good album, great for the gym.. My fav being Professional Griefers! I got the MP3 Album but it's available with AutoRip (Meaning you buy the CD and you get the MP3 download too)
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find amazing links and picture to just about anything you take interest in. The app allows you to create your own  boards which you can add pics, links, and commentary about your board. I think it's a great app for inspiration.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is a preorder so I can only say that i hope it will arrive in the time frame presented at time of purchase.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is certainly addictive. I love how in every level there are five waves. the 3~D retro graphics are the best I've seen yet. if only there was a six star rating...
0316228532|4.0|I am quite mystified about the venom of reviewers on this book. I put off reading this book because of it (and the price was a little steep but is now quite reasonable on Kindle). This is a well written novel about life in a small English town. It discusses the power of secrets- the tolls it takes to keep them and what happens when they are revealed. It's really good. The only complaint I have is the cast of characters is large and it was hard at first to keep them straight.<br /><br />  Why is everyone upset? Well, it's not Harry Potter but it never pretends it is. It's an author trying to stretch herself and open new doors. I think Rowling has done her time with Potter and now wants to do something different. Good for her. Who wants to do the same thing over and over? I think this book would have received a warmer welcome if people kept an open mind and didn't have preconceived ideas.<br /><br />  I found it quite moving and dealt with some real social problems. I was glad I read it but I'm also glad I didn't pay the high price it had at first. Now is the perfect time to dabble in a new offering by a gifted writer.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse is awesome it works well with all games and is good with the switchable DPI I love it thank you so much Anker and Amazon
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|This movie was hard to pay attention to.  So much so, that I paused it many times to do things around the house and came back to it.  It has a good story line.  I think the audience is intended to be younger (I am 27).
B006DHASYM|5.0|Super cute chick flick that is funny enough guys will love it!! Ana ferris and Chris Evans are so funny and super cute!
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This book fills all the knowledge gaps in knowing how to eat healthhy.  A best source of healthy eating information.
B008VBYN80|4.0|you build your kingdom and then fight then you collect spoils from war and then make stuff its sort of like age of empires but its not id say just if your into those games du it bro just do it
B004NBYRYC|4.0|i now have the complete harry potter collection and i think this one is much better as far as it being a region 2 one i think it also has better special features.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is my favority series on TV.  The people in this series rocks...NCIS is the best of all in this planet
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I seriously don't get it.  I feel like I am the only person on the planet that hasn't become incredibly attached to this book.  I can't put my finger on what turned me off to this story (although I know it definitely wasn't everyone's favorite tattooed scholar/underground collegiate fighter, because weirdly, I was into that).  Maybe it's the fact that these characters are college freshman.  I'm definitely not an ageist (I'm only 30, and I can definitely remember college), but there is definitely something almost irritating about these co-eds making very adult decisions.  How did Shep have time to pledge a fraternity, get a serious girlfriend, and manage his cousin's extracurricular Fight Club activities within the first few weeks of school?<br /><br />I wanted this book to be so many things that it just wasn't.  I wanted a story I could get behind, a story that made sense, and a story with realistic characters who do realistic things.  I feel cheated that all I ended up with was a few hundred pages about uniquely named college freshmen who, at the end of the day, led really ridiculous lives that smacked of white trash stereotypes (seriously, you guys, Abby's dad is a gambling addict, her mom's an alcoholic, and the only real description of the Maddox household full of card-playing lost boys is how dirty the shower is-- and those are only minor anecdotes to the overarching themes of violence, codependency, and illegal campus gambling).  I don't know.  I guess I'm just sort of mad that this book got such rave reviews, when there's a lot of other stuff out there that is just so much more realistic and interesting.
0143118706|1.0|The one good thing about Elisabeth Gilbert is on the subway; you know exactly who to not speak to, even if you are attracted to them and you caught them smiling the kind of headphoned 'I'm conjuring a Missed Connection as we lock eyes!' smile, if they're reading one of these books. It is hard to talk to people you are attracted to who are showing interest on the subway. Best to have a business card. Just hand it to them and walk away. This actually works.<br /><br />Also, I had no idea that Mr. Gilbert was a hooker. First J.K. Rowling in her car writing wizard stories on tampons, now this. I'm going to take my manuscripts to the streets of the Tenderloin, SF, and start prostituting myself. Breathe life into our O so beloved memoir. We need a male hooker memoir which results in yours truly climbing to the top of the food chain, becoming a business mogul with a mean haircut, marry a man, endorse Obama, etc. My God the book's writing itself!<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Gilbert!<br /><br />Your secret admirer,<br /><br />Yyle T.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The second book of the Beautiful Creatures line was awesome, I am buying the 3rd as soon as I get done typing this! Definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys super-natural love mystery stories!
0345803485|1.0|Next door in the still nothing country suburb of a wasteland state resides regular row ranch & low lands and plaza, middle-aged pillhead sky pilot sexually attracted to her mailbox, men mopping speedboats in stained underwear, skateboarders with pieces of silver stuck to their hawklike faces, a korean methodist church and an unknown temple close to the bowling alley, which core's summit sits down the moss-strewn brick wall, and a lonely married woman.<br /><br />She is married but her husband hates her. He is addicted to cocaine and freely admits they should never have had their son, who is now two. If she goes out she takes the kid with her, to the store, hiking, to the mall, wherever it is these people go; the father wants nothing to do with them. He only waves to anyone outside in the Spring when he is blacked out. She lives with this as her family is rotten to the core, extended and immediate, and she has nowhere to go. She thought the child would be a miracle, her escape. Instead it is her anchor. Let us call her Madame Valerie.<br /><br />Between books she made feeble passes at her neighbor's son, visiting from the city, ten years younger than her. He was kind of into it. He liked to let the people left whom considered reading something 'They Do' expound on specifics. No need to ask. No need to know. But it was midnight and Madame had been talking about approximately nothing, nervously, for an hour. He asked her what she read. She said you will not believe this. He believed he knew what she would say next and she said.<br /><br />She lent the traveling man the book. He felt very sorry for its readers and its popularity. Not just because it seemed a pathetic attempt at saying, 'Not everyone watches porn online! No! We still make it literary!' - but also because of the degenerative quality at reading this kind of thing, written in urine by blindfolded slave, swallowed by the desperate beside electronic fireplaces, like mediocre white wine.<br /><br />He pretended to read the book, taking his time. When he visited he gave her updates and passages he'd highlighted. This eventually led into an intense, albeit brief, physical affair, which destroyed her marriage. She insisted he keep the book. he did, eventually selling it to a used bookstore for a quarter and putting it toward a Nerve City button in the junk store.<br /><br />She is still there in the suburban vortex reading this book and others like it. She cannot fathom otherwise. She will dream away life, and justify the manufactured dream's reality until she is old and then dead. She might be lucky for this. It is a matter of fantasy unknowing. A matter of futility.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1VTVHDMOWQ1WC]]I like this game because there is a lot to do and very additing game very fun game I really like it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 2 is great because there is alot of new area and powers that is why temple run 2
B009KEN87O|5.0|So many great reviews for game, well that's because this is a great game!  How could space invaders be turned into a great game?  That's a good question, try it out for yourself, like I did, and you'll see for yourself.
630469654X|4.0|enjoyed the movie  comic kid was good too.  got the movie for my great granddaughter to start her a collection
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Couldn't stop watching this one. Watching the Joker going postal at the amusement park almost seemed surreal with all the shootings we see today. I read this comic a long time ago and it is one of the best. The move doesn't dissapoint. Check it out and you'll know what I'm saying.
0143117009|4.0|I have a brief knowledge about ancient civilizations and their cultural traditions. I learned about societies like the Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas in my Spanish class in high school. This book made me think of how those societies failed or succeeded and not just what I was taught in Spanish class about how their cultural traditions still live on today. I thought the book was basically divided in to two parts and not really four parts. The first part of the book talks about how a society is faced with a decision which could either lead to a long term success or a destruction caused by their failure. In this part he talks about societies like the Maya, the Norse and even Polynesian. In the second part of the book he basically uses the five point framework and applies it to modern societies. As well he talks about the affects of business and globalization.<br /><br />The overall style and content of the book were good and I found it to be a good read. The only thing I didn't like was that it's pretty long and you have to find the time to read the book. I found reading about the Mayans and the Polynesians societies interesting. I liked seeing how each society responded to the problem they had. As well I find it more interesting and I like seeing how some societies fail by the decision they made. I like learning from mistakes and that's why I found it more interesting seeing how societies failed and collapsed. I would have to say that some of the things I learned from this book are the differences in many of the societies and how they were each affected by different factors some being environmental, neighbor relations, or even over population. I also learned about how their decisions and how they either helped them or hurt them dearly.<br /><br />I would recommend this book and it maybe long but it's a good read and I found it interest how the five factors affected each society. I also would recommend this book because I found it interesting how a single decision could decide whether a society would fail or succeed. As well as an interesting read, Jared Diamond does a good job with the writing in the book and people could learn a lot from it. All in all I would say that this book is worth reading.
B001QJUX24|5.0|one of the Duke's best performances. not his usual swaggering character, but a thoughtful, thought provoking performance. one of my all time favorite john wayne flicks! so glad that amazon had it in stock!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is really fun and great for the five year old I babysit. He loves the black horse!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicted to this game and I am sure you'll lovwe it too!!!<br />It is so much fun!! Hope ya'll enjoy it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|For a person who has read the Harry Potter,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,and a few books in the Heros of Olyimpus series you have high expectations in a book or series and The Sorcerers Ring reaches all of them.
0062238868|5.0|This book opened my eyes to what some of our brave young men face on a daily basis while protecting our freedoms.<br /><br />Once I began reading the book, it was nearly impossible to put down.  This is not a Hollywood version of war...it's the real deal, written by a young man who served 4 tours on the front lines of genuine battlefield conditions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Soar
B005I6EVUG|3.0|The Verso Artist Series Case Cover for the Kindle Fire is made of vibrant red leather embossed with the names of various cities of the world.  It is a very lovely case, sleek and sophisticated.  However, it is sorta like a super model: pretty to look at but not very functional.  I wish it has a fold out flap so I could prop my Kindle up while reading or watching programs.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I am very happy with the performance levels of Sony's Ultra Lightweight Headphones.  They are lightweight, get the job done well, and the quality of the sound is great too.  For the price, can't ask for much better!<br /><br />Soar
B003XVYLDU|2.0|This book is interesting in the sense of letting the author take you on a journey of which you will have no sense of direction. I was bored with the idea about a fifth of the way through. It's entertaining, however the concept is not my cup of tea.
B000ZNQEMU|5.0|My three son's loved lego's and these key chains are fun to have as a reminder now that they are driving and not building like they used to.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|It was entertaining, time well spent but I expected more of thriller and less &#34;phone home&#34;.  My wife would not watch what we expected to be a horror movie...too bad she would have enjoyed it.
0062238868|5.0|I throughly enjoyed the book and was able to relate. It was funny and sad. I was able to visualize what was happening because it was explained well.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Among Cumberbatch, Rathbone, Brett, and RDJ varieties, I cannot pinpoint who evokes the canon writings' Sherlock the most, but this CBS variant with Jonny Lee Miller drags the detective into a murky gutter but portrays those attributes very well.<br /><br />Homage to the canon isn't rigorous to individual stories, and I am glad.  The show is meaning something else, yet the relationships between Holmes and Watson and Holmes' skills are  honored well.<br /><br />Watson by Lucy Liu also brings out the attributes of canon that matter to make a doting, dutiful, not to mention independent person that is strongly and strangely attached to the steel trap.<br /><br />The only drawback to bear in mind if you want canon is this: you're watching a CBS drama.  The show has semi-soap-opera-y emotions brought out that I think can be tied to other dramas made by CBS.  Still, even its contemporary music exits don't ruin the show as a faithful installment of Doyle's characters and plots.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story about honor, integrity, camaraderie on both sides of the war. Scary to relive that part of history and to think the German Air Force held themselves to a higher standard than the ruling parties is incredible. Highly recommend this book to all readers not just history buffs.
0713151382|5.0|More than anything I like the way the book fits into my hands. The story is an old one, as is the book. I was delighted to see it was from the London University.It is small and fits into my hand perfectly
B004GJDQT8|5.0|It's nice to be able to shop on the go and to check my packages. really do in joy it. thanks
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first book was brutal, but gripping. The second was almost chapter for chapter a simple clone of the first, and therefore dissatisfying but I had a hope the third wpuld save the series. It doesn't. Katniss turns into a self obsessed little snot who is impossible to symathise with, while you the reader are screaming at her to get a grip and turn into that heroine that all expect her to be. Spoiler alert: she doesn't.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Great set. My only wish is that there had been a Blue Ray/DVD option so we could have both types of disks for our different players.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Follett was clearly trying to channel Somerset Maugham with this doorstopper, but while he filled it with the requisite upperclass twits and working class babymakers, liberal dashings of longing glances and pacifist angst, this book ended in my basement and unlike Razors Edge, will never be read again.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is my 6 yr old daughters favorite movie to date.  I thought for sure I wouldn't like it considering the lineup of actors (voices), some of which I do not care for.  I was wrong.  Fantastic.
030746363X|5.0|This book is fun to read and there's a lot more included than just tips on building a 4 Hour Body
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|My whole family lives this movie!  I love the darker kid movies like this one, Corpse Bride, Coraline, etc.  Frankenweenie has a great story line and is hilarious!
0439023513|5.0|I still wanted more.  Is she going to continue with this series or has she written anything else? I hope so
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I find the story line thought out and personally like this type os SI-Fi sop opera (poor choice of words?)
043902353X|4.0|I have read all 3 of these books. I could tell these were written for the younger crowd but it was a good read for the older crowd as well.
0553801473|5.0|As with the previous books, this is a great read.  There's only one problem...what to read until Martin's next installment.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Easy way to kill a couple of hours.  It wasn't one I would watch again and again but it was an okay movie.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a really great app! I love how it lets you communicate with friends and how it really makes you think! I've always loved drawing and now I get to play a game about it!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This movie has some very funny moments.  All in all it is a cute movie but not as funny as it was hyped to be at the time.  Not one to own but worth $5.00 to download.
B000099T2L|5.0|this albumb was great had eight great radio songs and the others well very good as well. would recommend to true beyonce fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting I just downloaded this game today and I have not stopped playing.  This is the most perfect game and its so awesome you just want to unlock everything. I just cant get off this game. You should download this game you will not be sorry.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gives you great insight into all of your relationships as well as yourself.<br />Very informative.<br />This guy truly understands relationships.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a great cd for listening to anytime. It has all his big hits and if you are a Stevie Wonder fan, you'll love this cd
B006M4F67A|3.0|Love the screen. It is bright and very visible. But, would like to know how many moves are left and would like to be able to start a game over when there are no more moves. These features would make this a five star game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the beginning you can help but to be drawn into the story. The author writes in such a way that you feel that you are living among the pages of the novel. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a great heart tugging book.  The entire series is highly recommended.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I really like the xx and I was angry when I couldn't see them when they came to town.<br /><br />Album is all around great and I can't wait for more!
B00006878K|5.0|As SRV's mentor, its no wonder Stevie Ray was so hot.  Albert is an American original that gives our Blues the sound so many want to copy, and effected rock and roll.  There are a lot of good / great guitar players out there, but Albert and other American artists have both skill and soul.  Playing is one thing, making a song/story work is another matter all together.  Albert is a master.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great match game with a story to move along with. Love this one. Playing on Nexus, and have not had any issues.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It was a great movie even for adults. My kids range from 4 to eleven and they both enjoyed it.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Overall, I quite liked the second season. It followed A Clash of Kings reasonably well and, like the first season, was overall well put together. However, I have a major complaint with it: very important characters were left out entirely, for example Meera and Jojen Reed, who are vital to Bran's subplot. &#34;Arstan Whitebeard&#34; and Strong Belwas should have been introduced to Daenerys' portion of the plot as well. The latter two will probably be introduced early in season three, but the Reeds may be somewhat more difficult, due to where the Neck is compared to where Winterfell is.<br />Another part of my complaint is essentially a part of the same. The destruction of Winterfell was, in the book series, the work of Ramsay Snow, which was immediately shown. I can understand trying to keep him under wraps for those who haven't read the books, to help keep one event of the third part a surprise, but it was some good characterization for the new character, and a solid introduction. I suspect that he will turn out to be the one who did it in later seasons, rather than the implication that it was Greyjoy's men, but this still annoys me.<br />In short, it's still good, it just has some flaws, which are far from ruining it.
1476719071|4.0|My Initial Thoughts:<br />I honestly didn't have any real thoughts on this book before I read it. I hadn't heard to many people talk about it, but the few I did said it was great. I was a little worried because it was a contemporary read and it was over 400 pages. I thought I might have a hard time finishing it or that it would take me a long time because I wouldn't feel the urge to pick it up.<br />My Review:<br />Well I have to say I didn't have to worry about not feeling the urge to pick this book because I didn't really put it down. Yup, read this book in a day. I don't think I have ever read a book this long in a day. I have to say I really enjoyed this story. I ended up knocking a star off, which I will explain later.<br />I believe this book fits quite nicely into the \\"New Adult\\" category. This book involves older teenagers, the main character is 18/19. There are adult things in this book though. They have multiple fake ID's and you get to read about drinking, gambling, and sex.<br />I think the synopsis is a little misleading. It says right off the bat that Abby Abernathy is a good girl and she doesn't drink or cuss. I honestly can't remember if she cussed or not because cussing doesn't bother me so I tend to not even pay attention to it. However, she drank quite a bit! I never saw her turn down a drink.<br />Abby Abernathy is the main character. She is an 18 year old freshman at Eastern University. Her best friend American, I will get to her in a minute, comes with her to school so she can help Abby start over. Abby is strange. I was torn on whether I liked her or not. She couldn't make up her mind when it came to Travis and Parker. She was always worried about what other people were thinking about her. She made some decisions that sort of made me want to yell at her.<br />Travis is the main man in this book and man if I went solely on looks then he would be my guy. HOWEVER! He reminded me of the infamous CHRISTIAN GREY! Please tell me I am not the only onethat thought this! He only slept around with girls and was totally against a relationship then all of a sudden he meets this one girl on accident and completely changes his outlook and is totally in love. He is also extremely controlling! He doesn't want another guy to talk to Abby, let alone look at her. He has a tendency to fly off the handle and completely over reacts when Abby leaves. (CHRISTIAN GREY ANYONE?!) Their relationship definitely leans towards the \\"disaster\\" part of the title.<br />The other characters in the book are Park, the preppy guy that Abby thinks she wants to be with; America, her best friend that tends to overreact on her boyfriend but is otherwise ok; and Shepley, America's boyfriend, who is probably the most level headed average character in the book. I think I might have even liked him the best.<br />Now because the relationship in this book is pretty much just a disaster and there is no real beautiful to it, some people are giving this a horrible rating. However, I liked the story. A story is supposed to cause a reaction from you and I believe that's what this book did. I hate boring contemporary stories that follow someone's average everyday life. My life is like that so I don't really feel the need to read about it. I like it when contemporary books have that extra something that makes me want to continue the story. It's not like the author wrote about something that would never happen. Relationships like this happen all the time, all over the world. I don't think that should cause a book to get a bad rating. There are certain parts of this book that I found a little unbelievable (as in I really don't think it would happen) but they would all involve spoilers. Those are the couple parts that I knocked a star off for. (And a little because I was reminded so much of Christian Grey).<br />Do I Recommend this Book/Series?<br />Yes I recommend reading this book. I hate comparing this book to Fifty Shades because it is definitely not all about sex but he just reminds me so much of Christian Grey's character! So I say everyone should read this but if you think you would have liked Fifty Shades without all the sex then I think you would really like this book.<br />Will I Read the Next Book?<br />Absolutely! The next book is supposed to be from Travis's point of view and I can't wait to get my hands on it.
1601251831|5.0|The art and general feel of the book are amazing. Just flipping through the book will give you amazing ideas for encounters. The monsters are well balanced and all stats are clear and well put together.<br />A must-have for every Pathfinder-campaign!
B001OSIV62|5.0|The style of the story presentation is very interesting and keeps you watching. I think it is very well executed.

1853268968|5.0|Thank you, Conan Doyle (1859-1930). Since the age of 13, about 55 years ago, I have read and reread your Sherlock Holmes stories four or more times. They took me into a world of adventure, of reasoning, of loyalty to values, of thriving on a central purpose in life. And thank you to Wordsworth Editions Limited, the publisher of a handsome complete collection of the stories, plus the original _Strand Magazine_ illustrations. I hope to reread the complete set at least one more time before my life comes to an end.<br /><br />What I love most about this volume is its dignity. It presents Sherlock Holmes, in words and illustrations, with respect.<br /><br />I recently completed a rereading, using this single volume hard-bound edition with its relatively large pages. I read one short story every few days. (I skipped over the non-Holmes parts of the longest two stories.) For those two months or so, I was immersed in a value-charged world, a world of adventure.<br /><br />As an author of intellectual adventure stories from the history of philosophy (_The Power and the Glory: The Key Ideas and Crusading Lives of Eight Debaters of Reason vs. Faith_ at http://www.amazon.com/Power-Glory-Crusading-Debaters-Reason/dp/1439266581), I admire Conan Doyle's storytelling skills. I am grateful to the publishers of this edition for their dignified approach.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like a little more variety with my games and different pictures on the tiles. Fun though and glad its free.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book .. good twist at the end. So many life lessons all in one piece. I will definitely recommend
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great Acting - very interesting not straight forward issues - seems more real than what is usually in a movie
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Kept right up there with book #1. The maze runner was awesome and the scorch trials holds its own and leaves you hanging and wanting more.... can't wait to start book 3
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the second season!! Beautiful costumes, fun acting, somehow a joy to watch!! and then talk about with your friends :-)
B004N6369Y|5.0|During my hour long ride to and from my chemo infusions it keeps me occupied.  Then during the 4 hours of chemo I put my headphones on and am able to be transported to the a world completely different than the one I'm living.  I'm right there in the hotel living the life of the father and daughter. The descriptions are amazing.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Like a lot of people over the age of forty, I have boxes of old slides and negatives that I can no longer view.  The snapshots printed from the negatives have often degraded or been damaged in some way so that the best versions are locked up in a relative inaccessible format.  This DB-Tech \\"scanner\\" is a relatively painless way to convert the old formats into digital files that can then be cleaned up, if desired, with post-photography software.<br /><br />The process is quick, although not entirely intuitive.  For slides that are mounted in holders, you pop them directly in the top slot, press a series of buttons, and the images are captured by an interior camera to an SD/SDHC card (not included.)  For strips of negatives or single frames, the process is a bit more cumbersome because you must use one of the included frames and insert it in the slide slot.  I had some issues feeding negatives into the machine because I couldn't get the inserted frame and the strip to line up properly.  A little jiggling and adjusting got it right.  Once I got the hang of it, things went much faster.<br /><br />Because the machine uses a camera, it takes mere seconds to \\"scan\\" and save each image.  I whipped through four rolls of negatives and a box of slides in about twenty minutes.  Scanning individual photographs take a lot longer.  Yeah, the images aren't great when compared to the digital photography I'm now used to, but at least I have those images saved on my computer.  Color film in particular degrades, although the scanned negatives have better color than their printed counterparts.  Still, many just look old.  (And they are!)<br /><br />The scanner is small and lightweight.  4.5\\" x 3.5\\" x 2.5 \\" / 7 ounces.  It has a pop-up screen for viewing images, an especially handy feature when you're feeding strips of negatives through.  I love that it's so small because I can easily toss it in a drawer until I'm ready to do the next set of scans.  My only complaint is that the power cord is too short.  Note:  I received a sample from the manufacturer for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannrd is too short.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Don't pass this one up...its totally absorbing and entertaining. See what everyone is talking about. A glimpse in to a bygone era.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|The 3D looked fantastic on my Panasonic plasma.  But, I found the movie to be very disapointing.  Everyone behaves stupidly.  There are a lot of recyled situations from the other Alien movies without much originality.  The basic underlying plot makes no sense.  The ending is terrible.  It was better than Alien 4, but not as good as Alien 3.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I have recommended this to many folks and also bought a separate one for my son.  Everyone that uses it for the first time purchases right after :).  It is physically comfortable to use with very little fatigue over longer gaming sessions.<br /><br />The ease of mapping allows me to use the same/similar mappings for just about any games I play.  This allows me to transition between games quickly and not have to learn new key positions (with exception of games with specialized key combos).<br /><br />The user selectable LED color backlight is a nice touch.  I currently have it configured to match the color of my G105 MW3 keyboards green backlighting.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is AMAZING! It is your clsssic space invaders with AMAZING 3D graphics. When you are invincible, they are even more unbelievable! Fun and overall amazing! Get it!
B0017HEX76|2.0|My Fantasia 2000 was damaged and I was hoping/expecting to replace it with a duplicate.  This dvd has eight of the original sixteen pieces on it.  I was very disappointed. Would have returned it but had already unwrapped it.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|\\"In 1968 ... the Beach Boys released Friends, an album so laid back, some thought it asleep. ...'Friends' is a wholly likable record that has aged remarkably well; the seed of its amiability, however, is that it had nothing to do with ambition. Life is good, and music is a comfort.\\" ([[ASIN:0385196504 The Beach Boys Silver Anniversary]], 178, 184)<br /><br />So what to make of this album? It deserves three stars, at least, for merely having been recorded. After the band fissured with the death of Carl Wilson, I had mentally written then off. The went not the way of the dodo, but the Turtles--a band in name only, touring with token original members, and buying re-re-repackages of their golden oldies.<br /><br />And that is what Mike and Bruce have done with the name, taking the six-part harmonies and reducing them to a duet. Al has his solo album out, [[ASIN:B005HWUB4Q A Postcard From California]]. And Brian, of course, has been wildly successful on his own.<br /><br />Did the \\"troubled genius\\" need elbow room and breathing space. Apparently, yes. His 1988 solo album was great, and I still hum songs from \\"[[ASIN:B000007NCL Imagination]],\\" a nod to his rivalry with the Beatles. He did not need this for his career, by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />So was this album necessary? I can't say.<br /><br />But it clearly shows two things. One, the Beach Boys can still make music--though I need to qualify this. Second, there is a demand for new Beach Boys material--if you can image that!<br /><br />Why? The lads from Hawthorn have done something incredible. They have been able to celebrate frivolity, good-clean-summer-fun, the California Myth (to coin a term). Yet at the same time they have a distinctive spirituality.<br /><br />Think of \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"He Come Down,\\" \\"All This is That,\\" \\"Everyone's In Love With You,\\" their a capella Lord's Prayer, two Christmas Albums (three, if you throw in Wilson's 2005 solo). And the liner notes of [[ASIN:B009CQHYQ6 L.A. (Light Album) (2000 - Remaster)]] explain \\"The word `light,' refers to the awareness of, and the presence of God, here in this world as an ongoing, loving reality.\\" Of course, this is not gospel; that's Elvis. But it is religiosity.<br /><br />Track 2 sums up this dichotomy: God and the radio. The spiritual and the carnal.<br /><br />This is a common false dichotomy. British religious leader John Taylor said, \\"Why, there are some people who think that the fiddle, for instance, is an instrument of the devil and it is quite wrong to use it. I do not think so, I think it is a splendid thing to dance by. But some folks think that we should not dance. Yes, we should enjoy life in any way we can.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />The Beach Boy's Endless Summer is a reminder of Eden, and a foretaste of a celestial glory. And thank you for reminding us of that.<br /><br />Earlier I said that I needed to qualify the statement that the Beach Boys can still make music. I like the album, but there is no ear-grabber, aside from the title track. Like the Beatles with \\"Let It Be,\\" or U2's \\"No Line On The Horizon,\\" bands produce an album because there is a demand for product, or because they are a band, and that is what band's do.<br /><br />I feel the same way about this album. Like on \\"[[ASIN:B009B504S8 Wild Honey (2001 - Remaster)]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000002TRD 20/20]],\\" some of the tracks are good, but undeveloped. \\"Beaches in Mind\\" is really just a chorus, though it blends in well to the next track \\"Strange World.\\"<br /><br />This may be a clue. \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B005ZWPR06 The Smile Sessions]]\\" were composed in snippets that where spliced together. The album sounds like that. The individual songs are passable, and charming, but not great alone. Yet overall, that is where the magic occurs.<br /><br />Bullet thoughts.<br /><br />* Think About The Days is a nice a capella tone poem, like \\"Our Prayer,\\" or \\"One For The Boys.\\"<br /><br />* \\"The Private Life Of Bill And Sue\\" is Wilson's answer  Jacko's \\"Leave Me Alone.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Beaches on Mind\\" could have used a guitar riff. Marks is back in the group--use him!<br /><br />* There are two plagues of the Beach Boy's recent albums. One the invitation to nostalgia, which they have been doing since \\"Do It Again.\\" The second is the frozen abstraction of early 1960s teenage life. No one uses radios nowadays--it's all internet and SirusXM, and I don't \\"still cruise\\" \\"In My Car,\\" due to gas prices and pollution. It seems like we are still fighting the Pet Sounds battle and which way the group should go.<br /><br />* \\"Summer's Gone\\" is a good bookend to \\"Till I Die.\\"<br /><br />So fans, like myself, will cherish this album. Sadly, the 50th Anniversary Tour did not end well, and this may be the last gasp of a drowning group.<br /><br />I hope not.ilson's answer  Jacko's \\"Leave Me Alone.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Beaches on Mind\\" could have used a guitar riff.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|not his best, but I am a big fan and needed it. You can beat Bruce.I love it although I prefer others
B006ZB65H0|5.0|Got the wrong size of this wonderful shoe. They run a little tight so 10.5 seems good for me while jogging shoes go half sixe smaller for me. Very quick reply from supplier and return promptly acknowledged.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|Nice to hear these tunes again. Although I really liked it, I think I liked the original better. It was still good to get all these songs on one CD.
B004GYY714|5.0|I work in a building that has no radio reception and stations & streaming are blocked by a firewall.  We've been in this building for 8 years without radio access.  Recently we were given access to wi-fi.  It's great to actually listen to local stations for a variety of music and news updates.
0345803485|2.0|Writing was terrible and the sex got tiresome. Everyone kept telling me the story was so great but-really-don't they every read good books?
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Great game!  Would like option to play alone while waiting for \\"buddies\\" to return to the game.  Hate that you constantly have to refresh when playing on the PC to see if opponent has taken their turn.
B005K17RU0|1.0|after the last update this has become nothing but a battery discharger. the forecasts are off, the current weather looks like it was drawn by a kindergarten class. this is being uninstalled immediatly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so much fun its like you have your own pet horse to take care of and do competions.

B005K17RU0|1.0|if I can't go back to the old version- I will most certainty remove the app and use someone else.It looks cheap and tiny compared to the original which worked perfectly and looked very nice; bright and clear.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Good for the whole family. You can have different profiles so everyone has their own game. It's fun for all ages. Lots of levels.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I like it cool world but Morgan needs to finish it. Liked it so well had to go right into 2nd & 3rd book. You need to read it!!!!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game and interesting variations.  you will enjoy this game. You can play so many ways and share it with your family during game night.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This cd is amazing. There is not to much &#34;good&#34; rap out there these days, but, Macklemore definitely is fun, easy to listen to and his songs are really thought inducing
B0063IH60K|1.0|I barely opened the app before a video started playing. I wanted an app for a card game. I can ignore the advertisements around the border but I do not think it is appropriate to have my screen suddenly bombarded with hair and toilet paper commercials. I will choose another app for my gaming enjoyment. Unless commercials are your thing, my recommendation is that others do the same.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game that wastes time when you need it. The only problem is it takes time to get money, but it's definitely worth it. Definitely get this game. But don't make this your only game. Haha.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great movie brilliant Densel at his best,<br />Good story line with a great twist many viewers may relate to subject matter.<br />Good buy.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I was ready to give this game a 5 star review when I first downloaded it on my Kindle. Good graphics, nice story line, from one of my favorite books and authors.<br />But after finally getting stuck in India trying to get past a level , I realized it could only be passed by dumb luck, it's time to let it go.<br />I usually enjoy games like these but when they become an unsatisfying time waster, it's time to uninstall...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching DA last month.  Almost caught up, can't wait for Season 4.  Love the Crawleys and the staff, except for the haters!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this every day. I love that I can pause live streaming radio, and record. I love that it also plays podcasts of the shows I missed. I love the favorites presets. I love the 'related' feature. I love that I can set it to play the last station on start up. I love that it pauses during phone calls and resumes when done.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a wonderful and beautifully acted BBC serial.  I love the characters some of the same actors as in Downton Abbey.  See it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this is the a great clock for travel. and desk top thanks. it will get plenty of use on trips and vacations.
0345803485|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, it was great! Had me hanging on each chapter, i just couldn't put it down, i loved it!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I remember reading this book a long time ago; either late elementary school or early middle school.  A few friends and I stumbled upon it while discussing books one night, so I found it for kindle and bought it.  It is a great read, albeit a simple one.  It has enough layers in the character development and themes to keep older readers engaged, yet simple enough for kids.  It was very enjoyable to read again.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Good read. Ash takes a simple concept and provides a practical application to the process for running leaner. Read this book
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|From reading the notices from Amazon about updates for my Kindle Fire, I ordered this cable.  Once I get it I discover that my version of Kindle does not need updates.  I wish I had been informed of this prior to ordering.
630587493X|5.0|I had been looking for this movie and been unable to find it. I found it on here and the price was great. Movies on here are a great deal and arrive quickly
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Like the book by Marti Leimbach, Dying Young, this is a similar premise.  However, the setting outside London, the circumstances of the care giver and patient and the stark contrast of their lives, made this a good read.  I was surprised that I found myself surprised at the ending.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The variety of environments and challenges makes this game much better than the first. Though the focus shifting much more toward micro-transactions is off-putting. You can definitely play this game for a good amount of time without the need to but upgrades or power-ups.
0316035904|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but how can you go wrong with David Sedaris? And the best part is I found this brand new copy for only 59¢!
B00003CXCT|5.0|bought as a gift for my son-in law he said he liked it I hope he did would like to see them
0896762629|5.0|A great historic look into later period clothing. Fantastic detail and a must for anybody doing historically based clothing. Fantastic.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have not finished book 3 yet but it keeps me very interested  --  each time I sit down I pick it up to continue to read the story.  It's a reat  read.  &#34; Fifty Shades Freed&#34;
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was not thinking i would like this app but i love it!!! Thanks for making it the free app ofthe day.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a very good book that I have not read before.<br />The audiobook is also free and a great companion.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great product. The kids love it. It does have some words that may not be wanted to be heard from young children. See kids-in-mind.com
1401307787|5.0|Very clear, concise and eye-opening. That's all I have to say, but I must type 5 more words or I can't submit this review!
B007MDB6L0|4.0|I bought Secret of the Wings for my four year old niece and watched it at least a half a dozen times with her.<br />It's a good little story and the graphics are amazing.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|So many of the songs on the vinyl albums I had &#34;way back when&#34; plus newer ones - glad I found it.
0061245097|4.0|This is so far a fantastic series. I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as the first, but it was still fast-paced, captivating and very exciting.<br />I was a tad let down at the climatic scene, yet with the way it ended, I can't complain. I love the dynamics of Bones and Cat's relationship and can't wait to read more.<br />If you enjoy reading, pick this series up. You won't regret it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I cant wait for the next book!!!!!! This was one of the best book i have ever read, i'm not lying either!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it gives me the option to read or listen. I love to listen because it help me with the correct pronounciation of names which are sometimes difficult.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Thank you for a fast wonderful service! It got here in great shape & my family & I are really enjoying the tv series all over again. Thanks again!
B004GYY714|5.0|I like the options and world radio. This app is well worth having.. Highly recommend to everyone who loves to listen to radio.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey. All the different personalities developing in season two! It's. also like a history lesson but with a really fun professor!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Angry Birds meets Starwars, what is not to like? It's very cute and the likenesses are close enough you know who the birds are.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show and it streamed perfectly on my sony system. I would stream again and again! It was great!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Enjoyed the dour John Rebus again.  As I have just been to Scotland could visualize the countryside so well described.  I thought the perpetrator of the crime was a bit marginalized and would have liked to know more about he and his motives, but overall enjoyed the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is very fun and I suggest it to many all though I never seem to get to the end:/ but it is very easy which is why I regimens it to many kids in need of a fun app!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was considering not buying this game at first but I'm glad I did. Might as well it's free now anyway. There are some fun power ups and stuff...get it
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|If not the best album of the year. I am absolutely hooked on this album. Very unique band. Goes from upbeat to somber easily. This is definitely a band to look out for. I can't say it enough great great job!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|It was a very entertaining book in my eyes. A bit childish with a lot of time lapses in it though, but only a few parts are written like that. 8/10 for me.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I was so excited that I could finally play this game on my kindle but now it won't download. It downloads half way and just freezes.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|I enjoyed reading his views, agree with him, and I think the book is well written and easy to understand (I'm not an economist and don't play one on TV). Because of the nature of the material, it's a bit dry but I had no problem reading it in a week.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have not seen the movie yet, but am really enjoying this book! It is long so perfect for the kindle. One day I hope to watch the on stage musical!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I like the music and the game is pretty addicting. Good controls as well. Runs great on my Galaxy S3.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The title says it all. Intelligent keyboard. Learns your style, applies it to your conversations. Perfectly adapted to learn from Facebook/Gmail as well.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|The movie was ok. The best part being the suspenseful airport scene towards the end. I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, but my guess is its not. Thats ok, as this isnt made to be a documentary. Anyways, the movie made me so thankful I dont live there. What a horrible place! I wish the movie had touched on the eventual release of the other 52 Americans during the iran hostage crisis. Oh, and Benjamin Affleck-Boldt really needs a haircut bad. Much respect to Mr. Tony Mendez. You have to admire his bravery
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This book was helpful and very needed. It is a bit redundant,however the instructions are easy to follow. I personally was hoping for a bit more as in best font size to use, best fonts and etc.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got this for my father for his birthday. Easy to use, fits everything. He has a canon rebel t3. It fits his camera body and his two lenses. It also fits his small video camera with room to spare. There is also is a side strap that holds a small/medium sized tripod. My father is a bigger guy and the backpack fits on him comfortably.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I spent a HOLE DAY playing this app SOOO WORTH MY DAY PPL if u don't wanna buy this app u trippin lol :) XD
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Very simple but great way to aggregate data to one place!  I don't carry credit cards on me, but if I need to know a number, it's as simple as whipping out the smartphone and looking it up!  I have mSecure loaded on my laptop and manage the data from their.  My cellphone and tablet both sync to the laptop!  Works awesome!

B0084I9QIW|5.0|So, in 1988 I was 7 years old and completely in love with Michael Jackson. I even showed the movie Moonwalker at my birthday party. Why oh why didn't my parents take me to see him in concert? There were so many opportunities: Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indianapolis. Did they not realize that this would be his only US tour ever??? Did they not know that this was history in the making and probably one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived? It's not like I could have ordered tickets and taken myself. Poor me.<br /><br />And then 25 years I discovered this wonderful dvd here on amazon. This dvd does not disappoint. It takes me right back to 1988 when the 80's were awesome and I had not a care in the world. Michael has his long Jheri Curl with the little baby hairs and the band has no shortage of mohawks to go around. Now for those of you who criticize the video quality, I have to say that it actually inhanced the experience for me. Obviously this was recorded in the 80's before all of the technology advancements we have today so you must take that in consideration. I also find it quite amusing to watch their attempts at making stage theatrics and pyrotechnics to thrill the crowd. Of course it pails in comparison to what we have today, and may even seem a bit rudimentary, but to me it is a documentation of history. Michael was a perfectionist so for the time period whatever was strategically placed in the show was painstakenly reviewed by Michael and his creative team. Even by today's standards it is still a fantastic, marvelous show. His talent is timeless and for that reason alone this concert stands the test of time. I really appreciated it's VHS quality. Call me a sucker for nostalgia.<br /><br />All of the songs performed are great. I do have one criticism, however. Why oh why did he hire Sheryl Crow as a back-up singer? I love her music as a solo artist but until I heard her live singing on this dvd, now I must question her ability as a singer. She sounds like a strangled cat. She butchered one of my favorite songs. By now I'm sure you have seen the movie \\"This is It\\", well the beautiful young lady he hired to sing this song for his This is it tour blows Sheryl Crow out of the freakin' water. I don't know what the heck Mike was thinking. Maybe he was infatuated with her high heels, leather mini skirt and sky high eighties hair lol. Speaking of Sheryl, when they are singing together on \\"I just can't stop loving you\\", the sexy way Mike touches her and is in tune with her body. Whoa! I didn't know Mike had it in him. I mean, I've seen all his videos but those all seemed so choreographed. If this video is any indication, Mike sure knew how to touch a woman in all the right places.<br /><br />Best video ever. I am so happy I have these memories to remember this special man forever. He was genius and now his legacy with live on through his music and the collection of film that we have. Bravo. Bravo.

B007HO392S|5.0|I think this CD is totally awesome. It's nice there are so many hits on one CD alone. Great job. My favorite CD.
B00004W221|5.0|It's about Football, College Football, and One kid's passion to play for Notre Dame.<br />I'm not a Fighting Irish fan, but this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time!
B001FBIPF0|5.0|I am an old school FOB fan, back since they started up and I fell behind on getting the new album, but once I got it, I'm glad I gave it a try. The songs grow on you after a couple listens and they have all the parts of old songs that once got you hooked on Fall Out Boy, Great Chorus lines, anthem like progression, and great intensity!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I find this album a lot better than the first, the songs flow together well, full of energy and great lyrics. Babel is their best work yet!
B00138F080|4.0|May not be for everyone, but Mgmt have some great songs on this album, over half the album is GREAT! Not all the songs are to my liking as much as others, but 80% of them are fantastic, so why not just buy the entire album!  Mgmt looks promising for the future!
B007712XAU|3.0|I ordered new DVDs, not used, but two of the six disks had places where the movie stopped and then started then stopped again. I was so disappointed as I'd been looking forward to seeing seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey and was ready to return them. I decided to used my cleaner on them and they worked after cleaning them.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My wife and I ordered this for our soon-to-be 19-year-old son for his birthday.  He received this in conjunction with some other &#34;Nerd&#34; gifts and, after opening the box, told my wife, &#34;I don't know what to say.  This is the best gift I've ever gotten!&#34;  He couldn't get it out of the blister pack fast enough.<br /><br />If you know a Dr. Who fan and don't know just what to get them, this is what you should choose.  Yes, it's a toy, but it's a fun toy for an adult!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love it. so fun.omg for free. it is worth 1million.u all should get it.I love the world wide tours.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Everyone raved about how funny this movie was—my husband didn't even stick around to watch the end of it! I watched the end and was disappointed in having wasted my time and money with this movie. Very few things were funny. Thumbs down.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My grandsons and I love this movie.  It's fun and funny and my oldest loves to imitate the stuffed unicorn line while at the carnival.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I don't get all the bad reviews if you enjoyed The Lord Of The Rings movies this is a must you'll love it.  A perfect balance of the lighthearted feel of the book and the dark tone that ties it to Lord Of The Rings movies, this was exactly what you want in a prequel.  The visuals are beyond amazing and the adventure is enjoyable from start to finish just sit back and enjoy.  Very happy Peter Jackson came back to direct this it's his universe he brought it to life and The Hobbit connects seamlessly to The Lord Of The Rings.
0425252868|5.0|Bought this book for my husband and he lists it as one of the best WWII book's he has read.  A must for history buffs.
B009Z5975A|5.0|I loved them on VHS and now I have them on Blu-ray and my kids and grand kids love them too.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Good movie, interesting movie.  There is some nudity in it at the begining and adult language thru out the movie.
B005D63ICI|5.0|We started watching Dexter at seson 7 and loved it so we just had to rent the other series to get caught up.
B00365EVWE|4.0|For the price I paid I haven't heard a better set of in ear headphones.  Great bass, good mids and a decent high end (not alot of air or sparkle but still very satisfying).  Definitely worth it.  I mainly use them with my smartphone but tried them out with my dedicated headphone amp and they definitely opened up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|AWESOME!!! I read a review in the newspaper on sunday and bought the book the same day. Finished it today Wednesday. CAUTION it is very difficult to put this book down and get your life going, you have to know what happens to everyone. I highly recommend this book, if not for the social lesson, for the joy and fun of it. Great job Mr Howey.  Great Job!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am thirty-two and yes, it helps.... lol...  I'm not a bondage kinda girl, but the sexuality with the romanticism entices through every page....  enjoy!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you need a kick and have an imagination, this will awaken it!  Enjoy it and forget what your inclinations may or may not be...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok.  So not an S&M kinda girl.... however, this novel is where harlequin meets reality.  It's every little dirty thought incarnate.  If you like sex, this will turn you on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am 28. While this book was downloading, I started reading the reviews and became disheartened by how many really terrible reviews there were. So I waited to read the book for a couple of weeks and when I picked it up, I started watching for all the problems other reviewers pointed out. I couldn't see them and certainly couldn't understand why anyone would have hated it so vehemently as some reviewers seemed to.<br /><br />The attitude and demeanor of the two main characters have been criticized as snarky and temperamental, but I found them to be no more so than normal teenagers and at times, they seemed more mature than I would have expected.<br /><br />I found the characters intriguing and their love story very sweet and touching. I laughed at parts and the cried moments later and that is pretty amazing. I love finding characters that I become so emotionally connected to and this book definitely provided that connection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best app ever for your reading device or ipad or whatever you have! LOVE IT! Makes it so easy to use!

B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game! it captures the fun of a retro game perfectly. The 3D power is cool but on some levels it the best and others the worst. Everything else I have no complaints!<br />I'm playing on the original Kindle Fire
B000IZ0KRK|3.0|I really learned a lot in this movie about that era.  It was a sad time.  Great acting. The dialogue was very convincing.  Seemed like we could tell who the bad guys were.  I do recommend, but just not as a romantic movie with your significant other.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is probably the best show ever produced for television! You won't be able to stop watching! After the first episode you get interested. After the first season you get hooked. By the final, fifth season you'll start all over again because it is that good! And beware!! I guarantee you will not be able to watch only one episode at-a time! You'll find yourself watching four or five.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I needed this to download all my music from the amazon cloud to my Samsung Galaxy II. I was pleasantly surprised how simple it was to download the music to my phone! A NO-BRAINER!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I read the complete works of J.R.R. Tolkein so many times I lost count. Each time I pictured in my mind's eye a very similar version of what Peter Jackson has put on film. I love the way he (for the most part) didn't re-write the story in order to make the movie. Close to the detail that Tolkein placed in his writings.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Great movie if you havent seen it you NEEEEEEEED to it is the best movie of all time word word
6305609705|4.0|I completely acknowledge and admit that this movie is great in many ways, but my enjoyment of it only extends to &#34;pretty good.&#34; The Valkyries scene is great and it's always incredibly tense, but some of the imagery just doesn't jive with me. When the villagers start chopping the bull, it looks real and freaks me out. And I never understood why so many people devolve into madness. I know it's a metaphor, but the execution never quite sat well with me. However, it has a lot of great production stories, iconic lines and characters, and is incredibly effective.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Thought it was a great movie. Managed to be pretty insightful but also very humorous. I love Meryl Streep and this was definitely a great for her.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|It's no secret that I've been a fan of JT since his days in the MMC.  This album was a long time coming, and it does not disappoint.  Following the model from FutureSexLoveSounds, the lengthy tracks wrap two different feels into one package.  Innovative beats, sounds and emotional writing make this album worth the wait!  If you love pop music, or even music, add this to your collection.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Good book, a little predictable in that the reluctant heroine is a personification of the goddess whom she is named after, but enchanting story nonetheless. I really enjoyed this read and can't wait for the next one.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|easy to work with.  i have enjoyed bidding, searfhing for items and selling iteks.  love getting notifications oj things.  i am ebay obsessed.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The &#34;Beatles&#34; &#34;Abbey Road&#34;  Great album!!! In my opinion, one of their best, if not the best music they produced...but cleaned up and sounding even clearer than original...  Need I say more?
0394800184|5.0|At the end of WWII the US Government -fearing another violent veterans movement like the WWI Bonus Army Riots of 1932- initiated the largest and yet least known social political movement in the history of the Union. Using the scores of staff artists and columnists -afore used to combat the propaganda of the Third Reich- and all the latest in media technology they launched the \\"Go Home Rosy\\" campaign. This campaign extended well beyond the mass layoffs of female iron and factory workers \\"to free up jobs for returning veterans\\", they affected a change in an entire nations perception of femininity and motherhood. The working mother became the absentee mother, and a host of claims for child welfare and identity formation became the watchwords of the late 40's and 50's. Many of these perceptions still prevail today, commonly accepted as truth. In his ground breaking novel \\"Are You My Mother\\" P.D. Eastman examines and challenges the preconceived notions of the model mother. Raising an egg all alone, single mother Robin must leave her nest to provide for her son. Using a birds eye narrative Eastman follows Robin's son through out his day as his young mind explores the world around him and the social networks he builds. Though identifying many adult role models, Eastman shows how the child innately identifies with and finds their place in the world despite the presence or absence of a working mother. He challenges -if not destroys- the notion that in order to be an effective parent the mother must be in the home.
0399226907|5.0|The face of eating disorders is typically a female one, so it is no wonder the male body image struggle tends to be overlooked unless one is referencing the effects of mega-maleisim or the image of the super male. It is shocking then to learn that over 6% of individuals dealing with anorexia and over 1% of individuals battling bulimia are in fact, male. Boys too, it seems, are dieing to be thin. In his book The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Eric Carle addresses the roots of male eating nervosa from parental abandonment to the growing \\"hunger\\" for love and acceptance. He addresses the patterns of binge and fast that so aptly marks the male patterns of this disease while addressing the ever looming image of bodily perfection, \\"the beautiful butterfly.\\" A must read for every parent raising a boy in today's commercialized society.
030716327X|5.0|Tactile and witty this book explores the rudimentary core of human existence. Dorothy Kunhardt viciously tears apart the ideas of relationship and re-stances them only as foreign outside forces which must be experienced rather than understood. This book is breathtaking and truly interactive, a must read for all developing minds.
0307454568|5.0|This book never got boring. The end was so-so, but on a whole I enjoyed every minute of it. Love a book you can't put down. Once you are emerged in this series you can't stop until its finished and the last book did not dissapoint.
B000059TFO|5.0|The movie was expertly done, with actors playing very convincing roles. I love the leading actors so dearly, and I hate the villains! I could wring their necks with my hands - that's how excellent the acting was. Of course, the lessons of this historical event can never be lost in our minds and hearts.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I love Downton Abby!  You get caught up in each and every character.  The casting is superb!  zim do excited when we just switched over to Comcast that we'll be able to watch series 3 for free!

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This is a demo. DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP FOR DEEEMOS. It needs 15 minutes because the full is awesome.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I enjoy having the series available to enjoy when I want.The disks are easily numbered so I can get to the ones I wan to watch.
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|I tagged this product around 8 hours ago, and it was 179.99. Now, 304 dollars. Is this store nuts? Plenty of places out there charging standard price, there is no reason to pay premium.<br />And even though it has a flimsy battery, half an hour of poking around and changing battery (soldering abilities needed) will take this babe up to 7 hours.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty spans a period of twelve years, starting with 9/11 and ending with the killing of Osama bin Laden, and the film follows the hunt for the terrorist in a surprisingly subtle, but thrilling way.  Much like Hurt Locker before it, Zero Dark Thirty is notable for the quiet moments, casual conversations over chow, for example, that explode into horrific scenes of chaos and violence.  These aren't movies interested in hundreds of soldiers invading beaches through exploding rockets and machine-gun bunkers: These are modern war films, where four bullet holes through a house's front door are enough to get the job done.<br /><br />In both cases, Bigelow doesn't flesh-out her main characters with obvious details, but chooses to allow the audience to understand them through their actions and reactions.  It's an engrossing effect and one that gives these characters humanity while also acknowledging that these individuals - immersed in the daily business of war - will never be fully identifiable to civilians; Jessica Chastain handles the role with ease.<br /><br />Pretty much a pitch-perfect demonstration of post-9/11 warfare, where intelligence-gathering and intelligent operations win the day, Zero Dark Thirty may have only one slight misstep and that is Kyle Chandler's character as the \\"boss who doesn't listen.\\"  I know there are these types in real life, but here he almost stands out as an obvious cliché in the middle of a surprising group of competent characterizations.  Not the actors' fault by any means, his performance is good as always, but his constant nagging and doubts echo too many cop-show captains to give him much believably.<br /><br />A great film that chooses to focus on the mechanics of a sprawling manhunt without commentary or judgment, Zero Dark Thirty is simply riveting in its execution.  You will be amazed how quickly two and a half hours just flies by.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I thought that the book was written very well,I also liked how I could understand what was going on even with th different personalities
1419702238|5.0|My grandson loves the Wimpy Kid series.  He read this and the other books I ordered in less than a week.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I'm not a huge reader, but I do like reading many different kinds of books.  I do enjoy classics and had previously read and really liked titles including Jane Eyre, Little Women, and Gone with the Wind.  I also saw newer movie versions of a couple different Jane Austen works that I really liked, but this was my first time ever reading a Jane Austen novel.  The characters are well developed and quite different from one another, and like the other titles I mentioned at the beginning of this review, this story revolves around a strong- albeit shy and reserved in this instance- female protagonist set during the late 19th century.<br /><br />The book was really engaging, and an advantage of getting this Kindle version was that I could highlight words I didn't recognize to get definitions without leaving the text.  (Although the dictionary on my Kindle at least didn't recognize several of the archaic spellings of some words in the book.)  I think this was well written and I was able to relate to it, despite coming from a different era, geography, and socio-economic background as the protagonist and her family.  Ms. Austen does a wonderful job of making you care about the characters- especially with the characters that it seems the reader is meant not to like.  (I think Margaret Mitchell does this well too with the character of Scarlett O'Hara; in Persuasion, Austen writes in similar fashion, showing the reader how characters like Mary and Elizabeth- the protagonist's sisters, and William- the protagonist's father, while not flat are rather shallow and pretentious.)<br /><br />I've never been to England but found that that didn't act as an obstacle to understanding the setting, which is well described.  Though completely foreign to the mores of that society, Austen delivers an insider glimpse so that I- who have never experienced an environment in real life like the one described in the book- feel really enveloped in the plot and am able to understand the different characters' motivations and desires.  This was a wonderful read!  I think this book is another piece of timeless literature, and really enjoyed reading it.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This worked perfectly with my LG HDTV Model 32LE5400 and a Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable along with the LP-2020A+ Lepai Tripath Class-T Hi-Fi Audio Mini Amplifier. It was perfect to power my existing speakers and providing booming sound!<br /><br />It also worked perfectly with my Panasonic TC-L24X5 HDTV which required a Digital Coaxial Audio Cable. I used the same Amplifier and the Dayton Bookshelf speakers. My Panasonic TV did require me to go to the Menu, select \\"Audio\\" and change the output to \\"PCM\\"... the default was Dolby which this says it does not work with.<br /><br />I am a happy camper!  This is an excellent device and makes watching TV a whole new experience again since I can use 'real' speakers instead of the built in bar on the TV.  LOVE IT!!!

B001MS7IBS|4.0|A commercial airliner arrives at its destination with every passenger and crewmember on board dead. The FBI investigate. Clues suggest that the only person who can help with the investigation is a brilliant but disturbed scientist named Walter Bishop. Bishop has been locked up in a mental institution for seventeen years and the only person who can sign for his release is his son, Peter, a shady businessmen. FBI Agent Olivia Dunham and the Bishops successfully discover the answer to the mystery, encouraging the FBI to create a special unit dedicated to these 'fringe science' cases, which have exploded in frequency in the last few years. The cases are varied and individual, but together form 'the Pattern', a statistical trend that suggests a major event is coming.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss Fringe because of misconceptions. A new TV show from the creator of Lost, J.J. Abrams? And a premise that seems to owe rather a lot to The X-Files? The number of people who passed the show by, fearing (fairly or not) muddled mythologies and an inferior homage to an older show, must have been significant.<br /><br />However, such reactions would also be unfair. Fringe distanced itself almost immediately from Lost by having a much smaller cast of characters, meaning a much tighter focus on the stories and the gradually-evolving backstory. Abrams also took a back seat after the pilot, letting other writers and producers come on board to direct the day-to-day running of the show. A key difference is that whilst Lost's mythology only got some direction in its third season, when an end date for the show was set, Fringe's mythology and story arcs were mapped out in advance from early in the first, giving the show a much stronger sense of direction.<br /><br />The season kicks off with the pilot, in which the regular cast and premise is established. Anna Torv immediately impresses as Olivia Dunham, a no-nonsense FBI agent (though prone to unexpected bouts of deadpan humour) who has alot of pressure riding on her shoulders. Joshua Jackson takes a little longer to convince as a businessman with shady contacts, but eventually turns in a very human and funny performance. The main weapon in the show's arsenal is the spectacular John Noble - previously best-known as Denethor on the Lord of the Rings movies - who plays Walter Bishop to perfection. Character traits and tics that would have been hokey or hammy in another actor's hands become utterly convincing in Noble's, who is able to play his character's memory problems and occasional emotional outbursts for either comedy or pathos as the script demands (occasionally both simultaneously). It's frankly worth watching the show just for Noble's performance. Also providing able support is The Wire's Lance Reddick as Dunham and company's boss, Philip Broyles.<br /><br />The show's premise - that the FBI would employ a certified lunatic, an occasional criminal and a cow called Gene to investigate fringe science cases from a basement in Harvard University - takes a bit of swallowing. The show does its best in the pilot to try to make the premise a bit more palatable, but it's surprisingly late in the episode before 'the Pattern' and the great urgency to find out what the hell's going on (making it a bit easier to accept the desperate lengths the FBI are going to) is more firmly established.<br /><br />That out of the way, the show quickly establishes a format: the mystery-of-the-week is laid out in the pre-credits sequence and our heroes rapidly show up to investigate, usually involving labwork from Walter and good old FBI fieldwork from Olivia. The procedural aspect of the show was apparently key to getting it on the air - the producers deliberately used it to entice Fox on board - but it's not too many episodes before it's being downplayed in favour of the crazy lab antics. These episodes also hit that early X-Files sweet spot of having (mostly) satisfying, self-contained stories with more serialised elements being laid down in the background.<br /><br />It's not too long before Fringe's serialisation and mythology comes to the fore later in the season. A recurring enemy is established early on, followed by another, more dangerous one later on. Walter's memory loss, initially established for comedic purposes, later becomes far more important as Walter begins to discover the ramifications of experiments he conducted twenty years earlier. A key episode reveals that Olivia herself may be part of 'the Pattern' and the discovery of a manifesto belonging to a terrorist organisation spurs events in the series finale. Watching over events is a strange bald man in a suit and hat, who appears (if only fleetingly, or in the extreme background of some scenes) in every single episode and is more strongly featured in two of them. An off-the-cuff reference to quantum theory in one episode sets up a major storyline that emerges in the finale and provides the season with its final and most famous cliffhanger image.<br /><br />This segueing from the stand-alone elements to the more-heavily serialised storylines is well-handled, though some may lament the decreasing frequency of the stand-alone mysteries in the late season. At its best Fringe is a surprisingly gory homage to The Twilight Zone, but at its worst can be trite and predictable (though allegedly the worst episode of the season was actually cut, showing pleasingly surprising creative integrity). Fortunately it's worst is very rarely encountered. Slightly more problematic - though perhaps unavoidable in these kind of shows - is the number of times that major reversals and deaths could have been avoided if the characters just stopped and talked to one another properly for a few minutes. Whilst far less of a problem than on Lost, it still niggles when Walter says something cryptically vital, Peter notices but then gets interrupted by Olivia and doesn't bother to raise the question again at the end of the scene.<br /><br />Overall, the problems are few and outweighed by the positives. Season 1 of Fringe (****½) starts off as a finely entertaining slice of SF hokum before being carried by excellent performances and a reasonably compelling central storyline into a finale that leaves one eager to move immediately onto the second season.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|Story written with eye on celluloid. The story does not really progress after book 2. It seems to go round and come back to where it started. It is true that the book is [appears to be] in two parts. The book is more a set of events than smooth flow of story. It ends prompting you to be ready to buy the next book in the series.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game.. I usually tell my self one game! And an hour later I am still playing!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I haven't read the book but I don't think you can compare books and movies.  They're not the same, they never will be.  You have to judge them on their own merits good or bad.  I'm sure the book was fantastic but due to time constraints or money or what have you, not everything that was in the book is going to make it to the big screen.  It's unrealistic to expect it.<br /><br />That being said, I thought Beautiful Creatures was a good movie.  I got a good sense of who Ethan and Lena were as characters.  Loners who liked to think for themselves and I really liked that they shared a real love for literature.  That's not really something you see in teenage romances these days.  I do feel that they fell for each other a little fast but they may be the way it was written in the book.  I think we did get a nice progression of their relationship and how the strain of Lena possibly turning dark wore them down.<br /><br />I thought Emma Thompson was one of the best parts of the movie for me because she really became that character.  In fact all of the veteran actors were great here.<br /><br />The problems with Beautiful Creatures for me is not really getting a great sense of Lena's family, I felt like some of the characters were just there with no purpose or explanation and the acting.  Sometimes the acting from the two leads was comically bad.  I kind of expected it because they aren't overly experienced but I expected a little more than what was given.<br /><br />I think if you leave the differences from the book out of the equation, you'll find a well crafted teen romance movie with a little more substance than most.  Give it a shot you won't be disappointed.
B00A8307BG|5.0|We have been fans of Trower for many years,but this is one of his best. We love the Blues sounds and he has SOUL.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Hard to actually believe that this would ever happen, but this movie has some great underlying themes, on faith, fishing, and seeking what you want in life! I highly recommend watching, the music along with the movie is great also! Great acting by both main actors and some funny moments throughout the movie.
B0095VP8D4|4.0|I bought this to put in an HTPC, mainly because I didn't want to have to buy a separate graphics card. The built in GPU works great with my MSI motherboard and runs plenty fast for my HTPC that has a dual dvr tuner<br /><br />the only negative is that it would be faster, but then again it's low power which offsets that
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I didn't think they could beat their previous album of &#34;Manners&#34; but they did! Great songs on this cd, I recommend buying the whole album you won't be disappointed, great tunes, catchy lyrics, they'll make you want to get up and dance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i do not have amc to watch it so i watch it the next day on amazon good streaming no commercials
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You fall in love with the main character, but at the same time you can find yourself being mad at him and confused at why he is like the way he is and what he does. This story really opened my eyes to see what it may be like with a mental illness, I guess we are weird in some way or another. But overall it's a great read, I couldn't put it down, highly recommend giving it a try, and giving Pat Peoples in the Silver Linings Playbook.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I was uncertain what to expect from this album because the reviews were so/so and all of them talked about the length of the songs, but I must admit that I have been surprised how much I like this album.  Its an album by the old school definition where there is a theme to the songs and they all flow together.  Obviously, \\"Suit and Tie\\" is all over the radio and \\"Mirrors\\" is getting a lot of attention and they are stand outs, but the production and detail in extending and building the songs makes it a really rewarding listen.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|What's not to love about a sci-fi movie with Harrison Ford? I think this movie was ahead of its time! A great story, great acting, and actually some good graphics, Blade Runner is a must see for anyone who has never seen it. I think I need to give it a second viewing.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great fun! This game revives memories of old Amiga and C64 shooters. The 3D mode adds some novelty to a classic.
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|You can get better notebook or notepad apps, I didn't like the layout or format on my Kindle Fire, I recommend giving another free one a try before this one.
B008JFUNAU|5.0|Have you ever wondered how the Wizard became the Wizard of Oz or Why the Wicked Witch was so Wicked ? Well, all your questions will be answered here. This movie which was directed by Sam Raimi was an excellent movie, it had the heart and feeling of THE WIZARD OZ.<br /><br />The movie even starts out in black in white like the original movie. James Franco, Zack Braff, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis all give excellent and emotional performances in this film, plus there is humor in it as well.<br /><br />The 3D in the movie is spectacular and worthy of all fans of THE WIZARD OF OZ. Would I recommend this movie to anyone ? Yes I would.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very nicely packed together, great layout, and book that comes with. Great blu-ray quality and extra features, a must have for any &#34;Dark Knight Trilogy&#34; Fan!
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's kind of like the original space invaders game but it has some extra effects and enemies. I need 3 more words.
B0055SWM08|2.0|Not very hard, not very exciting, 10-15 mins and you'll be bored. I'd look elsewhere for some entertainment, unless this app is free, then give it a try.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very suspensful, and informative about the treatment of slaves in the South at that time. .  Suspenseful, and heartwarming how the various families melded together
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This twitter app works well on my Kindle Fire, fast to load, doesn't slow it down. But seems to be lagging sometimes in new tweets or updates or needs me to open the app first then &#34;finds&#34; updates and new tweets.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I've found that as in most of his novels it's just too predictable as to the plot of the story.
B00A757EFW|5.0|For old gamers and new youth, Pacman is a fade that will never die, and will bring you endless hours of fun of eating dots and getting chased by colorful ghosts, then chasing the ghosts in return, just watch out on your next move!  Works great on my KINDLE FIRE!!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I just picked up this game today and so far so good. The title &quot;with the money&quot; is a little tongue-in-check as I paid nothing for it as part of the free app of the day promotion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wa wa wa wa W's W's as W's W's az cg f Tv d. vvd. cc ff Vf g. d ggx gd gt. gd f Vcr gccd. f. I like this game! awe some yea!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm my opinion this game is wonderful, the graphics are good, it has creative mode and survival made(personally in my interests I love the survival mode), if your creative like me than this game is for you, also this is one of the few real minecraft games on here, don't fall for the other scams, this game is the real deal, and great for all ages
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game. Brings me back to the days of old school Atari. Filter filer filler filer Follett filler fleet fleet fleet
B009KEN87O|5.0|I really like this game, great controls and smooth. Only one complaint, but not big enough to give 4 stars, upgrades go away after each wave. It would be much nicer if upgrades would carry across waves
1616550414|5.0|Good quality book, nice illustrations but it is mostly about Skyward Sword. There is a lot of concept art and it answers some questions about the series.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Got it for free but it is worth buying. The levels and enemies are diverse and fun. While the graphics are simple, they get the job done.
B00004WG2F|4.0|It is such a great movie,although very sad at times.i was pretty thankful there were no scratches.And the price was reasonable.
B006CHML4I|1.0|I like the watch and am going try and get it reset other than that it is a nice watch
B009KEN87O|5.0|Really great for a freebie. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this quite so much...but I grew up on Space Invaders and Galaga...This is a thoroughly entertaining more modern version!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its really really really super fun I love it and I stink at videogames and I'm good at this one
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Lizzy Hale and Halestorm absolutely kick ass.  Every Song  has a hard charging beat and Awesome vocals.  One of the All-Time great lead singers, with Rockin' guitar.  Not a &#34;B&#34; side song on the CD.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|!  Wow what a moving and yet disturbing pictorial of our food industry!  Raising my own food after watching this movie!  Love you Hanna my youngest daughter, you have opened my eyes!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Now I know why this was the best picture winner.  Great plot well acted and funny at the same time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app is good cause it has good things... a a a a a a a a a a a a
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well worth every minute of your time . I have always been a World War 2 buff . But this book puts a whole new twist on the men who fought over Germany that I did not think was possible .
B006R1T40I|5.0|One of her best albums. If I had to pick the best it would be this and &#34;Home Run&#34;. Bonnie at her very best, afetr 40 years of singing and touring she still belts it out and hits the mark!  I feel in love listening to her and and back there again.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had heard about this series but didn't understand what was so great about it.  I was so impressed when I watched it!!  It was beautiful and lush and a fantastic story.  I will watch all the other seasons as they come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game evr so addictive and just the best fan  ever to buy buy it play it best game ever j u s t buy it.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I decided I had to have my own copy. Great story, great acting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes English literature.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game need more money to get started having fun getting my city up and running with a lot of traffic on the road
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Fairly predicable but with twist of modern ethics thrown in. I'm usually put off by stories set abroad but that wasn't a main focus here.<br />I would recommend the book as a weekend or holiday read if you love true love stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a fun way to learn the basics in what it's like to have a horse and also some of the responsibility you need to care for your horse!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|streamed this movie for my grandchildren. streaming quality was very good - no jerky movements. the kids really enjoyed the movie
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is way better  than the first in  so  many levels  new challenges and characters in this awesome sequel.
0062082353|5.0|Fascinating and gripping. Chris's childhood background helps the reader get engaged with how this American hero thought about his country, his family, and the freedoms he protected with a level of tenacity that is rare amongst today's younger folks. The war in Iraq against terror had facets different from our previous conflicts. Chief Kyle outlined these in a straightforward, detailed style. I gained a better understanding of how the Rules of Engagement combined with house to house type warfare had created such a tremendous stress level for our frontline combat troops. I may wait a year or two before my 13 yr-old grandson reads it. This is not about movie theatrics; this was real and you know it when you read it. May God bless Chris Kyle's family.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Calculator way to easy! Great interface. One thing missing for me..... feet and inches. But otherwise it's GREAT<br /> Highly recommended for its ease of use!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My husband is hooked....and the kids enjoy it too when they can get it from Dad.  Nice to have the idea of freeing the birds instead of just &#34;popping&#34; the pigs too- on a Mommy note.
1451629192|5.0|A piece of writing that won't let you put it down until the last page has been devoured. I recommend this book to anyone out there. It definitely brings the hope out in anyone out there.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book.  I wanted to read it before the movie came out and I did and was very excited to watch the movie.  The movie is very good and has amazing animation, but I just can't help but think that it did not quite do the book justice.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie, I still suggest you read the book.  I am thinking of reading it for a second time.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's very relaxing, especially if you turn off the timer.  I play it when I just want to kill time and unwind.  I don't tire of it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Yes, the uptown production of Downton Abbey continues and has left me waiting for more.  Although I was sadly disappointed at the loss of two of my favorite characters, please God don't take my Irish favorite, I am still enthralled with this story, it's characters, its location, its continuing historical look at life, times, customs and mores of pre-WWI and beyond in the British Isles.  One of my favorite characters is the young Irish chauffeur who falls in love with the English daughter of the manor and  watching as he juggles his conflicting beliefs and emotions.  I hate to give much away to those who are just starting to watch this or, like me, have chosen the set to watch from the beginning, so all I can say it is well worth the watch.  If, like me, you are tired of trying to find something beside the hideous fake reality garbage that has been foisted on the U.S. in the last few years, you will be relieved and excited to find programming that does not dull your intelligence but fosters it.  My only regret is the loss of my favorite character at the end of the last season, and I profoundly wish that we could have a \\"Dream sequence\\" copied from an American soap opera of the past but like I said, I will still be watching regardless......
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It provided a unique perspective on the atrocities that occur in North Korean prison camps.
B007712XAU|5.0|The British have done it again, they continue to churn out great actors and actresses, great TV and movies that are a treat to watch, and fantastic views of homes, décor, apparel, countryside and all within the constraints of a particular time frame while keeping continuity with changing times.  I had heard so much about Downton Abbey but thinking it only a soap opera had chosen not to watch it even though I normally loved PBS and most British or Canadian TV fare.  Finally, my sister and others urged me to give a try, but by that time the 3rd season was ending on PBS, so I decided to order seasons 1, 2, & 3 and watch from the beginning.  My sister and friends were right, I loved it.  It is a soap opera of sorts, but done a beautiful way, not only are the characters interesting but they are interwoven with real history and we are able to get a knowledgeable and informative glance at the past.  We see the passions, difficulties, and beauty of differing political and changing ideologies that infect some and inhibit others as it pertains to an ever-changing world and those caught in it.  The cast of actors are superb, it feels as if I am not watching actors acting like real characters, but watching real people in real situations, their loves, lives, hurts, pain, suffering, weaknesses and strengths.  Without going into the story, all I can say is to those who love to watch great programs should watch Downton Abbey.  It is a masterpiece and it is only right that it should be presented on &#34;Masterpiece Theatre&#34;......once again, Kudo's to the Brits.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Love this Album!! I have the LP but no longer have the turntable to play the album.....so the next best thing is purchase the CD. The album brings back some great memories!!!!!!!!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've watched Avengers more times than I can count. I watched it 3 times in the theater. I love it.
B00AYB0SQQ|2.0|I don't understand the glowing reviews this movie has received. For me it was a poor mimic of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Aliens take over humans by invading their ears.  It is not very thrilling, not very suspenseful, not very scary.  The one glaring continuity issue (which may be a spoiler) is this: how did some of the faculty get taken over even before the alien gets to the school?  Save you money and watch any of the Body Snatcher movies.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I highly recommend this game to anyone it is fun and addicting and awesome. I would love to get an update with more cars and a multiplayer where you can race each other
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many crafty people out there and are willing to share their ideas and products and knowledge. i cannot live without it now!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down I literally read the entire thing in one sitting this is a good book for anyone
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|One of my childhood favorites, Willow arrives on blu ray for the first time.  The film follows a young Hobbit, er, Nelwyn named Frodo, er, Willow and his adventure of a lifetime.  Along the way he'll meet a great warrior hiding from his destiny named Aragorn, er, Madmartigan.  Just having some fun, but you have to admit, the film is VERY much inspired by Tolkien's Rings trilogy, just with a baby subbing for a ring.  There are many parallels; Gandalf is split into two characters (The High Aldwin and Fin Rezel) while Saruman and Sauron have been combined into one with the sorceress Queen Badmorda.  It may seem as if I'm downing the film, but in fact I truly love it.  The film holds up very well and unlike some OTHER sword and sorcery epics it won't take you 9 hours to watch.  ;-)<br /><br />I have owned Willow in it's various releases (VHS, DVD, now Blu-Ray), and am very pleased with Willow's arrival on blu-ray.  The picture is very pleasing, having has not been overprocessed with DNR.  By no means reference quality, the film still looks easily the best I've ever seen it and is definitely a step up from DVD.  I'm not an audiophile, but through my soundbar & sub the film sounds fine with the effects not overpowering the dialog.<br /><br />The extras are a mixed bag.  We FINALLY get the deleted scenes we've been hearing about for twenty years!  There are 3 deleted sequences it all, each with introductions by Ron Howard, and unlike some deleted scenes on other titles, these are not horrible grainy looking workprints but nearly complete footage, plus they are shown with footage from the film to give them context.  Very well done, all deleted scenes should be shown this way!  We also get Warwick Davis' Film Diaries.  The title is a bit misleading as it's some of his footage mixed with other backstage footage.  This feature is VERY good, with Warwick Davis providing new interviews and commentary.  Finally 2 of the featurettes from the DVD release are included; an original EPK which is actually better than most, and the MORF to Morphing featurette.  These are carryovers, but they include new introductions with Howard and the effects supervisor.  Finally you get a minute long matte painting gallery displaying the EXCELLENT matte work in the film.  Unfortunately Warwick Davis' excellent commentary track is NOT included here, neither on the blu ray or the included DVD (I checked).  Very unfortunate, a mind boggling omission and the only real black mark on this release.  The film's teaser and trailer are also not here, another head scratcher, but at least these can be found online.<br /><br />Overall this a wonderful film that the whole family can truly enjoy.  Good acting, beautiful sets, epic action and a rousing and memorable score.  Highly recommended.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I bought these headphones recently so I can listen to my movies and games while I don't disturb others at night.they where very good at that, there where other little things that are holding these headphones back from becoming 5*.<br /><br />*These headphones sound very nice for shooters, on some other games they would sound low even when turn all the way up. I was playing a wide veriety of games from halo 4 to the whitcher 2, from DMC to street fighter 4 ae. All of them sound loud, I even had to turn some of the volume down. When I pop in Skyim they sounded very low even with the volume all they way up, so I guess it's a hit or miss for some games.<br /><br />*There were 2 things I didn't like about this pair. One was how the speakers had that plastic around them. They felt like cheap plastic but that's me being picky. The headphones can take a little bit of a beating, my 3 yr old neice like too play around with them so she throws them a lot but I've let do too much damage to them. The 2nd thing I don't like is that when they run dry, they let out a screech that hurts your ear a little but not too much with no waring. Another problem with these is that you do hear a small fuzzing noise when no sound plays. These do get some drop sound from time to time but that does go away after a few mins.<br /><br />*The wireless feature was a main selling point for me and they did that job well even through walls. Just don't go far away from the receiver cause the break up noise is loud. They'll break up around 10 to 15ft.<br /><br />*For movies they sounded ok whitch was a little bit of a let down but just a little. The sound could've been a little higher but like with games there where a hit or miss.<br /><br />*Overall i'd say even with these flaws they are pretty good if your looking for wireless headset with sourround sound. Good for a somewhat low price. Really I'll rate this a 3 3/4 star.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Lee Childs is a master story teller and certainly the Jack Reacher storys. Cam always recommend Lee childs story for having excellant plots and believeable storys.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|We love these stories based on truth.  This was so interesting to see the struggle of this man during WWII  That is why we so enjoyed Enemy at the Gate as well as Definace.  Defionace probably our very favorite story as it was based on a true story of Jews in Germany during WWII.  These are survival stories and we love them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome I love it I think that there should be more apps like it. It's so real.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|good app - lets you keep up with the market and stocks on a real time basis and its free
B009FZFONO|3.0|I love the series however this season is more about egos then zombies. Season 3 very slow moving I would recommend seasons 1 & 2 to build intrest before attempting season 3.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book by a great American hero. Truly engaging during the firefights in the mountains of Afghanistan. God bless all Navy Seals!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My Family loved this film and coming from a quarter arcade child of the 80s very interseting to see what your favorite video game heros and villians arew up too after closing. Wreck it Ralph is a must for any family.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book, cannot believe what he went through and the family he beginning to enjoy again, and then to have his life taken so easily by a coward with no conscience. VERY sad.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|My wife & myself really loved this film very well written. Very nice flow to the film with a few twists along the way.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a novel about a young girl who was a challenge to the social system of today that showed an innate tenacity to learn.  And I learned a lot about the messages we send in the language of flowers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I recommend this to everyone. It's sad, funny, and probably the best book ever!<br />I really really loved this book!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|My son likes dinosaurs good enough for him to want this game. He really liked the first Jurrasic Park movie. The game is kind of slow to start and on my Kindle Fire it sometimes is hard to collect, its like my kindle isn't sensitive enough to feel my touch even though I haven't had any trouble on any other game. But its still fun. Like most building games out there now, you can progress without spending money, slowly but surely, so if you want to progress quicker you will spend a few dollars here and there to get where you want to in the game.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I didn't realize what a sacrifice this man made until reading this book! He put his life on the line for us to be free! Then was killed by a person he was truly trying to help! No doubt heaven gained a great warrior but one that was gone too soon! A must read for anyone that loves war books! RIP Warrior
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My 2 boys and I really like this game. Very addicting! There's not enough levels tho, wishing there were more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I  could not put the book down, but I have not seen the movie.  There was too many bad words,though.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Bought as a gift though have long had my own copy. Have yet to find anyone who does not think Celtic Woman are the best shows ever.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie, no reservations, love it!  And here I am 63 going on 13.  Love Anne Ramsey as Mama and John Matuszak perfectly cast as Sloth.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|None of the flimsy ness of other  micro USB cords. The micro USB spec seems a bit wimpy for everyday use
B007X4ECMI|4.0|This is comparable to the action movie Chronicles of Riddick, but with more dialog from our hero.  Liked both.  Have watched Lockout twice and will watch it again.  They cast Joseph Gilgun perfectly as the tattooed maniac psycho killer.  He should have received an Oscar nomination!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Pretty good acting that goes nowhere story makes no sense and is offensive and makes u say I wasted two hours
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I'm afraid of heights, so my adrenalin gets flowing in you can guess which scene!<br />However, I like MI-3 the best.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Rented this last night and watched about 1/3. Began streaming again tonight, and suddenly the video is no longer available. No explanation. Will not ever waste my time with another amazon rental or purchase, and I suggest that you don't either.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|I didn't buy this for the great acting and character development in it.  No, I bought it to watch the aliens blast the Navy with the imaginative bombs.  But, I always wonder, here is an alien species that can traverse light years, yet essentially has projectile weapons...guess the makers of the movie thought it makes for more drama.
6302426197|4.0|The first in a number of great Christopher Guest comedies.  The humor is so subtle that you really have to &#34;get it&#34; when it comes to his movies.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can one say about Downton Abbey that hasn't already been said, much better? This is superior soap opera, beautifully acted, with fascinating interwoven story lines and set in a magically beautiful location. I have thoroughly enjoyed all three DVDs so far and am already looking forward to the next.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Such a wonderful and sweet album.  Paul displays such a gentle charm with each song and it's a nice way to hear these old standards.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Asten is my favorite classic author, Persuasion being my top favorite of her novels. Sense and Sensibility, in its depiction of gently-born women in restricted financial circumstances vividly illustrates a society in which women are very much dependent on men and, being unable to work for a living, must contrive to find a husband who can support them financially (if not emotionally).<br />The romantic complications and social manoevrings are depicted with wit (sometimes caustic) and compassion and the ultimate resolution is very satisfying.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Oh my goodness...I effectively that Nicholas Sparks is probably my favorite author. I loved this book & many of his others...I'm never disappointed!!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|As usual with any Rdiley Scott movie, the special effects and cinematography was beyond critique. Its just the story was not up to his usual level of accomplishment. To me it was lacking. But I still give it 4 stars just for its association with the other movies in the Alien franchise.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Pros:<br />* Looks absolutely gorgeous<br />* Feels great in hands<br />* Fits perfectly due to a good old-fashioned fastening system
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Great Lego, my Grandson loved it, his mother little less since it took sometime to put it together (too many pieces)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came out. And it truly touched my heart! I loved every part...except the ending. It was to twisted and confusing. But other than that, it was great! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good read!
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Great toy for kids that love Star Wars, my Grandson loved this, got it for Christmas and he loved it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun little game to pass the time.  It has a bejeweled sort of feel to the game.<br />It was a free app.
0786962984|4.0|I read the reviews because my 4 year old boy is a nerd (like dad).  It is not playable by himself and he needs an adult to figure it out.<br /><br />The combat mechanic is fairly simple.  You pick up the card, look at the number associated with your class or spell and then if you roll higher with 2 dice you kill the monster.<br /><br />I think that if you want to get this for your kids they should be between 7 and 10 as I think an 11 year old would find the game too simple.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I definitely like this game.  The graphics are beautiful and I enjoy playing.  However, it only goes so far in the game and then I have to pay.  The \\"free\\" is no more.  I was disappointed in that. The game is a little involved and takes awhile to figure out the clues to get you to the hidden object process.  It is worthwhile but don't expect to play for free very long.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My kids and I looked forward to our nightly reading of this book, the Mark of Athena. Rick Riordan continues to develop the demigod characters and their relationships. Lots of action and intrigue, as always.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Useless drama, story wasted on good actors. Old film &#34;My Dinner With Andre&#34;, a two hour celebration of conversation as you dine with Andre Gregory is superior to this film. More rewarding life event.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Have read all three of the Clifton Chronicles and enjoyed them all so much tat i read late into the night becoming severely sleep deprived.  When can we expect Chronicles 4?  I am already imagining whereit will lead.
B008GFI4V8|5.0|The &#34;Two Towers&#34; extended version has some interesting things that were in the book but not in the theatrical release. It doesn't change the movie very much, and you have to be quite a fan to sit through all the ways Peter Jackson has the commentaries. I did, and loved it, but it isn't for the casual watcher.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|I enjoyed the book and the story, but it lacks the quality of a historical narrative.  This was an event of great historical importance, and hopefully the full story will be told one day with the appropriate literary quality.<br /><br />The intensity of the experience is loosely conveyed, but better writing would go a long way.  All that said, it's a good read, worth checking out.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|If u haven't seen this u should. Watch with an open mind and in a happy mood. It's hilarious and stupid.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|game is pretty cool. like that you can get free gems but wouldn't buy them. wouldbratjer pay a one time fee and just have everything cost coins. want to see more horse breeds like clydesdale and shire.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I've alwasy liked Keira but now I love her! It's great to see a young star that can do more than rely on special effects to support their career. Dialogue is what I'm about & Keira is obviously capable! She needs to take on more projects of this kind.
0525952926|5.0|First in the trilogy - always a Follett classic, the way the story interweaves people from different countries as they come into the first world war is seamless and enthralling!
0800141660|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift for a young friend. This has always been a favorite of mine & now I'll be passing it on to a new generation. She really enjoys period pieces & I know she'll love this. I became a fan of these actors because of this film. Thank goodness they've all continued to work & share their talents!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I know it's a best seller and I enjoyed it up to a point.  Should have ended the book sooner, after a while shock value was lost and i kept wishing for the book to end.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This was a good movie but it was obvious that the intent was to set the tone for the coming of &#34;Avengers&#34; & not to give the Captain America character a venue to expand. It's quite unfortunate that this is all the adventures we'll ever see that centers around the character. The Captain America graphic series was so full of great stories that they easily could have done more. I guess the modern day producers & directors can't figure out how to make something exciting unless it involves machines, monsters or super-natural beings. All-in-all, I really liked the film. So much so that it left me wanting to see more of the Captain on the screen.
B003AJKPL2|2.0|This product is sort of clumsy. I like the idea of it, but if you are pitting smaller items it doesn't work all that well.
0446547573|1.0|I have read all of Nichalas Sparks books from start to finish. I must say that this was one of the worst books I read last year. Don't waste your time. Try reading one of his other books.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute childrens movie. We even enjoyed it being adults. It has a very good story and is very appropriate for children.

1454901276|5.0|A literary crime story with a unique setting on a sparsely populated island off the Scottish coast.  Mr. May gives us lots of 'value added' stuff about life,customs and language which shape his hero and villains.  And sometimes, it's hard to distinguish between them.  A literary writing well worth your time and money.
B005MXQD1K|5.0|If you like celine then this is one you have to have.  The songs and effects of the show are breath taking. And the behind the scenes are great. Very interesting on how this show was produced and all the work it takes to do it. One of the best Dvd I have ever purchased.
B00A7GWG3Q|5.0|Better realized than Popular Songs, Fade finds YLT refining their craft writing pop songs. I was not so sure what John McEntire could bring to the table, but the rhythm section obviously benefited, particularly the tighter drumming. The sleeve is beautiful, and I think its only on the 12in sleeve that one can spot Ira, Georgia & James on the cover!
B005DOKM9M|3.0|Thought it would be thicker  for protecting screen but does the job .could have gotten same thing less expensive.but its nicely made and it was a gift.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun.......a little slow to start but once you get going is fun. I would pay a couple bucks for this
1401228801|5.0|I love the Fables series and this is such a great addition to my collection! Also there were some really great scenes but I won't give anything away. I totally recommend it to anyone who loves the Fables series or who wants to read something original and a creative masterpiece!
0810993139|5.0|Great price, fast shipping, free shipping, great condition of the book. My 7 year old loves this series and has yet to put it down. I have to buy books 6 and 7 and he will have them all. Highly recommend to kids to encourage reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great it does what I need it to. Its simple and easy with no fuss.Thanks a bunch.,
0810970686|5.0|My 7 year old is reading this series. It is one of his favorites. Amazon offers a great price one these books; lower than Wal-Mart and I get free shipping on Amazon. I only have 2 left to buy for him and I will be buying them from here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a awesome and exciting book. I would recommend this book to people that read and liked the Harry Potter series. It has a lot of suspense.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Bought this when I stayed overnight in the hospital with a family member.  Not an exciting game, but a good time filler.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read The Stand three times because I could not get enough of the characters. It's one of my top ten reads.  I just finished 11/22/63 moments ago, and I know it will be weeks before I can get these characters and this story out of my head.  Bravo.  I have a new favorite.
B004LROMQG|5.0|I happened upon Merlin through Netflix, and was immediately hooked!  Due to the delay between the air date and US release, then the availability on my Instant Queue, I splurged on the DVDs; this season did not disappoint.  Haven't looked at any extras, so can't comment on those.
B006YC74E8|1.0|This app is no longer installed at the time of this review simply because I did not see much point in having it on my Kindle.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I enjoy using my new mouse. I like being able to adjust the speed of the cursor and it takes very little surface movement to move the cursor across the monitor (27&#34; monitor). Being able to adjust the weight is also a plus. I don't appreciate the fact that it cost more than advertised because this purchase was made overseas (unbeknownst to me) due to transaction fees paid to foreign banks or middlemen.
B008D37J6O|1.0|I uninstalled this app... every time I go to open it I have to quickly choose a file because it &#34;unexpectedly stops&#34; before I can finish exploring my files... it does the same thing sometimes when I am in the middle of a movie too.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|this does not work on mobile, nor does it remain workable on my Mac? Why the ongoing fight with Apple?<br />Work with Samsung to improve, does not work there either?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great little app especially when you couple it with the WIFI File Explorer Pro app. Now i can transfer files between all of my devices and explore as deep as the system files!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app while reading.... its so peaceful... Set the timer and be lulled to sleep by any comforting sound you choose. I use the &quot;Night &quot; option... reminds me of the sounds when camping...that's when I sleep the best.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|my girlfriend and her sister get jealous with how cool my facebook app looks on the kindle... so much they take turns logging in so they can use it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed this sequel to the Beautiful Creatures book.  I wasn't happy with Lena's behavior, but due to circumstances, it was somewhat understandable.  There are lines in this book that would make me laugh.  I would have liked to see this made into a movie, but after the changes they made to characters and plot in the movie, I don't see how they could do it.  This book left me anxious to read the next one.  These books are full of suspense, comedy, happy times and new ideas, bravo to the authors.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|I don't really see the point in being able to use your kindle camera as anything other than a webcam, I tried this and think that people look silly hoping to capture an image that they cant fully preview while taking because the camera is on the same side as the screen but to each their own.
B00A8307BG|4.0|This is an excellent release containg some outstanding tracks, such as 'Hound Dog', 'The Thrill Is Gone', 'Little Red Rooster', among others, with Trower's killer guitar tone, but I would have thought that a musician of his calibre and experience would print composer credits for the songs he's covered!
B00899F0G8|4.0|How can you reach the end of last season and think the next could hold any new surprises?  It does.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I read it many years ago, before the movie came out. Just reread it a couple of weeks ago, still love it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is very good. I love to play this game for a long time. I recommend everyone to play 80 days
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I can definitely say that I enjoyed this read. It was a stretch from Grisham's usual, and that's not a bad thing. However, for that reason, I caution readers not to approach this with his previous works in mind. If you do, you will find the book tedious until you are well into it. :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just got it and I have had a really fun time playing it whoever doesn't have it you should get it
B0043X1FL8|5.0|The movie arrived as promised in new condition. I enjoyed the movie and the process of acquiring the movie was very easy. I recommend amazon for your movie purchases. PS the price was right.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It is a wonderful kids movie however it skipped and froze a lot and we had to keep getting out out of the movie and logging back into it to start it back up where it froze at.
0634022296|5.0|I have really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn Beatles songs.  I liked it so well that I purchased two more copies to give to my friends (I only have 2).  Thanks, Lee

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like this app because it keeps me organized before I got this app it was just so hard keeping organized. I was always losing my note books for school.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I am not an artist but this app is amazing to use. It works perfectly. The number of tools available are limited but  using them in different combinations lets you create some real professional looking artwork. This is not  a  just a doodle pad but  a real artists palette.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It was very good! The most intense and my favorite was when Kevin came to Southport. How Katie fought for her family and their safety.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The plot, though intriguing and current, loses it's potential impact due to poor editing and the overuse of literary devices. Laura's character is never fully developed, and there is too much fore shadowing of how the story will ultimately end. On the bright side, it is a &#34;good&#34; read, and despite these short comings keep you engaged until the somewhat unsatisfactory ending.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Awsome fit!!! I used Rit Dye to color them green and they turned out great. I just love the look and feel they give my BK2. Thanks much.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very good movie to watch, kept you interested throughout.  very good very good very good very good very good very
0345803485|4.0|I recieved the book and it was in perfect condition. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! I literally read the whole book in 2 days, it was very hard to put down and a good read. The love story that begins in this first book made it hard for me to just stop at the first book so I bought the next two on iTunes and those books are just as good. Overall I'm very happy with the book and can't wait for the 4th book!!!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Audio and video on this series is incredible for a television production.  Lots of interesting extras included in the set.  They could tone down the nudity a bit, but otherwise one of the best shows of all time.
B007STXHTM|4.0|Typical GoPro.  It is good quality but the menu screen cannot be seen adequately when the camera is in the housing, which is why it is 4 star.<br />It takes care of the quality of image problems that the original dome port has underwater.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album was released in 1998, a very good year for music. It was a huge success, but it has taken me nearly 15 years to give it my full attention. And I'm glad that I finally did!<br /><br />Since Lauryn Hill was responsible for the bulk of the writing, arranging, producing and performing, this has to be considered her creation, and so most of the credit for its success is hers. The three main elements she employs are rap, soul singing and R&B music, both old and new, used in various combinations and to various degrees, with other elements thrown in for extra spice. \\"Lost Ones\\" is a strong, confident rap (\\"My emancipation don't fit your equation...You might win some but you just lost one\\"), but it includes some harmonized singing of the choruses as well. \\"Ex-Factor\\" is a somber ballad, with the vocal high and vulnerable as the singer pleads for fairness and \\"reciprocity\\" in a relationship. Two other somber ballads are \\"When It Hurts So Bad\\" and \\"I Used To Love Him\\". In the latter, she finds redemption and announces, \\"Father you saved me and showed me that life/Was much more than being some foolish man's wife\\". In \\"To Zion\\", hip-hop blends with Latin sounds, with some help from Carlos Santana, as she expresses joy over the birth of her son. \\"Doo Wop\\" mixes rap with retro R&B, and includes the memorable hook about \\"...that thing, that thing, that thiiiing...\\". \\"Superstar\\" references the Doors hit \\"Light My Fire\\", with harmonizing voices alternating with a single gospel voice against a background of a hip-hop arrangement which features a harp, of all things. She chides the superstar: \\"Come on baby light my fire/Everything you drop is so tired/Music is supposed to inspire/How come we ain't gettin' no higher\\". \\"Forgive Them Father\\" is a mid-tempo, very serious song about false motivations and betrayal by those close to you. One memorable line in the song is \\"Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas, back stabbers do this\\". There is a rap in the middle of the song, and we get to hear some Jamaican patois at the beginning and at the end. \\"Every Ghetto, Every City\\" is a bit lighter and funkier as Lauryn reminisces about good times from back in the day. \\"Everything Is Everything\\" is dramatically serious, meant as encouragement to persevere in life's struggles: \\"Everything is everything/What is meant to be, will be/After winter, must come spring/Change, it comes eventually.\\"<br /><br />Whether this sequence was deliberate or not, the last listed track and the two bonus (hidden) tracks are all 3 positive in mood and pretty mainstream in sound. \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" is a comparatively bright-sounding ballad. The cover of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" is faster than the original, but that fits in with the hip-hop arrangement and happy vibe. \\"Tell Him\\" is practically a breezy pop song with a hip-hop beat.<br /><br />To emphasize the theme of (mis)education, there are interludes between the musical tracks in which we hear interaction between a teacher and some students. But I think that we, the public, are the ones truly enlightened by this album.the song, and we get to hear some Jamaican patois at the beginning and at the end. \\"Every Ghetto, Every City\\" is a bit lighter and funkier as Lauryn reminisces about good times from back in the day. \\"Everything Is Everything\\" is dramatically serious, meant as encouragement to persevere in life's struggles: \\"Everything is everything/What is meant to be, will be/After winter, must come spring/Change, it comes eventually.\\"<br /><br />Whether this sequence was deliberate or not, the last listed track and the two bonus (hidden) tracks are all 3 positive in mood and pretty mainstream in sound. \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" is a comparatively bright-sounding ballad.

1401323820|5.0|This book is so similar to the T.V. Show that of course  I picture that gentleman as Richard Castle in the book.  He is such a crack-up, and the story is terrific.  I love all of his books and appreciate them more because of the t.v. show.  The books that he writes are all so interesting that it is very hard to put down.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|sit back and expect outlandish story lines and outcomes.  The writers must have had a ball writing this series  as it is rather unbelievable but that is what makes it so entertaining.  A must see for those who want a fast paced and mindless violent series.....I recommend it highly.....

B00BG08FKK|5.0|I am so excited that the actual full soundtrack to the movie has been released!  I loved the highlights CD, but it just wasn't the same since many of the 'big' songs (Do You Hear the People Sing being one of them) were not there.<br /><br />I'm loving the live singing as well.  Hearing the rain while Eponine sings 'On My Own' is amazing.  You feel like you're back in the movie theater watching it.  Or at least I do.<br /><br />I never purchased the highlights CD, but I did download a couple songs... I'm glad I waited for this!  However, a Les Mis fan like myself (I have every version of the stage show on CD!) can never have too many versions of this beautiful musical.<br /><br />Even if you have already purchased the highlights CD, I highly recommend buying this version as well, just so you have all of the songs.
B003ASLJKO|3.0|I'd say there's a reason that you don't hear much aboiut this movie, nor do you see it for sale, very often.  However, if you like these guys, it will keep you entertained.
0394800184|5.0|Or rather, loses his mother.  This is a great book for children whose' mother is gone, and<br />the father has to make a mystery story to explain it.  Children are afraid to get lost, and not be found, or to lose their mother.  Too many divorced mothers think, or hope to feel that they can raise children without a father.  Wrong!<br />Also, it helps if you have a friendly &#34;snort&#34; to help you get back into your nest.
1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is one of the best modern novels I've read.  Cleverly written and utterly suspenseful, the multiple plot lines make this a real page-turner.  While I think this is the best among Kate Morton's novels, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending any of her books.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|How can this package already be getting reviews when it is not scheduled for release for six more weeks?  Also, why are all the reviews the same for each of the three editions being offered?  Do they all have the same stock-keeping unit number??
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book because it's funny. I rated a five star because I like the details and the illustrations. I've loved diary of a wimpy kid since I was 5, I'm 12 now. Hope they make a new diary of a wimpy kid.!!!!:)

B007L3BMGA|4.0|People go on about the Erotica in this book but ask anyone who has actually read it and they will tell you it is so much more. For the record it is not a book about a girl being dominated by a guy. it is a fantastic book to inspire woman to be strong independent and comfortable in themselves and there sexuallity. Should be mandatory reading for all woman.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Great set.  The last season saw many great episodes.  Too bad the show ended.  The last episode was well worth the wait.

B003102JDM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I Believe I watched over 10 times.  There are very subtle nuances in the movie which I did not fully appreciate until I goggled the movie and read what Wikipedia said about the movie.  Watch the movie read Wikipedia.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Of course i love it! its the twilight saga! lol and love that it had the second disc with it!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|I love the movie and was excited to see it available in 3D, but the 3D is sub-par compared to what is available today. I guess you can't expect a lot from a movie that wasn't filmed to be in 3D. It is different, just don't expect to be wowed by the effects. It's just OK.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|incredible photography. Says a lot with no words. It is a true test of a video system and a joy to see. Music is very good as well. would love to see more like this.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Note: I originally wrote this review for my blog, Real Appetite.<br /><br />Michael Moss, the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist who brought \\"Pink Slime,\\" the beef by-product, to light in 2009 (which might still be in your store- or restaurant-bought ground beef, by the way), brings us this book, which tackles the way the food industry works to get us hooked on three very powerful components that form the backbone of the processed-food industry: Salt, sugar, and fat.<br /><br />This book was absolutely fascinating. It is broken up into three parts (you guessed it: sugar, fat, and finally salt) and Moss presents case studies from different companies using products we all know and love. And those companies (Kraft, Dr. Pepper, Frito-Lay, Oreo, Campbell's  and more) know just how much we love these products. And they know what three ingredients make us love them so much that processed food is a multibillion-dollar business enveloping the whole world.<br /><br />And it's not just the private companies. The government plays a huge role. Did you know that the USDA actually advertises for the dairy and beef companies? The Farm Bill requires (stupidly, in my opinion) for the government to buy any unsold beef products. So in order to buy less themselves, they advertise to make us buy more (To be fair, the money comes from the dairy and beef companies, not taxpayer dollars. But the USDA manages all the advertising for them). Since this program went into effect in 1985, the USDA has spent $2 billion advertising beef to Americans.<br /><br />And cheese: ever since people became terrified of whole milk (which is only about 3.5 percent fat, something many people don't realize) and switched to skim, there were tons of milk fat sitting around. And it was going for cheap. So what did the food industry start doing? First they developed a manufacturing technique (using chemicals, of course) that could significantly cut the time it took to make cheese, compared to the traditional methods. And then they put it into everything, of course! And I mean everything. Four-cheese frozen pizzas with a cheese-filled crust. An explosion of new cheeses in the deli section. Crackers bursting with cheese. Dozens of new flavors of chips. Even chocolate cream cheese. You know, for dessert. Or breakfast. Whatever. Cheese became an ingredient rather than a special topping or a rich appetizer to be savored.<br /><br />The thing about processed food is, very rarely is an item created because customers are clamoring for Spicy Six-Cheese Cheetos. Most of us were perfectly content with crunchy or puffy before all these other varieties came along. Same goes for crackers, cookies, ice creams, yogurts. These food giants create things because they want to sell more, want to make more money, and want to make their investors on Wall Street happy. Most of them don't give a damn that we are getting fatter and sicker. They defend themselves by saying, \\"well, no one is holding a gun to anyone's head and shoving Triple Double Oreos down their throats.\\"<br /><br />And they argue this any time the FDA tries to set limits on how much salt, sugar, and fat we consume. Or they buy out scientists or doctors who will say that their products aren't harming us and the government is just trying to push the nanny state on us, the gall!<br /><br />But these companies know that salt, sugar, and fat make these foods irresistible to us. And that we will sit down with a bag of chips and eat not one, but four servings at a time. And that we will buy time and time again. All this is because of the way our brains react to fat, salt, and sugar. Moss visits research facilities where they test new products, such as one where they are trying to reach the \\"bliss point\\" for a new flavor of soda - the point where there's just enough sugar: any less or more and we wouldn't drink enough. Or showing that there is seemingly no limit to the amount of fat that tells our brain, \\"enough already.\\"<br /><br />The bookdiscusses the guerilla tactics used by these companies, which use many of the same marketing ploys as the tobacco companies. Just as the tobacco companies marketed slim or filtered cigarettes to women, Big Food advertises with cartoon characters to children, or tells harried moms they are making a smart choice when they pick a \\"fortified\\" cereal, nevermind that it is 50 percent or more sugar.<br /><br />Moss speaks with several reformed executives and food scientists who realized the plight their products were causing and tried to get their companies to voluntarily reform. As you can guess, many were relegated to lower positions or fired. But the bottom line always is, the only thing that matters is the bottom line.<br /><br />A section of this book is dedicated to Lunchables, that little compartmentalized tray of fatty, salty goodness that kids seem to love oh so much. I was one of those kids. I remember begging my mom to buy them for me, especially the pizza ones. I distinctly remember the \\"crusts\\" tasting like cardboard and the sauce being super-sweet. But it didn't matter, because I could \\"make\\" my own lunch - which is exactly what the advertising wanted us kids to think. I also remember occasionally getting the ones with a Capri Sun and a fun-sized Snickers, loaded with several teaspoons worth of sugar on top of all the fat and salt in the rest of the package.<br /><br />This product was not invented because moms were asking for it. It came about because Oscar Mayer had so much extra bologna it didn't know what to do with, ever since America started shunning saturated fats in the early '80s. I am certain my mom had no idea how much sugar, salt, and fat this seemingly innocuous lunch contained. I am also certain if she were aware, she would've steadfastly refused to buy them for me (I'm pretty sure she eventually figured it out, because I don't remember my younger sister ever getting them, despite their ubiquity in the grocery store to this day).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the way Big Food operates. It is a fascinating look into just how we got so hooked on junk food from a psychobiological perspective as well as how the companies lure us in, and keep us coming back. But you can break this cycle. You can stop buying all the unnecessary chips, cookies, candies, and cakes making us so unhealthy and quite honestly, don't always taste that great. You can vote with your dollars. You can choose to eat and make real food.
B000V0ON52|5.0|This is a simple and wonderful mediation on finding meaning in life.  I bought it to share with my kids, but after reading it I don't think I will read it with my young kids until they are much older.  The Prince is depressive but learns to find meaning and joy in simple things in life.  There are some great lessons here.  But he premeditates his own death to be with his loved one and that's a tough one to explain to kids.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great app, fun to play!<br />Reminds me of old school space invaders upgraded and added in a little asteroid action
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|If you know Tim Burton's work, then you'll know exactly what to expect up front. I noticed other people were in the dark for some reason.  This movie is quirky and dark all at the same time. This movie has elements of homage to the \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" using stop-motion animation puppets. This is all in black and white which makes the characters and elements even more beautifully grotesque. The lead is a young boy who is an outcast named Victor. His best friend is his dog who ends running into the middle of the street and getting hit by a car. The dog is buried in the kind of gothic cemetery you would find in those old Hollywood black and white horror classics. Victor is also a science kid whiz and digs up the grave of his dog and uses lightning to bring him back to life. I found this darkly enjoyable. It may seem a little harsh for young kids, but considering what kids are watching today, I'm sure it's fine.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesomely fun! Lots of levels very addicting. Easy at first then it gets progressively hard.  The end boss levels do give you a challenge but very fun for a free app of the day
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I love and have loved the Alien series.  To me, this is an extremely good movie.  However, there are certain logical inconsistencies in the story.  The myth makers have fallen short. Therefore, I must give the movie 4-stars.  There are certain racial tendencies in the movie.  For instance, the Engineers are suppose to be a superior species - our creators.  But then why do they act like such brutes?  We humans have to keep reminding the Robot that He is a Robot and therefore inferior when, in fact, he is the most interesting character - both the hero and the villan - and keeps the story going.  The moral of this story should be, &#34;We should love (and respect) our creation(s) as we love ourselves.&#34;  The ultimate question - Why? Why do our Engineers want to kill us?  I think the Robot's answer makes the most sense. I guess that makes me a Robot and you an anti-robot racial bigot.  Shame on you.  No wonder the Engineers want to kill us. As for the Robot, he is as vain as we are.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my kindle fire especially when I'm passing the time at the bus stop or while on a long car trip. There should be more chances to earn investments though
B00004RJ71|5.0|A friend of mine has a housekeeper who was watching this movie on TV on her day off from her regular job.  The housekeeper did not show up at my friend's abode at the appointed time because she was engrossed with the movie.  My friend called the housekeeper to find out what the problem was.  The housekeeper quit watching the movie to come over and do her duties. They ended up having a big spat about it.  My friend wanted to make-up and restore a peaceful relationship. So she asked me to order the movie for her housekeeper.  I have not seen the movie, but I keep wondering what the fuss was all about.  Maybe the housekeeper will read this and then lend me the movie so that I can watch it. I keep thinking, &#34;What am I missing?&#34;  Maybe you can tell me.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I like this show so much. I really LOVE Reid and the banter between Derek and Penelope. Sometimes too much blood though.....<br />I am more interested in the profiling and backgrounds.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Even though Kate Morton's first 3 novels were great,this one was her best...different time frame but an even better story. Just when you think you have it figured out, you don't!

B0076DELIG|5.0|Really like Michael Connelly's writing style.  This book was an absolute pleasure to ready.  Harry Bosch is an intriguing character, the plot was interesting and there was plenty of suspense.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Cool little shooter game. Real throw back. Nice control and pace. I got it for free but definitely a game that I would pay for.

B0086449YA|5.0|I love this CD.  It's also fun to listen to the songs that Mark did on his U.S. tour last fall- especially  &#34;Yon Two Crows&#34;.  Lots of blues and one of the most beautiful songs Mark has ever written - &#34;Dream of the Drowned Submariner&#34;.  I've listened to this CD literally dozens of times and keep coming back for more.

B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This is one great CD - DVD combo.  Along with the Babel CD you also get the RED ROCKS CONCERT CD & DVD.  I just love that Red Rocks CD.  I put it on my Bose every night and fall asleep to it.  Buy it.  This is one purchase you won't regret.
B004MYFV0O|4.0|Good lessons for beginner beginner or intermediate artist.  I enjoyed each lesson lesson and found the directions simple to follow.
B008476HBM|5.0|Must read. The beginning is a little slow but it's well worth it in the end. I enjoyed it a lot
B00B671W6W|4.0|First off. Some reviewers panned this for having only 8 tracks without reading that this is a darn EP. 6 songs is the going rate for EPs. News is they'll be working on an LP toward the tail end of this year. That'll be a full length album.<br /><br />You get a good selection of songs here. A little AC/DC, a little Thin Lizzy, Cheap Trick etc. Six covers and a pair of versions of Crawl.<br /><br />I hoped for a higher octane, heavier (maybe even faster) cover of these songs but they do sound a little too close to the originals for my liking. You can hear the snippets and judge for yourself. These aren't covers like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Joe Jackson's Got The Time. You can clearly hear a lot of Anthrax in those covers instead of a lot of the original song showing through on the covered versions.<br /><br />Personal highlights, TNT, Big Eyes and Crawl.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|This is the type of novel that kept you in suspense and you realy did not know where it was going until the very end I would recommend this novel
B00BUIYJD0|5.0|This show has the potential to be special. Good, taut writing and a fantastic core cast that doesn't suffer from the bloat of other broadcast programming. Jonny Lee Miller is absolutely fascinating to watch in this role. He gives Sherlock Holmes a manic, intense energy that is very compelling. He turns eating a bowl of cereal into something worth watching. I went in with reservations about a female Watson and about Lucy Liu, but she's won me over completely. She and Miller have a great chemistry and have built a really neat dynamic. Holmes and Watson have had a very close relationship in all the adaptations, but the gender flip has really given it a fresh kind of energy. There is an undercurrent of unresolved sexual tension, but more than that it's this neat platonic romance brewing.<br /><br />Season standouts include You Do It To Yourself, the Leviathan, the superb M (introduces us to the Moriarty storyline in this universe), A Giant Gun Filled with Drugs, and Details. The latter for no other reason than it pretty much establishes the Sherlock/Watson dynamic going forward. The Deductionist features great acting on all sides.<br /><br />The show has a good start, but it gets consistently better as it rolls along. Do not be dissuaded by what feels like another CBS procedural show when you watch the first few episodes. It's slowly becoming more serialized and has now become must-see viewing for this once skeptic.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|It started strong, but wore thin as it went on (that might be a little harsh, it wasn't like &#34;oh god get me out of this please!). But it wasn't like it was terrible! I still absolutely love Tina Fey. There I did it, I reviewed her book!
B005BCE7II|4.0|We all like this movie, really enjoyed watching it in 3D with grand kids. They were so involved they actually kept on their glasses.
1433502410|5.0|My preacher recommended this Bible to me because of its commentary, not just for the version. Looking through his I found an explanation of a passage in Ephesians, which I was teaching at the time, that I felt added great insight I had to share with my class. I asked if I could take his home to look through it more. I did but knew I had to have one I owned for myself. I ordered one from Amazon and got it almost immediately. I love this Study Bible and highly recommend it, especially because of the information it has regarding the text. Excellent Study Bible for the true disciple.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book full of action and intrigue! I have always liked mystery action thrillers, and was glad to find this as I had been looking for a new novel series.  It is hard to put the book down (That is the way I like it!).  Looking forward the next book in the series \\"Die Trying\\".  The whispersync for voice feature is great.  Read while at home on the Kindle, listen on the android/iphone while in car/running errands, and back to the kindle book wherever.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Excellent movie for the family! My kids saw this in the theaters and absolutely loved it, so much so we bought it through Amazon.com. Needless to say we watched it over, over, over and again. Amazon offers exceptional HD quality movies and with DreamWorks animation the pitcher comes alive on my 3-D flat screen. Rise of the guardians is a combination of all the holidays put into one that can be played at any given season. I highly recommend this movie to any age group.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Loved the first one so why not get the second one. Movie looks great. And Robert Downey Jr. is great as well. Whats not to love?

076115678X|5.0|I've learned a lot from this book, it's very clear and easy to read.<br />I consider that the contents are appropriate, but i would have like it more if the transitioning chapter was longer. Other than that i like a lot.<br />I would recommend this books and the dvd to everyone who cares about their hair, not only curly haired people, because it's very instructive and useful.<br /><br />He aprendido mucho de este libro, es muy claro y fácil de leer.<br />Considero que el contenido es apropiado, pero me hubiera gustado mas si el capitulo de transicion de pelo relajado/desrizado/alisado a natural hubiera sido mas extenso y explicativo. Aparte de eso me gusta mucho.<br />Yo recomendaria este libro y el dvd a todo aquel que se preocupa por su cabello, no solo las personas de pelo rizado porque es muy instructivo y util.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|Cute and funny.  Delivered early and as usual no problems.  I would order some of the following series - have not had enough time to watch all of them
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Second book I read by Nelson DeMille.  Stories are interesting and full of intrigue.  Sometimes he goes into too much detail but plots keep me going.  He is a real smart mouth NY cop type and while I get tired of all the smart a** comments, they also make me laugh a lot.  I told a friend of mine to read DeMille's book to get a new repertoire of wise cracks because his were getting stale.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is a classic hero with a twist. An ex-military man who reinvents himself as an off the grid drifter with a unique skill set. Lee Child has created a character that will thrill readers young and old for decades to come.

B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is cool, once you get the hang of it, but what I don't like is how you have to wait at least 24 hrs before you and do your levels again after 2 attempts and choose not to buy more time.

B0019HQIGS|5.0|Perhaps like many of my generation I tend to view much of today's popular music as relatively shallow and uninteresting with little to add when compared to the output of the fertile period of the late 60's early 70's. Then my son played John Mayer's live acoustic version of \\"Neon\\" for me. That led to the purchase of the \\"Where The Light Is\\" DVD and to my, rather belated, discovery of a truly gifted songwriter and musician that need not take a back seat to anyone. This film captures Mayer's extraordinary artistry, versatility and commitment to excellence in his craft. Much like Martin Scorcese's \\"Last Waltz\\" the intimacy of the moment is captured and Mayer's guitar playing virtuosity is on full display. \\"Where The Light Is\\" could have benefited from more \\"off stage\\" scenes and conversations (a la \\"Last Waltz\\") but nonetheless the concert is a joy to watch for music lovers of any generation.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is about placement and if you don't put the coins exactly where they need to be this game could be tedious and time consuming waiting the 30 seconds just to get one coin.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and I use it every night.  I used to put on Pandora or iHeart Radio, but the music is too random, and the intermittent commercials would wake me up.  This app is well worth the money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great, I don't need a whole lot of symbols and things, just enough to do some basic math and percentages.
B008JFUN8C|4.0|OK -- This is a film that many critics didn't like and I admit it had a couple of draggy parts, but maybe it's my inner child, but I liked it.  It is clearly a prequel and it pays homage to the version we all know and love.  It starts in black and white and like we expect it transitions to color.  Oscar the cheap magician is transported by tornado to Oz where he is hailed OZ, the Wizard Extraordinaire.  To critics this seems to lack originality but to me it was logical and anything else wouldn't have seemed real.  I loved the characters, Finley the flying monkey was a nice addition and lent continuity to the flying monkeys of the wicked witch we all know.  The Munchkins are there -- a bit part -- but once again expected.  The three witches were very well done and explain how they became ugly and evil.  Glinda -- aka -- Wanda to the Wizard -- is also well done as she helps the Wizard fight the forces of evil.  The very best part is the final battle where Oscar the charlatan and cheap magician is transformed into OZ, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.  It truly connects this film to the original that we all know and love.  This is not an academy award film on any level but I don't it was ever intended to be anything but a fun film. If you are looking for anything dramatic and original this probably isn't a film for you, but if you want some fun entertainment then try this film.  As I said maybe it appealed to my inner child but I liked it, my kids liked it, and more importantly my grandchildren liked it.  A good companion piece to the Judy Garland version.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Kindle is secure and looks great.  Easily sets up for landscape view.  I am so glad that I bought this one.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|well worth the $1 I spent on it.....very useful for getting rid of stress after a long day at work
B008220DGE|4.0|I need to stop thinking that there's more to Paul Thomas Anderson's films.  I watched THERE WILL BE BLOOD with great interest and great admiration.  I wondered what it would all mean, since it was so clearly fraught with deep meaning and was going to make an amazing statement about...something.  Then came the final, odd scene in the bowling alley.  The film was suddenly over.  I had no deep insights.  Surely Anderson wasn't simply saying something about \\"American corporate greed\\" or how religion/money are tied together in unhealthy ways, or something vaguely disparaging about America's thirst for oil?  For all the incredible effort, all the obtuseness, all the meaningful glances and pauses...surely it wasn't as simplistic as all that?<br /><br />Then I watched THE MASTER.  Brilliantly acted and engrossing throughout.  Surely this wasn't just a simplistic statement about how some can be gullible about religion, or about how a cult develops, or even something about the American spirit yearning for fulfillment in the wake of WWII?  Then comes the final scene, and my heart was already fearful that this was going to be THERE WILL BE BLOOD, PT. 2...and sure enough, the final scene served to confuse and confound more than to enlighten.  This carefully crafted and intensely acted and FRAUGHT film really wasn't about anything terribly astute.<br /><br />Every time I dare to criticize an \\"artsy\\" film, I get feedback saying things like \\"you're obviously too stupid to get this...stick to action films.\\"  Well, I still have to call them like I see them.  I've praised many \\"artsy\\" films, including some difficult ones like SYNECDOCHE, NY, which I picked as the best film of its year.  Or even A SERIOUS MAN.  These were tough films to glean meaning from...but they both left me FEELING something specific, as though I had experienced and internalized someone else's world view.  The great absurdist play WAITING FOR GODOT is very tough to assign specific meaning to...yet it makes you feel you've reached a greater understanding of the human condition WITHOUT needing to know exactly what was going on.  I say all this to defend my ultimate critique about THE MASTER, because I don't believe I'm dumb or closed to challenging movie experiences.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but THE MASTER is the ultimate Emperor-Has-No-Clothes movie.  I enjoyed 95% of it immensely, but when the Emperor had completely finished walking by, I was angry that he deliberately wanted to make me feel like an idiot because I thought he was dressed when he really wasn't.<br /><br />By all means, see the film.  It has gorgeous cinematography.  Wonderful costumes and a great sense of style.  It recreates post-WWII American sumptuously.  The music is grating but surprisingly effective.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is riveting.  Amy Adams shows us some new stuff.  And Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the most compelling, draining performances I've seen in ages.  Honestly, the performances alone make the film well worth seeing.<br /><br />Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a deeply troubled sailor who emerges from WWII a wreck of a man.  Phoenix embodies this role so fully, I was simply amazed.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a character so uncomfortable in his own skin.  You can't keep your eyes off this angry, twitchy, oddly compelling man.  Especially when he's with Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), the pseudo-scientific, pseudo-religious cult leader who pulls Freddie into his inner circle and dazzles him with his faux insights and psycho-babble.  This cult leader is a mass of contradictions himself...but what he does is convince those around him that he's had great insights, that he's so much smarter than everyone else around him and that if THEY can't understand HIM, it's only because THEY are having a failure of comprehension, not because the beautiful words he's spouting are complete malarkey.  (Kinda like I feel Anderson is treating his audience here.)<br /><br />Quell & Dodd's relationship evolves over the years (as does their relationship with Dodd's wife, played by Amy Adams).  There are ups and downs.  Fights and reconciliations.  Steps forwards and backwards.  For ALL the characters.  It's all quite gripping and Anderson has written a wordy yet always compelling script.  His cast tears into it with gusto.  Yet for all the great melodrama unfolding, Anderson keeps a tight rein on things, never losing control of his tone.<br /><br />Anderson IS a great filmmaker.  His BOOGIE NIGHTS is one of my favorite films.  MAGNOLIA, equally obtuse as his later work, worked for me in the same way the films I mention above like SYNECDOCHE, NY did.  They resonated on an emotional level.  But Anderson, with each film, seems to strive for some emotional detachment.  BOOGIE NIGHTS is frantic, joyful, energetic & fun.  MAGNOLIA has moments of almost shattering emotion (Tom Cruise talking to his dying father, Julianne Moore losing it at a pharmacy)...but also moments of almost clinical coldness, such as in the narration that opens the film.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD takes another step towards emotional distance.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays his character is a towering, unforgettable way...yet the viewer never feels they are walking in his shoes.  And THE MASTER really challenges us not to connect emotionally.  It wants us to understand the emotions of the characters, but from arms length.  We've gone from a Beckett-like way of showing the human experience to a Brecht-like detachment.  For all his brilliance, Phoenix can't make Quell a recognizable person we can empathize with...Anderson doesn't quite give us what we need about Quell to make that leap.<br /><br />I recommend the movie...don't get me wrong.  I was just angry at it when all was said and done, and feel each viewer should go in expecting to be challenged and confounded.  For me, the challenge seemed a bit arbitrary or capricious on Anderson's part.  Perhaps you'll feel differently.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is a very entertaining game and who ever thought of this game is creative. A lot of people like temple run and this is a game that is just like! I think the company who made this game should keep up the great work!:)
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|JIRO DREAMS OF SUSHI is a gentle, amusing and hunger-inspiring documentary about the great Sushi chef in the world.  It just so happens that 85 year-old Jiro's Michelin 3-Star restaurant is in a subway station in Tokyo, and only seats 10 people at a time.  But over the decades, Jiro has mastered his craft and has not only perfected an age-old cuisine, but has revolutionized it in some ways as well.<br /><br />This is far away from being an \\"important documentary\\" that exposes deep problems or tries to inspire outrage and action.  It's the kind of documentary that draws us so deeply in to the rhythms and mysterious workings of a relatively obscure subject that we feel we have glimpsed something rare:  the beauty of the simple human desire to master a skill and bring it humbly to the world.<br /><br />Before watching the film, I had read or assumed that Jiro was a harsh-task master (the \\"soup nazi\\" of sushi) and that all trembled before him.  That he inspired reverence and fear in his children who work for him.  I was ready see a profile of an angry eccentric who was only tolerated because the sushi he made was so good.<br /><br />The actual film is much richer and more rewarding.  Yes, Jiro is single-minded in his pursuit of excellence.  He has not been the greatest father, because he's spent virtually every day of his life at his art.  But the joy he evinces in the work he does, and the great humor he, his kids (who are around 50 years old!) and his staff constantly show seems to give us a peek into a world where everyone is HAPPY to be in their place and each works selflessly in the pursuit of a goal.  Granted, one could argue that paying so much attention to the tiny details of making great raw fish for customers with lots of money is not quite as lofty as researching new drugs or educating children.  I prefer to see it as like-minded folks finding beauty in what they do and sharing it.<br /><br />We see a lot of Jiro, but we also spend a lot of time with his oldest son, who will one day take over the business.  Imagine the stress of being 50 years old and essentially still an assistant cook...knowing one day you will take over a revered business and never be able to live up to it.  I don't mean to sound condescending, but he handles this with the kind of exterior grace that I expect from traditional Japanese.  I don't personally know that culture well, but from what I've seen elsewhere and from what is articulated in this film, Jiro's children are committed to taking traditional roles behind their elder.<br /><br />It's a little sad for a Westerner like me to see...that these two grown men have led what I might see as a stunted life.  But through the laughter, joking and smiles (as well as the intensity of the work we see), I mostly saw a humble embrace of the lifestyle.  If one has to take a deeper meaning from the film, I suppose it might be that one can find fulfillment in any line of work if one pursues excellence.<br /><br />But who needs deeper meanings?  I don't like sushi much myself, but I was practically drooling to have some after seeing this movie.  We get to see so much of the actual work (from the dedicated fish buyers and rice buyers to the kitchen staff to Jiro himself molding the final product) that there is no helping the desire to partake.  Who wouldn't want to try some tuna that's been prepared with such loving, meticulous attention?  As a simple, pleasant feast for the senses...JIRO succeeds mightily.  It's 90 minutes well spent in the company of some fascinating people who make some darn tasty food.
B008VBYN80|5.0|great game I only wish they gave more diamonds; and not take up as much megabytes. I still like it though.
B007EDZ20O|5.0|I write those words in reference to the woman, not the author. Hitchens work is important simply because those who would impose their world view on all of us continue to use the good Mother as a catalyst.
1938469003|4.0|I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my daughters boyfriend. Apparently it has got all the information that he needs for making a good brew.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have read Grisham books for years. It doesn't matter if it's one of his legal thrillers or a baseball tale - he is a master raconteur and I love his books. He is an author who loves the written word and it shows in all his books. That written, I have enjoyed some of his books more than others. And \\"The Litigators\\" (boring title aside) is the best book he's written for quite a while and a very fun romp through legal land.<br /><br />Street lawyers aka \\"ambulance chasers\\" Oscar Finley and Wally Fogg run a \\"boutique\\" firm in south Chicago. By per happenstance, Harvard trained attorney David Zinc ends up on their doorstep, after walking out of his very lucrative high pressure job with one of Chicago's top legal firms. He is smashingly drunk and for whatever reason they hire him on as an associate.<br /><br />There is a major mass tort case and a few sideline cases/stories and Grisham does what he does best. He tells a story.<br /><br />Well-rounded characters, a dramatic storyline with a lot of humor thrown in this time, legal lessons to be learned, a few twists and turns - all make up for a Grisham thriller I thoroughly enjoyed.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I've read probably 20 King books now and have many favorites, but this is the best one I've read yet. I love how he goes back in forth with the character's childhoods and their adult life, showing how much things change and yet seem the same. No one writes coming of age books better then king. So many of the chapters where the kids are just playing in barrens and biking remind me and I'm sure many other readers of our own group of friends when we were young (hopefully none of you had a killer monster after you). He plays with real-life situations kids deal with along with fantastic horror situations that you'd never imagine dealing with. Many readers dislike Kings length to some of his novels especially this at over 1300 pages, but its a page turner and took me about 6-7 days to finish and I only read about 1-2 hours on a good day. So the plot is well worth the added bulk, and in my opinion the more pages he writes the more bang for you're buck. The ending is a bit strange, but like most King books its the journey you take to get to the ending which is so interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes King or anyone who reads novels in general. Very good read.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|It's one of those CDS you can listen to start to finish. Bey at her best. Love it I definitely recommend it.
B00B2TUKI0|2.0|Peyroux brings nothing new to most of these songs, which have been endlessly covered.  I have heard more interesting versions of many sung by lounge singers.  And the strings - good grief, the strings.  From time to time, a few tasty licks from the backing musicians, but the producer made sure that mostly they didn't interact with the vocals.  The song selection is beyond puzzling: what WAS she thinking?  Cohen's \\"Bird on the Wire\\" seemed to go on forever, its brilliant lyrics ground into submission by a lifeless recitation.  What a disappointment.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I CRIED through much of this book and at times wanted to  throw it at the ground and run from it. A good book leaves you thinking because you feel it. This book is sobering yet holds a whimsical love story. You feel their desperation and share in that anxiety, but understand that everything comes to an end.
B004C0WVP6|5.0|I got this on time and was packed well this work great now I have more than enough room to save my files and back up my PC thanks allot.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Dear Friend,<br />This book made me cry, laugh, and tilt my head in confusion. This book is perfect for me because people in my school think I'm weird but after reading this I wonder why they think I'm weird when the are probably weirder than I am. It's very inspiring for teens who suffer from bullying and/or abuse and even adults. Charlie's family and friends go through everyday situations that many have to go through. This book is definitely the greatest book I have read.<br />Yours Truly,<br />Carina
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Disney makes good children movies my granddaughters and I always look forward to the Tinkerbell movies and I love how they created a sister for Tinkerbell. Awesome.
0307341550|5.0|I absolutely love this book. The author's style of writing is very unique. The story is well written & keeps you guessing the whole time....just so you know most of the time you will be wrong. I reccomend this to people who like edgy,disfunctional family, and seriously screwed up characters stories.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Enjoyed every bit of this book. It inspires me to go out and do more. A great read for those searching for fitness inspiration.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I have loved all Liane Moriarty's books, but this one is something else. I feel like I know these people which makes their dark secrets and their pain all the more shocking. I recommend this book unreservedly.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is reminiscent of a lot of games that I've played in the past and that is a good thing. I got this a faotd but it is definitely worth 2.99.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is great for all of my needs. I will purchase another one soon for my friends camera and accessories as well.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The premise was fascinating but I was disappointed with the ending.  It didn't need a happy ending but it certainly needed a satisfying ending.
B008FOB124|5.0|I did not know this was a recent album until I checked the lyrics and the history.  Their first in 16 years.  His voice is much more intense than before and hers as beautiful as ever.  I can play their music time and time again and it feels as if it was yesterday when I got their first album.  I was so young then and it is so beautiful to hear them play again.<br />I wish they did a concert at Strathmore in Maryland, USA sometime in 2013.  They don't fall under one musical category per se and that is what makes them so interesting, the combination of sounds, their voices, lyrics and the tranquility that their energy bring to one's soul is what, to me, makes Dead Can Dance so special.
B000HEVALC|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  Just a group of country boys, so young, all destined for super stardom, who just wanted to jam together.  They talk to one another, try different keys, and such a peek into the music business you never get.....
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am not socially skilled speaking or writing so this is akward for me.  However the first book of theirs I encountered was while traveling in Austraila and I became an instant fan.  I have read everthing they have written together and am now working on their individual works.  I tell everyone I know who reads they are a must.  When I read their books I get nothing else done.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a blow by blow account of the killing of Osama Bin Laden.  I enjoyed it very much and were so proud of our brave Navy Seals...
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. Smooth, simple gameplay and retro style graphics with a 3d and well shaded twist make this game awesome.
B00AO686MY|1.0|I thought I was buying the Blu-ray in Blu-ray packaging, with the blu-ray cardboard sleeve around it. What i got was the movie with no sleeve. I'm sure the blu-ray is fine, but when I buy something and its not how its been described and pictured i dont like that. If you dont care about the sleeves on movies, then it won't bother u. I just happen to like that and expect it on a movie that I preordered, especially when its on the Blu-ray in the picture attached.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|I don't really use it much. But it's nice knowing that I can play a game when I'm bored or waiting in line somewhere.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|this dumb game crashed my kindle!!! I had to get a new one...and I almost beat my friends high score one temple run...:(
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Florence and the Machine offers up a great new sound.  I thoroughly enjoyed the CD after recently discovering this artist.  After listening to this Cd I went out and purchased Ceremonials which is awesome as well.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were fantastic. Very sensual and romantic.  Will recommend and have recommended to several friends.  A must read collection.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|bought the collection just to have it I don't know why we have to write so many words ,makes me feel like I'm back in school
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie. I like how it tell the truth about what it was like being the black help in the 60's. And I love Ceila and Skitter.
B00BF11STU|3.0|It's an ok movie. Some of the scenes are a little contrived, and it's pretty much what you expect it to be. I dont think it should have been up for any academy awards.
159420411X|4.0|I thought statistiical analysis was a boring subject - until now. Nate Silver has provided a facinating presentation of complex subjects like the economy, housing bubble, CDOs, etc. Nate has made them interesting.
B004LROMX4|5.0|All I can say is get it, im waiting for season 2 on bluray! it has nice effects! nice story! nice actors!! and a very original story about Alien invasion! it really gets you! lots of action!
6305499365|3.0|I recommend this to anyone who hates their job and would love to be able to quit.  The guy with the glasses and the orange Swingline stapler is hilarious.  Garry Cole does a perfect smarmy boss anyone would hate
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This is a perfect move into bluray!! this movie looks awesome! has DTS HD Sound!! hook it up with a nice home theater and you are good to go! michael jackson classic adventure makes you wanna dance!! its a classic!! the king of pop really rocks in this bluray!
0061719544|5.0|You get to see a more serious side of Craig in this memoir, where he details his struggle with alcoholism. However, it is far from maudlin in tone and is very entertaining. Some great stories and loads of his signature humor!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|probably one of the best science fiction movies I have ever watched! must be in every science fiction fan collection! I do recommend the blu ray edition instead of the regular DVD since dvd does not do justice for the beautiful scenes!
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Very mellow and relaxing, which I love, but the tracks are way too long. I spend far too much time wondering when each song will be over and that shouldn't happen on any album.<br /><br />But otherwise it would be a five-star album. He took a style cue from Robin Thicke and did a great job with it.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|What can you espect from the original ALIEN director? only the best! this is an excellent prequel to the Alien series, it has the best special effects to date! and a nice misterious story! it does not end there! wait for the next movie &#34;paradise&#34; on a couple of years to explain more of the origin of the Alien!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is an excellent album to put on and zone out to. Whether I am on the track running or sitting at my desk at work, it makes the time go by much faster. There is a great mix of tempos to focus on which makes it a great all around album.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|What can I say? this is LEd Zeppelin, one of the most influential rock bands of all time! love the bluray! beautifull sound! this is a master piece of rock that every led zeppelin rocker must have! get it from amazon! cheaper, better, faster!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Finally got it.  Great tunes, great singers, great music! I love the show, lots of music all through each episode.
B00402FGEE|5.0|This series is great, I missed BSG when it ended, but this gave me a darker look of deep into space dramas, this is probably one of the best science fiction series out there, (it has nothing to do with the adventure-style-childish style of stargate saga) this os a whole different drama, more serious. Love Rush!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is worth the money(if you like to be scared it is). I was colecting a sign and then I went into corner and turn around. There he was. GAME OVER!!! I got really scared.
B0030BOCF0|5.0|This is a record LP that will be considered as one of their best albums! it will also be a rare piece to collect with time! it has a great sound! good build quality 2LP 180gram Vinyl! I do recomend it, get it from amazon if possible!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is super fun. I love G5 games, they are addictive and challenging.  I like the way this game makes you think think and use your brain.
B009KEN87O|5.0|A quality homage to classic shooters. Adds new graphics and optional objectives to keep the old-school feel fresh without corrupting the spirit of vintage gaming.
B000WN8AHA|5.0|flash back to when i was a kid enjoyed putting this kit together. this is a great kit i have it finished and sitting with others in the series. Came with the figures shown. Very good detail, not many extras.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I love anything with a love story but there was a lot of sadness in this book and there wasn't enough happiness to balance it out. For a book that spends so much time discussing happy endings, the ending could have been much happier or at the very least more detailed.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I love this case. It's not to big and protects my Iphone. The back is interchangeable so you can swap different colors if you choose to do.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|He is a poet who people didn't know about until now. This showcases his awesome lyrics that people just weren't ready for back then.
B00442OHNG|5.0|I actually love Sarah, (Chuck's better half) but Chuck (and Morgan, Casey, the Buy More crew ) are hilarious! This is one of the best spy comedy series ever to come to television I have all the seasons in one form or another and I'm gonna miss the show!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Was wondering what the South Aficans saw that we in America didn't. After hearing this CD I totally understand where they are coming from.
B000784WMW|2.0|The movie was so hyped up by reviewers, I had to purchase it. I love Jane Eyre. But this is the worst one I've ever seen. It was done almost like a play or a really old soap opera. And even though it went along with the book more than others, my favorite rendition is STILL the Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A must see. If you are a fan of music then this is one that you have to see. Appreciate it.
0307596885|5.0|I just finished the book and enjoyed each short story.  I will definitely re-read it to savor the short, succinct writing style of this very prolific<br />womens' writer.
B00979CS50|4.0|New tracks, but the closest Neil has come to Rust Never Sleeps - one of the all time top 10 albums. Turn it up and enjoy!!
B00BRUYQFC|2.0|I'm truly a JT fan.  I loved his songs with N'Sync and even his last 2 albums, but this one...ehh.<br /><br />The producers were trying to hard.  I definitely wasn't feeling the musical arrangements.  It was weird.  That Blue Ocean Floor song gave me goosebumps...and not in a good way.<br /><br />I will say I loved one single called Mirrors.  I don't know if he's talking about Jessica Biel but whoever he's talking about, you can definitely feel and hear the love in that song.  Definitely will be on repeat.  The rest of the songs are forgettable...including suit and tie.
B000002OVJ|4.0|A fossil who saw the Beatles, Stones et al in the '60s, I consider The Who right up there with the top bands of the era. Did not manage to see them at Leeds but saw their show in Adelaide, South Australia. This album brings back many happy memories and production wise, passes the test of time. A lot of Tommy tracks and that album was a groundbreaker. With the extra tracks, top value.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is a great film. Everything about it is good; from acting to the reasonably close story with actual history. I already own this film in DVD, but decided to buy it in blu-ray as well. I'll just give the other copy to someone else. The blu-ray is great. It's one of those movies with beautiful scenery and worth the better image.
B0031RS44S|4.0|Great at always and didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to my friends.  Jack Reacher means business and doesn't hold back!
B0015YGA0Y|5.0|Great for the students in my Spanish classroom.  They like this group and their music.<br />They have accompanying sheets of the words in Spanish as well as English.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun and easy to play.  A nice selection of horses to choose from including some fantasy unicorns!  I wish they had some Arabians though.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My kids love it - I have 11 kindles I bought with my personal money - to use in the classroom with the special needs kids I teach. I also bought the one for the IPads (2 are the school 3 are mine) - the kids love it - but this one is not working right - I thought maybe I had it on too many of the devices - so I tried to buy it again to appease the owners of the app - the store will not let me buy another one and these have stopped working since you put this one and Batman on sale - my kids are mad at me - could please fix the problem - the apps worked long enough to get them hooked - the kids will work all day for the fifteen minutes to play your games and they had been asking their parents to buy it for them - but if they don't work here - they won't ask to have them bought at home - the same with Batman - and I paid full price for Batman - out of my money not the school to reward the kids I teach because their scores were high on the standard testing - could you please fix this - it took forever to get the games downloaded even on an excellent wi fi and now they don't work and the boys all mad - did I mention I have 55 kids on my caseload and 40 are boys. Please fix this problem with spiderman and batman - I gave you five star for how they worked when they worked - but I will review it again on the ipad if you do not fix them soon - you are disappointing my 40 boys and making life difficult. Not to mention the four and five year old boys I tutor think I did something to it - thanks for the lovely names they have called me for your game  that has stopped working - IT IS ONE THEIR FAVORITE APPS WHEN IT WORKS - COULD YOU FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ON BEHALF OF MY 40 - 5, 6, 7, 8, AND 9 YEAR BOYS - FRUSTRATED TEACHER
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a GREAT weekend book. Pat, the narrator, gives you a CURRENT/MODERN, comical look at dealing with Bipolar disorder.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book. It will make you laugh, have compassion for those suffering with mental illnesses and will leave your heart warm.<br /><br />The movie is different but equally as great.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful read that will leave you feeling like you have a new friend.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Amazingly detailed story of the third manned expedition to Mars, and the accidental stranding of a crewman there when the rest of the team left quickly in an emergency.  The science is fascinating, and mostly believable.  The character is brave, resourceful, methodical and...funny!  What a bonus to find a thoroughly human hero: eat that Marvel comics!  Partly told through his journal and partly through the eyes of people on earth and elsewhere, it reads like a news story and can't be put down.  I only hope this author has more on the way.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book illustrated the invisible connections formed between people and the often unknown repercussions that result. Although I survived adolescence many years ago, I found myself intrigued by the reviews. This book portrayed the complexities of emotions that impact the decisions we make.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great episode. Great episode. Great episode. Great episode. Great episode. Great episode. Hate that I have to have so many words in this.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is the best book since Cabinet of Curiosities! It keeps you intrigued the entire time.  I couldn't tear myself away.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Outstanding graphics and nice sound effects and music.  Takes me back to my days of playing space invaders but don't have to keep pumping in a quarter to play.
B007ZY7WQE|5.0|a song of ice and fire is by far the best fantasy book series i have ever read. this deal is great because it is fairly cheap for the first four books
B009KEN87O|5.0|I wholeheartedly agree with the rest of the reviews that say they were put off at first by the look of the game...only to download it and be blown away by the retro &quot;space invaders&quot;/&quot;yars revenge&quot; type fun. DOWNLOAD THIS APP!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a story of the relationship between 3 teenagers (Hazel, Augustus,& Isaac) that meet in Cancer Supper Group. Each of their stories are intriguing, insightful , as well as inspiring! They deal with their cancers in such a head on fashion & with attitude that only teenagers could!!<br />I thought this book was going to be hard to read due to the topic but I and most of the ladies in our reading group couldn't put it down! I was especially impressed that the author was able to write the story from a teenage girl's point of view so effectively. This book made me laugh and cry!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This movie has always been a classic, but in 3D, awesome. Great crisp detail. Highly suggest to any 3D collection!
8866130923|5.0|I use this Moleskine planner for by personal finance recorder and it works perfect and is not bulky and provides plenty of room for notes.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hope next one is better - a continuation.  I really enjoyed the descriptiveness of the author - in all the scenes.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love this book and can`t wait to read the next book in the series. It was worth the money I payed!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was equally as exciting as the first. It takes you on a journey of emotions from page to page. I found myself laughing, crying, and getting angry all in the same chapter! The characters in this series really come to life. Best science fiction I have read in a long time!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game ROCKS if you like action packed fun games then this game is for u if you like boring stupid games then don't get this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this for my 8 year old and he just LOVES it. If I let him, he'd play 24/7!!<br />He's getting very creative with all the worlds he creates and all the endless features that can be added...<br />Nice game!
1250012570|4.0|I just read Rainbow Rowell's second novel, Eleanor and Park.  I loved her first novel, Attachments, and I read through this new book very quickly.  It's set in high school, in 1986, and it's the story of an unlikely romance between a geeky half-Korean boy and a poor, offbeat girl from a disastrous home.<br /><br />It's incredibly well-written and very powerful.  It transported me straight back to high school.  And that's the problem, for me, with this book.  I HATED high school.  If I was offered $10 million to go back to being 16 again and reliving it, I'd tear up the check.  And, looking back objectively, it wasn't really that bad at all.  But at the time,  in my head, where everything that happened to me was the most horrible, tragic, awful thing that ever happened, or ever could happen to anyone, ever, in the whole history of the world, and no one else knew what it was like (except for everyone else my age, who felt exactly the same way!), it was an unending nightmare of misery.<br /><br />And this book brings that feeling home expertly.  Rowell's writing is beautiful, and also clever.  The characters are compelling and feel real.  She really does put the reader right back there in 10th grade.  She does a masterful job of it.  The only problem is, I don't want to go.<br /><br />On the other hand, if high school wasn't the most miserable time of your life (or if it was, but you're more mature and together than me and can look back on it without suffering panic attacks), you'll absolutely love this book, and you ought to read it immediately.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well I have never played Angry Birds, but my son sure loves it. If he's happy then so am I!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A classic!! Loved it! My kids can't stop talking about it. Ang Lee  is a wonderful director. Exquisite imagery. The only sad thing is the story behind the scenes --- the folks who worked on CGI lost their jobs an company gone bankrupt.  Well hopefully after all the a advent awards -- things have changed .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks doesn't disappoint. It is a cute fast read, perfect for a weekend. Bonus the movie is out too. Although they almost never get the movie right.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book right from the first page! The twists and turns were expertly written and the way the characters were described I would have loved to meet all of the in person. A wonderful story
B007SYWFRM|2.0|The app doesn't load real good. It crashes a lot and used to be my favorite game in till it started to crash down. Here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Crashes a lot!!!<br />Needs to load constantly.<br />And gets boring after a while.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Good graphics<br />Some movie trailers<br />Fun mini games
B009KEN87O|5.0|I had forgotten how addictive space invaders was. This is an excellent implementation on the Kindle Fire. I got it on the FAOTD, but it's cerrtainly worth the two and a hall bucks they're asking now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a joyous wonder of ups downs ins and outs I really understand the hype of this wonderful illustrated book
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Raw, moving fun gritty. Great music. I even bought the soundtrack. John Cameron Mitchell amazes me. This is one of those movies you put in when you're having a bad day and need something to remind you that it's not all bad.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Can't wait for the series.<br />Love the complexity of the characters, makes them more realistic.  I hope Martin writes the rest of the books quickly.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I probably should spring for the tablet version. As I'm on the Kindle HD 8.9, it's a little large for the screen, and could use it downsized. What can I say. Next!
B000W967UQ|5.0|Another great discworld book!<br /><br />Thank you Terry.<br /><br />A A A A A A A A A A A A +
B0064X7FVE|5.0|As a snow-bird, keep track of how happy I am to be in Florida, instead of New York State.<br />Also keep track of the weather where each of my kids live, simple.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The author's goal was to let others know what a Seal experiences both while becoming one and when being one, especially at the highest level. He then gives a clear account of those dangers also experienced when facing Osama.<br />A Seals life experience has been portrayed by others too and this book reinforces those but goes into more detail of the training and dedication leading to become a Seal.
0761169253|5.0|A wake up call and jolt into action. You can't deny the facts, straight talk and best of all, the strategy. Can't wish for being younger, can only do, and right now.
030759565X|5.0|I also bought this delightful book for a dear friend who loves cooking and baking as much as I do.
B008D30K7E|4.0|Twists and turns over 100 years.. Very funny story and extremely enjoyable to read..can't help liking all the characters good and bad.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I've been watching this movie every year or so since it was released, and I still love it after 50+ years.  Makes me laugh out loud. The animal shots are amazing, and the scenes make you feel as if you're part of the capture team.  This is a movie for almost everyone
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this game every day. I love that it never seems to end and always has new quests to accomplish.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|So far I am really enjoying this game. The hidden objects are the best I have seen in any game so far! Kudos to the artists! I will look for more from this group!
B009KEN87O|3.0|It installed but just kept throwing an error and only option was to force close.  I love the old school games and wish this one work run on my thrive.  Maybe an update will come out soon.
1577314808|3.0|Just got tired of all the NOW illustrations.<br />Overdone in my opinion. Maybe OK for<br />someone new to the idea of NOW.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My wife loves playing this game on her kindle. It's very realistic and she says it's a very relaxing game. Would recommend it for those who love horses.<br />It's even easy for all ages to play.
0452289963|5.0|Had so many notes with this book! I really loved it!<br />Lots of Aha moments and  lots of<br />appreciation for it. Worth it for sure.<br />Worht re reading many times.!
0439023513|4.0|read this. it's good! recommend reading it. nice story and follow up to the other two books so check it out
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Easy to read. Kept me curious all the way through. Hoping for his happy ending. Enjoyed it very much. Can't wait to see if the movie plays right.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the game it is very addicting I don't like the fact that it cost money or that you have anything to do without energy. Overall the game is fun.
B009KEN87O|5.0|One of the best apps of the day I have seen, great retro feel to it and good time killer
B009KEN87O|5.0|Sweet game. Fun and  easy to play very addicting and worth the download. So what are you waiting for? Download it now.
0141439475|5.0|I already read the book and it was in excellent condition. my love,blessings and all the good wishes to the person who sent the book in such good care.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|If you love Ice Age, what more do you need to know.<br /><br />I am a fan of Ice Age so adding to my collection was not a question of value. However, the combo pack is great. You are set for viewing in all current formats out there. So if you're traveling or packing the kids over to grandma's house you can take the appropriate version with you.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i really enjoyed this game because i love zombies and i love killing zombies as a samuria. this isnthe best game ever
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Love to find a new band with a fresh sound and some raw authenticity, and found it here. There are three or four great songs on this album, inlcuding Radioactive, Tiptoe, It's Time, and Amsterdam. Love the mandolin sound and the upbeat march through some challenging stuff.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Ok I was very nervous when downloading but this is truly the best facebook app ive seen. better than phone android, iphone and mobile online. I dont know if people need to update their kindles or something but none of these problems exist for me.<br /><br />I bought my 7&quot; HD in jan 2013 and this app does things not listed in features for an example if some one post an album you can side swype and browse the entire album from the news feed. The news feed update perfectly fine and notifies you when new things come up. I however cant save pictures but I can email them to myself. There are litterally tons of unmentioned features, I honestly think most dont have some setting enabled or are not up to date this just might be the best thing since sliced bread!!!!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I am on my third one atm the first just stopped working after about a year, the second did the something at 13 months, I checked board and internal battery cant physical see any failures and the battery's fine also. I cant complain to much I've had things work for less time and explode on me so...<br /><br />But really if you hearing impaired this is the unit you want, Fiio has bigger more powerful units if needed also.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|enjoyable game, though the gems would be nicer to earn a bit faster, without dl'ing other games. especially when they pop up in what I assume to be Chinese or Japanese. other than that, its quite nice.
B002XISFGS|4.0|Not much new here. Film is still slow, talky and derivative. Too much special effects, not enough character development. Yet, grandest of all the Star Trek films in terms of scope.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is second to none. Film shows signs of being rushed in post-production, which it was. Director's Edition solves some of those problems.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a delightful and clever book. The main character is very likable and so clever and smart yet I never felt lost or buried under the details. I hope this author has another book in the fire.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you enjoy hard science fiction, do yourself a big favor and buy this book. You will not regret it. I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews! I will looking out for more books by this author.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I believe that this was a very well written book. I know for sure that I will be read in  the last one in the series. I just have to comment on The  fact that the middle ended up being more staged on than I thought. I believe this book to be AMAZING none the less.
B003PAXONC|4.0|We all know the movie. So I'm just gonna say that this collector's edition is a great add to any collection. Especially considering that it's price meets the price of many regular editions.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is easy to play. It is a good price. Need more games as good as this one. Well written by the programmer
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Don't waist your money.  This is the worst app ever.  I would't even give it one star.  I would have loved to know that it only offered 28 US choices.
0312117337|5.0|Beautifully rendered, deeply insightful.  They sneak up on you with the power of their<br />insight and wisdom.<br />  These are ones I use.<br />  I trust.<br /> Excellent for self-reading.<br /><br /> The only other deck that I like as well ..due to the brilliance of the book that accompanies it are<br />the Angelic Messenger Deck by Sowers.  That one particularly explains relationships brilliantly.<br /><br />  This deck seems to have a more universal message.<br />  Both very good.
0307595579|5.0|First I would just like to say that this exact box set is for $100 at Barnes and Noble. I will review the Box set, then the book itself.<br /><br />The Set is beautiful and sturdy, You will have them for a long time, and the design is very classy. And they're readable without ruining the books.<br /><br />The book is more than just a book on espionage, and action, and detective work. It will have a profound impact how you look at women forever.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is the second book I've read from Colleen Hoover, and once again I'm pleased. I enjoy we d this book so much I read it in a day, even though it isn't a long book to begin with... but anyway . Once I finished reading Slammed I purchased its sequel an  can not wait to start reading it.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is an amazing book - I could easily read it over and over (with perhaps a year or two in between).<br />At least the priest in the story was interested in a gal - that makes a change from real life.<br />A must read and of course set in New Zealand and Australia, the lifestyle if very true to real life in those countries during those years.
B0070NSPCU|3.0|This novel starts off ok with a group of friends going through bootcamp together kind of predictability. However, when the story starts to get into the proper story it starts to get a bit silly.  The main character, Vaelin, comes across as a self-righteous sourpuss who's decisions are whimsical making the storyline thin and watery.  I won't be reading any more books in this series.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Seems to match the crisis our country is really having with all the<br />petty politicians.  Good flic.  Want number three.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a \\"thriller\\" from the beginning!  You think you have it figured out, a third of the way into the book, then it completely changes.  Brilliantly written, so believable, I couldn't put it down!  Great book, I will be looking from more from Gillian Flynn.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Was pleased with quality of disc. Pre-ordered and received on the first day of release. Second disc has video blogs filmed during production. Really interesting.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Highly enjoyable game with good variety and an old time arcade feel. Responsive controls and runs great on my Note 2.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|At first I did not think I would like Russel Crow but he can belt it out.  Cant wait for the Blue-ray to arrive
B00849F82E|4.0|i don't necessarily align myself with chesterton, theologically, but do appreciate reading what he has to say on life.  i do think it's important to read his works, even if you disagree.  it's not hard to read what he has to say--it's an enjoyable and fairly easy read!  highly recommend this and his other classics.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus has 3 different sized tips depending on what you are using it for.  The tips are a soft rubber and hollow. They glide across the screen easily and no fingerprints.  I love using it for games and drawing.  It was quite economical.  I enjoy this product very much!
0470901071|3.0|This book is ok, I've used it for my Icnd1 and Icnd2 class, we only glanced at it.<br />If you've got money to spend and have no clue on what networking on cisco devices is, then buy this book.<br />There are better and cheaper ways to learn this stuff. You can find youtube videos and web articles that are more in-depth.<br />If you're just trying to make the material stick, the best way to do it is to get cisco packet tracer or gns3 and just practice, practice, practice on creating/fixing networks.<br />You can find free labs that will have an answer file, that you can open up so that you can see how a network is set up.<br />There are also youtube videos that will walk you through a lab.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|I'm really not sure how anyone could objectively give this album more than 3 stars out of 5. Trite lyrics, throwaway production, and forgettable melodies make \\"The Next Day\\" almost unlistenable for more than a few tracks at a time. I wanted to like it. I really did. But song after song just left me with a feeling of \\"Really, David Bowie? What butt-kissing record executive told you this was ready to release?\\" Sure, it recalls some of his earlier work, but instead of a \\"return to form\\", it's a sad and depressing example of an old man trying in vain to recapture past glory. I'm really glad i streamed the record through a subscription service, rather than wasting money on purchasing it.
B0092QITO2|5.0|It arrived at my house when it said it would and I live over seas in Terciera Island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, so 2 thumbs up!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really good for passing time. the graphics are wonderful. I didn't expect it to actually look realistic. I would definitely recommend to all horse lover's.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Hope that some religious people could read this book with open mind ..We could have less wars.<br />Easy to understand even for close minded people that still believe in the theory that you need of a god to explain creation.
B005F3XV7Q|4.0|Kevin James is a very funny guy and he lets the rest of the cast be just as funny.  Several sections of this movie were just a riot.  Nick Nolte was fantastic as the Gorilla.  Fun to watch.
B00B10CT7A|5.0|True story and a great person.  He will be missed.  Great story about life and setting goals. Acting good and great surf scenes.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|It is a great movie. Kevin Bacon is a scary person in this one. Keeps you on your toes. Must see it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My newest addition.  I love this game.  It's not like Rubic's cube (which I could never do), although the graphic may remind you of a Rubic's cube, if you're old enought to remember those.  It's more like a kid's Memory game (where players - usually pre-school children - turn cards over to match pictures) except it's in 3-D and on steriods.  It's more difficult than it looks but not too difficult that it's not fun.  I keep thinking of my college courses on the psychology of perception and industrial psychology when I play this game: you'll find your self tapping a flower for a heart; a blue starburst for a yellow one!  There are three modes for playing, for some variety, altho I play the puzzle mode most of the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a cool game. My 12 year old son always uses my kindle fire and he is always playing this game. I also like the upgrade to the streets of Rome.
B009VQBEPE|5.0|Awesome version, with the Classic minimalistic steelbook case. The blue Line at the top is just removeable paper. The movie is pure and pristine gold
B008HHTE64|3.0|I love this album of course and i have an sacd player and this sounds great but it is not 5.1 and that was not clear to me when ordering..very confusing since some reviews refer to a 5.1 version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. I have played it quite a bit and still am not bored with it.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Won't install new update. Package sig duplicate. Please fix this. I love this app but hate that it won't update.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I beat every level in the original Quell with a perfect score and was looking for a new challenge.  I found it here.  Quell is a simple, yet challenging game and with Quell Reflect, there are new challenges, such as working with two raindrops.  It's a great game to play while waiting for an appointment.
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is a classis and a must ready for anybody you likes adventurous books.  I bought this to read to my son and he really enjoyed it.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|...I was bored with Part 1 but this was fantastic! This delivered action, drama, and closure! I love it.  Well done
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly the most well written book I have read in a while. Amazing. The story gives the combination of tragedy, romance and comedy. The end will most definitely, leave you wanting more...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|once again Nicholas sparks writes an incredible book, a great story of survival and relationships, loved how jo turned out
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a very good game. It seemed kinda short for me as I was able to finish in a few hours.
0316776963|5.0|Most of David Sedaris' books are laugh out loud funny, but start with this one as I did. I have been found on the beach laughing out loud reading his books, to the curiosity of other beachgoers on neighboring blankets!
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I was vary unhappy with this movie somebody watching a movies and it turns kids into killers blaw blaw blaw
1439152802|5.0|best of all I have read by Kate Morton.  I don't like writing reviews about the books I have read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game. is the best game ever. Its very addictive I would suggest this game to everyone me and my neices play this all the time they love this game!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|It was excellent, but it was not a \\"fast\\" read and sometimes it seemed to \\"overdiscuss\\" some of the incidents
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome in most ways<br />Like when everyone has sacrificed slot to get to Greece via Argo. Truely amazing in every way .
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is a masterful blend of fact and fiction that draws you in and keeps you emotonally involved. Like the rest of the books in this Dan Brown series, it's a book that when you start reading, you have trouble putting it down.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|The characters are caricatures in this movie.  The plot solely relies on special effect major blow-up scene after scene.  Women are marginally represented--either sex-pot or matron.  Men are marginally represented--milk-toast administrator/scientists, recalcitrant brooding hero or villain, and thug/bully without any personality.  Very one-dimensional.  Disappointing and missing the cavalier class of previous bond movies.
B007HO392S|5.0|Great CD! We love everything that Carrie Underwood does. Would recommend this CD to Carrie fans and country music fans.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Standard crazy action movie where 95% of what happens could never happen in real life.  I still enjoyed it... I'm a guy.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|The clip-style attachment of the Kindle into the cover feels secure.  I like the elastic strap to keep the cover closed for travel.  It is comfortable to hold in all positions.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|I just realized how big Guns N' Roses were huge back then, and I was only a teenager during that time who didn't like this type of music, but after I heard their number one hits on youtube, my favorite song is &#34;Don't Cry&#34; and I love the video. You should get it before they are gone.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|I love Keira Knightley and these types of movies but this one did not do it for me. Costumes are great
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 10 year old daughter loves this game! I have to admit, I don't mind playing it along with her!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel is great in this movie is very interesting. Makes you worry about flying in airplanes. Must see movie. Enjoy
B001QVFDA4|5.0|Any Guy Richie movie you've gotta love!  I haven't seen one that isn't the best movie I've seen! And this one proves just that.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Addictive.  2 0 w o r d m I n I m u m.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 use to be the go to top thermal paste hands down.  Then a bunch of other products claiming better thermal conductivity came out.  I heard about these other products and read lots of reviews saying that they worked better.  But when I tried them I got poor results.  After doing some research I found out why.  Those other products might have better conductivity, but they were thicker, so they don't spread out into the tiny cracks and crevices as well, and actually act as a barrier between the heat sink and the integrated heat spreader.  Arctic Silver lays thinner than any other thermal paste.  The reason why the other products didn't work for me was I always use heat sinks with a mirror finish.  If I was to use a cheap heat sink with a rough finish the other products would probably work better.  But since I only use high quality parts Arctic silver is the only CPU thermal paste for me.  GPU, North Bridge, etc use something non conductive.  The only other CPU thermal paste I would ever consider is the Diamond based ones, and the only reason I don't use those is I'm worried it will scratch the mirror finish of my heat sinks, and make them harder to reuse.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Friend loved it but not my cup of tea even though I usually enjoy a costume period drama. I find post WWI England depressing.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|WE KEPT HEARING FROM THOSE WHO SAW THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN THAT IT WAS THE BEST TRANSFORMERS EVER AND IT'S A KEEPER.  SO WE WAITED TIL IT CAME OUT AND BOUGHT IT. OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH MY SOURCES, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT MADE IT BETTER WAS SHIA LaBEOUF'S HOT NEW GIRLFRIEND. MEGAN WAS GOOD, BUT THIS ONE IS BETTER/HOTTER. THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THIS FLICK WAS THE GIRLFRIEND. I MEAN, AFTER YOU SEEN ONE TRANSFORMER KNOCK-DOWN-DRAG-OUT, YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL. ALSO, SHIA AND HIS STAGE PARENTS ARE FUN TO WATCH, AND I LOVE SHIA'S CHARACTER'S DEFIANCE OF CIVIL AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. IF YOU HAVE THE OTHER TRANSFORMER MOVIES, BUY THIS ONE AND ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION. THAT'S WHY WE DID IT... WITHOUT REGRETS.
B009AMANH4|5.0|A fantastic film and award winning performances. English actors perform so well as Americans. Sally Field looked the part. Loved the accuracy of the sets especially the period furniture.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|GOOD (NOT GREAT) INTERTAINMENT. WE BOUGHT IT TO ADD TO OUR COLLECTION OF ACTION & ADVENTURE, BUT DON'T THINK I'LL BE WATCHING AS OFTEN AS OUR OTHER MOVIES. I'M A FAN OF DANIEL CRAIG, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T TALK TOO MUCH. HARRISON FORD IS A GOOD CHARACTER ACTOR AND PLAYS A JERK-TURNED-GOODGUY IN THIS ONE AND WE REALLY LIKED HIS CONTRIBUTION TO ACTION AND STORY LINE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. MY WIFE WOULD PREFER TOM SELLEC. (WHOOPEE)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Seriously eyeball popping stunts but the revelation at the end was disappointing. Gotta love those Saville Row sets esepcially tailored for him.
B000092T6M|5.0|THE TWO-DISC SPECAIL EXTENDED EDITION IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO WITH THIS MOVIE. WE'VE OWN THE REGULAR DVD AND WE WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT AT ALL! GREAT MOVING AND GREAT COLLECTION-KEEP-SAKE.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Not a personal fan of this actor so don't watch his films. Perfectly fine as a gift for a amily member who specifically requested it
B002GHHHP6|5.0|FUNNY, ADVENTUROUS, GREAT ENTERTAINMENT! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A MOVIE THAT HAS MEL GIBSON, JAMES GARNER AND JODIE FOSTER IN IT. GIBSON HAS ALWAYS PROVEN HE CAN DO COMEDY AND DRAMA MIXED TOGETHER, BUT FOSTER IS BRILLIANT, AND GARNER ADDS THE STABILITY TO EVERTHING HE STARS IN. LOVE IT AS ONE OF OUR BEST IN OUR COLLECTION.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Good story, but could have used any characters.  I feel the author was piggy backing off of Jane Austin by using Pemberley, and the Darcy's rather than create her own characters. Cheap trick, but like I said, decent story.
B00000G3PA|5.0|WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT THAT EVERY DVD COLLECTION SHOULD HAVE. PEOPLE WITH A MISSION THAT JUST ISN'T THEIR OWN, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE WHOLE WORLD, GENERATIONS TO COME. EVERY ACTOR WAS PERFECT FOR THEIR CHARACTER. SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERYDAY.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Viewing Quality was excellent.  I had attempted to watch the same move with another service provider and experienced lag and pixilation.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I have been able to download this game on my kindle for my son. I bought it  online, not on my kindle but that  should not made a difference. So where is my game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love . This it is s o challenging but incredibly fun and free.my dad has thousands of games but the one he likes most is sub way surfers Rome
B00003CXTG|1.0|it didnt work when i got it for my dad so wasnt happy i sent it back and never hurd a thing so not happy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son and I have been playing this game all morning and we have been having a blast!! If you get this game you will not be disappointed.
1616550414|5.0|This really worth the price, it has a lot of information, the new timeline may seem a little confuse, but it is also an intresting feature wich they give the effort to complete it.<br /><br />The book itself is more about skyward sword then the other Zelda games, but it sure has enough content for his size! i love it!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|It was a great book I loved it and I recommend it to everybody and they need to make a second book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game. Better than Temple Run. Only thing that's wish you guys would do is make it so there was more levels of magnet strength and maybe add some other fun power ups. The shoes arnt very fun to use.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for all ages. Addictive, but annoying that you have to wait so long for energy to build up to a use able level.
B00000IFP6|4.0|I may have to hear this cycle a few more times. I can see the fresh breath of air thing people are talking about but sometimes it doesn't work, not so much breathtaking as trying to catch your breath. Admittedly I've listened to the old guard all my life so maybe I'm a bit biased. I loved their triple concerto but the violin concerto, not so much.
0312330537|5.0|I love this book - it is a fabulous read.  It arrived timely and unfortunately possibly due to the shrink wrap the corner of the book was dented but I was so happy to get it and since I own it now, I did not feel it was an issue.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I like it and I'll listen to it once in a while but I have a lot of Hendrix I like a lot more. I'd give it 3 and a half stars.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Was very pleased with my purchase and more pleased that it came very quickly to my mailbox.  The movie is excellent and I love watching it. The UltraViolet Digital Copy is lousy, that I was not able to create it on my computer or over the net but that is ok with me
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Excellent game.  Great controls and graphics.  Other than wacky phrases from Page the dialogue is on point.  Worth the seven dollar price.  However for a buck you are doing yourself a disservice by not picking it up.
B000V86OKG|5.0|It's hard to go wrong with watching Dexter and if you don't have a blu ray player then DVD is a good way to go. I did compare the prices to Best Buy and Target and this was definitely the best deal, especially with free shipping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|that game is like so fun.I have all the mindcraft apps on my kindle and my ipad. Who thought mindcraft would be so fun,and killing the creepers, zombies,and skeletons.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you love all the other seasons of dexter and don't have a blu ray player then this is definitely your way to go. I compared the price to best buy and target and this was definitely the best price. Especially with free shipping!
B007SGM084|5.0|I want to find a man like Christian grey but a little different. I can go without all the playroom but I would like someone as caring and passionate as him. I loved this just as much as I loved the twilight saga and the hunger games saga.
B002NV9AH8|5.0|Glad I found this, was missing from my collection and a great piece that i had never heard, good stuff
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After so long rodriguez's music is reborn through this movie. While the music is the soul of Searching for the Sugar Man, this  documentary has entertainment value beyond most movies we watch. The journey the documentary takes us through has the drama,excitement and joy that continues long after the movie finishes just like a good red wine.On reflection the surprise element gave it a real boost and the humbleness of its star combined to make it one of life's great feel good stories. Buy the cd as well!
1616550414|5.0|Well I got the book because I enjoy Zelda stuff. The book is HUGE!!!! Much bigger than I expected. It's the size of one of my college books. It has everything you would want in a Zelda book: Original drawings, stories, art, etc. After I read the book I found my Zelda collection and played it. This makes the games much more fun because you understand it more.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|Tom Cruise seems to still have the formula right to put out the stock action movie. Because we know Cruise is true to his profession and creates so much reality we can enjoy his movie for what they are..As normal,the action moves along in extreme settings while trying to develop its characters and add some glint of needed humour. it will be interesting to see how he can inject some new edge to his next MI episode.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A Classic.  Saw the new movie and wanted too know how close it is to the book.  Can't wait to read it.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|Loved the CD, just wished the tracks were a bit longer, but no real complaints. Don't often buy game soundtracks but would recommend this one.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|Bloodsports is a fantastic, superb album . It is loud,brilliant,melodic, aggressive, uncompromising and absolutely, defiantly beatiful. Nobody else could have written these songs. Suede have done the almost impossible task of  looking back at the past while planting a foot  into the future. There will never be another band quite like Suede, thank Goodness they're back.
B00BHMEALA|4.0|Liked it because it was based on real facts. Always like Ben Affleck as an actor. Very intense movie. Will watch again.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Great video about inspiration and devotion to the things that matter most in life from a personal sense of view.  Made me want to jump in my car and run off into the sunset to places unknown.
159420411X|5.0|Silver explains application of Bayesian statistics and regression analysis to an intriguing mix of applications that everyone can relate to, or at least to most of them, e.g., from baseball and poker to politics, financial crises, climate change and terrorism. It's intriguing but basically sensible that scientific forecasts work best for systems that can be observed, such as weather forecasting and less for &#34;hidden&#34; phenomena, such as earthquakes. I enjoyed seeing the same statistical principles applied over such a broad range of topics.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The best CD I've purchased in a long time.  If you like Adele you will be happy!  I'm still listening to it several times a week.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A typical Tom Clancy novel.  Great story line highly recomend this book to all action thriller seekers . II love it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been along time since I truly enjoyed a good story, and that's exactly what this book is.  I looked forward to stealing a few minutes whenever possible just to read a few pages.  I read the negative reviews, and I think they missed the point if thus series.  The sole purpose is to tell a story, to create a mental picture.  This book does that, and leaves me with unanswered questions that better be answered in book 6!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found this book to be interesting and can't wait to discuss it with my book club.<br />The characters are complicated with sadness in their pasts
0547884591|5.0|I now own all of Tim's books and this one is by far the most useful to me, and Im not even through it yet! Great Stuff Tim!
B008KRJWEK|3.0|if it weren't so sticky it would be better. you have to hold buttons down for them to work. plus everything is so expensive! you'd have to play 10,000 games to get a good truck, also the glu coins are are far too expensive for a free game. if it were, lets say a buck for 2500 coins them people would buy them more often.<br /><br />thanks for reading this. -A

B004KKXMSI|5.0|I love 1 and 3, I'll watch them a lot. Awesome movies. Not fond of 2 but still well worth the money for just 1 and 3. (I hate computers)  lol
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I liked the book.  A good insight of France in the early 1800's.  Some inspired prose but also some long boring passages.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the best mouse I've ever had and it's also the cheapest mouse I've ever bought, considering the high quality of the mouse, I was expecting it to be a fortune.<br /><br />This is probably the best piece of hardware I've bought for my PC since I've got it and that's ruling out my logitech gaming keyboard and my turtle beach headset.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book provides a hero's insight on the Iraq war. It was tragic that the author was gunned down helping other Iraq veterans at home.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is a captivating read. It is the kind of book that makes you put everything on hold until you can finish it.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Just water ... I mean humans ... lol.  A meat eating plant from outer space.  A musical sci-fi comedy love story.  There's something for everyone.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly really brought it all back....seeing the ugly news broadcasts of those riots, hearing all those grim statistics from Iraq. Connelly's characters feel like they were there and did those infamous deeds. Harry may be behind a desk but he's still at the top of his game. Bravo!
B002BJGYU8|4.0|One of the episodes skipped some but other than that I was thrilled with the purchase! I didn't see any scratches but it skipped everytime. So not sure if the seller was aware or not but it didn't hinder my enjoyment much!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Finally somebody who knows how to make a great game. I was a little worried when I saw Retro and the graphics. The positive reviews got me to try it and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The controls are excellent and the game play is a blast, no pun intended. Solid  job by the developer.
032147404X|3.0|This book reminds me of a magic set. You know the one. The boxed magic set you might buy for a kid. It teaches them some neat self-working tricks, but it really doesn't teach them sleight-of-hand, or how magicians do their tricks. It's simply a starting point, an introduction to magic.<br /><br />The Digital Photography Book #1 is about the same. It teaches you some nice tricks about your camera, it gives you nice reminders, and gives you some decent tips, but it won't provide you with anything you can't find elsewhere. I did learn some cool things, but the book is very broad, and the tips are very short. They are about a paragraph each and there is a new one on each page. I don't think I wasted my money entirely, but I will say I am disappointed given the great reviews.<br /><br />If you bought your first DSLR camera, this MIGHT be the book for you, however, I think your better off with Understanding Exposure, first, and looking up various things on the web and YouTube. Understanding Exposure, which is recommended by Kelby, will teach you the foundations on how to take a picture properly on manual mode. Then, after that, I think this book could serve you well. It will give you tips like, remember SD cards if you shoot a wedding, use a tripod, how to angle your camera for proper portraits, etc. It will get you started on some basics that you should know, and will give you some tips on composition. You can just find better, especially for the hefty price, it doesn't offer much.<br /><br />I think if the book was about $9.99, I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars, but $25.99 is overpriced. I bought the box set, which, I hope, wasn't a mistake. But if you're beyond your first DSLR camera, or your first book on photography, or have done any research on your own, this book isn't for you. I think it's more of a book that you can take with you if you forget how to take a shot. It's more of a starting point, though. It will by no means make you an independent photography whoknows the ins and outs of the camera, photography, exposure, or composition. So, come to this book with the right expectations and you'll do fine.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind, though this book isn't that old, it is a little dated. So, when it gives you tips on how to take portraits, weddings, etc. you have to keep in mind that these are starting points. Most people want more artistic shots now.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a okay starting point, but don't expect it to be the bible on photography. Just expect to get some tips that may seem obvious. I'd highly recommend reading the book in a library or going to a bookstore and just flipping through the pages to see if it's for you.
B00BRUYQFC|1.0|This is an overblown, stretched out exercise in cringe inducing faces. All of these songs are stretched out with overblown beginnings, endings and breaks. This album is trying so hard to be a defining moment in JT's music career, but it spun out of control. I applaud that he tried new things...but for me personally, it is not something i would listen to a second time. There is very little in the way of catchy music. I can only relate it to a soundtrack to a videogame like Journey or Flower. When every song is approximately 7 minutes, give or take, it's a bad sign. I know all the JT fans are going to defend this to the death, but I would bet it won't be in their playlist six months from now. Sorry JT fans, this is a BIG YAWN.

0385349947|5.0|This book couldn't have come at a better time for me, I just switched jobs and am going after a sector that I find not only valuable to businesses but also I enjoy. Sheryl provides so many key pieces of advice that women should really take into account.<br /><br />This book is not for the women that are less inclined to go after success in the corporate realm. Its not for the woman who desires to quit her job be a stay at home wife/mom. This book is great for the women who want both success at home and success at work.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Tom Hooper took a masterpiece book and made it into a masterpiece movie. I have read a lot of negative reviews on this movie and how wrong they all were. I am a massive fan of the stage version and the 25th Special Edition but it was great to see it brought to life on the screen.  I laughed at Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter and cried  more  tears  than  I thought I would when Jean Valjean died. The story was well told in a film lasting nearly three hours. I would urge anyone who has read the book and/or  seen the stage version to go see this movie........you will not be disappointed. Just bring the tissues because you will need them.

B009KEN87O|5.0|I an rally enjoying this app. The designers put it together very well. The retro feel us definitely a plus.<br />The given spacecraft is highly maneuverable and responsive.<br />There are a multitude of targets, each acting differently and the levels leave them just long enough for you to start to get the feel of them before changing it up to keep it interesting.<br />I would recommend keeping the sound on but it's fun either way.<br />Of the few games I actually play, this will definitely be a often reoccurring one.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|I prefer \\"Songs from a Room,\\" which shows more engagement with the outside world -- I take it as a comment on Vietnam -- but in this one there's the characteristic mix of concert and poetry reading, done (at its best) in a very appealing light baritone.  When he goes higher, the voice is less engaging.  However, Cohen's ability to produce and juxtapose striking imagery is well in evidence, though it's beginning to sound a bit dated.  As I see it, the Cohen persona is a kind of lost wanderer, willing to hook up with or hang on to whatever sister of mercy will take him in.  These could be nuns but are just as likely to be teachers or girls like Suzanne or Marianne who are attracted to young men who are still in the process of finding themselves -- and Cohen's protagonists all sound at least ten years younger than he was when this album came out.  Is he serious and sincere? Or is there a consciousness of the seductive power that lies in being or seeming \\"lost\\"?  To raise these questions isn't to criticize the album -- the young W. B. Yeats wrote very effective lyrics that made him sound older than he was -- but to probe at its appeal.  Cohen has a great feel for the way in which apparently disparate images can coalesce to create and sustain a mood, and his delivery can be very effective:  \\"Suzanne\\" is a great song, and on this album, \\"So long, Marianne,\\" \\"Sisters of Mercy,\\" \\"That's no way to say Goodbye,\\" and \\"The Stranger Song\\" are very well done.  Although not on the original album, \\"Blessed is the memory\\" is also haunting and effective.<br /><br />Some reviewers reference Dylan and Paul Simon in comparison.  Like Cohen, these guys are verbally deft.  Dylan is much more interested in narrative and engagement, and Simon is a superior melodist.  There's a narcissistic strain in Cohen that touches the narcissist in all of us, and for the young of the 1960's and '70's, negotiating their escapes from the world of their parents, it was almost default mode.  So no wonder Cohen was popular then.  Of course, a lot of these youngsters are working in investment banks today . . .  a subject for Dylan, maybe?hen was popular then.  Of course, a lot of these youngsters are working in investment banks today . . .  a subject for Dylan, maybe?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series. Makes you feel as though your really there. I will continue to follow this show all the way through.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|EDIT / DISCLAIMER:<br />Funny how 2-sentence reviews like \\"I loved it!! Pure Bowie!!\\" get 100% helpful marks, and a negative review that took time and involved scrutiny, explaining the DETAILS of how one arrives at a two-star review.... THAT review gets constant \\"not helpful\\" marks. I see this every day. A review is there to give you impressions of what an album is like; not to validate your established positive opinion. LAME!<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />I don't like having to review an artist's material by holding it up against their earlier work. But when one invites comparison (like Bowie has with the new cover), by recalling earlier, more vital efforts, well....<br /><br />When I think of Bowie records worth celebrating, I think of an artist that mixed supreme melodic sensibility with intensely experimental impulses and a chameleon-like instinct to never get stylistically pinned down. Things like \\"Lodger\\" showed how intellectually abstract Bowie's work could be. Mixing in backward tracks from older songs, insisting that session musicians played their parts without allowing them to listen to the basic rhythms laid down earlier, having his session guys spontaneously switch instruments.... It was that kind of risk-taking that created real art. Even 95's largely-ignored \\"Outside\\" exhibited the kind of gonzo science that showed how fast the gears were spinning inside David's melon.<br /><br />Listening to this record, I get the feeling that David's artistic pretense has definitely outrun his artistic abilities. Hammering, cliche beats melded w/ yawn-inducing, Pro-Toolsy production that seems to strip away any intensity from the adept musicianship on display. Bowie's attention to the hook is virtually extinct, and his vocal delivery has a rapid, directionless attack. The lyrical content gets him absolutely nowhere, poetically.<br /><br />It all culminates in a production that leaves me absolutely cold, and begs the question: \\"was this album even moderately necessary?\\" There's just such a wealth of young, under-the-radar talent on the map now; stuff on Soundcloud and Bandcamp that you have to dig just slightly to unearth. In the 70's, 80's and 90's, we relied on label-backed artists because seriously independent stuff was just not widely available. Now, there's a lifetime of brilliant underground listening available. The challenge today isn't to find a place to dig, it's weeding through the multitudinous mediocrity to get to the gold. It's just a question of perseverance.even moderately necessary?\\" There's just such a wealth of young, under-the-radar talent on the map now; stuff on Soundcloud and Bandcamp that you have to dig just slightly to unearth.

B0000DBJ2B|4.0|I bought this movie because it was one of my favorite movies as a child.  I must admit I couldn't tell much of a difference in the remaster.  The movie is still very enjoyable.  The items included with the DVD didn't seem worth the extra money - there was some character art and and some storyboards, but they weren't really that interesting to me.  Maybe I'm just not the target audience intended for a \\"Collector's Edition\\".
B00ADLCC9I|3.0|They are charging $305.00.<br />Everywhere else, $180.00.<br />Don't get ripped off, don't buy it from this reseller.<br />Battery life not so great and internal memory is definitely thin.<br />But joysticks make action games MUCH better than screen interface.<br />Great idea and a lot of good games are properly interfaced
0060922583|5.0|This book presents some fascinating theories on the nature of the universe - it should, however, be taken with a shaker full of salt.  Do not take everything in this book at face value - it is at best a collection of theories, with some conveniently picked studies and examples to back them up.  It's something that will get you thinking and questioning the world around you - but like the universe, don't just accept what you've read here - question it.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|This is challenging, but kind of fun.  Haven't played it that much.  The songs go from super simple to a little bit difficult.  Would like a few more inbetween and more current (there's a lot of classical stuff).

You'll fall in love with Abby and her bravado, her courage and level head; Travis will melt you with his irresistible charm and wit.

B00004WPFX|5.0|After I purchased this item I started reading more of the reviews on it. I bought the vinyl fyi. A lot of people were complaining about the record skipping in the same spots, due to fault of Virgin and their pressings. This got me a little paranoid, I didn't want to have just spent my money on a faulty album. I received the album and put it on- it's one of the better sounding records I own now. I have no idea what problem others were having with it, but imo the faults all on their part. I mentioned this on a message board I talk vinyl on and others owners of this pressing said the same thing- probably just due to not properly setting up their arm or using a bad cartridge/stylus combo.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this record, the sound is amazing compared to the digital copy I'm used to. I would recommend this to anyone who's into Daft Punk.

0143113100|5.0|This a  wonderful book on brain plasticity.  I truly loved it.  I think there are multiple reasons for this.  First, I learned a lot.  I already knew a little bit about brain plasticity but I never could have imagined how truly \\"modifiable\\" the brain is.  Second, my impression is that subconsciously, it reassures me that even in old age I might still be functional and have an active intellectual life.  (I truly hope that this is the case).<br /><br />The book describes in layman's terms what is plasticity.  It does this mostly through \\"use cases\\" where various people's whose suffered brain injury got better through retraining of the brain.  There are interesting cases:<br /><br />  * A woman who lost her sense of equilibrium (inner ear infection) and has the impression that she is always falling down.  She was retrained through a hard hat wired to her tongue.  (The hard hat had sensors feeding her data about her position, probably using a gyroscope).<br />  * A woman that was born with half a brain, but somehow the brain that was there remapped all of its functionality in that one hemisphere.  She apparently has some problems but is still functional.  Quite amazing.<br />  * Blind people who can \\"see\\" through sensors placed on their tongues.<br /><br />Basically, brain scientists initially thought that various locations within the brain were used to process specific signals.  This is the theory of localizationism (Philippe de Broca was one of the main proponents of this theory).  In the last century though, scientists have realized that the brain is quite adaptable and can remap a lot of functionality if it needs to.<br /><br />One of the interesting things is that the author indicates that there are ways you can be \\"brighter\\".  You just need to train for it.  He mentions a few programs (for example the luminosity program) or some of the other web sites that are popular these days.<br /><br />In any case, it's quite a good book and I will wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody that hasn't read it yet.  I'm probably going to loan it to my dad next weekend.  It might make him decide to live new experiences... who knows.<br /><br />Some of my takeaway notes:<br /><br />  * Neurons that fire together, wire together.<br />  * There are periods of critical plasticity.  During these periods, the brain is extremely susceptible to change.  It is possible to make changes after these periods, but it is more difficult.<br />  * Memory is plastic... Thinking about past events changes the view of the event, it's like a \\"transcription\\".<br />  * Transference... A user can relive past events.<br /><br />The first rule (\\"Neurons that fire together, wire together\\") is repeated throughout the book.<br /><br />The one thing from the book that I wasn't totally on board with is the importance of psychiatric analysis.  That being said, the book made me \\"review\\" my ideas about psychiatry, there might be some truth in it.to anybody that hasn't read it yet.  I'm probably going to loan it to my dad next weekend.

B00271B752|3.0|Maybe it's a 70's thing? I was told this movie is a must see. The first time we tried to watch it, we turned it off just under an hour in to it. It was moving so slow and I just wasn't into it. We were told by a friend that it gets better so we decided to finish it. I am glad we finished it because it got much better.<br /><br />In the end, it was a decent movie and I'm glad I watched, but probably not one I'd watch again.

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|So many mistakes in the details. The mistakes are so glaring and so prevalent that I began to wonder if the author was an editor secretly conducting an experiment to prove that online publishing is a huge joke. So bad I couldn't put it down - Will the main character have blue eyes or green eyes? Will the streets still be crowded or suddenly maybe only a few lovers will be strolling along? Will her southern boss suddenly begin using British slang or French phrases? Anything is possible.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|Captivating.  The author's way with words floats you along.  Was never quite sure what was going to happen. There is a fine line between the sane and insane and that is portraited profondly.
B004QX07G4|4.0|This was a pretty good book.  Ellen writes like she talks so that made it a fun book to read.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I honestly didn't even read this book. It isn't nearly as good as everybody else made it seem. Maybe if you like to read you would enjoy it much more that I did.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch is easy to read, durable and very rugged. The watch is accurately represented in picture and arrived quickly.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|As a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings movies I had high hopes for The Hobbit. An hour in to it I was so mad I paid for this movie. It is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It started off slow and got slower. There was almost no action during the entire movie. I don't expect a movie to have action for it to be a good movie. My favorite types of movies are ones that have good story lines! This movie is nothing but a musical. All they do is sing throughout this film. After this I will never spend money or watch another one of these films in this series!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've gotten some good recipes and useful ideas from Pinterest. Some people tell me they're addicted and I can see why. I usually go on a couple of times a week just to check in and see what's new.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so addictive and a nice way to pass some time.  I gave it 4 stars because it's designed to get you to spend real money.  But other then that I love the concept of the game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|The game is simple to play and the graphics look pretty good. The action is medium paced (although I'm getting dinged for being too slow), and the variety of enemies makes this an entertaining experience.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Old moviewhich was always a good story  but has now been converted well for the 3D experience watching the dog fights in the middle of the lounge room is an experience not to be missed by the 3D buff
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I caught the middle - end of this movie on HBO. When I went back to watch the whole thing a week later ( or maybe even a day later), they had taken it off!! I was pretty disappointed. I had ordered a blu-ray player for my friend and Amazon generously  gave me a $5 instant video credit... Needless to say - it was spend on renting this movie. WOW! What a powerful love story. The characters/actors (Jane & Edward) have GREAT chemistry and it's such a heart-wrenching love story. It makes me wonder how simple and yet so complicated life was back in those times. I honestly would recommend this to everyone. I also see myself purchasing it. It's definitely one I could watch over and over. Hope this review helps any one who is on the fence about renting or even watching!! (Even I at first, did not have any desire to watch it. But you get SO caught up in the story)
B0060MYM3S|4.0|BOOK AND SHOW ARE STARTING TO DIVERGE A BIT MORE BUT STILL VERY COMPELLING. ORIGINAL ENTERTAINMENT THAT THOUGH FANTASY KEEPS IT REALISTIC ENOUGH TO NOT SCARE AWAY MARGINAL FANS TO THE GENRE.
B009KEN87O|2.0|poor graphics and not a very interesting game just shooting. no colour or excitement in it and not worth $2.56 :(
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's been very useful. Mostly I've used it for short stories but even for that I'm thankful. It's helpful to have a place to put ideas instantly.
1451695195|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a physician and once I started reading it I could not stop.  I think every doctor should have a copy in his office and in his medical bag.  The book, written by an outstanding neurosurgeon, who was well respected for his research, neurological practice, and daring lifestyle, had a NDE which changed his life.  That experience is shared with wonder and clarity that widens our scope of understanding the fullness of existence, earthly and beyond.  We need to look at todays many problems in such a broad manner.  I am looking forward to hearing Dr. Alexander's story once again in person soon.  MHP
B005CRQ2DK|2.0|It is cool but more of a normal book except the trouble Greg gets himself into just annoys me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Megan
1451620829|2.0|I just finished Peter Criss's book. All this guy seems to do is whine, complain and cry. I grew up admiring the guy until I read his book. What a loser ! You hated gene and paul? Guess what? we all hate some of the people we work with during our lives. Its something we all have to deal with not just you. It seems this guy cries about one thing or another on every other page. All your problems seem to be the results of the mistakes that YOU made for yourself. You remind me of Robert Blake. You seem a little off center mentally. After reading about your behavior I wouldnt have wanted you in my band either. You reep what you sow
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson loves this game. Plays constantly. Can be on it for a very long time. He says its an awesome game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a beautiful story & very heart wrenching! If I was to die, I would want my husband to find a wonderful woman to raise our children. &#60;3 Nicholas Sparks!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|I enjoy this app, which allows me to use my Kindle for a bathroom radio -- good app that I use on other devices as well.
B009K0P10K|1.0|I was not able to watch it. When I clicked on 'Play', it started then stopped abruptly. I retried several times with no avail. I was going to buy the whole season two of revenge and watch but after this experience, I do not think I am going to use Amazon Instant Viewing anymore. This was my first time and I did not have a good impression.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoy this show very much and was glad to be able to catch the first season in such an inexpensive fashion.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Unforunately the US tour sold out too fast for me to get my 10 year old daugher tickets.  She was crushed.  As an alternative I came across this DVD and decided to buy it for her as a second choice.  I do not think she has taken it out of her laptop!  She loops it nonstop and said its so much better than the concert because she can watch it anytime and its very &#34;up close and personal&#34;.  I would suggest this to any one direction fan!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The story is so strong, the emotions are aroused.  I cannot give it anything less than the best.  At the end, my spirit soared and the tears fell.<br /><br />'Tis true, Anne Hathaway's Fantine is weak from the start, but Hathaway earns her awards with her amazing performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"<br /><br />Hugh Jackman's performance was beyond words.  He hit the notes he had to hit to have credibility and gave a performance of a lifetime.  He was Valjean.<br /><br />Samantha Barks as Eponine is again the heroine of the story.  Truly.<br /><br />Isabelle Allen as the young Cosette was extraordinary.  The best I have seen.  Amanda Seyfried as the older Cosette was acceptable.  Her singing was strong at the start, but faded into mis-hit notes during critical musical passages.  Her over-blown pupils, worse, were distracting.  I understand that they wanted her to look wide-eyed and innocent, but those pupils were so large that she just came out looking stoned.<br /><br />Marius was miscast.  The bloke who makes fun of him falling in love should have been Marius.  Sorry Eddie.<br /><br />Poor Russell Crowe.  Arguably a great actor who floundered because of the music.  He didn't sing horribly--he actually sang quite well, but his focus on trying to sing well killed all the emotion Javert has to have.<br /><br />I was determined not to like this Gavroche as I preferred some of the chubbier ones on Broadway and in London, but this little guy sang so well and charmed me right in.<br /><br />The ensemble's performance was divine!<br /><br />Somehow, someway, the cast overcame the mis-steps and made me cry in the end.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as a surprise Wednesday gift and she has been singing non stop for over a week.  I fear she may wear out the disc.  This is a very wholesome band that I have no issues with my 10 year old listening to.  Great CD.
B00A1AD6ZU|4.0|I've a few of the Sigma series and this seems to be the best.  Plenty of action, heroism and a nice blend of science fiction.  It's a good read.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|The movie is off from the start. Something isn't right. McClane says a few lines in the opening scene and then springs up in Russia, not saying much of anything nor do we know what he's been up to in the previous years. Note to the filmmakers, fans enjoy a few quite moments of character revelation. This movie instead shouts little hints at us about John and his son as they bicker for the first 30 minutes. Everything else is old hat in the movie. The dialogue is corny by the way and not in a fun way. A decent rental of an action movie but nothing that stands out on a whole. Really disappointing for long time Die Hard fans. They could have done so much more.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I bought this to replace a logitech G400, which I had bought to replace my logitech mx518.  The reason I wanted a replacement is because the mouse buttons were 'catching' or 'sticking' without there being any kind of spill or something on the mouse.  it seemed to just be bad manufacture.  So rather than buy another G400, I looked to upgrade a bit and found this mouse.  It was a very good price, looked cool, has good reviews, and seemed to be what I was looking for.  I got almost exactly what I expected, but unfortunately I ran into a very similar problem.  The left mouse button of my anker mouse is very 'springy' and makes a lot of noise.  I asked their customer support for a replacement and they were very gracious to send me one without RMAing my original first.  Thank god I did not send my original in because the new one has an even springier left mouse button, which makes an audible noise if I tap my finger on it.  I mean it makes a noise when I do not even apply enough pressure to do a 'mouse click'.  Something in this design means the left mouse button is loose, and its a bit annoying.  So if you can easily get annoyed by function stuff like that, I guess avoid, but overall this has been a very good mouse.  I am still getting used to the thumb button placement for FPS games, but overall I'm satisfied.  I can live with a springy mouse instead of a sticky/choppy mouse button like the G400.  Edit: Just want to update.  Anker has been VERY accommodating with their customer service in trying to make sure I can get a mouse that meets their standards.  I honestly don't think I've ever had as positive a customer experience with an electronics company.  I'm raising my rating to 4 stars to reflect this.  Edit 4/14/15 - Updating again.  I have to change my review to 3 stars.  The company was very accommodating when I had problems with newly delivered mice, but I am having the opposite experience now that my mouse is out of warranty.  The scroll wheel, which is also a button as is the case for every modern mouse, has become unresponsive at times.  I have to click 4 or 5 times to get it to register a click.  On any other mouse I'd unscrew the case & clean it out but I could not find a screw point on the anker mouse.  I contacted support to ask how to disassemble and they spent a few days wasting my time asking me for my receipt & serial number so they could tell me my mouse was no longer under warranty (i realized that already guys thanks).  After dodging my question for a bit they eventually told me that they would not tell me how to take apart the mouse because it would void the warranty and that I was free to buy a new mouse from them.  This mouse is worthless if I can't use one of the buttons, especially for video games where you get a lot of mileage out of that middle mouse button.  The warranty is done, just tell me how to disassemble.  Changing to 3 stars to reflect this dire turn in customer service.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Really fun to play. Finally one of the better Retro space shooter games. This is stuff I grew up with. Really well dine. Its a keeper...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|fun game young kids can play several types of sharks a lot of fish to eat... and other sharks its fun try it out
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an awesome write. he really paints a story with words. The emotions are heartfelt and real. The characters have depth and after reading Safe Haven I feel that I have lives the story and made lifelong friends.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book has been such an inspiration! Congrats to you Cheryl, for completing your journey and inspiring mine. I hope to have my own story to tell someday.
B009KEN87O|1.0|I just keep getting an error message when I try to downloaded it on my Kindle from the Cloud.  It won't let me delete.  I thought then I could reload it.  I'm bummed.  I loved the old Space Invaders.  Any suggestions?<br />'
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is so addictive and epic, I just got it and immediately I loved it!!! I can't stop playing it. Definetly one of the best downloads I've made.
1451673442|3.0|Didn't keep my interest but wasn't a sleeper either. They have alot of helpful tools and things you can apply to your daily life.
B009S33I68|5.0|I had seen the movie which was a favorite of mine. I did not even know of the battle at LZAlbany. It was a stirring account of the Vietnam war. It was very well written. I appreciate the sacrifice of those that fought bravely on the battlefield. I also came to admire Colonel Moore and his men. Felt sorrow for the men at LZAlbany.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|This motherboard includes features like usb3.0, high speed sata and also amd and crossfire which means it is built for the future at least another 5 years if it works for that long. The bios is really comprehensive but fortunately aside form the qflash to update the bios, there really is nothing more you need to use unless you are overclocking. Took away 1 star as the drivers dvd is not useful at all. I have to manually download the drivers online and install them.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I am just your average 20 something who loves to read YA fiction/fantasy/sci-fi, and I have read  A LOT! I can basically say this, when a book is good, I am done with it in a day or two, sacrificing precious sleep time to get to the ending, hiding under my desk during break times to get in every last bit of every chapter, and if it is phenomenal then I might even try to read a few lines while I am sitting at a red light... City of Bones was far far far from a good book. Honestly I am still not finished with it. It's always hard for me to express exactly why I don't like a book, so to put it simply, I thought it was boring, the situations the characters got themselves in where just too unlikely and didn't make sense. I know it is a fantasy world with shadowhunters and demons, etc, and the author can pretty much do what she wants, but come on! Give the reader a little bit of credit! It was just so juvenile and maybe just a little too immature for my tastes. The problems presented were just so unbelievable and the solutions just seem to be so easily found. There was really no mystery, no suspense, it was like \\"Who is this warlock I have to find... he holds the keys to my memories!\\" and then someone else \\"I happen to have an invitation to a party, oh look, I think the warlock you are looking for is throwing it!\\" \\"We need to find out where the bad guy is hiding... Wait I remember a place, hey Simon can you look this up on Wikipedia?\\" \\"Sure, you're right, looks like the place!\\" Just... lame..<br />Maybe the books get better, but from what I have read it doesn't seem like it. It was poorly written, I agree with the fact that a lot of things seemed like a Harry Potter rip off, incest - no thanks (and yes I know what they find out later, but I don't care), and I didn't really like the characters much. Seems like the author really understood one of her characters and that was Jace, he was the only person who I wanted to read. Everyone else was flat and boring, cookie-cutter fill-ins to make a sorta interesting story, but honestly just not worth the price. If this is one of those books that the movie is better than the book, I wouldn't be shocked in the least!
B000002KBA|4.0|This is one of Deep Purple's signature albums. It really Rocks. There is only one song that I dont care for.Any Deep Purple fan should own this album.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|All in all, Tesla's Electric Mist is a well-designed game game and won't disappoint. The plotline is engaging, the graphics are good, and the puzzles are challenging. While the game provides a couple of hours' worth of entertainment, I was hoping it would be longer. That is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars. If you like puzzle gamed, this one is worth picking up.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I had low hopes when installing this &quot;free app of the day&quot; but it's a winner. there's more variety than you'd expect.
8866130931|5.0|I finally went back to a paper planner this year - the Moleskine has enough space to write in (important for me because my handwriting is large) and is slim enough to fit in my purse without taking up much space. I like the pocket in the back to store important things in if necessary and the notes section to put info about the week or just when I need a place to jot something down. Also appreciate the elastic band that keep it closed in my purse so the pages don't get ripped or bent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|look, you all knew what you were in for after temple run. So with better graphics ,more moves, and more to do in general, you'll love it.
B009G7WUW4|1.0|How can a movie soundtrack not include the movie opening theme song? This was a gift for someone, what a let down and complete rip off, returned.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great retro game. I love the animation which is retro with a 3d feel to everything. It has 3 different difficulty selections which means anyone can pick it up and have a good time. Overall a well made game. I hope we keep getting games like this one from this developer.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I knew this would be a different genre than JK Rowling's other books, but expected it to be an entertaining read. I struggled through the first few chapters, but the only word I can think of to describe it was, BORING! I found that I really didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. How disappointing.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|very efficient, all lots for ports well placed,very durable, would purchase form this manufacturer again, always through amazon online get one
0307352153|5.0|This book actually moved me to tears at times. I'm late to offer much that's new. To me, its greatest significance is in field of education. I hope it ushers in a new/back-to-the-old paradigm. Our present (since 1930s?) educational system seems purposely designed to crush introverts,to the detriment of all of us. I absolutely loved her statistics. Validating. Vindicating. The more the merrier. I want to hug her for them, but, being a shy introvert, I will merely say, \\"Thank you!\\"
0385349947|1.0|First of all Sandberg is so TONE DEAF to her own privilege that it gets infuriating - she is NOT like other working women in this country. She is a privileged individual who didn't have to climb much to get where she is today. Hell, she didn't even have to break a sweat. Oprah had to work harder to amass her wealth than Sandberg ever did.<br />The main message of the book is that women should never disengage from their careers. Even in childbearing women should always step-up and assert themselves as forcefully as possible so as to not fade away and eliminate themselves from advancement and leadership roles. Here's the reality - most working middle class women do not come from the wealth and privilege Sandberg herself used as a step ladder to her success. Those are tools not available to middle class women let alone middle class men; let's just call them PEOPLE shall we. That's another thing; her facts, figures and assumptions are so mired in the 70's. We have come a long way in the workplace. In fact more women than ever ARE in leadership roles. Just not the BIG leader roles Sandberg feels they should be in. And this leads to my ultimate point, You May Have The Will, But Do You Have The Skill? Do you have what it takes to be a CEO? Skill and will are two VERY different things. Sandberg doesn't address this enough in the book. It takes skill to lead a big corporation to profitability. Yet so many executives get their title by privilege, EXACTLY HOW MRS. SANDBERG GOT HER POSITION. You hear me defenders of this book - I've read your comments and have been disgusted by your lack cognitive logic. SANDBERG IS NO SPOKESPERSON FOR THE WORKING MIDDLE CLASS WOMAN. She's a BILLIONAIRE who lives a privileged life with no worries that so many middle class working women face today. Has she ever had to sit down at the kitchen table with a mound of bills in front of her and paycheck in her hand knowing there is no way in hell this paycheck is going to cover these bills. Sandberg has no right spouting rhetoric or giving advice to these millions of women who are somehow suppose to rise up and be BOSSY and DEMANDING in their careers and tell the BOSS I'm entitled. That could get you fired from a job and opportunity you may never have again. Remember, we are still not out of this recession yet and there are more workers than jobs available in the market. Not to mention that even more jobs are being cut everyday and most working class men and women are still concerned about keeping the ones they have.<br /><br />Sandberg may have advice, but it is hardly fit for the middle class working woman or man. It works only with that Silver Spoon inserted into one's mouth; then and only then will the advice in this book work for you. If you start at the top you are assured a CEO Executive position. You have the education and the social network to get you that position. So let's be honest about the advice in this book, while she may try to encourage women in the workplace I can promise only discouragement when you factor in the authors privileged background and never ending assets she has to fall back on if her calculated risks somehow takes a turn for the worse. Unlike the majority of us; if we lose what little we have, we have lost everything. That's so nice of you Sheryl - thanks so much for you expert advice and I'll be sure to sing your praises while standing in an unemployment line. It's all Sunshine and Lollipops, when you live in the land of Sheryl Sandberg.as no right spouting rhetoric or giving advice to these millions of women who are somehow suppose to rise up and be BOSSY and DEMANDING in their careers and tell the BOSS I'm entitled.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|When I first got an iPhone I looked into purchasing a lifeproof case. But who wanted to spend $80 on a case for their phone?... not me! Thankfully I had good insurance, because I went through 3 iPhones in the first 3 months that I had one, by dropping or falling out of my pocket and shattering the screen every single time. Even though I had good insurance it was a pain to not have a phone for a few days or weeks while mine was getting fixed or replaced. So I finally gave in and purchased a Lifeproof case through Amazon. I'll admitt I was very wary when I took it out of the box because it seemed like a flimsy piece of plastic. I couldn't understand how it was going to protect my phone from all of the falls, but I have not had a problem since. It keeps my phone clean and protected from dust and liquids. I dropped it in the pool and it was fine. It is constantly dropped daily, and I have had no problems. I have had it for a year now, and am now finally considering buying another one. While the phone has stayed safe, the case itself does get beat up looking after a year. I would also like to add that my best friends 1 year old absolutely loves playing, chewing, throwing, and beating on my phone. I have not worried once that she will affect my phone in any way. The phone is easy to use through the plastic screen. And the size is very sufficient. It is obviously bigger than the phone itself, but is much smaller than an Otter Box. I would highly recommend this case to anyone, its a God-sent!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Fast and in perfect condition.  We love this series and can't wait for the third season to come out in June.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I appreciated the way Peter Jackson transitioned from the Lord of the Rings back to the beginning of the Hobbit by using the same actors and setting that he used at the beginning of Lord of the Rings. Still too many orcs and orc scenes for my taste which was my disagreements with the Trilogy. However, the costuming, acting, sets (even if CGI) and scenery of New Zealand I never get tired of and Andy Sekris and Gollum are phenomenal.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie lives, Bowie rocks, Bowie proves again he is the ultimate master of groovy art-rock-art!!  How do I love, love, love this fantastic new record?!!  Let me count the ways: (1) Every single cut can stand on its own, no fillers, no throwaways, each song is thoughtfully crafted and complex, this is an honest record; (2) The lyrics are beautiful, cool, seductive, ethereal, reading like abstract impressionist paintings, telling stories through a fractured, interesting, narrative prism (the lyrics are included with the record, making for excellent sing-alongs!); (3) The melodies are strong and memorable; (4) The musicianship is superb, all vocals and playing is first-rate, harmonic choruses soar; (5) Every tune is mixed perfectly, and hot!;  And (6) most important!! Bowie's awesome new creation sounds fresh and inspired yet continues in his unique signature style - this makes listening to The Next Day deeply satisfying and truly inspiring.  Ground control to Major Tom, your circuit's live!  Dig Bowie. Tune in.  Turn on.  Get  it.  Now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I simply can not wait until the June release of &#34;Entwined!&#34; these books have captured my attention and held fast.  There were nights when I read til 3:00 a.m. Knowing I had to be up at 6:00 a.m.  I could not put them down!

B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a great movie.  The hotel that they use overlooking the Lake Palace was also the same hotel that we stayed when we were in Udaipur.  India is an amazing country incredible and amazing better than the books and pictures.<br /><br />The movie captured a mili second of our trip...
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I must be getting too old to watch movies anymore.  The singing was okay the rest of it was really just a silly mess.

1475972350|5.0|It took me a little bit to read this book , but not because it was tough to read, but my little one kept interrupting! LOL! Had it been up to me, I would have never put it down! I really like the way Max and Jesse are together...it didn't go romantic, and I like that. I love how just when I thought I had it figured out, I was thrown for another loop! That kept it exciting, and that is important to me. Cannot wait for another Max Larkin book...and I will never again waste anyone's time ;)
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I am a purist when it comes to books ... I love books ... not just the words & ideas, but the feel & smell of a well-bound book. That is until my wife bequethed me her ol' school Kindle after getting her Kindle-Fire. This is the ONLY book I have bought, but I am hooked. It is truly a comprehensive catalog of Boz's writing, including some of his lesser-known works. It is a must have addition to any Dickens fan's library. Thank you, Mr. Dickens, for the years of entertaining & thought provoking reading you have provided me.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I heard his music at my Moms' and I decided to get this CD.  AWSOME!!!  I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates really wonderful music.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My mom and sister suggested this book to me.  It has an unexpected ending.  The read is quick.  Have to say I became a little paranoid after reading this book though :)
1885167776|5.0|I posted my review on [...].  This is a really great book that would make a very good gift for your children if they read it.  It is all about how to obtain the things you want in life and shows you exactly how to do it.  Check out the review.
B00005NKKZ|2.0|Not a lot of good songs.  The Sounds of Silence is a much better album.  I would not recommend this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm a fan of the adventure game genre.  This genre had been in hibernation for quite a while.  What a fresh!
B004RUF9DC|5.0|I also saw this movie as a kid and seeing it in bluray has been mesmorizing.  The quality is amazing.
B004QBWU02|2.0|The picture quality is poor.The images throughout the whole picture are &#34;Dark&#34; as in,one cannot clearly identify the<br />actor's or the story.This was returned for full credit as it is junk
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This app came to me as friend invite. I get a lot of invites but this one is one of my favorites. I have this game on my phone and tablet and enjoy playing on both. I like playing against everyone in the world.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Puzzles are too easy.  It is almost too easy.  I would search for a different.  Not enough tiles.  Graphics are good.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love how this series brings in guest stars. They all play a pivotal roll and their demise is always the best part. This series is full of karma. I'm hooked!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game . I LOVE all the games you can play. When I first got it, I wasn't sure what to think. But this game is AWSOME!!!!
B003L77GRO|3.0|I'm really entertained by this series but this season kind of fell flat. It seemed like they were running out of ideas and at times it felt like the program was dragging. This season deals with rape and violence against women. It was at times hard to watch and I would just fast forward thru some scenes. You have to watch this season just to keep up on the story line. Otherwise you won't understand season 6
B00AREIAI8|5.0|absolutely wonderful lovely game. its addicting. bum diddy bum bum..bum diddy bum. bum diddy bum bum. he haw he haw. giddy up giddy up.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Heard a lot about this show and got the first season at Best Buy. Well that did it for me, was hooked instantly. I ordered the rest of the series available the next day. (Yes I watched the who,e season in one day, it's that good and addicting)<br />Season 7 just became available for pre order so I can't wait to get it. The serial killer/guy with a code of ethics is most fascinating. It's pretty gory at times but if you like how bad guys get it in the end. I recommend watching. Hope the show continues for a long time.
0071373586|5.0|Anyone trying to brand a business, a product or themselves must understand the principles in this book. For years, I bought it for all my clients, so they would understand what I was trying to accomplish.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I won't say anything to spoil the fun. If your new to the series, it keeps getting better. The twist and turns keep you on the edge of you seat. Makes you think Dex is going to get caught and then by a stroke of insanely good luck he lives to kill another day.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|You want something thats inexpensive and has good sound look no forward.  I gave them 4 stars because i really don't expect them to last, i mean i paid  $30-something for this. I'll update after some time of owning the headphones.   *edit*   It is now Dec 24th 2015,the headphones are still working as well as the day i got them
B005HI4LLY|4.0|Another semi horror spoof. A friend of mine told me about this movie and said it was a must see. I will admit, there are parts that are very funny.  I think the typical hillbilly in the woods, stranded teenagers motif says it all. If you want silly humor mixed with 80's slasher flick blood and guts this ones for you.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Independent.  Honest.  Killer hooks.  And he's a local Seattle boy.  Love it!  Buy it!  NOTE: this is the censored version - Buy the original, \\"explicit\\", uncensored version unless you are offended by profanity.  I'm not, but the I couldn't have my 4 year old repeating the lyrics at preschool.)
B005FISBTO|5.0|Just as the previous seasons ended with the inevitable cliff hanger, this one doesn't disappoint. Can't wait to get my hands on season 7.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series, the story is captivating and the historical error is very interesting.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love The Lumineers. They make wonderful music that puts me in an upbeat and focused mood. If you like Mumford and Sons you will love this too.
B00004TJTS|5.0|This film may have its flaws; but taken as a whole, it never fails to bring tears to my eye.  A Must-See for anyone who has ever had a beloved pet and particularly for guys who have loved a dog.  Moving performances by Kevin Bacon, Diane Lane, and Luke Wilson.  This was one of my favorites of 2000.  Definitely had the feel of the period and .a wonderful introduction of young actor Frankie Muniz.  Deserved more attention than it got.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I discovered Freely about a year ago. I used it on my pc, but it didn't capture me like it does on the Kindle Fire.  I'm a dedicated Google Reader fan, but when it's phased out I'll be using Feedly for my tax reader because of its convenience and useful design.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and so addicting I have played for 3 hours straight! I love this game so much its crazy!!!!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I love Wes Anderson movies (save for maybe Darjeeling Limited). I have been watching his stuff since picking up Bottle Rocket on VHS at my local Warehouse mucic shop in the late 90s. I thought it couldn't get much better than The Life Aquatic and Royal Tenenbaums and I was wrong. There's a reason this was nominated for an Oscar. It is beautiful, pure and simple. If you love Wes' stuff, then please watch this. If you haven't seen any of his stuff yet, you probably want to sit down and watch one or two movies before jumping in head first. While I love his stuff, it's heavily stylized and not everyone loves it. Also, if you haven't watch The Fantastic Mister Fox yet then you NEED to go out and watch that TONIGHT! Pure gold.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Love that the writer is very informative. It's a book worth reading. Now hopefully the movies as good as the book :)
0783219733|4.0|This movie was always an all time favorite of mine.  Now that I have grandchildren, it's a movie we can all watch together.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie and purchased the book to see if it could possibly be better. I should not have been surprised to find it was even more amazing. I have already recommended it to friends and family.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My just-turned-three year old likes it enough. Level one and two are approriate for him and level five is more challenging probably suited for an older child. It will grow with him. Its simple design, nothing exciting but teaches counting and shape identification and listening and fokkowing instruction
B00005JMX6|5.0|This could easily have been a stupid, B movie grade piece of junk, but the characters turn out to actually have depth, and make you really cheer them on. It doesn't hurt that Elisha Cuthbert is drop dead gorgeous - what red-blooded male with a heart beat wouldn't want her to be the Girl Next Door? What's surprising though is that she, like the other characters, actually has qualities that are appealing beyond the physical charms. It's the typical &#34;smart boy meets hot girl, becomes stupid and nearly loses everything, but in the end returns to reality with a new look on life and a girlfriend to boot&#34; movie, but it is done so well.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I had over 2000 monkey money I had been saving and I was rank 74. I decided to start a game then after on the 14 round my kindle shut of so I turned it back on to see if anything had happened and my game was erased, all of the stats were reset and I had to start again. But this is still a great game. Did this happen to anybody else?
B00005JPO1|3.0|Wasn't the best movie of the franchise, but at least it wasn't the worst. This beats out Temple of Doom but not by much.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Great cast of characters that are growing into a magical, fantastic story! Can't wait for season 3! Roll on the battle for westeros!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|sweet I love this one of the best apps I have found so far thank you what will you guys think of next my husband will love this app aswell
