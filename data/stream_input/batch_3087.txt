B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Facebook games of all!  I must play this game every day!  It is very addictive.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Same as above, great story but poor quality of video, kept freezing and distorting. All in all I enjoyed this series.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Logical analysis of the change in our country's employment possibilities.  An inspiring book for anyone who is seeking the courage to use the time they have left on this earth to create something, anything.
B005PK57NU|4.0|The Good Wife is a terrific series that continues to hold my attention.  It defies the standard formulaic progression many of the dramatic series fall prey to; focusing too long on one particular relationship or rehashing the same story lines.  Just when you think you can guarantee what is about to happen the story turns left.
B00EPFEY44|2.0|DVD was not the entire concert as shown on PBS, with many songs being cut. I loved the PBS concert and was looking forward to owning it but I wasn't looking for &#34;highlights&#34;. I wanted the whole show. Very disappointing; I returned it the day after watching it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|The 2nd season is dramatic. The development of the characters has made me want to like and really dislike certain people at the same time. I've Already started the 3rd. I highly recommend this series. I'm totally hooked and you will be too.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Normally, I have a little trouble with so many different characters, but the author made. It fairly easy for me.  As usual, it was hard for me to put down.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|It's great to hear the younger generation carrying on good time rock-a-billy.<br /><br />I thought it was over when the Stray Cats stoped<br /><br />Ted Turner
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said by other reviews here.<br /><br />This book is awful. Poorly written, redundant, and mind-boggling as to how it garnered so much praise.<br /><br />If you are a serious reader, don't waste your brain here.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I first saw Imelda on the T.V. and thought I would give her a listen.<br /><br />Not disappointed, I continue to play the album every couple weeks.<br /><br />Keep on rockin' Imelda.<br /><br />Ted Turner
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Loved this film, Nice to see all these famous actors in one great movie. It is action packed and always a treat to set with my husband and watch a great movie like this one.
B00004VW0V|5.0|Just had to collect it on C.D. because the record is worn out.<br /><br />I now have most of the man's works on C.D. There will be only the one<br />Cat Stevens.<br /><br />Ted Turner
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game keeps me on my toes.  I have a lot of fun trying to get the little vampire thru the maze and sometimes it's a real challenge.  Definitely a coordination game but very enjoyable!!!
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|Yes he has still got it, whatever it is. I enjoy listening to the old pros.<br /><br />The younger ones still can learn from masters such as Eric. Things that<br />you can learn with time.<br /><br />Ted Turner
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'll use this app all the time, never had a problem with it ,really nice, love it. Works with or without wireless.
B000002G8H|4.0|Still holds memories for me.  Yes I was around when these where  new.<br />I enjoy the sounds of Eric's guitars. AS a fan it's good to be able to listen to those songs in the car.<br /><br />Ted Turner
006202406X|1.0|I was not a fan of the conclusion of the series. And not for the obvious reason. I just thought the conclusion was lack luster. It wasn't exciting it wasn't hearfelt. It just wasn't good. It stumbled along to a conclusion that you could see coming from a mile away. Veronica might have thought the brave thing to do was what she did and go against the grain. But to me the brave thing to do would have been to find a new interesting way to give Tris and Tobias a happily ever after. In book 3 she introduced a huge new world and solves all it's problems in one chapter in the end. No huge fight no exciting conclusion. It's a hand shake and a button push. I'm so unexcited about this book I don't think I'll even waste my time seeing the movie. There is nothing more heartbreaking than an author taking a series you love and throwing it in the toilet.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Don't like the idea of my &#34;stuff&#34; being in the cloud.  I have it backed up just fine.  What happens if the cloud dissipates, lol?
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This is my third FlipPix game, and I love it!  On the lower levels, I challenge myself by doing the puzzle using only the paintbrush. Give me more!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have Star Trek movies on VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray, some on Laser Disc as well.  I enjoy then all but my wife likes the new look at the series.  I like looking at how things &#34;might have been&#34; and the story lines are intriguing.
B005JABSB6|4.0|We had 2 pair already, but  if anyone comes over-2 wasn' t enough to share. As electronics keep moving on to the next level-I didn't want to wait and find they were no longer available when I wanted to get spares.
0375869026|5.0|It's heartwarming, funny, and has a great message for kids and parents alike. I highly recommend this book! Also, have tissue ready when reading this book. My favorite quote is \\"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.\\"
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My son and I love Shaun the Sheep and all his silly antics!  This is fun for the whole family.  We look forward to season 3.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Story good. Acting nothing spectacular.  Glad I didn't pay theater prices to watch. Not worth it in my humble opinion.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Connelly is one of my favorite authors.  I read this when it first came out, and was happy to re-read it.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I can't believe this movie is based on true events, pure brilliant! You definitely need to watch this movie. Just watch it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator on my Kindle and this fit the bill. I'm happy with it. It fills a hole in the Kindle apps.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|We all love this game and fight over who gets to play it. It addicting and fun! Wish I could give t more stars
B002X1JKG4|5.0|This is such a fun movie. The main characters playoff each other so well. My wife who doesn't usually like westerns loved this movie
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Very entertaining game!  Time flies when you are playing  it takes a lot of logic to beat the spider. It is definitely fun and definitely addictive!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The kids in this movie are great actors.  McConaughey does great work and I prefer him in serious roles like this.  The setting itself is a character.  I wasn't as much moved by the story line as I was the acting and the setting.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Its like walking dead, but with aliens. Walking Dead is amazing and I love anything sci-fi. So far its awesome!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books, but this book in the trilogy was a major disappointment. The story lacked the intensity of the previous books and I am sure fans will hate how the book ended.
0345410025|4.0|Good methods and techniques for memorizing long lists of random words... Great especially for college students doing a lot of studying!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|A Fabulous thriller with first rate actors!!<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fun and adventurous film. Watch it, you'll love it
B00E0SX118|5.0|Purchased this because of a recommendation by our adult children. It was a wonderful story and well done. It kept us on the edge of our seats all the way through to the end. We started to rent it but tried to change before it downloaded to a purchase order. Got billed for both unfortunately so be careful. I know I'll be more careful next time. My husband and I both look forward to viewing The Croods again.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I JUST LOVE THESE BOOKS AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR MORE wonderful BOOKS TO COME<br />GOOD LUCK<br />I CANNOT WAIT
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Understanding Exposure has been very helpful to me as a novice photographer. I recently purchased my first DSLR camera from Canon and moved from the point and shoot world to a higher level of photography.  Bryan Peterson writes in a clear and easy to understand manner.  The photographs in the book are beautiful and definitely help to educate the reader on how to make better exposures.  If you are new to digital photography I would highly recommend &#34;Understanding Exposure&#34; by Bryan Peterson.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I HAVE FOUND ANOTHER FAVORITE AUTHOR.  Beautiful style, great characters , endearing story, and a delightful ending.  I will enjoy reading the other titles from Christina Baker Kline.

1585104205|5.0|A very pleasant way of learning Latin and Roman culture.  Very good book! An easier method to learn and undersand Latin.
B0073B587E|5.0|This is really cool.  It turns my iPad into a guitar.  The interface isn't perfect, but for having fun it's great.  The iPad fits in perfect, no worries about it falling out.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Great action movie.  Mr. De Niro's acting is spot on as usual.  This movie has some character actors supporting him, too.  The story line kept me thoroighly involved and interested.  Wonderful movie
B009K916ZK|3.0|This one works as well as others I've ordered.  To be perfectly honest, I hate these adapters in general, not this one particularly, just this design.  None of the brands, up to and including the Apple ones, have lasted for a significant amount of time.  When they work they work great.  Wish they would go back to the old design though.
1423101502|1.0|worst books ever made in the history of the world. I hated all of them. they were so terrible I almost exploted.
B003DDKAT2|4.0|Listen, I love this movie, but let's be honest, it's terrible. It's like a soft-core gay vampire porn. NO, there is no sex or indication thereof, it's full of passing glances and open shirts between fellas. I think Tom Cruise might be the best actor in the film, a statement I find embarrassing to let pass my lips but hey. Wee Kirsten Dust is good too. Everyone else is wooden at best. All that said it is silly on top of silly. I'm not even entirely certain what the plot is. There's a beginning and a few middles. Not sure there is a real end. Nothing is solved or &#34;ended&#34;. Pretty people do pretty things. I quite like it.
B008J05EL8|1.0|this is no good does not work wasted my money, I do not rec-amend this to any one. I wish I could get my coins back on this. I want a refund. I do not want any one else to waste there money on this. It needs to be removed from being sold..........

B000E97X66|5.0|I saw Bruce in 1976 in Oregon... 2500 capacity theater on the Saturday night of the week he was on BOTH... Newsweek's and Time's covers... . I will not attempt to impart the impression I was 8 rows back center stage, mid 20s and had heard from East Coast friends that something very special beyond normal Rock and Roll was afoot... they spoke in tones that were... hopeful and inspired... so I had, to go. Sometimes an event transcends its medium... .<br /><br />But in this music and the very fine video... you can view it on YouTube... the raw creativity and youth and the added conscious I suspect... introduction to London and the UK of the E Street band and Bruce Springsteen... is different.<br /><br />It is a meta... moment in the Consciousness of the West that VERY few Rock and Roll related events historically have reached... but whose influence ripples outward into other fields and into space and the Earth itself. Too much? The human psyche is the gate to the vault... of the making... of Being... and some live lives lit by that radiance of creative change... live them to a degree for all of us.<br /><br />Concerning theater... and Bruce... while watching this I realized that theater... that is the reenactment of a poetic vision turned into a song and washed through the culture... and then recapitulated again in a never ending feedback... was what was in 1975 in this concert... so fresh and new to me although the presentation a year after in the Born to Run tour was slicker... here in its more raw form, we remember our youth and when new things were new... .<br /><br />Bruce is loved because of his musics artistic merit and cross tribal very American appeal world wide... by that I mean he is an element of the best of the old America... where anything is possible and everything should be tried at least ideally and if one does not... then in art... that \\"suppression\\" is always portrayed as the font, of sickness.<br /><br />Whether this be true or not... Bruce's supremely honest, sentimentality and subtle takes on a person, a time, a girl, or a group of friends and of music and band life... with political anger thrown in... well it defined a time and place.<br /><br />For those that say that the 70s was a wasteland after the 60s in music (the Marxist tribal... tone of this is too obvious to go into) the list of deeper musicianship in many cases and greater song writing, still sings clearly... but then there was Bruce.<br /><br />He was kind of 60s, had a love for the 50s and bows to it constantly, was never a precursor really of punk or the parade of a rock star/music or certainly not, the 80s techno bands (well Talking Heads had genius) he was Bruce. Still American to the core, a working class prince... with nobility written all over him and his art and his life.<br /><br />Too much? I beleive that in the 70s and with exceptions of other art and artists... few people even attempted to live up to a standard of his own image in other people's lives... he was and is cognizant of that... understanding his role long after his success artistically.<br /><br />The devotion to Bruce Springsteen is close to the old unashamed love of America... the America not controlled embarrassingly by bankers and crass propaganda corrals and fake terror events and psycho active drugs to thwart the empty emasculated response to lies in all direction.<br /><br />He may have naive political understandings at times... but his soul and heart are exactly placed where a good human being wanting the best for others and loving humanity... should be and he says so in his music and in the \\"theater\\" of our sad rise and fall. He has a target in every concert: to make his audience believe in a true heart again.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Trying to aim any weapon in this game is next to impossible.  Graphics are very unsteady.  This detracted from the game to the point I totally gave up.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as good as the book but still worth watching. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing Katniss and Woody Harrelson is awesome.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app my grandson loves it. He is only 20 months but doesn't like the fake horse apps loves to let the horse run in the pasture. Give it a try you will like it.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Excellent music and compelling plot that really makes you cheer for the characters. Although I had hoped all would go well with them, I wouldn't have guessed how much the final episode touched me.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I personally enjoy this game. It's fun, but unfortunately you're limited to what you can do by funds. The dinosaurs money gauges fill up fairly quickly, but unless you play all day, and every minute of everyday, you're unlikely to reap the full benefits. Overall, I'd download it and see for yourself.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Smart TV on a budget! I use this on my upstairs TV that is not a Smart TV, its setup and operation are seamless, now netflix doesnt have to be watched on a laptop!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Book is well written and starightforward.  Contains some helpfull information but most is not earth shattering.  Book is a quick read.
B0064W667Y|4.0|Like Once Upon a Time, if Once Upon a Time were on HBO. I Can't wait to start volume two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Even my 8 year old grandson enjoys Candy Crush Saga. When I get stuck on a board and he's in town, I pass it to him. I also have Candy Crush downloaded on my Android.
B0068THAGY|4.0|This movie keeps your attention and is another Spielberg winner with unusual outcome. One has to have a vivid mind to wrap around the outcome.
0743487583|5.0|Used it for class and it was as described. Love the price, so I didn't have to pay a fortune. Shipped quickly and had it in time for class.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|Heath Ledger's performance was my motivation for watching this movie. I was not disappointed. Quite impressed actually.  Otherwise a rather pedestrian movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Streaming from apps on Android or YouTube on a computer works great. Streaming a Chrome browser does not work as well as advertised. At current, it is an extremely low refresh rate- no good for video. Hopefully they fix this in an update. Also it would be nice to see support for Chrome on Android, once they get the Chrome on PC working.
B00BVGNWES|3.0|Good weekend on the couch movie. The ending leaves the obvious change for a sequel but gives not thought into why it happens.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first,  I thought this game was going to be like 100 floors. Once I started playing the game,  I did not want to stop playing. I just wish there were more levels. This game really makes you think.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Took two showings to understand, once for us and once for Grand Kids. Special effects pretty good. Seems there was a lack of diction in some scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love Candy Crush! So disappointed that I had to play on my phone for 10 months. Love the Kindle app for this. Nice and big and great graphics!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Brad Pitt pulls off yet another great character role in this Taratino flick. Solid character development with the diaolgue you have come to expect from Taratino movies. All in all this is a fun movie with a lot of great and up and coming actors. It is pretty much a throw back to the Dirty Dozen.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love big bang, so of course I would love the box sets.  I can watch any show any time over and over.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Action packed with great character development. With just enough throwbacks to the Original series for people who remember them. This is a movie for people that like either action, sfi-fy, or drama.
B005GT3XGS|4.0|Everything arrived in great condition and the discs play great. Can't wait to have a Bones Marathon and a bowl of popcorn!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I just wanted to see what this Candy Crush saga is all about and downloaded since it is free (Thanks for that) But I find it extremely frustrating to see that it is no different from most other match 3 types of games. Agreed the voice overs like \\"Sweet\\" & SFX are nicer compared to most other games in this category but what frustrates me most is that why do you need to pay, beg, for lives just to play this game? - Played few levels once I got the hint that this game is going to cost me money just to continue my sugar rush was over. Uninstalled it.
B002JVWR4K|4.0|Love Bones! Everything arrived in great condition and the discs play great. Can't wait to have a Bones Marathon and a bowl of popcorn!
B0041KW78S|1.0|I don't speak Italian and nothing stated that was what I was buying. Now trying to get a refund. Bogus advertisement.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Thought-provoking. Well-developed characters. Very enjoyable for teens and adults without much profanity or improper content. I loved it these books!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series, can't wait for Season 4! The characters are beautifully played, makes me fill like I am a part of all things going on. The series is fully believable.  I can imagine me being there.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|never saw a ghost on the radar. the &quot;UNTITLED EVENTS&quot; are annoying and inconvenient. I know it's fake, but I've always found this app fun. until this version. inconveniently small radar.
B00G32TD98|5.0|the conjuring is a classic horror movie that is kind of a throwback 2 times when you didn't need to have a bunch of gore and gross out just make a good movie
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for my grandaughter. She asks to play it daily.  She is only three so I have to help her a lot. It is fun for us to play together.
0782008364|5.0|This is the best lesbian movie ever. It had a great plot lots of action and real hot lesbian action.
0316219266|1.0|In the first chapter, the book sets the stage for Bezos’s decision to leave his job and build an Internet bookstore.  “At the time Bezos was thinking about what to do next, he had recently finished the novel Remains of the Day, by Kazuo Ishiguro, about a butler who wistfully recalls his personal and professional choices during a career in service in wartime Great Britain.  So looking back on life’s important junctures was on Bezos’s mind when he came up with what he calls ‘the regret-minimization framework’ to decide the next step to take at this juncture in his career.”  It’s a good beginning, and it weaves in nicely with what’s to come.  But it’s not true.  Jeff didn’t read Remains of the Day until a year after he started Amazon.<br /><br />If this were an isolated example, it might not matter, but it’s not.  Everywhere I can fact check from personal knowledge, I find way too many inaccuracies, and unfortunately that casts doubt over every episode in the book.  Like two other reviewers here, Jonathan Leblang and Rick Dalzell, I have firsthand knowledge of many of the events.  I worked for Jeff at D. E. Shaw, I was there when he wrote the business plan, and I worked with him and many others represented in the converted garage, the basement warehouse closet, the barbecue-scented offices, the Christmas-rush distribution centers, and the door-desk filled conference rooms in the early years of Amazon’s history.  Jeff and I have been married for 20 years.<br /><br />While numerous factual inaccuracies are certainly troubling in a book being promoted to readers as a meticulously researched definitive history, they are not the biggest problem here.  The book is also full of techniques which stretch the boundaries of non-fiction, and the result is a lopsided and misleading portrait of the people and culture at Amazon.  An author writing about any large organization will encounter people who recall moments of tension out of tens of thousands of hours of meetings and characterize them in their own way, and including those is legitimate.  But I would caution readers to take note of the weak rhetorical devices used to make it sound like these quotes reflect daily life at Amazon or the majority viewpoint about working there.<br /><br />For example, when the author does include people whose accounts of a supportive and inspiring culture contradict his thesis, he refers to them dismissively throughout the book as robots.  In an archive of the thousands of thank you messages written to Jeff over the years, a small sampling includes “I just wanted to thank you for giving my husband the opportunity to work for your company so many years ago and let you know that he always spoke kindly and enthusiastically of the distribution center, the people and you.”  “Having finished my shift I thought I would send you a short email to say thank you. There is a fantastic team based here and we have super support.  Our mentors are true Amazon angels providing guidance and showing great patience.”  “I cried as I read the Career Choice announcement on Amazon today.  What Amazon is doing to help its employees is affecting lives in the most meaningful way I can think of.  It restores my faith in humanity.”  It seems like unbalanced reporting to avoid including the point of view of more people like these (and to use narrative tricks to discredit those who are included), given how plentiful they are.<br /><br />In light of the focus in many of the reviews here and elsewhere on what the book “reveals” about Jeff’s motives, I will also point out that the passage about what was on his mind when he decided to start Amazon is far from the only place where the book passes off speculation about his thoughts and intentions as fact.  “Bezos felt…” “Bezos believed….”  “Bezos wanted….”  “Bezos fixated…”  “Bezos worried….” “Bezos was frustrated…”  “Bezos was consumed…”  “In the circuitryof Bezos’s brain, something flipped…”  When reading phrases like these, which are used in the book routinely, readers should remember that Jeff was never interviewed for this book, and should also take note of how seldom these guesses about his feelings and motives are marked with a footnote indicating there is any other source to substantiate them.<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges in non-fiction writing is the risk that a truthfully balanced narration of the facts will be boring, and this presents an author with some difficult choices.  It may be that another telling of the Amazon story—for example, that people at Amazon have no secret agenda they’ve been able to keep hidden for 19 years, really do believe in the mission they keep repeating, and are working hard and of their own free will to realize it —would strike readers as less exciting than the version offered here.  I sympathize with this challenge.  But when an author plans to market a book as non-fiction, he is obliged to find a suspenseful story arc that doesn’t rely on mischaracterizing or avoiding important parts of the truth.  I am grateful this is the era of the Internet, when characters in non-fiction can step out of books, as Jonathan Leblang and Rick Dalzell have done, and speak for themselves.  Ideally, authors are careful to ensure people know whether what they are reading is history or an entertaining fictionalization.  Hollywood often uses a more honest label: “a story based on true events.”  If authors won’t admit they’ve crossed this important line, their characters can do it for them.n the book routinely, readers should remember that Jeff was never interviewed for this book, and should also take note of how seldom these guesses about his feelings and motives are marked with a footnote indicating there is any other source to substantiate them.<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges in non-fiction writing is the risk that a truthfully balanced narration of the facts will be boring, and this presents an author with some difficult choices.

B00EXVZW6E|4.0|Not real easy . Nice challenge if that's what you are looking for. It can get pretty hard as you move.forward. If you want easy, skip this.
B00BU1DG1S|4.0|It's just very good.  I find myself remembering certain parts of the story and pondering them long after I finished reading it.  I am happy to have been surprised in such a positive way by a new SF writer and I look forward to more!
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I never want to watch a horror movie 2 times in a row, but this movie I wanted to watch it again and again. It has a great story, and some pretty freaky moments. \\"Mama\\" is based off of CGI, and personally I didn't find her all that frightening.On the other hand the two little girls in this movie are very horrifying when they are making the adjustment back to reality. I suggest this movie strongly to those who love a thriller with a solid story.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|absolutely awesome fun film. won't challenge world views or make you think about your own mortality. just plain unadulterated fun!
B002A9VJ40|5.0|This is an awesome movie! Such a classic! Being able to watch it on my iPad at any given moment is such a nice feature of Amazon Prime.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was not what I thought it would be.Thought it was a little short .I finished it in about 30minutes.But it was pretty funny
B0045HCJSK|4.0|I like all of John Wayne. The casts always delivers 1st rate performances. This is just one more movie I have added to my collection.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Quick read.  Good insight.  Pressfield takes you through the example of writing a book with samples that can be applied to any profession.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Pacific Rim is a American take on the Godzilla destroys Tokyo type of Japanese movie.  It does hold together well enough for the traditional scifi fan to enjoy.  I enjoy the Godzilla movies except for the fact that their voices don't match the lip movements of the actors.  That always annoyed me.  In this movie their words match their lip movements.  In addition there is a better than average story line and plot than the Japanese Godzilla movies.  I like the fact that this movie tries to get to the root of the problem of these gigantic monsters and solve that problem of monsters coming through a dimensional rift rather than simply destroying the bad monsters.  It's a nice variation on the alien invasion theme.  The graphics are good but not spectacular.  The movie was engaging enough to keep a Godzilla fan interested.  I would like to see more over the top movies like this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|i couldnt keep all the characters straight at first, but they wove together in a satisfying twist of life, fate and irony.  characters weren't lovable, or some even very likable, but they were human and eventually you could identify with them.  written as not an in-depth character study, just as a chronicle of events with several surprises.  a pretty good read.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun with a decent storyline and plot to back it up.  It kept me engaged for the entire movie.  The only issue I would have with any part of this movie was Jeff Bridges accent.  His accent and speech mannerisms put me off.  His acting was good except for the accent.  Over all I rated this movie with five stars because it is a good straight man type of comedy, not slapstick or overly in your face type of comedy.  Moreover, it has an interesting plot but not complicated enough to get in the way of enjoying the comedy.  It has an interesting take on the afterlife with deceased police officers tracking down bad souls.  A good fun watch.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Great book very interesting read. Have change my diet and feel much better. Have some health issues and hope it will make a difference.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|Nirvana is my favorite band of all time. It's great to have some of the songs off the Bleach album. This DVD is amazing the humor and power of the band really shows through. Got here ahead of time in perfect condition. Very satisfied.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|A different twist, with fast running zombies. Not one of Brad Pitt's best movies. Troy was awesome! This was entertaining, but not awesome.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Incredible end to a incredible series!! I laughed, cried, was stomping mad, and as always my heart sighed whenever Aiden was on the page. Sad to see it end but it could not have been a better ending!! Thank you so much Jennifer for share this amazing world with us!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This hunting game makes me feel like that i am actually hunting it makes me feel like that i am getting back at someone for some reason
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|To me, this album is similar to 808s & Heartbreak as far as Kanye's experimentation. First time I listened, I regarded it as trash. But much like 808s & Heartbreak, the more I listened, the more I enjoyed the album and now I listen to the album daily. The lyrics are the true strength of this album and Kanye really has some powerful and thought-provking prowess on many of the tracks. &#34;Bound&#34; and &#34;New Slaves&#34; are my absolute favorite tracks on the entire album. The beats take some getting used to and the album is fairly short but the entire album is perfect for working out to or when you're riding around and reflecting over your life. There's no middle ground with this album. Either you'll love it or you'll hate it.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I had been looking  for this movie and I finally found it.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Thanks
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Program is excellent if u need to read PDF files. It would be nice if it had the ability to read DOC files too
B00E193TM2|5.0|Excellent album by FFDP to date... the emotion and power brought me close to tears. Its that good and i suggest this to any knuckleheads.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is a very clever device. Because I enjoy making lists, I shall provide you with two. Yay!<br /><br />*Pros*<br />Casting (on Android) from Netflix or Hulu is easy and smooth. No issues (so far)<br />The device is small and light, making it portable (sort of)<br />HDMI connection<br />Inexpensive<br /><br />*Cons*<br />HDMI connection, if you don't have HDMI, you gots no video!<br />You must use your device as a remote, which makes sense, but if your device locks and you have a security code, you'll need to unlock before you can pause/do other things. Not the biggest deal but for people used to dedicated remotes, this could be annoying.<br />Not many apps can cast so far!<br /><br />*Neutral*<br />LED on the device is somewhat bright. Do with that information what you will.<br />Requires connection to power source. If your TV is mounted on the wall, you'll have an additional cable dangling.
0930289234|5.0|As to be expected amazing read.<br />Seller got must have mailed it meer hours after I ordered it, before a holiday none the less.<br /><br />This guy is one hell of a model American.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games because they keep my mind working, I am no genius!! I loved this game not only for its graphics but the entertainment it provided by making the player a part of a &quot;story.&quot;  It really gets you hooked like a good book or movie. I would recommend it to anyone!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Like other kindle users I've been waiting for this to come for Amazon. I wrote u guys &amp; u have finally heard our cries...LOL. THX A BUNCH
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard so much about this app and wondered what the fuss was about. Now I know. This game is a lot of fun, and also quite challenging. I really have to limit the amount of time I spend playing Candy Crush. I lose hours trying to reach the next level. Recommended.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Solid story. Quick, easy, read.<br />Really enjoyed the flow of the story and look forward to the next in the series.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|I forgot about all the bad language, but still a fun movie. The kids really enjoyed it like I did as a kid.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Caveat emptor, another glitchy movie and another one I got almost for free, and again if I take the punishment for putting this up, I do.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I bought this mostly because the price.  All the CD's worked great; no skipping; case is in excellent condition. This met my expectation.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|A good movie, no glitches and fun to watch. It might be worth purchasing The Lord of the Rings also for a complete sense of saga.
B008JFUOVI|5.0|Arrived promptly as advertised.  Packed well with absolutely NO issues.  The movie itself is another funny segment of the Hangover series.  It is not necessary to watch the first 2 before watching this movie.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|A good movie with some glitches in it caveat emptor -- I got it for free, though, so I guess if I take the punishment for putting this up I do.
B00AVASSZ8|4.0|Great Album. It's definitely a jam through album. I love what Jose James brings to the landscape of music. A must by album for 2013.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome app that gives you an exact answer and has helped  me  through school a lot!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this app to anyone and everyone!!! Should be worth $19.99!!!!
B00EZZ9W3C|4.0|Great Album! Hey Laura is probably my fav on this album. Gregory Porter is probably the most consistent artist out there. I know what to expect when I buy his albums.
1451666179|5.0|My only complaint is that I bought the Kindle edition, so the pictures are all in black and white.<br /><br />There is more truth in these pages than I've read in a long time.  Thanks to the author for opening up.  That took some guts.  And it was still entertaining. That took some talent.
B00DM11LV6|5.0|I thought this was a great movie; the acting isn't too bad for the main characters, I especially liked Elena's character. Thought the plot was interesting. I like the side stories of people with their \\"twin flames\\" and I liked the premise of the \\"true love\\" idea in spite of my skeptical self. Just a good movie all around; a good watch.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am a visually impaired person with total night blindness.  These small motion sensing lights allow me to move through my home in the dark without tripping or running into things.  We have set up the lights so that subsequent lights illuminate before the previous light goes out. This is a great product and I expect I'll be buying more of them.
B00ECLTYOG|3.0|I would actually say 3.5, if I could, but since I can't I thought rounding down was more appropriate. No new ground covered, but that is kind of a plus as the formula works. Only deviation is that it doesn't begin with a blackout. Oddly violent, though.  Sort of a SPOILER ALERT:  The first couple were crazy but nobody got killed.  People getting shot and killed very quickly sobers up this movie.
B003YY7BTW|4.0|Predictable but very entertaining. Great choice in leading parts. Funny! A few surprises, Jennifer Lopez is great! Supporting cast is excellent.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Suspend all reality. relax and laugh. Characters were funny. Fighting was overdone and silly but not graphic and super bloody. If you like comic books try it. Not worth the 10 movie price. 1.25 from redbox is more the correct price. Did not feel like driving so gave amazon 4.99.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging game. The further you go the harder the levels. Fun to compair between stags of your friends and relatives. Can ask others for extra lives or moves during the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is very addictive and a great time passer when you are waiting on something I recommend this game
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The Fringe is very creative and well written show that is also gross and not for kids (or squeamish adults).  I over look the psycho crazy nature of what they face and forgive the often silly science to enjoy the adventure and fine acting.  Not too many plot holes and the characters don't act out of character for the most part.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Terrific! It's so much fun!  I love being able to play it on the go instead of on my desktop.
B00AHSKRJ4|5.0|Both actors are excellent in this movie. The first time I saw it I wasn't sure I liked it but after watching it again I watched the characters and the performance they gave individually was so good I had to have the movie. I would recommend this movie if you like either of these actors because before its over you will love then both.
B000V674E8|5.0|Roger Hodgson is at his best in cretivity on this entire collection. The whole CD is really a story. If you listen well, it all ties together, one could go so far as to link it with the great release before it, Crime of the Century. This is not only a great example of their mastery with out of sync timing hues, it is a very well planned execution in musicianship and musical prowess.  They have never been better then these last two releases. Sadly, they have never matched them either.  This is powerful stuff.
B00EV0CXZ0|5.0|Now I have new copies of all their albums. One of my favorite bands of all time. Great music. Nice package. I got 911 of 5000. Love it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast works well for Netfilx and Youtube controlled from my iPhone. Wish it also did full screen mirroring as well.
B009XI7RF6|1.0|Takes too long to load. I stopped there. I don't know what the app is about, but WHO CARES?! Even though I'm only 9, I l know so much about apps. Don't get it. I got it for free yesterday, because it was the free app of the day. But like I said, it sucks
B003VANOFY|4.0|Works great... I know some people have had issues with the G930s but if you keep the Logitech Gaming Software up to date, you should have no issues.
B006T9Y278|5.0|Superb cast.  Romance and intrigue abound.  Humor and sadness play equal roles in this historical fiction.  Great movie!  I recommend it to all who love wonderful acting.
1595827684|5.0|Really nice book with great art for our budding digital animator. It will make a nice gift when the time comes.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The last installment of this trilogy felt extremely rushed.  I would have rather waited two more years for this book to come out, had I felt like it would end in a way that fit in better with the first two books.  Everything about this felt like it wasn't completely thought out, and a lot of what happened did not make sense for the characters.<br /><br />For example (SPOILER ALERT):<br /><br />Did anyone really think, for one second, that Tris would let Caleb sacrifice himself? Therefore, why would Tobias think that she would? He knew her well enough to know that that would have NEVER happened.  Yet, he went back into the city without a question and left her in the compound to \\"save the world\\".<br /><br />Tobias is also not one to trust very easily, so why would he have so quickly trusted Nita?<br /><br />There was this crazy buildup of Evelyn as this evil leader, and all it took to get her to stop was Tobias making her choose between him and the war.  That was way too easy!<br /><br />Did Uriah's death add anything to the book, other than causing Tobias to have to go back to the city to tell Zeke and his mother? I think that his death definitely made Tobias feel worse about working with Nita, but I think he felt bad enough before finding out about Uriah.  He made a mistake and Tris always had to be right about everything.  I would have liked to see Tobias be right about something, for once.  I really wanted Tris and Tobias to work together equally.  I felt like Veronica was leading up to them finally working together and having an equal trust of each other in their relationship, but then Tris had her plan with the memory serum and no one else's opinion mattered.<br /><br />When Tris died, it was like she wasn't even trying to stay alive.  She just accepted it.  When in Insurgent, on her way to be given the death serum, she realized how much she wanted to live.  I don't think it was necessary to kill Tris.  I honestly don't think it added to the story in any way.  If anything, it makes me not want to recommend this trilogy to people anymore.  Tris was a survivor.  She would have fought a lot harder to live.<br /><br />Overall, I did love this trilogy.  I would have liked it to have ended differently, and I would have liked Veronica Roth to have had a little more time to think through the rushed ending, but I'm still happy I read the book and finished the trilogy.  Maybe she will see all of these reviews and allow the movie to end differently, or she will write an alternate ending :)
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I found this to be so close to home it was quite incredible. I'm getting my entire group of IT Managers to read this and hopefully, they'll encourage their staff as well. It enforces Systems Thinking, covers the Theory of Constraints and gives you an entire arsenal of tools, techniques and discussions to have with your IT teams and your business counterparts. Excellent reading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have always loved A Time to Kill, and this book picks up right where A Time to Kill left off.  The characters are true to form and the legal battling is sometimes humorous.  This book is definitely a Home Run from John Grisham.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say?  I love everything about this series.  The characters, the setting, the story lines....and how can you not love High Clere castle.
B001NLKSI4|5.0|this helped me close the loop on so many questions I had from reading the Wolf of Wall Street. What a smart guy and yet also I couldn't help but feel sad for him too.
8867320793|5.0|I got this for my little sister and she loves it!  The embossing of Smaug is great, and from what my sister has said the artwork is cool too.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Amazing story that almost seems to be fiction until you research it... The guy had a knack and it's pretty cool and humorous the way it's told. It's not the best written story but you can tell why he was so successful!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Wanted to re read this story prior to seeing the movie.  It is a bit dated, but still kept my interest to the end.  I uncewrstand that Hollywood has changed the timeline and other story issues so that it is all speacial effects.
B000FC10MU|1.0|this is by far the weirdest book I've ever read. ever. the scene where the woman takes a man into her vagina for power after he is worshiping her had me going WTF....
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great mouse. I had a Naga and it started to act funny (right mouse button).  Took about 10 minutes to get the sensitivity I wanted, which is huge for gaming.<br /><br />Only few things I would change is the material the thumb grip is made out of and the plastic does feel a little flimsy. So if you have nerd rage I would stay away from this mouse.<br /><br />I am a gamer. I would recommended this mouse. Playing LOL it seemed like I had more control.<br /><br />Installing the software was easy. I will buy from this company again.<br /><br />It isn't as comfortable as the Naga, but it takes time to get adjusted. Also for 40 bucks can't really beat that.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Awesome technology! I think it will be amazing when  you can stream Amazon Prime, Pandora, and your iPad screen to the TV... until then, it's okay.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This was a fun read and held my attention. The narrator, who appears to have Asbergers Syndrome, is wildly oblivious about having it, but does recognize that he has difficulty in relationships with others. In his attempts to find a suitable wife it becomes clear to him that what he thinks he wants may not be what would actually work for him.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|this was delivered before it was due. that makes this great...this movie to me is rated ....A+++++++++...one of the scarest movies ive seen. glad amazon made it available to order before it was done at the theaters.....it came at just the right time  a day before halloween.....love it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many awesome recipes on here. I love cooking even more than before.  I look forward to my next meal now.<br />Thank you Pinterest!
B004GYY714|4.0|Love to listen to AM 'talk radio'. I can play back Mark Levin shows that I missed live. They are all on file, by date and topic.<br />I use a Fios wifi router with a wifi-only iPhone 4(up to date OS7), that down-loads older shows completely (in case I move out of wifi-range).<br />When listening to live shows (WRKO Boston 680 AM) I have to stay in range of my Fios wifi.<br /><br />Only negative is short drop-outs during live shows. One or two seconds of dead-air.

6300189821|3.0|I liked it because of the Pinocchio theme set in modern time, and also the song NOTHING'S GONNA STOP US NOW by Starship, played during the closing credits. Also it was interesting to see Estelle Getty playing a role other than Sophia Petrillo on Golden Girls. For a simple light comedy it was O.K. but I couldn't give it more than three stars for a comedy of this sort.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it love it love it  great past time love this game on all my devices wish the lives were infinite because I never want to stop playing love it love it love it love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait until my lives renew to play again
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Nice game to play lots of fun<br />Great pastime. The only thing is the waiting for extra lives to continue.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Quick read. Great examples on how to turn your passion/hobby/special skill into dollars. Good insight on marketing strategies. The piece that is missing in my eyes is exercises and or methods to explore or examine ones passion/hobby/skill. Sometimes hidden talents can be the biggest gold rush.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Iwas completely caught by Theo. When.I was not engrossed in reading the book, I worried about him-what is he doing? Is he all right? If the phone rang while I has the iPad in my hands, I had to drag myself back into the world. I am 90& the last paragraphs about life resonated with me. I want everyone to experience The Goldfinch.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|There are already 1600 reviews. I don't think it's necessary for me to even attempt to summarize the plot. Besides, it's the WORLD'S best-selling science fiction novel of all times. I want to stress that the Kindle edition I got two days ago is beautifully edited and identical to the paperbound I read over and over starting in 1973.<br /><br />I was &#34;into&#34; sci-fi in 1973. I was also commuting from my home to San Francisco every day when I started Dune. I loved the book (and at the beginning of each chapter, perhaps a book within the book) so much, that I started meting out my reading of it for commute hours only. That's one reason it took me 6 months to finish it. There are times when it's good to be a slow reader, and there are times when it's great to be able to stretch out something so enjoyable for such a long time.<br /><br />Absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately, I could never get into the other two books in the Dune Trilogy. THIS stands on its own.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great story and well made movie with just the right amount of special effects.  The book is better though, I hear.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a teacher I work with.  I have not had time to finish it yet, but I am loving the story sequence.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|WONDERFUL MOVIE, my kids loved seeing the little robot do his thing, and I love how the movie says so much without saying anything!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have not read a lot of post apocalyptic type books but am really glad I picked this one up. Perhaps I've discovered a new genre for me? Or a new author! I thought the characters were very well written, the plot 'conceivable, and the pacing....well, I couldn't put it down!
006202406X|5.0|As i just said, the book has a really sad ending. I was at the verge of tears when i finished reading it, and not because there sill be no more divergent books, but because the content is so emotional.<br />SPOILERS<br />Many people die. And one of my favorites, Tris, is the one who sent me on te verge kf tears. Im still really sad that she had to die as i type this. And yes, i got to be honest, you gotta give this book time to sink in with all the revelations and all that.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great historical thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat from the start up until the very end.  The acting and the portrayal of the 1970's was spot on.  Don't miss this one.
1250038820|5.0|i loved the facebook page and when i saw a book was being published i pre ordered. all the things i loved about the page and more in the book. awesome to see and read about peopels stories!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|As a kid who grew up in the late 70's and 80's, I was always fascinated by and fearful of nuclear war. This book is a comprehensive history of that topic. Great read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challengeinfmg app but still able to figure out the puzzles. the multiple puzzles per floor are nice. it is a well crafted app.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Fantastic price. I was going to spend 10 on the remix of Vapor Trails, why not just buy all of these in one nice little package? No reason not to.<br /><br />The one downside of this boxed set as opposed to the sectors boxed sets are the relative lack of images from the original album art. Sectors added images, this just didn't include any of them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  The characters and story line were so intriguing, I had to find put what was going to happen next.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|keeps my kindle running smooth and fast.  totally recommend clean master. easy to use and download was simple. everyone should use it
B00DQT1EOI|5.0|Concise and worth the time spent! The overview is particularly useful as is the highlighting of the challenges and opportunities faced going forward.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Great Movie!!! Watched it 3 times! I don't usually like gore, but this was awesome! I think I will buy this one..
B00BD99JMW|4.0|*Vague spoilers*<br /><br />You may not like it, but the way the story ends actually fits with what we know about Tris as a character. Personally I think the ending was the best part, its where Ms. Roth presented her best writing of the book. I felt that the first 300 pages were a little choppy, but she found her old voice by the end. The story may not be happy, but it certainly felt right.<br />Tris shows us in the 2nd book how selfless she really can be, and the ending only makes sense with what we know about her. Once I read it, I was sort of disappointed in myself for not seeing it coming.<br /><br />But all-in-all kudos to Veronica Roth for telling the story she set out to tell, regardless of how many fangirls will protest.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is addictive, the intro was a bit cheesy, but after you start playing its tough to put down...Lol,
B00993I6D2|2.0|Just hasn't aged well after 30 years.  Read the book instead.  The tech in the film is laughable now and detracts from the message.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.<br /><br />And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.  And if you become a huge admirer and fan, then this 3-disc spectacular is going to be right down your alley.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.. Mikels, Esq.
0385743564|3.0|I am not sure what I think of Sanderson. I want to like him. I have started other books of his and not finished. This book, as with those books, has a great premise. I really thought I'd like it. Turns out, I did not.<br />The characters are wooden. The dialogue is almost amateurish.<br />The whole experience is just meh.<br />That's the only way to describe it.<br />Sanderson fans may like it, but people without an emotional tie to the author will probably struggle to finish.<br />The plot is actually kind of predictable (I saw the twist coming) and just didn't hold my attention.
0060730552|5.0|I have the Vintage edition from 1997, which I read around that time. I knew of someone at University who fell hundreds of feet off Ben Nevis and lived to tell the tale, so that may have prompted me to pick this up. I haven't re-read it since, but it must have had a great impact upon me at the time, as I wrote a song and sent it to Joe! He was kind enough to return a postcard (even though the song was terrible) which is now tucked in the inside cover of my copy. It's a short book which packs a lot of punch and reminds me of the sort of test of a human's extreme desire for survival that was embodied in Aaron Ralston's misadventure. I did read Storms of Silence subsequent to this, but it felt forced, but to be fair to Joe, how can you top this story?
B008JFUO72|5.0|We have the other two Iron Man DVD's, so of course we were waiting for Iron Man 3 to add to our collection.  This one seems a little more on the Sci-Fi side, at least to me, but it's very good.  Always action going on or &#34;the calm before the storm&#34; brewing.  At times you feel like the situation is hopeless, but Iron Man eventually always comes out on top.  The villain's are creepy looking and have amazing powers.  Seeing all of Tony Stark's &#34;suits&#34; coming to his aid at the end was awesome!  If you're an Iron Man fan, this is a must-have.
0385486804|4.0|I read this in San Diego in 1999. I was drawn to the story of McCandless probably more than the actual prose of Krakauer, although his subsequent book 'Into Thin Air' was a phenomenal book. In his obsession to remove himself from the clutter of modernity and return to a more 'basic' existence, McCandless reveals something hidden at the heart of all of us. This is something I've written about myself in 'Flight of the Tropicbird', something that was noticed by Nietzsche and Fromm and others many moons ago. It has something to do with the core of who we are and how we came to be: how our existence prior to modern civilisation was as a result of pure survival - living off the land, killing bears and boars and mammoths, running from advancing tribal enemies. Now we sit in bland offices with project deadlines staring in front of us, wondering why we feel as though something is missing. Well, something is missing, and people like McCandless followed that burning desire to find out what it was. We must thank Krakauer for bringing this story to light and thank McCandless for reminding us in some way of what we are all made of.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|The second season of Revenge is awesome!  So much going on in everyone;s lives at the same time!  I actually had to watch it twice in a row from start to finish to capture all the details!  Love it!  Revenge is not like the ordinary homicide series you see on TV.  It's a mind-crafted story of one girl's &#34;live to revenge&#34; life that sucks in everyone around her and seems as though it can go in any given direction at any given time.  My favorite character is Victoria Grayson.  She's an awesome actress who also starred in &#34;Last of the Mohicans&#34;.  You never know what's going to happen next!  Will definitely be awaiting the arrival of the Complete Third Season of Revenge next year.
0061673730|5.0|There's a few things you need to keep in mind when you read this book. Firstly, on a Stanford-Binet scale of human intelligence Pirsig ranks 25 points above the entry level for a genius. The second thing is that his life wasn't a closeted, academic existence - he did various jobs, including academic ones and travelled overseas in the course of work and study. The third thing to note is that he had a wife and two kids at the time of his psychological breakdown. In other words, by the time Pirsig published this book in his mid-forties, he had lived a rich life of experience. He understood and had experienced the tremendous highs of life and had intimate knowledge of its abyssal depths.<br /><br />Besides an academic and personal interest in philosophy, Pirsig also taught creative writing at Montana State University for a number of years. So, in short, you have a super-genius with an interest in philosophy and creative writing who, sometime after he suffered a nervous breakdown, decided to go on motorbike ride with his son and write about it. This journey then provided a platform from which Pirsig could reflect on his past, reflect on schools of philosophical thought and introduce his own big ideas. Forgive me for that simplification.<br /><br />I can see in the reviews here that this book tends to invoke two general responses. You either love it and think it's brilliant or you dismiss Pirsig as a self-serving egotist. If you read page 419 of this 25th anniversary edition of the book, you'll find that these are exactly the same types of responses the book invoked when it was first published: &#34;Critics applauded its complex structure and its ambitious scope, whilst others dismissed it as the lofty and self-absorbed ranting of a self-important rhetorician.&#34;<br /><br />I often wonder what the response would have been if Pirsig 'fictionalised' the whole book. In other words, if you thought that you were reading a work of complete fiction, yet it was actually true, then would that have dissolved any criticisms of Pirsig being a self-absorbed ranter? If the author is not the same person as the character in the book, then personal attacks based upon the statements of the character would not be linked to the author. You could only say the character was a self-absorbed ranter, but the book was still brilliant.<br /><br />Although Pirsig states himself in the afterword that there was no ulterior motive in writing the book, I suspect that he did have one dominant motivation - he wanted to write a great book. That's really  what I think he wanted to do - write a great piece of literature: one that hooked you in, made you stay up late at night just to get through one more page; one that entertained you; one that excited you and took you on an emotional journey; one that made you want to discuss its ideas with your friends; one that you would read again.<br /><br />That's where Pirsig really succeeded. He did write a great book. He managed to write a book that had universal appeal. You don't sell millions of copies of a book that doesn't appeal to a wide demographic.<br /><br />Whatever you say about the actual philosophy and the originality of Pirsig's Quality (Metaphysics of Quality - MoQ), which he always encourages readers to explore more of in the sequel, Lila, at least one philosophy PhD has been awarded for a dissertation in the MoQ from the University of Liverpool. I don't know whether that will encourage any more academic acceptance of his ideas, but the general opinion of the academic philosophy community to this book is dismissive. That's probably because Pirsig himself is dismissive of academic philosophers, yet he does hold three degrees including one in philosophy. We should probably reserve judgement on his ideas for at least a few hundred if not a thousand years to see if they stand the test of time.<br /><br />Then again, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, I get the impression that the philosophy is just a side-show. Even though Lila may be about it, ZAMM isn't. ZAMM's objective is just to be a great read and maybe we should only judge it on that criterion. So, is it a great read? You'd better believe it. 5 Stars.de-show. Even though Lila may be about it, ZAMM isn't. ZAMM's objective is just to be a great read and maybe we should only judge it on that criterion.

0743243153|5.0|A must read for everyone whether spiritual or not.  It provides an insight for getting to know God and even ourselves better. Could not believe that it was written so many years ago!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is am amazingly well worded story. Zusak's breaks the &#34;rules&#34; of English and wordsmiths his book to my delight. He made me laugh and cry.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Absolutely loved this show!!! I've watched up to season 4 and I am always so pleased by the new plot twists!!! Walter is an ever-changing enigma and Peter and Olivia never cease to entertain!!! Very well written.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good story lines with believable characters.  Missed the first/premier show on CBS and after hearing about the show from friends, streamed the show in sequence to understand the plot and characters.  Glad I did it that way.

B00C8S9VKM|4.0|An amazing historical year. Many things were never covered in history books indicating that we are not so different now as compared with 1927.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|I LOVED IT. Better than 3 People You Meet in Heaven. I couldn't put it down and it helped me become so absorbed I forgot my own troubles and daily distressed. I already do appreciate my wonderful family and this book reinforces that feeling. It keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself and that life is truly a gift.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Hilarious spoof on all things Trekkie. It's nothing ground breaking, but good for a laugh on a rainy Friday night.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game. It's lots of fun and some parts are really hard but when you finally get it, it's amazing.
B007V6S8PA|4.0|The power cable is not working  I have aproblem with this how can you help me can you explain for me
B000069AT7|5.0|I got such a great deal on my childhood classic, that came with 4 discs (Original Version, 2002 remastered version--looks amazing, 2 Bonus Feature DVD), film senitype, making of the film book, certificate and great collectors edition box. I get to share the entire set with my daughter who now counts this as one of her favorite movies. The package arrived quickly, in excellent condition. I would absolutely buy again from this seller.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I Will honestly say I like this app because it works great on my kindle fire it is easy to understand and you can check how much time you have on your battery for what you want to do at the time you can tell how much time you can do different things on wifi to listening to music to playing a game or just reading a book this app lets you know
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found the book to be interesting and very moving.  The characters were real to me throughout the book.  It brought the awful story of Germany's role in WW II, and how ordinary people reached beyond themselves to help the helpless.  It also protrayed the misery of those ordinary people during the war, whether deserved or not.  War doesn't pick and choose who is rightous.  Everyone suffers.
0739324489|4.0|Alone had an exciting and tense beginning, it slowed down some for a while.  But all in all it was very entertaining especially the twist at the end.  I listen to many, many audio cd's while working and thought I had the mystery solved twice but was right on some points but off on a couple clues.  Love a good mystery with a twist.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I was completely surprised and delighted by this disc.  It was released 6 years ago and I hadn't heard any of these songs till now.  Love her voice and style.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I Love this book only review is i believe the book would be more appropriately namrd footnotes as it is the theme of the book :)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Charger was nice , however it did not solve the issue with the kindle fire . That has a poor design for the charger so making contact is not easy . We have two and they both have the same issue.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I love RHPS. This is one of the best musicals I have ever seen. This Blu-ray release has great picture quality and the sound is stunning, crisp, and exactly how I expected it to sound.<br /><br />This 35th anniversary edition is packed to the brim with special features and they are all great to watch.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it in a while or this is your favorite movie I suggest you get this. You have not seen Rocky Horror until you have seen it in HD.
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|I love the \\"Fast and Furious\\" movies. Action, action and more action!<br /><br />I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B009CGA29M The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift [HD]]] but was thrilled to have Diesel and Walker back in movie #4 of the franchise.<br /><br />I was glad to see American muscle in this one, especially a Mopar. The gas tanker scenes were great and the tunnel scenes were outrageous.<br /><br />These movies are definitely among my favorite action films.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A lesson for us all,to live a better life,care about our fellow man and do good for as many as possible.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Another marvel by Bill Bryson.  This is among his very best.  He weaves the tale of Babe Ruth and Charles Lindbergh together with the background stories of the time including Sacco and Vanzetti.  A clear home run for Bryson.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Makes me sleep happy, a very usefull item. Me and my wife love it, we use it all the time.

B003M5AXN4|5.0|I love this movie, It was a great movie to watch with the kids, and it looks fabulous on bluray.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to Candy Crush Saga.  I play it on my phone and now on my Kindle!  Couldn't be happier!!!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I love most of Bowie's albums, especially his latest, The Next Day. But when I first heard this album in 1980, it struck me as the best album ever. The prescient lyrics, Robert Fripp's guitar, the lyrics, the sound. To me, it signaled an end to an era--I love Heroes, Low and Lodger--but this brought the potential of those albums to fruition.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. it is a page flipping book that took me two days to read. I wouldn't recommend to children but to like teenagers and that stuff. I hope you read the book and enjoy it like I did.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|Faked reviews ... Wish I never wasted the time in downloading this thing. Started the download but then really looking at the reviews and it appears like the maker of this thing trying to pump up the rating which a bunch of fake reviews. Booo! Bad Reliance Games! Boo!!
0307949486|5.0|I loved this book. I may be biased since I'm not the harshest critic when it comes to new books, but I can truly say I wanted to stay up all night to finish this book. It's packed with scandalous stories, shocking reveals and twists that you'd never expect. The characters had substance to them, not your normal characters but that's what made them so interesting. There wasn't a moment I could say I was bored with the book even though it's quite thick. It is an easy read from the standpoint of a sophomore in high school, but the only part that was a little difficult to understand were the moments with a lot of business language. It's amazingly written, as it keeps you wanting to read more constantly, but I wouldn't call this story the most cheerful and happy book so be ready and prepared for some tough topics.<br /><br />I definitely would recommend this to any friend who's in high school and older or anyone that's ready to deal with more mature topics. This book is worth every penny in my opinion. If you're looking for a captivating book to read in your free time, this is definitely the book for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Keeps you playing. Got this app with high hopes after the first game  much better graphics and giant monkey monster is a good edition too.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Amazing....scared the %@# outta me<br /><br />Worth every penny you pay to watch....I was yelling at the TV and jumping out of my skin!!!
B008ALAHA4|3.0|I've always known that Amazon had some odd positions on things, but this takes the cake.  They practically insist that I write a review on a product that has been sitting in my \\"Wish List\\" for several months.  I decided I no longer have a need for this item (and a few others as well) and periodically go thru and delete those I know I won't be needing.  However, this is one of those times that I simply didn't know enough about the product when I added it to my list and now I know it will never work for my purposes.  I suppose I could just leave this item on my wish list for the rest of eternity, but why?  And since Amazon also insists that I rate EVERY product with stars...I'm not all that sure if I should give it 1 or 5...so for what it's worth, I'll give it 3 stars...because when the reviewers at Amazon read this ridiculous review (that they insisted on), they might realize that there web designers need to make a couple changes and fix it so that when this sort of thing happens in the future...they won't have egg all over their faces!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does very little, but does it very well!<br /><br />If you want netflix on a TV without using other devices this is it! Will also mirror a web browser for presentations.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Movies is dhe bomb. Ryan Gosling be so hot.<br /><br />Drive reminds me a lot of Steve Mcqueen movies or something that came out of the 70's action films.
0312430000|5.0|This is a very profound book.  His thesis is very simple but as with many things in life, simplicity is the key.  There is absolutely no question that people and businesses make things way too complex in day-to-day actions and that by breaking down things to a checklist, it allows people to be more efficient and make less mistakes.<br /><br />After reading this book, I incorporated the principles into my personal injury law firm and have seen immediate results.  Keep things simple - and use a checklist.  It works.  Bravo to Dr. Gawande - great insight.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Love letter to japanese films. If you like Godzilla or Older Anime this is a must own. Gundam, Robotech take note.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Pretty entertaining. Good time waster. It's exciting when you best the harder levels....'......you have to think about what you should level up and when.
B00124LYHQ|4.0|Classic movie that everyone should see. Marlon Brando is excellent and nice to look at. Amazon rentals are the best.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Finally READ to see what all the hype was about. Still don't know........ not great VERY abrupt end ing. Not worth reading further into trilogy. Two stars
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|I was disappointed in this cd for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I love Blues. Joe Bonamassa, some Beth Hart, etc. This is not Blues.<br />2. I would put this cd under popular country. That is what it sounds like to me.<br />3. For a country singer she does have a good voice, but country music is not my cup of tea.<br />4. Somewhere it was mentioned that it had a 'rock like' style to it. I guess I missed that song.<br />5. So if you are looking for a new Blues/Rock artist, pass on this CD!
B00E8AVNBI|4.0|Throughout cinema history, the Horror Western is a rare commodity and with the decline of the Western genre these past few decades, it is almost non existent.  It is refreshing to see this slick, stylish return to the genre in Director Roel Reine's 'DEAD IN TOMBSTONE'-2011 highlighting crater faced cult actor Danny Trejo with non stop shoot em up action.  Double crossed by his brother played by slimy Anthony Michael Hall and plugged with enough rounds to sink Afghanistan, Trejo is sent to hell where we have Mickey Rourke giving an eerie performance as Lucifer himself.  Striking a bargain for his soul, Trejo is sent back to the land of the living for only 24 hours to deliver the souls of his brother and five gang members in exchange for his life.  The over 100 minute running time is dedicated to that plot as Director Reine stylishly piles on images of every conceivable genre cliche and it works.  Director Reine known basically for the last two sequels of the 'DEATH RACE' franchise is honing his craft brilliantly and gets great perfs from all including television actress Dina Meyer as a fetching gunslinger who aids Trejo.  The bullets fly, the slow mo cams upset the stomach, and rat a tat editing stuns the cranium as the revenge motif reaches for the climax which may or may not spawn a sequel.  I viewed the unrated Blu-Ray disc which is in stunning 1080P 1.85 widescreen with great DTS MasterAudio to rattle the subwoofer.  The disc has a fistful of extras including featurettes on the making of the film ; a 10 minute stint on the director Roel Reine; deleted scenes and a deleted scene montage and feature commentary to name but a few.  Highly recommended to action enthusiasts and Western fans (the film has hommages to Italian Horror films and Spaghetti Westerns) and a rockin music score by Hybrid, it makes for a great purchase and I can hardly wait for the sequel.  Director Reine is someone to watch in the action genre.
B00C1S945G|5.0|If you are a Star Trek fan this is must see. Though a few episodes are lackluster, the season as a whole is well worth it. Some cover back story of characters that i found most entertaining. Brought back many memories of watching it on tv.
B008JFUR10|4.0|If you are watching this movie for a story line or for character development don't bother. This movie is good because of the visual bonanza that it gives you. It is an awesome treat for your eyes, with a bit of story sprinkled in for good measure. Had the story been better I would give it 5 stars but for what it is worth, this movie is awesome.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Lots of fun, great acting,  a little sad, but all in all, it was a highly enjoyable movie for a Saturday night.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story. Enjoyed characters twist and turns by author. Emotional and Intriguing story did not want to put this book down.
B00CT6EJEG|5.0|I didn't appreciate this film when it was first released.  It took a few viewings to get into just how fantastic it really is.  The blu-ray looks fantastic and the sound is great.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Words can not describe this book. The pride, fear, honor you get by reading this book is so unreal. What our Military goes through... I just want to say THANK~YOU. I stand by each AMERICAN soldier.
B00CTT9646|3.0|I love this movie and it looks great.  This blu-ray set is a waste.  It needs more extras.  The phaser was soft on detail and wasn't put together properly.  The pieces on the phaser did not line up properly.  For something made from a CGI master, I'm going to call them out on.  QMX's quality control is terrible.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is lots of fun with many different types of challenges. It is addictive and you can advance at a nice pace. It is free and not being asked to spend money to play other levels. Give it a try and see if you agree. Have fun.
B0089BSM70|4.0|The transfer on this is pretty good.  I believe that it could still be better.  I don't think it has held up well over the years but it is still the best of the sequels.  This is still a fantastic set though.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a whimsical tale that has humor for both adults and young children. And what's not to love about those minions!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Best game EVER!!!!!  A must have for any gamer!!!! I'm totally in to this game, but now having a very difficult time up in the 70's level!!! Need lives peeps!!!! Very addicting!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the better books I've read. Began the books with my teenager . Finished them due to work after her. Great reads and fast ending the story itself makes u want more at the end. Not the end itself.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My granddaughter really likes this. She said it was a lot of fun to play. My husband also likes it.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Surprisingly awful, disjointed effort from 2 Oscar winners. Good cg obviously can't fix everything. Do not like. Do not buy.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|The reason I am giving it 4 stars really is because I completely feel that this purchase is unnecessary as an accessory when you pay more than $1000 for macbook air.  I totally understand the point that Apple is trying to push the behavior for next generation (wi-fi only) however we are not quite there yet as not all devices or software can be installed wirelessly.  When we get to that point, I agree that providing a LAN jack may become unnecessary like CD slots these days or that the accessory can become redundant ... just my opinion.  Other than that, I have no complaints in terms of quality or functionality of this adaptor.
886613564X|2.0|This is not what I thought I ordered.  It is much too bulky to carry around and not big enough to write a journal or a diary on every page!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app has great features and even better picture talking capabilities, I would recommend it to all. A few glitches at first but it corrected itself
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Interestingly, like in many other field, we should unlearn what we know to learn how it is properly done.<br />Things in life are simple. It is us and society that make them complex.
0385344228|1.0|I am compelled to write a revew in order to counter balance the multi-star ratings.  I was sucked in by the description and all the great reviews.  When will I learn?  Poor plot developement, people referring to things that weren't brought up at the time(where was the editor?), unlikeable characters, a grandfather in prison with a 1 dimensional personality straight out of an old gangster movie, an ending that is pretty obvious about 1/2 way through, and worse of all (to me), no conclusion/explanation/resolution.  Mysteries are the one genre I do expect a tidy conclusion  explaining to the reader what happened and how.  And the scene with the cat being killed some where?  It felt so artificial and unrealistic.  What was the point?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game so far I've now started playing and its a lot of fun if you know how to play temple run or angry gran you should have no problems
075669812X|5.0|My son is a big Ninjago fan. We borrowed this book from the library several times, and I was pleased to find that it was priced well on Amazon, so we decided to purchase it. My son carried the book around for over a month. He spent hours looking through it and reading. It is a complete reference of all Ninjago characters, and there were so many I hadn't heard of.  The format of the book is text with many photos, so it keeps my child's attention. Great book!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is an excellent book by John Grisham.  As I read it I was brought back to the &#34; A Time To Kill&#34; story.  I liked all the characters and how Mr. Hubbard's will making everything exciting.  This was a good read and hard to put down once you started.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors. I could not put this book down and look forward to when I will be listening to it as an audio book.

B000WTLDPU|4.0|I've read 2 divergent reviews of this fantasy tale and one is unfavorable on the HD DVD version while the Blu-ray one is favorable.  Nevertheless in either version this film is a delight and I don't expect to double dip and get the Blu-ray version which is considerable more at $20 compared to the $6 I paid for the HD DVD version.  If anyone has the Blu-ray version of this and say it's better in terms of audio and video quality--I'd like to see a response.  Also Michelle Pfeiffer still looks gorgeous in her 40's or 50's.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Just not quite as good as his best. Enjoyed it and will endorse it very much and with out reservations.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|You get emotionally attached from the beginning. A book full of detail, showcasing heartwarming moments, courage, despair, but mostly hope. I loved it.
1476733953|5.0|I literally could not put this book down from first page to last! Howey is a master story teller. The characters are compelling and the story had me on the edge of my seat. Highly recommended.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|The dedication from one of the authors sets the tone for the book (I\\"m not going to give it away, but it made me laugh out loud).<br /><br />What I liked about this book is that it gave me new ideas for how remote working could function well from a number of perspectives:<br />- as an employee<br />- as an employer<br />- in a client/agency role<br /><br />I thought it was a good balance of the why and the how, and appreciated that it also talked about some of the downsides.<br /><br />This book helped me see why remote working didn't work in some of the environments I've worked in, and is helping me figure out how I can make it work in my current situation where I have clients in other cities that would like to work with me.<br /><br />The most practical part of this book for me were the chapters on \\"How to Collaborate Remotely\\", \\"Hiring and Keeping the Best\\" and \\"Managing Remote Workers\\". I like the idea of the virtual watercooler and the Campfire rooms for different topics.<br /><br />The illustrations were cool, too.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This remaster is a revelation!  The sound is much more open and natural.  The original release was compressed to death and muddy, but this remaster reveals the real music and it is a VERY welcome upgrade.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend a double-dip purchase on this, as you really are getting a completely different record.  Sure, the songs are the same, and the performances are the same, but the sound is completely different and GREATLY improved.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|The rating is for the movie.<br />As a lifelong Trekkie (Before they started calling themselves, &#34;trekkers&#34;, dammit) I have been though all iterations, sequels, spin-offs, etc.<br />This was the Trek I was waiting for. Action packed, slightly humorous, brightly colored, darkly themed at times and a stellar cast.<br />In particular Anton Yelchin as Chekov. His line deliveries are unique and honest and as real as can be.<br />But, that shouldn't take away from the rest of the cast, who are extraordinary.<br />And yes, I like the lens flares.<br />The rating is also for the cost. $5?<br />That's just crazy. Thanks, Amazon.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|When the previews of the new Superman movie made its rounds on the internet, I was excited to see a new modern, more serious take on the Man of Steel. While the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeve was fun, iconic and kept with the true spirit of the Simon and Schuster comic book classic, it was a bit on the light side and a bit too humorous. When it was announced that Zack Synder was directing this new interpretation of the Son from Krypton, my expectations were unexpectedly high. Both Watchmen and 300 were brilliant comic book based movies. Unfortunately, Man of Steel, was not.<br /><br />Despite having some very interesting and creative scenes of Krypton with Russell Crowe and some very touching scenes with Kevin Costner and young Clark Kent, there was a definite disconnect with the plot due to large gaps in sequencing. The movie felt choppy and uneven in trying to teeter back and forth between present day and past scenes of Clark Kent.  It seemed Synder was more concerned about creating atmosphere instead of adequately telling a story. Worst of all, there were absolute lapses of logic. The first meeting and subsequent meetings between Clark and Lois Lane felt hallow, unconvincing and most of all, lacking of any chemistry whatsoever. You felt absolutely nothing between this new take of Superman and Lois while in contrast, the 1978 version of Clark and Lois felt genuine and magical. In the final battle between Zod and Superman, Superman tosses Zod through building after building, causing 9-11 level destruction as buildings collapse in the middle of Metropolis, resulting in thousands of innocent deaths, and yet, all he cares about is saving Lois? And in the end of the movie, people are supposed to honor and respect as a hero after all the death and destruction his presence has caused??? One pivotal scene at the end of the movie (without revealing a spoiler) is so uncharacteristic of Superman, that it's literally inexcusable and unforgivable for us that grewup reading Superman.  By emulating Christopher Nolan in reworking the superhero mythos, Synder has given us a sad, moody and emo Superman. While this may work for Batman, that's not Superman. For that reason, this movie fails to revitalize the myth to modern sensibilities. It lacks the charm, the chemistry and the solid storytelling that the 1978 original brought.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Are you old enough to remember classic video games like Q-Bert and Donkey Kong? Remember playing them in the arcade?<br />Okay, so, like me, you are old.<br />Wreck it Ralph is a clever adventure inside the world of videogames, where the inhabitants are sentient and have rules for survival.<br />Except Ralph hates being a villain. It's no fun. Everyone else has fun.<br />So, he leaves to find a way to become a hero. And all hell breaks loose.<br />Most of this movie takes place in King Candy's video game of candy designed race cars. And that's brilliant because it combines princess pink candy sweetness with lightning fast racing. Something for the boys AND the girls.<br />Alan Tudyk's take on King Candy, using Ed Wynn as a guidevoice is spot on. John C. Reilly will break your heart.<br />But, the real revelation here is Sarah Silverman. She is fantastic.<br />Shoot. I'm gonna stop typing and go watch it again.<br />Excellent.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book made my heart stop beating for a few seconds. I can't believe it. My mom thought I was insane for crying over a book!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I really wish there was an option for a half star. Because this record is really a 3.5 star album.<br />The hits, Radioactive, Demons, It's Time, etc, are great. And they make the album worth it. The non hits aren't &#34;bad&#34;, nor are they filler. Thye just don't measure up to the great ones.<br />That said, it's infectious, catchy and every song is different.<br />Imagine Dragons (Terrible band name) don't confine themselves to one genre. That means there are surprises throughout.<br />Give the samples a try. If you like it, buy it. It's worth it.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is about keeping traditions going. It's about expecting and getting what you've dreamed about all year long. Oh sure, it's got the usual obnoxious relatives visiting for the holidays and all the antics that come with them. And, let's face it, you'll still laugh at the jokes and the sight gags and maybe see yourself in some of them too!  It's one of my favorite holiday movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent story line, excellent cast and excellent writing/directing. If you watch one episode, you are hooked on this very good show. If  you haven't watched it, start with season one episode one.

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I think this game is ok but there is a little bit of energy and it goes down so fast the hunts are so short and each hunt takes one or two energy.Otherwise.good stuff. I don't really recommend it if you are not good at waiting an 1:50 minutes for your energy to load.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|My husband and I rented this movie on movie night with my teenaged little brothers. It's a great movie, and I would recommend it; however, I wish there was a little more story. G.I.

I am glad I made an exception in this case.

I've read a lot of the \\"critical\\" reviews of it and sure this movie has some weaknesses where you wish it would have went in a different direction but it is what it is and it's an awesome, classic, Sci-Fi flick!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Since I played a similar game in my cell phone, I have enjoyed the challenge. However I am disappointed that I cannot progress beyond level 35 without making a purchase. I know it's only $0.99, but I should be able to enjoy the game using my skills. Shouldn't 360,000 plus point's account for something? Additional instructions would be helpful.
0553593714|5.0|An excellent read even though I'd already watched the show. There was so much more in the book and it kept me very interested. I love how deep the characters are, even more complex than you get in the show. It's pretty long, but I think I read it in about a week.

B00BVYJG18|4.0|The list of bands who have been able to successfully pull off the old switcheroo with singers is a short list. Even shorter is the list of those who have returned to the original singer after a decade or so of success without them. When Killswitch Engage found themselves once again singer-less in 2011, it was only natural that their original vocalist, Jesse Leach would return. Replacing his replacement in Howard Jones, Leach has a hefty task on his hands. Not only is he finding his way back into a band he left over a decade ago, he is also trying to carry the torch lit by his successor (predecessor?). Afterall, the band found their biggest successes after Leach left, so it's safe to say that the odds were stacked against him. Thankfully, \\"Disarm The Descent,\\" mostly lives up to the promise of 2002's landmark effort \\"Alive Or Just Breathing\\" while carrying over the more commercial elements of the band's most well-known works.<br /><br />Sounds Like: Killswitch are alive and more than just breathing.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Jesse is back! And not only that, he sounds phenomenal. That guttural, rough-around-the-edges delivery you remember from the band's birth is still alive and kicking, though slightly refined. Howard is a rather large voice to replace and Jesse is equally up to the task of pulling off the clean vocals as well.<br /><br />- The production by guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz gets the band back on track after the murky sound of the Brendan O'Brien produced 2009 self-titled effort, highlighting each guitar-lick and bass-kick equally.<br /><br />- The album is lean, mean and no frills. There really isn't a track that feels extraneous. This one flows perfectly from front to back, which the band hasn't quite pulled off since \\"Alive Or Just Breathing.\\"<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Though Jesse does a good job of delivering some good, old-fashioned Killswitch-brand melodic metal, there isn't much exploration beyond what the band has already accomplished. I guess you can only push this sound so far?<br /><br />- Even though it flows so nicely, the album feels a bit brief. It feels like there is at least one massive, epic song missing. Even the last effort had the brooding \\"The Return.\\" Gimme some of that goodness, guys!<br /><br />Hits:<br /><br />- \\"The Hell In Me\\" opens the album with a substantial and appropriate bang. This track just defiantly screams \\"We are Killswitch Engage, we are back and we mean business!\\"<br /><br />- \\"Beyond The Flames\\" is one of the speediest and catchiest of the batch. This is the \\"must hear\\" track of the album. Classic Killswitch.<br /><br />- \\"Always\\" and \\"In Due Time\\" being the album's most accessible tunes are also the perfect marriage of the Jesse-era and the Howard-era. They really hit the sweet spot here.<br /><br />Misses:<br /><br />- \\"Tribute To The Fallen\\" and \\"You Don't Bleed For Me\\" are a bit repetitive, but really don't drag the album down too much.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: You haven't listened to Killswitch Engage in a long time and need a reminder of just how awesome they were (and still are).<br /><br />Personally: Though I liked their 2009 self-titled just fine, it was pretty formulaic and didn't bode well for the future. By that point, the writing was on the wall with Howard and it seemed something had to change. The band kept on good terms with Leach all along and the ensuing homecoming is glorious. I dig \\"Alive Or Just Breathing\\" just as much as \\"The End Of Heartache\\" and this strikes the perfect balance between the two worlds.<br /><br />The Bottom Line(s): It's Killswitch Engage. They blend hardcore with classic metal better than anybody. Jesse is a powerhouse and a genuinely gifted performer. You owe it to yourself to give the band another chance, even if they may have lost you a bit in the late '00s.d.

B00DQBWLSO|4.0|I'm a huge John Mayer fan, and own all his CDs. Like many of his fans, I think Continuum is by far his best CD and it's still in regular rotation on my playlists; it's my favorite CD of all time. However, I appreciate that John continues to evolve as an artist, and appreciate that he can delve into any genre while still keeping his signature sound. Paradise Valley is a great album to just put on and listen to the whole thing. While I don't think there are a bunch of &#34;singles&#34; on this record, I really enjoyed listening to the intricate work he put into each track, with his guitar work of course but often layering in piano, vocals, etc. That's where, for me, Paradise Valley (and Born and Raised) really resonated, and I can't think of any other artist today who musically is at the level John Mayer is. While I'd love it if he decides to write a Continuum Part II, I'm not at all disappointed.<br /><br />Best tracks for me: Wildfire, Dear Marie, Waitin' On The Day, I Will Be Found
B000AP04L0|5.0|Even though I didn't think this was the best movie I'd ever seen, there were no glitches in the DVD and the package was clean so that's worth the five stars.  I hadn't seen this movie before and bought it on the recommendation of someone I work with.  It's light and cute and defnitely a means of venting (through laughter) when you recognize a character as someone you actually work with.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I rarely rate apps but Magic is a fantastic app. For those of us who secretly played Magic years ago when we were kids, this is a great way to secretly get back into the game. I played Magic back when it was in the 3rd edition so there are a ridiculous amount of new rules now and I didn't recognize any of the cards. But the core gameplay was still there so I jumped right back in without any problems.<br /><br />From the perspective of a casual gamer, this app is perfect. The $9.99 I think is very reasonable for the amount of gameplay you get.  I don't have time to customize my deck or buy booster packs, but the pre-made decks have a lot of variety in terms of style and strategy that I think most players can identify with one of the decks.  I didn't try any multiplayer games but for a single player it was challenging enough and kept me up a few nights so I could play an extra game.<br /><br />Problems with the app:<br />- takes up 3GB of space (1.5gb to install + 1.5gb downloading data after the install)<br />- After installing, I had to leave the app open and keep tapping the screen until it downloaded all the extra content<br />- the battle animations are a little slow<br />- Overall I wish they cut down a little on the fancy animations and effects to trim down the file size and make the game faster. For example I play Ascension, and I have a great time with Ascension on the iPad but it's like only 100MB instead of 3GB.

0316219266|4.0|On November 1st, 1994, Jeff Bezos walked into the garage of his home to inform his colleagues of the new company name. The current name, Cadabra, was currently being used, until Jeff stumbled upon the word 'Amazon' in the dictionary. He said \\"This is not only the largest river in the world, it's many times larger than the next biggest river. It blows all other rivers away.\\" The name was a good self-fulfilling prophecy. Amazon has blown all other internet retailers away.<br /><br />In July 1996, Amazon.com launched, and since then, has become a retail juggernaut. In 17 years, Amazon has gone from 0 to $60 billion in revenue. It's ambitions grow by the year, and Jeff Bezos has mentioned turning it into a $200 billion dollar per year firm. In the last few years, several long standing retailers have fallen over (Circuit City, Borders, etc) and people look to Amazon as the assassin.<br /><br />Brad Stone details Amazon's rise and culture, which previously has been kept under a cloak of secrecy. Although Jeff Bezos argued the company was a bit young to write about, Stone was the best equipped to write it. He had inside access to Bezos, his family, and conducted hundreds of interviews.<br /><br />The Amazon culture Stone divulges is hard to digest. Amazon pays average wages, drives its employees hard, and negotiates steep deals with all parties it does business with. For Amazon though, all of this is necessary to deliver the best prices to the consumers it obsesses about. It wants to have Wal-Mart prices AND Nordstrom service. When Amazon decides to foray into another business, they aren't the least hesitant to take steep losses to acquire market share. Their internal practices seem to border anti-trust, and make giants like Wal-Mart shiver.<br /><br />What will Amazon foray into next? Stone has some predictions. Prime members will have next-day and same-day delivery. Amazon will roll out its grocery service, Amazon Fresh, to other cities. And Amazon will introduce a mobile phone or internet connected television set-top box. Whatever they do, Amazon seems like they will evolve into their destiny: be many times larger than all the other rivers.e phone or internet connected television set-top box.

1608871827|5.0|Guillermo del Toro's blockbuster monster-vs-mecha film \\"Pacific Rim\\" was, in my personal and unprofessional opinion, the best movie of 2013.  It caught my attention in a way few movies ever have, and sported amazing special effects, thrilling action sequences, jaw-dropping visuals, and a surprising amount of heart and decent characterization.  The plot was a little thin, but I believe most movie-goers were too caught up in the world and visuals to care much on that front.  It was, to me, a spectacular film that balanced out eye-candy visuals with attention to story and characters, and it made me want to learn more about the world of the movie and how it was constructed.  So I ordered the art book... and promptly had to wait a month for it.  (My best guess is that the publisher underestimated demand for the book, and I had to wait for another printing to get my hands on a copy.)<br /><br />This book was totally worth the wait, however.  Not only is it an informative, in-depth look at how the film was made, but it offers crucial background information on the characters, technology, monsters, and world of the film.  And the extras help sweeten the deal.<br /><br />The book starts off with a thoughtful foreword by del Toro himself, talking about his love for the movie and his desire to share it with the world.  From there, we learn more about how the movie took shape, and how del Toro signed onto the project after leaving \\"The Hobbit\\" and having his adaptation of \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" cancelled.  The film contains storyboards, concept sketches and designs, production photos, and movie stills showing how the film took shape, how the actors and set and costume designers and special effects teams collaborated to bring the film together, and how much attention was given to even seemingly insignificant details in the film.  And for those interested in the characters themselves, every major human character, Jaeger, and Kaiju is given some background, including \\"tech specs\\" and some insight from del Toro, the actors, and the designers on how they were developed and what their stories beyond the film are.  It's a fascinating look at how much thought and effort went into the world, taking what could have been a slapdash summer \\"popcorn movie\\" and turning it into something with weight and texture.<br /><br />The aforementioned extras I spoke of are detachable cards, posters, and sticker sheets that adhere to some of the pages of the book.  There are bio cards for Raleigh and Mako, a sheet of stickers with symbols of the various Jaeger teams and Kaiju \\"kill records,\\" Kaiju War propaganda posters, and even reproductions of sketches and notes from del Toro's own notebook.  The reader needs to be careful removing these from the book so as not to damage the pages, but I was able to get them out without damaging the book or leaving behind residue.  And they are fun little extras to have.<br /><br />If I have any nitpicks with the book, it's that there are a few factual goofs in the \\"tech specs.\\"  For example, Cherno Alpha is listed as a Mark-4 Jaeger, when other information lists it as a Mark-1, much older than the book's tech specs state.  But these are fairly minor, in my opinion.<br /><br />Stories of how films are made, from the conceptual stages to filming to special effects to everything else, always fascinate me, and doubly so when it's a movie I love.  If you're a fan of \\"Pacific Rim,\\" or simply enjoy learning how a film is made -- especially a film made with loving attention to detail and story -- then this book is a must-own.  It's gorgeous, informative, and high-quality, and will be quite the conversation piece sitting on your coffee table.pecs\\" and some insight from del Toro, the actors, and the designers on how they were developed and what their stories beyond the film are.

B002APU580|2.0|Have never felt even remotely inclined to write a review of a movie, until this one. Took me a couple of years to even consent to view this movie, felt it came out with too much saturation of Keira Knightly everywhere. And knowing the tendency for the big screen to hack up great books and slim down carefully written characters to a manageable 'just over two hours' production. Well, finally decided to give it a chance, and have rarely cringed more than in watching this version of Pride & Prejudice perhaps writing this alone will help someone else.<br />While being a fan of Austen's, I would hardly call myself an Austenite, but after seeing so many liberties taken with her dialog, perhaps I am. Austen was rather wordy, but to chop it up and modernize it was condescending to the reader/viewer. Elizabeth's character came off a snotty and headstrong, instead of self-assured and quick witted. Jane was empty instead of kind to a fault, and Charles Bingley, although interestingly cast, was a bit of a fool instead of endlessly kind.<br />The book and my imagination are very closely seconded to A&E BBC version of this film with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. This version isn't anywhere near the running.<br />I find it necessary to point out how bad or ridiculous every-bodies hair was, everyone looked as if the just tumbled of bed, or the more senior ladies were over teased so as to look like England's version of New Jersey, not a good look for Dame Judi Dench.<br />The casting was a who's who of England's talent, with the odd exception to Donald Sutherland, who did well enough for a horrible screenplay. Carey Mulligan, a fine actress, was reduced to either crying, laughing too loud, chewing, or the odd exclamation, not her fault, again a horrible screenplay. Judi Dench was so obvious a choice and so over exhibited in this production she could have just sneered as Lady Catherine and saved uttering her few badly chosen lines. Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas was made overly plain, add her character reduced to an an embarrassment as Elizabeth's much loved friend. Kelly Reilly did a great job making Miss Bingley hate-able with her few scenes and fewer lines that were as empty and mean as her poor part was limited to, Miss Bingley was as most of Austen's characters, much more complex, more cunning and conniving, and even admirable in their witty snobbery; Kelly Reilly is such an excellent actress she could have made that happen, but the writing. Matthew MacFadyen appears to have been severely limited too. He must have been instructed to smile far less than even Colin Firth would, and instructed to execute the lines as severely as you can while not moving a single facial muscle, except during the scene in the rain when he seems so intent on kissing Miss Elizabeth that he may even bite her. Oh cringe!<br />Keira Knightly was made so plain, and her lines so devoid of a rich character that Elizabeth Bennet could and should have been. I hardly even liked her as the well beloved Elizabeth. I found myself wondering just which line she would say how, instead of feeling one way or another for her, a bit like watching a tennis match instead of a celebrated love story. He character in those Pirate movies was more deep.<br />In all the movie appears to have been done by casting inexperienced with English talent. It comes off as if someone was given a limitless credit card and told to go shopping for fine things in a well appointed department store, and having never been in one before, gets off the plane in London, hops in a cab, asks the cabbie who his favourite English actors are and sets out to secure them like ridiculous ornaments that they are unaccustomed to. I hope this fine list of talent was paid well for such an overdone empty production.<br />The cinematography appeared amateurish, with wide shots done so long that their length eclipsed the most rushed proposal scene. Poor Matthew MacFadyen had to utter his proposal like the techno-babble ofa Dr Who episode; so the audience could view Keira Knightly's skirts billowing in the wind on the peaks at length.<br />Chatsworth is and always will be more beloved as the previous choice for Pemberly (and for it's own merits as one of the finest houses in England, it is NOT the only one however), where it was coyly displayed in a lovely beguiling manor; instead put on display much like poor Judi Dench was. The angles were obvious and over the top, and looked more like a tacky tourist leaflet, instead of subtle showcasing of a grand, well known estate. That display and the final scene of the newly married Darcys overlooking the great estate, made it and them look cheap.<br />The manners and customs of that deliberate era, were replaced by the theme of barging into rooms and constant eavesdropping.<br />The division of rank and money was showcased as usual, and it was cringe-worthy for the Regency Era or any era, where money and intelligence are often mistaken as interchangeable, so kudos for hitting that altogether obvious mark, however Austen subtly rectified this in her book, this film left that issue hanging like bad drapes.<br />The music was lovely, the costumes were good, and the diverse dancing was well represented.<br />I give this 2 stars for the sake of the cast, each of them has such a fine record of their own, with even their TV dramas far superior to this flimsy production. IMDB some of these actors, study the body of their works overseas, watch some of the things that are being put out in UK and you'll too see the emptiness of this work for such a rich cast of fine actors, and even Donald Sutherland.<br />I will never watch this again. And do hope another production tries to come along and eclipse this mess.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a very good read and I didn't want to put it down.  It is filled with plot twists and turns.  Very entertaining!
B005K17RU0|5.0|See above, I use this app daily and as such relay on it daily. I have tried the .Weather channel as an alternative however I always come back
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game. Lots of fun must look at every object in each room and try things you think would. not work .
B0047SIXGE|4.0|Very good movie, full of symbolism as Sheen's character travels deeper and deeper up the river and into world of insanity where only the insane are the truly sane.  Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It'll leave you wanting more and at the edge of your seat. It's a book you won't want to put down. I can't wait for the movie and see how well they bring it to life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the best work of fiction that I have read in a very long time. The characters were well defined and the storyline was great. Loved the Epilogue!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Wish there was more levels. Ten isn't enough! Rooms are really neat. Fun checking out all the nooks and crannies of the graphics.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is going to be one of my long-term favorites. It has great humor and the female leads are a refreshing change from the usual male-dominated movies.
B000026OW3|5.0|Artur Rubinstein was a wonderful pianist and was of Polish nationality.This was probably why he was such an absolutely<br />marvellous interpreter of the music of Chopin's music;with the exception of the waltzes,which no one played better than<br />Dinu Lapati except, perhaps' Chopin himself.<br /><br /> The collection is worth every penny and although I have the complete works of Chopin on LP and CD's this collection<br />is marvellous.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is easy to set up and works well through the phone. I am hoping that more applications become 'streamable' through this device to make it even better.
B00FA20GWA|5.0|The movie got here within the expected timeframe, the case and dvd were new and I loved the movie. I saw it in theaters but I had to own it bc it was so good. Definitely enjoyed the suspenseful dinner date night!
B008JEJLVS|4.0|They are a touch bigger than the last pair of size 11 I bought....but still fit and are very comfy.
B00C1BHQXK|3.0|I found the work to be a good tool to drill down into the nuts and bolts of the &#34;why?&#34; of my life.  Defining and refining purpose and clarity were two huge issues that emerged out of the book.  I found it to be timely for me, and it added some needed fodder for re-thinking through personal and professional goals.
1451697686|4.0|I love this book. I read various simplifying/decluttering type books every now & then; this book is not quite that category, but similar in that Johnson has simplified her family's life extensively by trying to avoid creating any trash (zero waste). I think her choices are entirely commendable & she shows that it can actually work for a suburban family of four.<br /><br />Rather than the recycle mantra we all know, Johnson urges much more proactivity with these 5 Rs:<br /><br />* Refuse (stop stuff from coming in your home that you do not need: slowing consumption, stopping junk mail, not buying things in single-use plastic containers, etc...)<br /><br />* Reduce (the amount of stuff you need but still use; evaluating consumption habits you have, what can you share/borrow instead, reduce exposure to things that lead to more consumption)<br /><br />* Reuse (reusables vs. disposables; sharing; buying used; repairing or finding a new use for things that you might normally have tossed or replaced...)<br /><br />* Recycle (should be one of your last choices, not a first choice)<br /><br />* Rot (compost)<br /><br />I especially loved all her details about her grocery shopping w/ reusable containers & love the simplicity of her solution. I also really enjoyed how she went through various areas of the house, giving lists of how to evaluate what you have, what to get rid of/keep (simplifying is a part of zero waste), & what she kept & what she got rid of from her own house. For example, a lot of stuff left her kitchen, including a vegetable peeler (now her family eats more veggies w/ the skins on, getting more nutrition; if she does need to peel something, she just uses a knife) & her can opener (they don't buy food in cans). Both of those items were things that I, personally, would have never even considered during a cull, so I found it eye-opening to see her list of what didn't make it -- making me see what we have in a new light. At the end, she muses on what she hopes the future is/can be if more people tried to live a zero waste lifestyle & I greatly enjoyed her 'vision' (which, as it turns out, she says are things that already exist in limited amounts in limited places around the world -- now the world just needs to adopt better practices & expand the zero waste lifestyle).<br /><br />Also, for books of this type, this is well-written, well-organized, & her resources at the end match up exactly with the order of each chapter. So, it even appealed to me on an editorial level. I guess I noticed it because in that area, this book is definitely heads above others books of similar ilk.<br /><br />I think some don't like her choices or the extremes to which she has gone (easy to dismiss what she has done as unattainable), but I think it takes people willing to buck the norm, stand up & make different choices, & show by example why their way might be a better way. I see Bea Johnson as being that type of person.<br /><br />I'm nowhere near what she lives, but her choices & suggestions make a lot of sense to me & I'm definitely planning to take a hard look at our lives & attempt to push us toward more of a zero waste life. I love her blog already (plus her gorgeous, spare house that she has photos of on her blog) & found her book to be a great companion to her blog: [...] If you are interested in this lifestyle, I'd heartily recommend both her blog & the book.
B00G8P27PM|5.0|This movie was absolutely what we wanted. We loved the story, loved the jokes, loved the entire thing. Cannot recommend it thoroughly enough.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Good program, and it does really work you mentally.  I recommend it just to keep you on your toes mentally when you have some spare time
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a truly unique game. I recommend it for anyone who likes puzzle games, logic games, and/or games that really use your brain.
B0074QGGK6|2.0|This Kindle book was a small collection of thoughts and that was it.  I read it in the Doctor's office while waiting for my appointment.  It doesn't have much substance and was a disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It has you going, one moment you just give up but you find yourself picking it up again!! The levels get harder and harder as you pass each level!
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|It wasn't a great as the first Hangover - but sequels rarely are!  It's still a funny movie with the same kind of humor we're used to in these films.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Love it! This my faveorite movie! Such good music! I couldn't be happier with this product! I would totally recommend this product! Thanks.
034580404X|4.0|Surprised it was more of a love story than erotica.  Interesting and a fun read, but the 2nd and 3rd books start to get a little annoying with the \\"goo goo ga ga\\" love-doveyness.  We get the point.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Did not use  is complacated Not easy r use and to keep as application and to be useing. A lot
1451666179|5.0|I have always looked forward to reading the blog posts, so when this book was available I snatched it right up. I laughed myself silly. The way that this author is able to tell the story is such that it makes it easy to see that kind of humor in everyday life. Honestly, I laughed so hard I nearly choked. This book is a must have
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Good sound quality, but i wish the cord were much shorter.  I've used it to mike the groom for wedding videos, and can barely fit the thing in the groom's coat pocket, along with the audio recorder.  for other uses, it's fine.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've always used a wit stone to get a fine edge on my important knives, but its very time consuming. Now with this sharpener I get almost as good an edge in just a few seconds. I'm happy!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|A great fun classic movie!! A must see and must have.. too bad we didnt see much more of these actors
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Be smarter than these hungry spiders. Cut them off strategically and outmanuver them before your bugs get eaten ...enjoy this one
B00004Y87O|2.0|John Carpenter has made a name for himself by delivering tacky cult classics over the decades, and this post-apocalyptic bore-fest is one of them.  Yes, I called this boring and yes I gave this two stars so you can start the complaining and ‘non-helpful’ voting now, but really…are you serious with this?  Yes, the film is brisk, but it is ridiculously dated and makes zero impact.  Kurt Russell’s performance barely translates across the screen, and while the idea of Manhattan being a prisoner’s wasteland is pretty cool, the construction of that world is pretty lazy and the cast of characters couldn’t be less engaging.  Borgnine is a joke here and Donald Pleasence is wasted.  The final frames hold some intensity, but it is too little too late, with a ‘moral’ ending that feels tacked on and irrelevant.  Maybe if I saw this in 1981 I’d have a different feeling, but through 2013 eyes this is a dumb movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A wonderful read.  John Grisham is on a level with Conroy in my opinion.  This book, along with A Time to Kill are, in my opinion, his best works.
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|This works better than I imagined. I use it all the time on our road trips to stream movies. The kids now have tons of movies to choose from via the iUSBport. Before, the iPad was limited to its internal memory, or you had to fool with some camera adapters which ask you to move the movie to the iPad in order to watch. Now I simply turn on the iUSB with my mini usb already inserted (I have a 30gb San Disk mini cruzer) and boom I can play a movie. I chose to use the Chrome interface to browse and view the movies, seems to load faster. This works great anywhere since it creates its own network from the box. If you are sick of being limited to Apple's iPad storage or don't want to have to mortgage the farm for more space, then check out the iUSBPort. I've been using it for months now with out any problems.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Great book for anyone in need of functional muscle for martial arts. I wouldn't stick strictly to the workouts in this book but it is a great addition to any functional muscle exercise program.
B000067J24|5.0|the movie was full of interesting characters, especially the gay best friend, and incredible music.  I had to buy the soundtrack and I listen to it often.  You might also get hungry as  Cruz moves effortlessly through the cooking scenes.
B0060Q962Q|3.0|This is an ok game. My grand daughter is smart and did get bored with it already. She was 6 then.  If you try to.play this fast, it does get more exciting.
158234082X|5.0|he's a great writer and tells a brutal story of the real life of a successful kitchen from the Chef to the pot-scrubbing unfortunate.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|why do i always have to pay for every episode i want to know why if it's supposedly free does anyone else has to do this cuz if i have to pay for every single one ill just deleted it, i paid for the chocolate mountains and now it wants me to pay for the next episode when this game on other devices is free. I love this game but if it keeps on like this im gonna regret it.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Vintage Earth Wind & Fire. Friday night and  early Saturday Morning music. This will never be played on the no longer free but commercially controlled American Radio. The quality of educational music is supressed by financail creed.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so fun it's not even funny you should get it it's one of those games that you would think should be  like  six ninety nine
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Used to play this game on the computer all the time, so Iwas more than estatic to see it as an app on my new kindle fire. Looks and runs great, and it a great way to kill some time
B00AES0AZI|5.0|A treat for all the dean koontz fans. Again, build around characters and not a fixed plot, exploring the deepest limit of human psychology, be it positive or negative. The narrative and build up of dean koontz's characters in a novel sets him apart from the rest.  Caution.... You may not like it at all, if you are not a reader of this zoner( I mean psychological thrillers)..
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Outstanding and is everything it claims to be.  I just wish it was supported by more apps (e.g. mobile chrome, skype, hangouts, etc!).
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Have only seen parts of this movie while flipping channels over the years. Finally will see it from the beginning.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This  was  an interesting  read told  from a girl's  perspective. Though  the  writing  was not  sophisticated  it  did  convey  the  nuances  of  living  in such a  contested  part  of  the  world.  Malala  herself  is a  wonderful  role  model  for  young  woman. In  light  of  the  attempt on  her  life Malala's commitment to the  movement  to  create  access  to  education  for  all  children  and  especially  girls  is  inspiring.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I use it on my kindle but it doesn't want to let me download it to my kindle. That need to fix it be for I do some thing because I'm about to contact Amazon like right know.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cool game.  puzzles aren't difficult but they're not simple.  I'm looking forward to the updates hopefully there will be more added.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I think this would be great for a child, but I found it very elementry.  I have played simular games, but this one didn&#34; appeal to my interest at all.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|We call our son Peanut and elephants eat peanuts and well, Dumbo is an elephant! It's always been a childhood favorite of mine and now is his too!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The Google Chrome cast HDMI don't work, I have tried 2 of these devices.  Rep couldn't figure it out either.<br />Larry McComas
B008TRH5N6|5.0|This book is amazing, it really got me thinking a different way. I love this book. I am learning a lot about myself from  this book.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I had read the other four books leading to this one. it really captured my attention from the very beginning. it's a really good book.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my Mother, we both listened to it and LOVED IT!!! If you love Bluegrass you'll LOVE this album! Love AJ!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had not played Candy Crush until I got this app.  I really enjoy the game.  It is simple to understand and yet fun.  Some of the levels are really difficult.  While there are in app purchases available there are fewer than similar games and they can be avoided.  It might take you longer to get through the levels, but at least you can do it.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game is addictive.  I really like it and I am in my 60's. Give it a try. You will love it.
B00AQN09VQ|2.0|The menu system is horrible.  Black shows menu selection, otherwise the menus are a very dark blue.  Hard to tell the difference.  Not friendly to people who are color blind.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|The most personal and refreshing perspective of one of my favorite writers. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson's unique persona reminds me of simpler times.
B0014LQ0NK|5.0|There will never be anyone with the skill and incredible ability to interpret classical music the way Rubinstein did. He is the ultimate master and this album is enchanting.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Korn is back and better than ever.<br />The cd is amazing and to see korn at its best again brings back so many good memories.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a good light read, with some plot implausibiliities but carried forward at a pretty fast and engrossing pace.
B009P1WES6|5.0|This is an excellent read with great twist and one or two surprises. Very interesting central character who is well drawn and slightly left field. Would like to read more from author who has certainly shown he as a great ability to create very threatening atmosphere and characters.....
0307719774|5.0|Everyone should own this journal. It asks you a unique question every day ranging from: &#34;Who's the last person you kissed?&#34; to &#34;What are three goals you have for the future?&#34; and it's really inspiring to look back and be able to see your answers for five straight years, and learn about how you've changed and grown in that time. I think this is a fun experiment for all ages, and it's a great way to journal without having to actually spend much time writing - there's only room for a sentence or two a day, so you're not plunking down a huge chunk of time. I'm an avid journaler and I love this as a small edition to my daily journal, but everyone I've bought one for has fallen in love with how quick, easy, and fun it is.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|It was everything I remembered from years ago.  It has rarely been seen on TV, if ever.  I enjoyed El Cid more then<br />Ben Hur.  My critique of a movie is almost always based on story line, not the production of the film.
0345529057|5.0|The Amazon price for this set is unbelievably cheap - this is a series every modern reader should own and read. They're absolutely riveting and well worth the time it'll take to get through them all.
B000063JDE|2.0|The story line (?) was a terrible disappointment.  Supposedly it helped Dennis Hopper's &#34;comeback&#34; in his acting career<br />but I thought it was a waste of some talented actors.
B00DETP4FK|5.0|Great service by Amazon and brilliant new album by KT Tunstall. Great melodies, excellent voice. I am so glad I have this on CD instead on mp3.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I thought this book was amazing, as said in the title, I recommend this to everyone who likes reading. I find this book 5 stars.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Loved this game.  So much fun.  Had to order Mysteryville 1 when I solved this one because I didn't want the fun to stop.  Great game.
0385351399|5.0|With great expectations, I pre-ordered Dave Eggers’ The Circle, from amazon. The result by far surpassed them.<br /><br />In the begining, when Mae, the protagonist of this remarkable, fast-paced and far reaching novel, joins The Circle, she knows that it is the “most watched workplace in the world.”  Its employees, the Circlers, are passionate, participatory and transparent (a nice twist on that corporate mainstay, the ppt presentation).  Mae secured her position through Annie, one of The Circle’s beloved, elect members, and an ideal mentor to Mae as Mae struggles to establish her foothold in The Circle.<br /><br />The Circle, as a place of employment, is renown for its Edenic amenities.  On the surface, nothing is witheld from Circlers.  Its vast campus is structured as a theme park with historical epochs - the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Middle Ages - The Circle seeks to deprive its employees of nothing.  There are endless, after hour activities, groups and sub-groups of people with whom to network on a dizzying variety of interests, medical facilities, dormitories for over night Circlers, and insurance plans that cover not just the immediate families of Circlers, but more distant relatives as well.<br /><br />Yet, no less than Eden, there is but one request: that Circlers share.  Within The Circle it is not property, as Proudon pronounced,  but “privacy [that] is theft.”  Privacy allows concealment, and concealment is necessary only to those who require the cover of darkness.  After all, opacity is necessary only for those ashamed to be seen.<br /><br />From that conviction, the  global aspirations of The Circle spring.  Make transparent that which seeks to cloak itself in darkness and the world’s ills all but cease. The abduction and abuse of children, the backroom deals of politicians, violent crime, theft:  all and more are significantly diminished, if not eliminated, once they become visible  to all.<br /><br />And what entity is betterpositioned to bring global transparency to fruition than The Circle? In this novel, The Circle is already the sole repository of more data on more individuals than any single entiy in existence.  With its vast array of tools, The Circle is better equipped than any fumbling government to monitor, measure and evaluate virtually any activity, anywhere.<br /><br />David Egger’s The Circle is not a work of science fiction.  In fact, much of its force, and much of what its readers will find mesmerizing is the extent to which the world depicted in The Circle seems to be a not implausible extension of the world they already know.  I cannot remember the last time a novel so vividly compressed between its covers so much of what the modern world encounters.  An absolute, must read.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Has to be the very, very best game I have ever tried to solve on my kindle.  It took me weeks to finish and don't think I could have done ti if I hadn't had help from others on the internet.  Even with help it was a very challenging game.  Just love it.  Will by the Haunt 2 soon.  Hope it is as much fun.  Can't imaging it could be any better.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|My least favorite reacher novel. Am a big Lee child fan but just not thie one have eead them all.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|Mika is a talent who has not been embraced by the U.S.  His songs run the gamut of pop, ballads, techno to rock.  I enjoy listening to his music.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It is OK but just not very good. I have seen better on other sites. They cost a lot more
B004LWZW4M|4.0|This is a clever mix of a science drama/science fiction/fantasy film with stellar acting.  Franco and Lithgow are great as the father-son duo at the center of this film.  This is a redux of the classic film with a more tangible reason for the rise of the apes.  I enjoyed it for its crisp writing, acting and special effects.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game it cane keep me going for hours when we are on a long trip.  Best part it is free
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is sticky but fun spin on the classic Christmas tale of redemption.  Sir Michael caine adds dramatic depth to this film.  Kermit, Robin, Gonzo, Miss Piggy and the gang are enjoyable in the muppet tradition. There are plenty of one-liners and special effects.  This movie is pure fun!
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Pacific Rim is an odd blend of Independence Day and Starship Troopers. Independence Day was cliché but fun; the actors made it work. Pacific Rim took the plot, made it more cliché, and then forgot to get good actors or a script for them to work from. The few good actors it had were wasted. The acting and script reminded me of Starship Troopers; a style reminiscent of people not comfortable talking to other people.<br /><br />If you come to the movie with no expectations you won't be disappointed. A great original idea,a battle between giant robots and monsters that destroy Tokyo. Well original in the sense its been done hundreds of times so maybe not so original. I would have enjoyed this movie when I was ten; who doesn't love giant robots and monsters destroying Tokyo, I grew up with it. But if you're going to put it on the big screen and charge money for it step up the game. I'm sorry the film didn't work (for me), maybe if they'd had all the Power Rangers it would have been more coherent.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Fantastic album. I definitely recommend it. I can't get Afterlife out of my head. Reflector is a great song and album. It's a great step forward for Arcade Fire.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Def a favorite of my husband and daughter! Purcahsed the movie for a firneds borthday who also happended to love the movie growing up
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing device. Although it can have trouble on certain dual-frequency routers, the Chromecast is easily my favorite gadget of 2013, and an absolute steal at this $35 price point.
B000TT1QLE|5.0|There's two version of Angela Hewitt's WTC:-<br />&#34;Box set - Angela in red&#34; is the re-issue of 1998/99 edition - played on Steinway (recorded in 2 years)<br />&#34;Box set - Angela in white&#34; is the latest one of 2008 - played on Fazioli (recorded in 9 days)
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Enjoy the comedy and drama blend.  The stars and co stars make a perfect team leaving you wanting more of the story just like a good book.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a well made game. Wonderful visuals, lengthy but in a good way, engaging and fun. Playing in the dark made it scary at times!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is an awesome, crazy addicting game.  I am so glad that is available for the Kindle Fire now!

B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Easy to use and makes learning a new language fun and entertaining. Works great. No problems so far. Thanks very much.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great flow, great characters, great twists.  Wonder if there's possibly more to come.  I'll be buying them to read tonight
B007HUD6OS|4.0|It is a great story and, between the lines, shows kids that even they can make a difference when it comes to abuse of power by politicians and lobbyists.<br />Our environment needs and deserves any ally it can get, and already  children must learn to speak up for good causes and then go out and do something about it rather than leaving it all to others and just passively watch the results on TV.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I took it to Spain and used it as my main bag to carry my essentials and of course my camera (with all the parts). It was a great bag & I was able to keep it secure by using the clips to tie it to a chair or the table. Only issue was the internal sections didn't stay as formed as I would like. By the end of my trip, all the parts were sagging and I was afraid my camera lenses were bumping around in the bag. But I'll keep using it & maybe fix the compartments.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 books, and the first one is my favorite. I have to say that all the dirty scenes get tired after a while, so I would skip some of those and go straight to the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Slow and predictable. I give this book a '2' out of '5' stars. It was also hard to get into and follow.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this is was the free app of the day a few days ago. I uploaded it. I have been playing it. the app is asking me to give it 5 stars... and I did. I like turkey.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Wonderful music, mega stars, bright dialogue.  The characters were lovable and quirky.  The location is lovely - I'd be thrilled to retire to such an historic building.
0805047905|5.0|The perfect addition to The Very Hungry Caterpillar! The artwork is such a lovely visual treat to both babies, children and adults alike.
0385523394|4.0|After watching this movie on Netflix, I wanted to see how the real story was told, so I read this book.  There were a few changes, as always when Hollywood takes a story, but I enjoyed  both very much.
B00CVDM5HK|5.0|Owning this on vinyl is amazing! The perfect addition to my MM vinyl collection. Corners of vinyl sleeve were a little damaged, even though the record was unopened. Oh well!
0385486804|4.0|Words that come to my mind when I read “Into the Wild” is an epic adventure of a college graduate who left the grid and changed his name from Chris to Alex. He had $25000 in his college fund and a working car. Then he donated the rest of his college fund money to charity and ditched his car and burned the rest of his money in his wallet. Chris told the people he met when he was hitchhiking that he didn't like his parents so I think he was a rebel. So I think that Jon Krakauer tool a good story of a rebellious boy trying to have an adventure and disappear from his parents.
0694003611|5.0|Can't beat this deal in baby book format! A great classic story for every nursery. Love it in baby format; so cute and will last a lifetime.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Absolutely, by far the best country music ever!!  Came across this by chance because I was looking for another country band to listen to besides Rascal Flatts (who is another one of my favorites).  Never heard of The Band Perry until now...listening to their music though...I'm sure we'll be hearing much more of them.
0451450523|5.0|The book is ALWAYS better than the movie. I normally read non-fiction; with the occasional fiction story here and there. This is such a great book; beautifully written, very imaginative and sweet read. You need to read this book! I can't wait to share it with my friends.

B00C7607BC|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie and I have great memories of watching it with her older cousins. The characters make this a Disney classic.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Incredible book.  A wonderfully skilled writer and a magnificent story.  Couldn't recommend it more highly.  This book will suck you in and, like a black hole, there's no escape.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great it freezes but it still has good quality and let's you choose cute backgrounds (just press the paintbrush in the top right corner  of the home page )
B002ZG9846|5.0|The disc set arrived without any damage, the discs are brand new and it plays flawlessly on my players. The movie itself is very entertaining and hilariously enjoyable. It was a fantastic purchase. I am very pleased.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The twist in the end made me crave for more. I could not get my hands off of it when I started. It was truly worth the time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game, makes you think.  Relaxing I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants something to do and block out the world for a few minutes.
B00E32J3EK|1.0|The only truthful thing was that it was the same book. It was said to be gently used and the newest version. I got the older version with writing on the side and ripped pages. I was also supposed to be shipped 3 weeks before it actually was.
B00000JMP9|5.0|Yes, I know the opera has been redacted to feature film length and the singing is lip-synched, but nonetheless for pure melodrama, nothing in the operatic repertoire surpasses Werther. Here, we have the hugely underrated Peter Dvorsky in, perhaps, his greatest role. This opera requires a Werther who can both act and sing, and Dvorsky satisfies both requirements, indeed, surpasses one's expectations. Brigitte Fassbinder is a wonderful foil as his snake bit lover. The acting is nothing short of spectacular, the singing is first rate, and the gorgeous music by Massenet carries the story to its tragic conclusion with elegance and beauty. If opera is drama intensified by music, this recording may be the best example I have ever seen.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Great  series! I really liked the story even though the ending is sad. All the hardships that Tess had to go through...it will have you crying.
1592407889|5.0|This is an amazing book..!!!<br />What a life, Sachi is a remarkable individual.!<br /><br />I have been a fan of Shirley Maclaines for years, she seems to be a pretty confused and mixed up person; in a way I feel sorry for her.<br /><br />It seems to me the only thing that Sachi passably stood to inherit from two very 'RICH' parents was this very valuable property in Hawaii (or Japan) from her father, but she took no action to claim the property and let it go to  her/ Sachi's extraordinary outrageously bad`,bad`,bad`, step mother, Miki; I was shocked.!!!<br /><br />Shirley had already told Sachi that she was not leaving her any thing and Shirley owned 4 or 5 houses and a 8,000 acer ranch, that is extraordinarily pathetic\\".!!! She seems to forget about the law of cause and effect and Karma.<br /><br />This is a very deep and complex story but is an easy read. Sachi is a very good writer.<br /><br />PS: The book has some really nice pictures.!

B00F880BWG|5.0|This isn't a typical horror show.  The zombies, while terrifying, serve as more of a back drop to the story line than the main focus of the show.  Characters are developed in such a way to make you care about them.  Production, direction, and acting all top notch
B00B8YSIMY|4.0|An enjoyable read.... quick moving and captivating.  Contains some nice pieces of humour to maintain the flow.  Im not much of a reader but managed to complete this in less than a week.  I will definitely give Jams N Roses another read.

B001EN71DQ|3.0|The seller did a nice thing resending me a second copy of the order when i didnt get the first one after 3 weeks and there was no ability for them to track the first copy.  Im sure it was just the post office but my kids were supposed to have movie night and see the movie weeks ago so the reality is the experience was only ok due to delivery issues.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent enlightenment to using your intuition to full benefit.<br />It's a short easy to read book that will inspire and challenge some of your thinking. I did all the exercises and was amazed at what transpires. Something that didn't come through to me (I may have missed it) is that sometimes we ask for solutions and think our requests haven't been answered, but discover later that they actually were, just in ways we weren't anticipating.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|I love \\"The Walking Dead\\", and have since Episode 1--to be honest, mostly for its character development...I unfortunately have to purchase it to watch it this season. I'm not sure why every two minutes an f-ing commercial airs, with sound, behind it, and am a bit peeved that I've spent money on the episode only to have this occur-it makes it virtually impossible to watch with any type of continuity. Fix this, amazon! Totally bummed!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of Mr. GRISHAM 's best efforts. A book that is like the ones when he first started writing, hard to put down. I read it in two days. Spellbinding and keeps the reader interested the entire book.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is just the right mix of fun and challenging!  You snip spider web strands as the spider approaches, in an attempt to keep him away from all the bugs in the web.  Sounds simple, but some levels are really tricky!<br /><br />I got this app for free when they were running a promotion, but in hindsight, I'd be willing to pay for it.  Love it!
B0081336FO|5.0|The show is awesome.  It's not a show for the easily distracted you have to pay attention and be observant.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The application works perfectly. I have never had any problems, graphics look amazing. I love this game. The kindle fire HD is so easy to use. The application looks just like the game on my pc.
B00CZ1TMUQ|4.0|After listening incessantly to their first album 'Together', this second album is a bit of a let down. In fairness, it would be difficult to top their first. This one is mostly covers of favorite love songs. After the thrilling, soaring arias of 'Together', this one seems like a night at the local dinner theatre. Well suited for Charlotte's range but Jonathan seems like a restrained bull, never permitted to burst forth with that powerhouse voice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its confusing at first and get very frustrating but its very addictive.  Still learning a lot about the game but I do love it.<br />Once you try it you will become addictive just like me.<br />Enjoy the game.
B0098460O4|5.0|After their stunning 'Prayer' performance I thought a first album of mostly Italian opera selections was an odd choice. But now I realize what better way to showcase Charlotte's sweet, crystal clear, pure voice against the volcanic power of Jonathan's magnificent voice. Even though I can't understand of word of Italian, I am almost moved to tears by these song selections. What a future lies ahead of these two talented teens.

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Iron Man 3 is the best of the Downey lead trilogy.As usual the actor delivers quick witted, off handed, situational comments adding connections and context to the scenes. Downey's mentally capable Marvel character is supported by a dry, &#34;mater of fact,&#34; English accented iron suite voice. The droid voice keeps the star informed about the state of his metal shells as well as their occupants.<br />I watched the movie twice and saw a number of new details with each viewing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was an amazing novel.  I couldn't put it down and was placed on an emotional journey from the start.  Reminds me of the same elements in Coelho and Marquez's books that I love.

B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Its an amazing version done in such a whedon manner. Its amazing. though it took me a second to adjust to the dude from sheid speaking shakespeare and i spent a lot of time searching for Nathan Fillion. for us whedonites you will see the familiar faces. We get Mal and Simon from Firefly, Fred and Wesley, Andrew from Angel/ Buffy, and Topher from Dollhouse. Okay its in BLACK AND WHITE. which i think adds to it but some of you wil hate. Finally its shakespeare people. if you have an issue with Williams Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet by Baz you will hate this. I though it was amazing changing conrade to a female role was brilliant. Her lines seem to make more sence this way. Finally for you feminists its shakespeare. the idea that this girl is having se and should be super a shamed and that two people can get married so quick still exists. in closing<br />IT'S SHAKESPEARE PEOPLE EXPECT THAT GOING IN DONT RATE IT POORLY BECAUSE YOU CANT FOLLOW THE DIALOGUE.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I love learning what makes us do the things we do and this book fits that bill well for those of us who are not social scientists. The book reminded me of a David Goliath moment in my own life.<br /><br />As a high school junior, I joined the girls track team. I was a tiny, brainy, uncoordinated nerd, but loved running. When the coaches were organizing the first meet, everyone on the team had been assigned one to four events except for me. I don't know if it was an accident or if I looked that bad on the track. The day of the meet, the coach announced that there were several spots open for the 400 meter event. I volunteered and came in second. Eventually, I was recruited for the 1600 meter relay after coming in second or third in the 400 meter at most of the meets.  Senior year, I was tired of coming in second and noticed that the girls in the 800 meter were just jogging, not running. I asked to switch from the 400 meter to the 800 meter. The coach didn't want to move me since I was scoring points at the 400 meter. In order to change events, I had to challenge the best 800 meter runner. During the challenge, I ran all out and beat her by a wide margin. I was allowed to change events and spent the rest of my senior season coming in first.<br /><br />I thought of this experience when reading the book. When I was not coming out on top in the 400 meter, I found another place that was just waiting for someone like me to succeed.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|It's a CD with Taylor Swift music, you're probably not going to buy it if you didn't already know most of the songs on here, so I guess there's no sense in reviewing the content of the CD.  So instead, I will review the actual CD and case.  They're both made of plastic, they look pretty sturdy.  The booklet in the CD case is nice too I guess.

B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Has Charlaine Harris ever read her own books? The rules she has set up for her characters apparently no longer apply. Lazy writing, it's like she got bored with her own story & couldn't get it finished quick enough. Very disappointed
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|&#34;Trekkies&#34; and &#34;Trekkers&#34; can complain all day long about the continuity problems with the current Star Trek movies, but in truth, films are excellent movies to bring in a new generation of fans, and a great introduction to the genre for casual Trek fans, such as myself.<br /><br />JJ Abrams made another masterful (Star Trek) film, and it delivers even more of everything that you could ask for in a movie (as does the entire cast).  Chris Pine is outstanding playing the role of James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto is perfect in his portrayal of Spock, and Karl Urban is the perfect Dr. Leonard McCoy.  Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and Simon Pegg is brilliant in his take on &#34;Scotty&#34;.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, however, is unparalleled in this film.<br /><br />I know that Star Trek fans and Star Wars fans are often at odds, and the movies aren't, really, similar in many ways (at least not to me), so I feel like they are comparing &#34;Apples and Oranges&#34;.<br /><br />But, that said, if Star Trek keep this pace up, as it has proven to, this franchise will soon lap Star Wars in short order with respect to writing, acting, cinematography, and overall quality.<br /><br />Although I am certain to draw fire for this, this is the best Star Trek movie ever made, which is amazing because JJ Abrams is admittedly a fan of Star Wars over Star Trek.

The jokes about him are kinda funny, easy to figure he is just a clone already. So far I have enjoyed this cast and show and I am waiting for them to get more into their characters and get it going for the season.
B00459GJUM|3.0|The Stargate collection of series, based on the movie Stargate, has been an enjoyable sci-fi universe built around the notion that a society from ages past, The Ancients, built a series of gates that connect planets across the galaxy, and even across galaxies.  The first series, Stargate SG-1, was an extension of the movie, and was a nice mix of sci-fi adventures and goofy charm, led by the always excellent Richard Dean Anderson.  The series went through several collection of villains over the years.  Stargate Atlantis, a sister series, takes place in a separate galaxy, and had the same themes, adventurers settling in a new galaxy, battling a race of life-sucking badies called the Wraith.  It had a mix of irreverent attitude and adventure that also worked.<br /><br />Stargate Universe was the third iteration of the basic premise, but in this series it is an entirely different feel.  The basic premise is that a group of people are transported onto an automated starship that is traveling through a galaxy very far way.  Only parts of the ship are still habitable, and they do not have the power to use the stargate to get back to Earth.<br /><br />This series is much different than the balance of the Stargate universe.  As noted, the first two series had a light-hearted sheen to them, with wisecracking main characters.  This is much darker, with conflicts among the characters, back-biting among people struggling to control the ship and the crew, and the crew breaking into various factions.  In other words, it is much more like real life in terms of how humans react in pressure packed situations.<br /><br />The second season was the last of this series, which was a pity because I don't think it had hit its' stride yet.  The season bogged down a bit by having a doomsday collection of machines that attacked all technology.  So much of the season is spent trying to avoid the machines and figuring out how to defeat them.  The problem is that it is not that interesting to constantly be battling machines that are relentless but not interactive.<br /><br />There is a nice set of episodes revolving around a society built by the ships occupants that were sent back in time to a planet in an alternate time-line (it's less complicated when you watch the series).<br /><br />Since it is only two seasons, and since it has an entirely different character to the other series, it is something of an anomaly for this universe.  But it is an interesting addition to the Stargate collection of series and may be worth checking out.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Many may be discouraged by the length of the novel, but reading on my Kindle I hardly noticed how long it was. It is not only about botany, which in itself was well worth reading about, but it is also a look into the life of a woman's life as<br />a botanistj when women rarely entered the field of science.  Very fascinating novel, I highly recommend it.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag is big enough but the exterior padding is minimal and does not provide substantial protection to camera and anything placed toward the outside edge.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, but watch out it is sooooo adictive, but in a good way. I could play for hours and hours
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was thrilled when this became available on my Kindle Fire. Now I can play it anywhere.  I find this game to be very entertaining and highly addictive. It's great that you can play against your friends and just have a good time. It also keeps your brain active as you do need to use it to try and score!

B009BJAPLK|5.0|Great series, wish there mor then three episodes. The updating to present day still retains most of the elements of the original
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great read. Very well written. I quite enjoyed it. Characters are complex yet relatable. Despite knowing the framework of the plot, there is still surprise and intrigue.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It really made Fitzgerald's themes come alive in a way that they never did for me in his novel. I loved the use of contemporary music. The acting was superb. The use of Nick Carroway's narrative to keep some of the original narrative from the book in the movie was very well done. I was particularly impressed that for all the flashy excitement, there was no swearing, no nudity, and pretty much no violence. A different director could have made the film much raunchier and more terrifying, but the movie was incredibly classy.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|This was a great movie, it was very realistic, well acted, and had a  &#34;seat of your pants&#34; ending... Highly recommended!
0525478183|4.0|It is a good book, very interesting read. It was also in good condition for being used. Not bad price either.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome movie!! Fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC acting, moving and witty dialog, big BIG special effects. The 'bad parts' lasted merely seconds and were easy to see coming over (kiddos watching). Next time I will rent the HD version for a dollar more.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Awesome movie from beginning to end!  Every character was essential to story and pulled it together seamlessly.  The end was totally unexpected.  It was nice be surprised.
B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed’s third album, Berlin, embodies the most beloved narrative in rock and roll history: the lost classic.  Nearly universally despised upon its released, in the last forty years Berlin has gone from pariah to a canonical rock and roll album. And while this is in many ways a triumph—after all, the more accolades an album receives, the more people listen to it—there’s something about Berlin that makes its banishment from polite society seem appropriate, not because the album is a disaster as some critics claimed on its initial release, but because the album spends the majority of its running time mired in the grime and muck of drug addiction, poverty, and domestic violence.  As an album, Berlin is arguably Lou Reed’s greatest evocation of place in an entire career concerned with the territory of the city.<br /><br />Ostensibly, Berlin is a concept album.  But unlike most concept albums of the 70s, Berlin isn’t concerned with baroque plotting or sci-fi fantasy.  Instead, the album is an evocative exploration of the cityscape and city dwellers.  Lou Reed acts as flaneur and guide who leads the listener through a kaleidoscopic series of personalities and images.  The title track opens the album with the shuffling sounds of the city: conversations, laughter, a birthday song, and glasses clinking all competing with one another for clarity.  This bundle of white noise soon gives way to Reed’s speak/sing voice and piano, reminiscing about attending a concert in a caf&eacute; with his paramour.  Reed’s lyrics cleverly collapse beginnings and endings.  The date at the caf&eacute; appears to occur early on in the couple’s relationship, a time of open possibilities, but these potential futures are quickly closed as Reed sings, “Oh, babe, I’m gonna miss you now that you’re gone.”  Already Reed is foreshadowing the dark places his tale will take us.<br /><br />Berlin’s narrative can be simply outlined as a street rat couple fall in love in the city, play power games with each other, have several children together, and separate.  Caroline, the female protagonist, eventually becomes disreputable, loses her children, and commits suicide.  There’s an almost stifling sense of dread throughout the album.  The details of this relationship are not always clear, but it doesn’t matter, because Reed is more concerned with crafting atmosphere and a sense of location than he is throwing together a clumsy plot.  Rather than referring to the actual Berlin, the German city seems to be more of a state of mind, a stand in for large international metropolises, owing as much debt to New York City or William S. Burrough’s fictional Interzone as it does to Germany’s capital.<br /><br />Just as the skyscrapers of the city can make residents feel cut off from the outside world, Reed’s characters are also trapped by place and class.  In the song, “Men of Good Fortune,” Reed swings back and forth between those born into wealth and those born into poverty.  Reed sings, “Men of good fortune / Often cause empires to fall / While men of poor beginnings / often can’t do anything at all,” drawing a line between the have and the have nots as well as their attendant agency or lack thereof.  The manner in which Reed’s verses place “men of good fortune” and “men of poor beginnings” next to one another is indicative of how great poverty and great wealth often share the same space in the city.  Several times Reed’s protagonist sings, “it makes no difference to me,” claiming that the trappings of poverty aren’t something that will define his life, but the tragic end to the album suggests otherwise.  In other words, you may not believe in class warfare, but class warfare believes in you.<br /><br />It’s important for Reed to construct a world around his characters, because they do unsavory things and at times seem completely unconcerned with one another.  The relationship between the two protagonists appearsto vacillate between love and hate.  In “Caroline Says I,” Caroline expresses her desire to treat her male paramour as a toy, and he responds by calling her his queen.  And yet two songs later on “Oh Jim,” the titular character is described as “Filled up to here with hate” and beating his lover “black and blue.”  In the song’s coda, sung from Caroline’s perspective, she quietly laments “Oh Jim, how could you treat me this way?”  This is a highly dysfunctional couple, and without an understanding of the world of poverty and drugs in which they live, a listener wouldn’t be able to extend any empathy.  Reed doesn’t ask us to condone the troubled psychosexual and physical power these two inflict on one another, but he does ask us to understand their world.<br /><br />The album’s longest song at nearly eight minutes, “The Kids” might be the album’s most sympathetic song.  The track details all the reasons why the state wants to take Caroline’s children away, including drug use and perceived promiscuity.  Towards the end of the song, we hear two children screaming for their mother, evocatively representing the toll this separation will have on “the children.”  By questioning the decision to separate mother and child, Reed asks us to question how class affects perception of motherhood.  “The Kids” has also resulted in one of the album’s most intriguing behind the scenes stories.  The two children calling out for their mother are supposedly producer Bob Ezrin’s.  Ezrin knew he wanted the sound of two screaming children, so when his children came home from school one day, he told them their mother had died in a horrible car accident and then recorded the results.  This story may or may not be apocryphal, but it only ads to the mythology of Berlin.<br /><br />Berlin manages to be both a representative and exceptional album in Reed’s discography.  It is representative in that it recalls Reed’s transformative ability to sketch characters and places.  But it is an exception because Reed relies on orchestration more on Berlin than just about any other album out there.  Amidst the album’s layered strings and overpowering horn sections, Reed’s off kilter, nearly monotone delivery grounds his story of druggies and lovers.  The closing track, “Sad Song,” swirls with arpeggio violins.  The track becomes a mockery of the sort of triumphant ending one usually finds at the conclusion of a Broadway musical.  The album’s male protagonist, Jim is supposedly thinking about moving on after Caroline’s suicide, but he only seems to be going through the motions, proudly exclaiming “I’m going to stop wasting my time / Somebody else would have broke both her arms.”  But it’s to Reed’s credit that buried within this irony is a true sense of despair.  As I write this review, Reed passed away a week ago.  I’ve been listening to “Sad Song” quite a lot, and I can confidently report back that it can in fact double as an authentic expression of loss.e between love and hate.  In “Caroline Says I,” Caroline expresses her desire to treat her male paramour as a toy, and he responds by calling her his queen.  And yet two songs later on “Oh Jim,” the titular character is described as “Filled up to here with hate” and beating his lover “black and blue.”  In the song’s coda, sung from Caroline’s perspective, she quietly laments “Oh Jim, how could you treat me this way?”  This is a highly dysfunctional couple, and without an understanding of the world of poverty and drugs in which they live, a listener wouldn’t be able to extend any empathy.  Reed doesn’t ask us to condone the troubled psychosexual and physical power these two inflict on one another, but he does ask us to understand their world.<br /><br />The album’s longest song at nearly eight minutes, “The Kids” might be the album’s most sympathetic song.  The track details all the reasons why the state wants to take Caroline’s children away, including drug use and perceived promiscuity.  Towards the end of the song, we hear two children screaming for their mother, evocatively representing the toll this separation will have on “the children.”  By questioning the decision to separate mother and child, Reed asks us to question how class affects perception of motherhood.  “The Kids” has also resulted in one of the album’s most intriguing behind the scenes stories.  The two children calling out for their mother are supposedly producer Bob Ezrin’s.  Ezrin knew he wanted the sound of two screaming children, so when his children came home from school one day, he told them their mother had died in a horrible car accident and then recorded the results.  This story may or may not be apocryphal, but it only ads to the mythology of Berlin.<br /><br />Berlin manages to be both a representative and exceptional album in Reed’s discography.  It is representative in that it recalls Reed’s transformative ability to sketch characters and places.  But it is an exception because Reed relies on orchestration more on Berlin than just about any other album out there.  Amidst the album’s layered strings and overpowering horn sections, Reed’s off kilter, nearly monotone delivery grounds his story of druggies and lovers.  The closing track, “Sad Song,” swirls with arpeggio violins.  The track becomes a mockery of the sort of triumphant ending one usually finds at the conclusion of a Broadway musical.  The album’s male protagonist, Jim is supposedly thinking about moving on after Caroline’s suicide, but he only seems to be going through the motions, proudly exclaiming “I’m going to stop wasting my time / Somebody else would have broke both her arms.”  But it’s to Reed’s credit that buried within this irony is a true sense of despair.  As I write this review, Reed passed away a week ago.  I’ve been listening to “Sad Song” quite a lot, and I can confidently report back that it can in fact double as an authentic expression of loss.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|why cant I open it after two weeks? is it updateing??? had game before and it did this...uninstalled it and reinstalled just to start over and now its doing it again. why?

B00DURHYWC|5.0|Love Pink Martini and this is a great album - lots of fun.  Instrumentals and voices are top notch and you can just see them all having a great time.
1250038820|5.0|I had been waiting for this book to come out and was SO excited when I got it. It came right on time and wasn't harmed during shipping. The minute I opened this book I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in one sitting. I highly recommend buying this for family friends and photography lovers alike. I'm also thinking about buying a few more. It will now have it's rightful place on my coffee table where it belongs.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it loads of fun ive spent many hours playing this game one of my most played. And most enjoyed
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Best edm album ever! I'm amazed by how awesome this album is. And it was only $4 how great is that.

B008JFUPOY|5.0|Another Disney hit!  This movie was a solid prequel to Monsters Inc.  This is a great family movie that everyone will enjoy.
B005F3XVA8|4.0|Nice video. Saw part on TV channel could not see to completion on TV because had other things to do at that time. Watched Blu-ray & saw completion. Good family CD.
B00C7607BC|5.0|One of the best Disney movies.  Great story, and classic tale.  This is my daughters favorite movie, always signing the songs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ADDITIVE, I love this game, it has taken forever for the Crush to come out and now that it's on my kindle I live for the next level.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Great movie with a solid storyline.  Robert Di Niro is fantastic in this movie.  Good re watch value, and great value.
B00FRMDH7Y|4.0|Was a great movie to watch with the entire family. Great animation and story line. Kids loved it.<br />I would reccomend it.
B000I2JI80|4.0|This film worked well when I shot it in bright daylight with a Pentax 645. Nice colour rendition and is scanned well from the negative. I will use this film again in the future.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|I've loved Arcade Fire since Funeral.  I thought that record was great, Neon Bible was good (but suffered from the sophomore slump), and that The Suburbs was better than its predecessor, but not as good as the debut.  With Reflektor, I'm actually dealing with the fact that there's a new Arcade Fire album I'm not even going to buy.  I've seen all the live TV performances, and I listened to the album roughly four times when it streamed on YouTube the weekend before it was officially released.<br /><br />I have no problem with a band making an album completely out of left field (Radiohead with Kid A, or Destroyer with Kaputt to name a few), or when a band constantly changes things from one record to the next (Grails, Sigur Ros, Liars, to name a few) as long as it's done right.  I don't think Reflektor is done right.  I think it sounds like them trying to blend 'world music' with LCD Soundsystem, and I think they fall flat on their faces.  You watch these guys doing live performances with all of the awkward dancing and the two random guys playing conga drums for darn near EVERY SONG, and it all just seems unnatural, fake, and contrived.  I think they're trying to fill a void for people who want there to be a huge rock act like U2 or Bruce Springsteen, and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The biggest offense though is what they pulled on the final track.  The only reason this album actually has to spread across two discs is because of the extended tape rewind sound that's tacked onto the last track.  If they just cut it when the actual song ended, the album fits on one disc.  This is so UTTERLY pretentious.  If you want to make a double album, then add on an extra song (or make the already long songs even longer).  Don't pull crap like that.  After such a nonsensical and forced record, extending it to two discs just because you can say you made a double record is too much.  I'm really bummed to be this unhappy with what I thought was going to be one of the year's best records.  I just hope Reflektor is a detour for Arcade Fire and not a sign of what to expect from them in the future.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very informational. I started reading the book as an annoyed skeptic. This whole gluten free trend is irritating. But after reading some interesting facts in the book I did a gluten free experiment on myself and actually DO feel better without it in my life. I highly suggest this read, even if it's just for the informational value.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|great app<br />simple to use and does what it promises to do<br />look forward to more features<br />probably support for more formats
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|So glad Mazzy Star is back!! Have missed them so much. Listening to this CD takes me right back to the good days of the 90's.
B007DIQAXI|1.0|Great songs, but don't bother getting the vinyl album. Get the CD or digital download instead. The vinyl album doesn't sound any better. The vocals are lifeless. And the percussion lacks detail. Especially telling is a tambourine at the end of record 1 side 1 that sounds dull and plinky. If the engineers used higher res digital, or full analog then the tambourine would sound real. All the subtle high pitched sounds would come through. I would have thought that if they bothered to make it a double album, they would have made it sound good too. This poor quality album wouldn't have sounded any worse if they put it on a single disc. It's not like they were avoiding dynamic compression. They only put it on two discs for show. For that matter, they only put it on vinyl for show.  This record sounds like someone held up their i-phone in the middle of the studio and then transferred the resulting pitiful digital file to vinyl. Don't waste your money. Just listen to youtube. Seriously, the LP doesn't sound better than youtube.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is so addictive, fun and frustrating. It is impossible to ignore it for very long. Excellent on the Kindle.
B00005JKHP|2.0|S.T.T.M.P.  What a title, right? I remember seeing this when it premiered in Philadelphia, at the Fox theater.(?) What was so impressive about the movie? You've got to remember, if you were living back then, that this was the first time we saw the Enterprise and it's crew, with BIG BUCKS behind it! I think the most impressive part, and this was what stayed with me, was the first appearance of the vastly improved Klingons and their vessels. Now they looked like aliens-not some guys in dark faces with beards. Another thing that impressed me was the vast improvement of the engineering spaces on the Enterprise. It looked functional and impressive - not some set with a few cardboard tables with blinking lights.<br />As for the story, it could've been done in 90 minutes, easily. The crew that put this together seemed to have forgotten what made the TV series work. Characters. Character interaction. Story.  What we end up with is 2 hours and 12 minutes of \\"Oh look at this. Oh, look at that.\\"  In many ways, this film is clearly prophetic of the state of motion pictures today, only they didn't have CGI back then.<br />As an entertaining film, this is clearly a failure. What it did achieve however, was to make the creative team learn from their mistakes, and come back like gangbusters with STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN. and the story goes on from there....<br />I can recommend this to anyone clearly as a curiosity. Be sure you have your remote stocked with fresh batteries, because you're going to be hitting the fast-forward button a lot.<br />I could also recommend this to anyone suffering from insomnia-almost guaranteed to put you asleep halfway through.
B00BB67UNW|5.0|I love Mark Walhberg he is my favorite actor and this movie was great and I am happy with my purchase and adding it to my Mark collection.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Another childhood fave!  I like to watch it around Halloween.  So funny and I love the music.  Even though I can quote the movie by heart I still love watching it.  Makes me laugh
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Better than a lot of action movies, but not a lot better.  And, running zombies?!  I'm not into that.  The book was better.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Almost fun, but lacked character development.  Didn't make you care about any characters enough to keep your interest.  The plot and story devices were lame. The point was apparently just to let us watch giants smashing stuff and it did that pretty well in most scenes.  Effects failed miserably in a few areas where giants and humans shared the screen, which was surprising considering most scenes that looked quite good. Poorly written for adults, but safe for kids to watch...mostly.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|this season sucks! sorry no other way to say it.... first there's alien abduction then some kind of monster mad scientist thing going on and follow that up with a lesbo newspaper reporter chasing a story about some guy called bloody face. Its almost like the writers just steal the main story line from many different movies and dump them all in the plot. I was so hopeful after season 1 it was awesome though the same dumping of mass stories was still there it was well blended. having said that I will be stopping at episode 1 enough said!!
B008D36INE|4.0|Despite the fact this movie was so dark and depressing, I rather enjoyed it. Perhaps I can identify with parts of it, I'm not sure, but whatever the case may be it was a beautifully melancholic film with a happier ending than you'd notice at first glance.<br /><br />The only part I didn't enjoy was the piercing violin music. The lack of score was more effective at setting the tone here, at least for me. It made the dialogue and background noise that much stronger and hard-hitting.
1439177791|5.0|a genuine account of what happens when you suffer in silence. the dark secrets of a terrible illness that is so often misunderstood; revealed in a candid and generously sincere format, without prejudice. very brave. great read.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Just wasn't impressed with this movie and I had high hopes for it.  The story seemed too fragmented - it all fit together, but it really spent too much time bringing in little plot twists, probably for some shock value, and they more they added made it less relative for me.  It earned two stars from me because I didn't turn it off because I was hoping for it to get better.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Another great season of SoA. Never want this show to end! I had actually stopped watching this season a quarter ways in because it wasn't all available on Prime, and just started again a couple days from now... The wait was certainly worth it, being able to watch the rest of the season straight through... So addicting! Not sure if I want to start watching Season 5, cause it my ruin my life :-)
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is a perfect fit for my kindle, nice looking, well-made and easy to use.  The kindle never needs to be removed from the case, not even when charging.  The strap keeps the kindle secure and when opened, the strap holds the kindle in place.  And I love the purple color!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I got a library copy 12 months ago and lost 9kgs in 5 months after struggling with every eating plan and supplement and working out at the gym - all the usual advice.<br /><br />So, very grateful to the Tim for finally shedding light on what was really going on with insulin resistance. And I didn't even implement the leveraged exercise plan in the book - that's next. In fact, lost weight without doing any exercise and without feeling deprived of food. Cheat day is wonderful, and I can postpone any cravings until then.
B000001ESJ|5.0|AND THE MEN WHO HOLD HIGH PLACES MUST BE THE ONES WHO START, TO MOLD A NEW REALITY, CLOSER TO THE HEART
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game. it was nerve wracking in the beggining. after you figure out how to find the clues each level is still fun
B007I2BZIE|5.0|a masterpiece that took me by surprise.  one of the best rush albums ever recorded and one of the best rock albums since 2000
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|This is a great album. I like to listen to this album to take me away from the always in a hurry life. It's very claiming and very likeable. I have recommended this album to all my friends.
B000001ESN|5.0|Spirit of the radio: one of their greatest songs and most played on the radio.  it never gets old. 5/5<br /><br />Freewill: again a popular radio song and it is played a lot for a reason. great guitar hooks. 5/5<br /><br />Jacobs ladder:  almost eight minutes of good stuff.  not one of their best works but still good. you might lose interest halfway through. 3/5<br /><br />Entre Nous:  A good lyrical song and great guitar work throughout 4/5<br /><br />Different strings: chill slower song. its good not great. 3/5<br /><br />Natural science:  One of rushs most epic songs.  Spanning over nine minutes and over three distinct parts this is a masterpiece. starts off a little slow but your patience will be rewarded.
1442362952|5.0|Loved this book.  The characters were well defined.  The book told a great story.  Can't wait to read book 2.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Loved the suspense! Great acting. Not gory in the typical sense, good story line, very creepy! I'm from New England, so it was kind of a &#34;my back yard&#34; story as well
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down. I kept seeing Matthew McCaughnehey and Ashley Judd in my mind's eye as Jake and Carla Brigance. I hope this one gets made into a movie with the same actors as A Time to Kill. It would be a definite watch for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading this, but very happy I decided to read this as well. The level of detail and getting to know what Katniss is thinking and what motivates her is amazing and adds a new layer to the story I hoped reading the book would reveal. Highly, highly recommend!
B00F0MNAZA|5.0|I was always going to like Kickback City. I've been a Rory Gallagher fan since I first heard him back in the 70s, I am a comic fan and I love crime fiction. So I was biased from the start. But here is the thing, I had high expectations and they have been completely surpassed.<br /><br />In all the years of listening to Rory's music I don't think I have every listened that closely to the lyrics. At least not in this way.<br /><br />When I got the box set the first thing I did was listen to the story whilst flicking through the book. It is just a novella so it lasts less than an hour. I am not a great fan of audio books but the story held my attention not only because Ian Rankin does a good job but also because of the great visuals from Timothy Truman in the book and Aidan Quinn really sells the part. You can have a lot of fun listening for song lyrics and titles as you go through.<br /><br />But the best for me came from reading the book listening to the &#34;sound track&#34; There was something quite surreal to doing this and I found myself in stages totally immersed in either the story or the music.<br /><br />As a result I have now spent a number of hours going through all of my old Rory albums really listening to them and paying attention to the lyrics in a way that I never have before. It's like I'm rediscovering him all over again.<br /><br />This is a fantastic collection. If you are a Rory Gallagher fan you will love this box set. It you are just starting to become aquanted to his music then this is a perfect place to start.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|What a fantastic album! It most definitely is a great follow-up to Black Radio. Get it, get it, GET IT!
B00EDCI5IU|5.0|Not normally a fan of female singer -songwriters, but downloaded The Curse after listening to the audio clip. After hearing the whole song, I went to Youtube to listen to the other songs. Found that I enjoyed 5 more that were on the CD, headed back to Amazon, and happily paid $5.00 for the whole thing. Extremely pleased with my purchase as I feel that an artist with this much potential should be financially encouraged.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first two novels of this series. And I looked forward to reading it for so long.
0802473156|5.0|Its a pretty fast read and has a lot of good things to say. Communication is probably one of the most important aspects in any relationship, so give it a read! Learn how you communicate and what love language you (and others!) speak!
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is a great set. They did a great job with the 3d version on this. The only thing was that they added extra scenes from the original version that my wife was not crazy about other than that its a great buy!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Terrible from beginning to end, especially the end. What was the beginning all about????<br />It looks to me like it was written in a hurry. Just bad, bad, bad
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|This film is over the top - visually dazzling.  But that doesn't mean the story held together.  The use of modern music, obviously to appeal to younger viewers of today, takes great license with history and the era it was portraying.  The music was so uncharacteristic of the period that it seriously dented the success of the film.  Wasn't Jay-z an investor with this film?  Of course, its all about him.
1451626657|5.0|Always a favorite book of mine, since time immortal (or high-school). Now over a decade later I re-read it, in the middle of a war.<br /><br />A book about the absurdity of war traveling with me through Afghanistan – a pistol on one hip, a rifle over my shoulder, and Catch-22 in my cargo pocket.<br /><br />Over a decade was too long for a re-read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's very addicting but not so time consuming.  Having to wait for results can be frustrating if you are not a patient person.  Would advise anyone to play this game.  The only thing is that I am playing on a Kindle which is not supported by the DragonVale team so I have had some glitches and issues but I like the game so much that I put up with the minor irritations.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I find it works better/more responsive than the built in miracast feature on some tvs.  Will be even better when it supports more apps.  For the price you can't really complain plus it's portable, should be able to use in hotel rooms.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|Great movie as always I would recommend this for anyone to see. Loving my prime subscription. That is all I have to say
B009KS4XRO|5.0|What a fun and adicting game. It does freeze from time to time. It doesn't bother me as I'm playing for fun not for money!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I think this album is one of the best Korn albums out to date it goes up there with follow the leader and life is peachy albums
B006O6F932|5.0|This was the &#34;check-mate&#34; at Christmas!  Grandma even outdid Mom at Christmas for this great gift!  11 year old girl set it up and played with it quietly the whole day and many days afterwards.  She still has it set up in her room almost a year later, and she remembers that I bought it for her, and thanks me all the time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! Every time I think that's it I giving it up, it reels me back in. So addictive but awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle escape game. Not too hard not too easy, I will look forward to seeing more levels. It is too short!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I like this game very much but I wish I was able to zoom in. Another thing I don't like is that if you don't click on a small item right off, you get a penalty. Other than that, it's a lot of fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I saw the movie before reading Hunger Games, I found the book exciting and for the first time in years read a book for the fun and entertainment in less than a week.<br /><br />HUNGRY for more!
B009WUBERW|5.0|The movie was good... All the actors come together & play their part well in the movie.Recommend you watch it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|what happened to the old screen. can't read the weather easily. I can't go back easily. And the app now constantly freezes.What a waste. Time to find another app. Oh; I forgot to mention the irritating constant videos.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this on my computer but finally got it on my Kindle Fire and I love it! Plays basicalliy the same. This game is addictive!!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Written with such beauty and knowledge. I enjoyed every step of the way. Highly recommend  I too question as she does.
B002ZG976U|3.0|Eye Candy?  That is almost a given.  Christina Aguilera's voice is definitely an instrument that is a force unwilling to be ignored, but a number of the selections left me wanting more.  I actually wanted more background/interactions - particularly involving Cher and Stanley Tucci (he is the CONSUMMATE Supporting Actor).  If you happen to see it during a lazy weekend as you are scanning channels - feel free to take in the sights, but don't feel disloyal should you be reminded of something else to do.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Don't buy this book - a great novel written by a detestable man. Orson Scott Card's views on human rights, specifically homosexual rights, are as narrow minded and revolting as his book is mind blowing and amazing. It's truly unbelievable that a book series with the type of empathy and gravitas about the sanctity of life as this came from such a bigoted and ignorant mind. Do not support him, do not buy his books.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Um, heck to the yes this met my expectations! Bad Blood is an awesome CD and Bastille is such a great band. The quality of the CD was awesome (i.e. the packaging).
B00G32OER4|4.0|Geez....[[ASIN:B004742Y68 Poltergeist]] got a PG and The Conjuring got an R? Either the MPAA hates The Conjuring Director James Wan or this movie just scared the pants off of the folks at the MPAA. Okay, granted that times have changed since 1982, and the MPAA is a lot tougher than it used to be. But there is more grittiness, language, adult content and gore on some prime time TV these days than there was in The Conjuring. (But I don't want to write [another] review about my differences with MPAA ratings; if you want to see my rant about that you can find it in the 3-star reviews for [[ASIN:B002SAMMME This Film is Not Yet Rated]].)<br /><br />The Conjuring has some genuinely frightening and yell out loud scenes. The story is well-written and flows quickly at just over an hour and a half. The story follows a husband and wife team of paranormal hunters that are introduced to a family that is being haunted by some mean spirited...well...spirits.<br /><br />This is not a movie to watch at night alone. If you do you'll be creeped out for sure. This is a fun group-movie to nervously laugh with everyone after the scenes where you all scream out loud together.<br /><br />The Conjuring is a great movie that should have gotten a PG-13 to better its box office take.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game soo much. It is fun and challenging at the same time. You will get addicted very fast.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|i am reading this to my eight year old twins.  We like it enough to continue, but not as much as percy jackson series.  There is more teenage romance, fewer loving adults, and less fidelity to the original myths.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I never read &#34;The Shining&#34; but certainly will now. I loved the characters as they have evolved. Danny is a complex yet flawed human who rises to the occasion when all depends on him, The young lady scares me and is truly a force to be reckoned with. Her interaction with Uncle Danny is amazing. Quite well written causing some unpleasant dreams of Rose the Hat.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Easy to install.... beautiful and durable case! Love the color The best case I have used. I highly recpmmend it.

B004T4KQJS|3.0|I don't know that I'm convinced by Krauss, that the Universe came from nothing; maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it.  Krauss makes some compelling arguments, and there is a lot more in the book than just what the title declares.  This is a good book to have in the science section of your virtual library.  He's a fairly good writer (not great) and you will be entertained by science if nothing else.  For me, a much more satisfying book, was The God Particle, by Leon Lederman, however,  why read one when you can read two for twice the price?
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I LOVE this game! I had it on a previous laptop and I was unhappy when I traded Up to a new Windows 8 Model that the polar bowler would not play:( Then I was cruising my kindle fire for books and apps and discovers much to my delight POLAR BOWLER! I down loaded it and began playing. I was very pleasantly surprised to see a nicer clear crisp rendering of on of my favorite games of all time.... Now If I could just get MAX PAYNE 1 AND TWO I Would be in heaven!<br />I highly recommend Polar Bowler, (especially if you suck at actual bowling like I do.)<br />Love it LOVE it LOVE IT!!!!!!
B004YESKU0|5.0|What a great price on one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. This band uses often times melodic, often times raspy metal, and often times quick rap-style lyricism behind a playful but demanding metal sound.<br /><br />In this box set you'll find their self-titled album from before their major successes, with memorable songs like Sugar, to Toxicity, their first major commercial success with such hits as Aerials, and Chop Suey. Then comes Steal this album with anti-establishment anti-authority songs like Mr. Jack. To cap off the entire discography of studio albums, you'll find the separately released double albums Hypnotize and Mesmerize.<br /><br />The packaging on this set is different to be sure, but the best part is getting an excellent bands entire discography into  your digital library for a low price.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|My nephew introduced me to this game and got me hooked. Definitely worth the free download. Happy hunting! Extra word, extra word
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It was interesting.  I enjoyed the references to France, and the French language. The story could have moved quicker. It didn't keep my attention. I felt forced to keep reading.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This is a very good book. It has an odd writing style but still easy to read.  Would I recommend thus book? Yes, I would.

B004JMY312|5.0|Awesome movie.. If you like classic movies, this one is the one to watch. It has always been a long favorite of mine.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a popular book, so I can't imagine my review of it will be relevant to your decision, but I must say this book is amazing. It's very fast paced and keeps you flipping page after page until the very end. I read this in two days, expecting to not finish it before I trekked off to the movie today, but I couldn't stop reading. Ender's Game is a phenomenal read, well deserving of all its hype. I especially loved how it didn't dumb down its young characters, it was extremely well written. Orson Scott Card being a jerk or not, the man can surely write.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|One of my most favorite games ever! I have always and will always love it! :D<br /><br />Graphics are pretty neat too
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Entertaining and a better plot than the others, making it a good choice if you are seeking a movie for a mixed crowd of scifi, action, and rom-com fans of all ages.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Special effect were good, story line good, movie idea good. Overall the movie was better than expected. We'll worth watching.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This was one of the best family movies out in a long time, plus I live in Denver so watching in the theater was awesome!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun game no problems at all like the mobs of dead people try to out do yourself and see how many people you can kill
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game to play when I just want something to do, plus I am hooked on trying to get all the stars
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Disappointed.  After waiting a few years for another blockbuster, I thought this was okay, but nothing to get excited about.
B009Q6ADG0|3.0|This cd was as discribed in the sellers discription.  I haven't decided if I like Adele music. I will listen to it again.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it had held closer to  the book.  The format of the book was superb.  It was in the form of an &#34;after-action  report&#34;.  That would have made the movie much more compelling.  Still, on its own, it was very good.
B008OOYALE|2.0|waste of money.....for me anyway. I did not like this. For younger people I'm sure. I'll stick to what I know and already like best.
B00BJKYM40|4.0|Good story, lovely characters, a neat little piece of extra-terrestial anthropology. Well worth a second reading. Indeed, it will in due course merit a third reading.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Ever since I heard of Malala's being shot a year ago, I have wanted to hear the full story. Her book gives the details of life in the Swat Valley, including how her family had struggled to live out their belief that ALL children should be educated, not just male children, long before the rest of the world heard of Malala. She is an extraordinary young lady by any standards, and that fact becomes crystal clear in the book.  Absolutely inspiring, this book is good for young or old to read.
B000W178XO|4.0|Although I have most of the tunes in this collection somewhere or another.  For the price, it was worth it to download to my phone.  Lot's of JC classics and some of the American Recordings tunes as well.  Actually, I didn't own Rusty Cage before buying this and his version of the Soundgarden song absolutely rips.  Also, I really like &#34;early&#34; version of When the Man Comes Around probably better then the one released on American IV.<br />On the downside, I just skip over the Highwaymen song. While I have respect for the 4 gentlemen involved, the whole project was really just your typically 1980's overproduced garbage.  One Piece at a Time doesn't really belong on here either.  It's jokey tone is all well and good, but definitely does not hold up with the rest of this material.  If you got rid of those two songs, I would probably give this review five starts.<br />So, it's not exactly what I would choose if I was making a Johnny Cash mix tape, but pretty darn close.  If you don't feel like compiling your own CD' or if your looking for an intro to Johnny Cash album, this is a pretty good bet.
B005HEVBGG|3.0|Was my first episode . It was good ! Not really into sci fy stuff but it kept my interest . Sort of funny too .
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Another great season of Zombies & really good story telling. Great bunch of actors. I am one of these people who for the most part do not like TV horror opposed to film. This show is an exception as was The X-Files. Keep it coming.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|If you love Les Mis, and you want more than just the &#34;major&#34; songs, then this is the album for you!
1476727651|5.0|Another great story by the story teller himself. Interesting take on the continuing life of Danny Torrence. If you read King, do not see how you would not enjoy this book.
0061969656|3.0|I really like the previous books in this series, I've re-read them all multiple times. I found &#34;Death of Kings&#34; was not as good, even confusing at certain points. I felt it lacked something compared to the previous books, no interest in re-reading it, wish I hadn't paid extra for the hardcover edition.
B00G32TD98|3.0|I love a good ghost story, but like this movie, nowadays they generally start out good, then revert to nothing more than unrealistic CGI. Episodes of the TV show Supernatural are more interesting than this movie. What ever happened to intelligent horror? All the goofy CGI does not scare me at all. It is the psychological stuff that keeps me from sleeping afterward. A couple good examples are The Legend of Hell House (1973; with Roddy McDowall) and The Changeling (1980 with George C. Scott), and more recently, The Others (2001 with Nicole Kidman). I have watched these movies a few times and still get the creeps.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Rip off of MIB, not very original. Mediocre CG scenes. Not much of an acting stretch for Bridges, he could have done True Grit and RIPD at the same time with just a wardrobe change.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It worked and had zoomable maps to drill down to more specific locations on the radar maps along with 10 day forecast off the bat.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|What a great movie. I hope they make a sequel.<br />I've been pushing it on my friends and almost dressed up as Dredd for Halloween , but the costumes are to expensive.<br />I recommend this flick. If you are worried about the similarities with Sylvester Stalone's Dredd- DON&#34;T worry , this has nothing to do with it and its a lot closer to the comic book Dredd.<br />Great job on this one movie-making-people.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was a great read, hard to put down. Kept you guessing and a good book for any book club
0451529065|3.0|Hard to read, but is a good copy of Darwin's work. My husband understood it more than I did. Copy was immaculate.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|This is definitely one of their best albums in years. Backspacer was good, but this one shows even more maturity and variety. I am a longtime PJ fan, so I'm naturally biased. This album definitely shows how PJ will be on the scene, filling up stadiums, for a very long time indeed.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I thought Christopher Nolan gave us an excellent movie.  I thought the line up of actors was superb.  We all know how Bruce Wayne lost his parents but this put more of a human aspect as to how it affected Bruce's behavior.  Though I thought some of it dragged a little at times over all I thought it was a good action moving movie.<br /><br /> I usually do not like films that seem to be filmed in a dark atmosphere but this one seemed to be filmed in a manner that it was easy to see and distinguish what was occurring.<br /><br />After watching this I noticed it was over 2 hours long but it didn't feel like the movie was actually that long, to me.  I know everyone has their own preference for what type of movie they like and I really wondered if I would  even like this one.<br /><br /> I wouldn't have any problem suggesting someone watch this movie.  Well done and as far as I'm concerned i feel the filming was superb.
0804121095|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for a few years, and I was not disappointed! Atwood is in true form with this work of art. It continues the wonderful story she started with Oryx & Crake and The Year of the Flood. If you're into post-apocalyptic literature and are tired of the same old same old, read Atwood's material!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I still gave this a 5 star because of the story line and because of the special effects that was used in filming of this movie.  I think I liked Batman Begins a little better than this one.  Overall the acting was still superb and I will be watching it again.<br /><br />People complain about how dark it is but than that is when Batman does his crime fighting,  at night.  Still this filming is done in such a way you can see clearly what is occurring.  It is not an over bearing darkness that hinders seeing what is going on.  I've seen movies filmed where the darkness over takes the scene and it is hard to distinguish what is going on.  This is not one of those movies.
B005HESLUA|5.0|My personal favorite of the Star Trek series. It has the characteristics of the original series (Federation ship on its own in deep space), but the action and well developed story line expected of a more recent tv show.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When it worked, it was great. Then it would not update and is stuck in an update. Google provides ZERO support on how to correct the problem or ways to ask for help. Now I own a $35 piece of plastic.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I have watched this movie a few times and I have to admit, I do enjoy it. At first, I thought it was a little cheesy and I felt like the writers were trying to give Mylie Cyrus an angry girl, rebellious part that turned out to be a little corny, but overall, it was pretty good. The music was great and the story line was moving.
0062238868|5.0|FIRST, I WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF CHRIS'S MURDER ON FEBRUARY 2, 2013 WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO HELP A VET WHO SUFFERED FROM PTSD.  I FEEL SORRY FOR TAYA AND THE KIDS WHO WILL GROW UP NOT KNOWING THEIR DAD.    This is a riveting account of the perils of war in the words of the SEAL with the highest kill total. It tells the story of what it takes to become a SEAL and then how that intense training pays off. It is kill or be killed and our SEAL put everything on the line to protect our troops and dispatch the bad guys. In some cases they loose a man, a brother and it is not easy for them to take but take it they must to protect the rest. You have to remember that the bad guys would just as quickly kill them or other American soldiers. This is nasty work that needs to be done. Yes he seems to enjoy killing but it is killing that must be done. You or your brothers die or he dies, which would you prefer if it was you? Yes he killed a lot of men that needed to be killed.    If you like this book you must read: Lone Survivor. The story of the only member of SEAL Team 10 to survive in Operation Redwing. These guys also save civilians who are in danger such as Jessica Buchanan in another book I highly recommend: Impossible Odds and Captain Phillips in A Captain's Duty, which I have not yet read or seen the movie.    If you hate America and what it stands for then these are not the books for you. If you don't like to read about the terrible things that happen in war, then this is not the book for you. I love America even if I don't agree with everything that it does and I still back the men fighting to protect us from terrorism at home or in foreign lands.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|this is fine drama. compelling cast, well shot, fairly well written. an updated manchurian candidate of course, but nonetheless watchable. hard to believe the locations are charlotte nc. a real tribute to location scouts
0316044695|5.0|I felt the first half of the book was a little slow but very interesting. It goes into much detail about what it takes to become a SEAL. It shows you the hell they have to endure and also how it can pay off. They learn how to deal with terrible conditions that they can find themselves in.  The  second half of the book is very riveting. A terrible fire fight between four Navy SEALS and approximately 60 to 100 Taliban attacking them from the top of a cliff. These four SEALS manage to kill about 50% of the Taliban forces attacking them with a very high kill ratio. Then one by one they all get hit. Three fighting to their very last breath. One manages to get out only to run into three more, one of which shot him. He manages to kill all three then gets help and later torture while being nursed. He literally goes through the worst hell imaginable. This is a must read if you enjoy these types of books. It is also very interesting and unbelievable that he could get help from Afgani's who live with the sight of Taliban every day. Sure Marcus is very full of himself but he earned the right to be. If you like this book then read: American Sniper and Impossible Odds. You will love them.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is for me one of the most profound spiritual teachers of all times and this book shows it all!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's third book was the saga of a family. Once I got used to the introduction of new characters, it was engrossing. Each character had their own story, like a mini-book...it had a surprise ending. I recommend the book.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There was a lot of hype for the Chrome and for $35 we decided to try it.  Its cheaper than a roku or other device, but really has limited use at this point.  So far there are just a few services that you can use to project onto your TV:  (1)  Netflix streaming, which has very limited programs (2) Pandora, which can be steamed to a tablet or other device (as you don't watch it); (3) hulu (we don't have this) and (4)  google play (where you need to buy the movies).<br /><br /> You can also show your chrome browser on your TV, BUT, this can only be done from a laptop, not a tablet.  I tried to watch movies in Amazon Prime through the chrome browser using Chromcast, but it always kicks out errors.  If there was an Amazon Prime app for Chromecast, It would be amazing-- but without that it really just provides another way to view the internet or a means to watch very limited program or use apps that aren't great.
B000002H97|3.0|The product description says &#34;Label: Elektra / Wea&#34; but it is not! Seller sent me the VERTIGO version. I bought this one because I was searching for the original black disc (I mean...the cd itself is black. Yeah, I know that those discs were produced several years ago but I was trying to get the original one). Well...now I have two copies of the same disc....If you are looking for the original black CD ...your wasting your time! , unless you buy a used one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Fabulous first person writing and very authentic feel to it with regard to mental illness. I cared so deeply about the writer that it was almost painful.....but mostly just very poignant and lovely. What a great read!
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I was waiting for this movie...and the wait was worthy! I guess this is one of the best Metallica performance: it's clean, flawless and at the right speed. It is well known that Lars always speeds up all songs on stage, but now they did it very well. I will enjoy this soundtrack till the last second!<br /><br />Review update:<br /><br />The CD box is pretty cool. It comes with a logo stencil for paint over any surface. Audio quality it's really cool. I'am Metallica fan and I must say that despite there is no new material in this new release I'm very glad to have it. I hope they release a new album soon!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved this -- good, solid storytelling, with well developed characters that you can really care about. I didn't want this book to end!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great movie based on a true event,<br />LOL kidding but a great movie before all the digital special effects have made movies just something to look at.<br />A little cornet but a classis that never goes old.<br />If you enjoy Sci-Fi movies this is a must own movie.
1611762359|4.0|This was an exceptional novel about barriers of class in England and handling extreme disappointment both in relationships and the viccitudes of life. The  overriding subject of &#34;The right to die&#34; was ultimately less important than  really seeing another person for who they are and not falling back on stereotypes.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|This review is based on the production, not the music itself. The album is flat in a number of areas. This might be stylistic, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to intentionally distort what would otherwise being a very strong sonic experience.
B00FPH6PRK|4.0|Excellent. A couple slow parts. But the scares were placed perfectly!<br />Great movie! Just make sure you don't forget to breathe!.....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is awesome game and very fun but it can make you very mad sometimes also, I rate it 5 stars.
0061950726|5.0|I felt the fear, the hunger, the insults of the child in this saga, and the same emotions of the teenager who later comes in to complete the experience of being tossed on the waves of loss and rejection of the security and love that we all should be able to experience in life.  A very satisfying story of two women who survived such loss and rejection.  I could hardly put it down, right from the first page.
B00G32OER4|4.0|This was an amazing movie!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it did start out a little slow. Once it started to get more intense, it kept us on the edge of our seats.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Just as good as a Time to Kill! I hope he writes more with the same characters! A series would be wonderful!
1781162646|2.0|Purchased this used, but it was in excellent condition. I have pretty much read everything Stephen King has written, and am disappointed from time to time. This was one of the disappointments. King seems to always have a 'showdown' in his novels. His character development and descriptions are still second to none, but this book was a bit tired, and for a King reader i had the feeling of 'been there, done that'
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Nothing new here<br />There literally hundreds of books like this. Two good friends strongly suggest I buy it. I'm sorry I did. It's silly pap
B0091REZMW|5.0|Haven't came across ny problems. It does take a little bit for life to build back up but that's about it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is addicting!!!  It was kind of hard to get going but once you do it is a lot of fun.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY...THIS IS MOTORHEAD....Fast--loud-rock n roll...CD IS VERY COOL...MOTORHEAD STILL ROCKS..MOTORHEAD HAIL FROM ENGLAND...OLD SCKOOL NEW SCHOOL.LIKE MOTORHEAD GET THIS CD.
193700788X|1.0|So badly written, so many stupid plot lines that meant nothing.  And the wrap-up was beyond uninteresting.  From a clever and very entertaining first 10 books (downhill after that), she went to blah blah land on this one.  Would someone please rewrite a better story/ending?  One that makes sense, and one that makes the romance part exciting?<br /><br />+SPOILER+<br /><br />Sam is boring.  I expected a much more clever use of the magic around Sookie.  As others have said, it's like the Fae thing just stopped counting, and Sookie was left with blah blah nothing.  Don't read the companion btw - it is even worse!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|JASON NEWSTED is awesome on bass also bas ass singer as well.Music is tight  and heavy...ALSO PLAYED IN VOLVOID AND METELLICA
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I am a \\"sometimes\\" Grisham fan.  I blazed through The Firm and The Pelican Brief--couldn't get enough of the guy.  Then, however, I stayed up all night in a small tent at Zion National Park reading by flashlight to finish The Chamber, and that's when my love-hate relationship with this writer began.  As an author, Grisham is all over the map (almost literally--remember Playing for Pizza?).  He is capable of writing the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.<br /><br />Sycamore Row isn't all bad; some of it is even good fun.  Sadly, I felt the ending was downright ugly.<br /><br />I am not going to recap the plot (others have done that quite well here) or reveal any spoilers, but I will say that I simply could not feel the \\"shock and horror\\" the folks who viewed Ancil Hubbard's videotaped deposition did.  We know something is coming (and many of us can predict close to what that ends up being), but I simply didn't feel the end delivered the promised punch.  Maybe that's because it's been done before and in much better fashion.<br /><br />In the year that debuted Django Unchained and Twelve Years a Slave, I continue to scratch my head in wonder that most Americans have not read the best treatment of our black/white controversy, Beloved, by Toni Morrison. [[ASIN:1400033411 Beloved]] Oprah sought to enlighten us all by starring in the film version.  TIME magazine hyped the movie in a big cover spread, but white Americans did not go see it.  No doubt, they heard from some of their friends that it was confusing and upsetting.  Indeed.  Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel contains the shock, horror, and magnificent awe that Grisham could only dream of achieving when writing about the repercussions of slavery.  Please read Morrison's novel or watch Oprah in the movie.[[ASIN:0788815474 Beloved]]  It will be a harrowing experience, but you will come away with a much better understanding of the long-term effects of slavery.<br /><br />I end with a caveat:  Grisham and Morrison are writing in two different categories of fiction.  She represents the classics, and he weighs in for pulp fiction. It's unfair of me to compare the two; thus, I will conclude that you'll probably enjoy Sycamore Row a lot more than Beloved.  I liked revisiting the town and characters from A Time to Kill but was disappointed by the predictable climax/denouement.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Battery sucker and annoying.  I deleted it after 48 hours.  Just wasn't worth the battery drain.  Not sure what I expected but this wasn't it
B001GF7WRW|5.0|These headphones are light and comfortable and provide awesome sound quality.  The cord on one side is convenient and does not catch like traditional headphone cords.  The ear pads are comfortable and stay comfortable during long periods of use.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works just like every other Twitter app with no issues and very RARE app crashes.  I highly recommend this app.
0143122916|5.0|The book description: \\"A gripping, terrifying memoir with a searing sense of place, Escape from Camp 14 will unlock, through Shin, a dark and secret nation, taking readers to a place they have never before been allowed to go\\", says it all.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Arrived quickly and brand new.  Exactly what my son was wanting to add to his lego minecraft collection for this birthday.  I'm very pleased and highly recommend this set!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I can't begin to describe how much Allie's book and blog have made me cry with laughter.  It's hilarious and touching, and so true that it almost hurts.  The chapters \\"Thoughts and Feelings\\" and \\"Identity Part One and Part Two\\" are incredible because they're raw and poignant while still being incredibly funny. I honestly want to buy this book for everyone I know who has struggled with depression, anxiety or just the idea that they're not exactly who they want to be, but keep trying to work on it.  Allie reminds us that we're not alone, and that is priceless.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app version is a little quirkey compared to the app for the iPhone/iPad.  Slow to load newsfeed and won't load a very long newsfeed history but it works in a pinch.  Just wish I could game from it too.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Tells me what I want to know  without excess info and helps me to see clearly and quickly how stocks are performing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was thrilled when I saw this game finally came to the Kindle! I actually prefer to play here than on any other device, especially since you can save your lives people send instead of losing them. Thanks Amazon and King!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The initial 9 or 10 chapters hop around in back story, but if you can make it through, you will be SO glad you did. I read nearly 3/4 of the book in a day, because I simply couldn't put it down. Excellent character development and a great story. I was very impressed with how King was able to make this Danny a completely different character altogether, and didn't rely on sentimentality from The Shining. I have recommended this book to numerous co-workers (and we all work in a Hospice House- a total bonus!!!)
B00FJU1HLC|2.0|Dreamworks typically hits it out of the park but on this not so much.  The story was very slow and never really develops.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is the most suspenseful book I have read (so far) now it's time for the 3rd book. Super excited
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Cool in concept and price however unreliable in execution.  With Netflix, it frequently crashes on playback, though usually after a couple false starts, it eventually with play through your selection without further problems.  However, select another movie, the cycle often repeats itself.  Yo bad, since it otherwise is a neat device.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Very good author.  Can't wait to read more of his novels.  If you like Dan Brown, you will like James Collins.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best game in HISTORY,OMG!!!! I never wanted to rate this game because I was busy playin it.U should get this free game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent story set in Australia.  I didn't realize that it was set in Australia and at first was confused with the langauge.
B004SEUJ0K|1.0|Brett Ratner shouldn't be allowed near another Marvel movie again!  This adaptation continues where X-Men 2 left off, but then it totally deviates from the source material and almost destroyed the franchise, not to mention Xavier, Jean Grey, & Scott Summers. This film is the equivalent of what Schumacher's  'Batman & Robin' was to the Batman franchise.  With the upcoming 'X-Men Days of Futures Past' movie, Bryan Singer is basically having to do damage control and write in conditions that allow them to bring Xavier back after Ratner vaporized him.  Even X Men origins Wolverine, which wasn't great was exponentially better than this film.  If you are a fan of the X Men source material, just totally skip this movie.  It isn't worth even watching once.  The acting performances were decent, but the story is horrible and the ending will make you never want to watch this film again.  It's that bad.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my Fella. We were watching a special on TV about the LeMans and he said something about this movie and said he had only seen it once and wished he had a copy. I went straight to Amazon...of course...Boom there it was.
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean is clearly the book that I use daily to run our business. It's full of practical tips that changed my point of view about running a startup.
B009NX50DM|4.0|It was enjoyable 60's humor well done and laughable throughout.  Well acted and funny. The plot was believable, well conceived and nicely directed.
0307271080|4.0|A well written book, full of sparkling wit and deep insight (particularly for non-minority, non-immigrant readers). As a minority, immigrant reader, I was amazed at how much African and an Asian immigrants share in terms of experiences when they come to the US.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me is that the main character, Ifemelu, is not likeable. I found her to be insecure, mercurial, obnoxious, judgmental, and just plain snarky. I am guessing she is the author's in-book alter ego, which is fine, but the character is over the top unrealistic. If Ifemelu is not racist, she is at the very minimum, absurdly race-sensitive.<br /><br />I did find the character of Obinze to be agreeable, complex, and interesting. I just don't see a real-life Obinze getting, and staying, happily married with a real-life Ifemelu...<br /><br />A thought-provoking, interesting read, full of relevant insights on contemporary culture.
B00C68JXAW|5.0|I loved this movie when it was released and it still holds the same value for me.  Sean Connery nailed his last role as James Bond.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Mr King is right when he says that nothing can live up to a great scare but I found this book to be interesting. I have always loved the shining and was thrilled to catch up with and revisit the memories of at least one of the characters. I say it's a must read for fans.
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|Decent plot. Good action, excellent f/x. No unnecessary vulgarity. No gratuitous sx scene.  Long movie, but no scenes I would have cut
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is addictive. So far I've been able to play without spending any money so that's a plus. I also like the fact that objects aren't always in the same place so I don't get bored.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|Let me start by saying the I loved Outliers, The Tipping Point and Blink by Mr. Gladwell and devoured them in short order, feeling that I learned much in the enjoyable process of reading them.  David and Goliath simply did not do for me what his previous works did.  I feel the premise - that what may appear to be a competitive disadvantage can actually foster coping mechanisms that create an advantage in the longer term - to be an interesting concept and well worth the analysis.  I don't feel that this premise was worth this entire book.  I am not certain where the chapter long discussion about crime and punishment at the end comes from in relation to the overall theme.  A relationship may be there and I am simply choosing not to find it, but I felt that the discussion of mandatory sentencing guidelines was out of whack with the overall premise of the story and was added to somehow make the book longer. We moved from battling enemies that are, on the surface, stronger than us; coping with losing a father in childhood; dealing with learning disabilities as a youth - to a discussion about the incredible loss suffered by two families and the sentencing guidelines that don't produce the required results intended by them. What connection am I missing??  Will I read another of Mr. Gladwell's books in the future?  Undoubtedly.  I will be an avid reader of his next effort, if or when that occurs.  Will I purchase the hardcover version of David and Goliath to sit in my library next to the other three works of his that I own?  No.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|A little one dimensional but still fun. Not quite a tower defense game but more an old school land battle.
B00G32TD98|5.0|If you are looking for a classic, creepy story with some scenes that will make you jump, then this is the way to go.
B002APU580|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all times.<br />I could watch it over and over again. Also, great distribution. Love it!
B00459EZLW|4.0|It is challenging to review a season of a show that ended without a proper story arc/climax and ending. Also, being that it is the second season, it would have been nice to see something other than the constant struggle to survive and repetitive issues amongst the crew. Even battles seem like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu so much that they aren't as exciting. I'm still giving it 4 stars, because it sparked the curious scientific part of my mind and went deeper than most shows in a few episodes.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Wonderful collection of new songs.  Good to hear Rod writing lyrics again.  This is a great adult contemporary collection for any listener.
1451695195|5.0|The  book is well written, provides a personal perspective of an area of study that is intriguing. Enjoyed the book.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|This is a great collection for the very devoted fan.  There are wonderful alternate versions of 60's and 70's classics and deep-cuts, but it won't hold much interest for the casual listener.  If you want 'classic Rod,' pick up Time or a greatest hits album.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This was a really good movie. I love everything that Denzel stars in. He knows how to really become his characters. My only regret is not seeing this  movie as soon as it came out. This is definitely a movie to add to your collection.
B005K15SPG|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my wife.  The bonus live album is excellent and captures the essence of the Mumford and Sons.
B00G32OER4|3.0|By what I had seen in the commercials for this movie with the audience jumping back in their seats apparently at certain scenes, I expected to be really shocked by at least some parts of this movie. There were some scenes that were pretty horific and others that were pretty disturbing, but nothing that lived up to the hype. Altogether, it was a reasonably scary movie and one to watch if only to say you've seen it. It is one of those movies I would watch again if it happens to be on and there is nothing else to watch.
B009RX7WTI|4.0|Love the show. Disappointed in the relationship between the two women. I hope next season they get back together. The

006202406X|2.0|Warning you may figure out the ending by reading this review.<br /><br />A friend suggested that I read Divergent.  Once I realized it was a trilogy and the 3rd book was not out yet I decided to wait until the 3rd book was released and read all three back to back.  I read all three over the course of 3 days.  I loved Divergent and Insurgent however Allegiant was incredibly disappointing, to say the least.  I felt extremely let down and not for the obvious reason.  I read as a means of escape like so many others do.  While I do not expect all sunshine and rainbows I also do not want to be invested in characters only for many of them to be killed off for meaningless reasons.  In this book I felt as if the characters I grew to hate were the ones who she chose to reward so to speak.  The dual POV did not work as I often had to go back to the start of the chapters to see whose POV it was written in since Tobias's and Tris's voices were written so similarly.  I also felt that the characters actions in this book were not believable in comparison to what I came to know of each of them in the previous novels. I love to loose myself in a great story and with a trilogy there is so much build up and investment and this book was not the payoff I had been hoping for.  Instead of feeling satisfied at the end I was left angry and felt like I had wasted my time investing emotionally in the characters.
1446249182|3.0|I previously had access to the older version of this book through the lab that I worked at, and finally decided to buy my own copy.  I kind of wish that I had bought the older verison - that one seemed to be much more concise in that it provided exactly the necessary information while remaining grounded in interesting dialog.  This newer version has substantially increased the amount of dialog and 'entertainment' to the point where it now seems to be too much (although I should point out that I don't actually have that older version to compare against the newer one - so my memory could be wrong).  It makes it difficult to actually weed out the important information from all of this background.<br /><br />The older version was great - go buy that one instead if you can find it!
B004499LWQ|5.0|A great movie in great Blu-Ray quality. The acting is magnificent and the story line is refreshingly original. A must watch for anyone who appreciates movies about how relationships are.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|You will for sure remember this book. It is not one of thoese infinite series that after two years you barely remember what it was about. As usual Khaled Hosseini produced a thrilling book with a lot of information that you continue to live with long after you finished the book.<br />My review is not 5 stars is only because i think this kind of story had to be at least twice longer in order to fulfill the idea and the expectations. On the other hand, the longer book would be regarded too complicated by some readers.<br />Bottom line: It's a \\"must to read\\" book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is one of the best aps that I have on my Kindle.  And who doesn't like free??  It functions very well!
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This is perhaps the second good science-fiction movie ever made, the first being Destination Moon. Many of the ideas behind this movie ended up on Star Trek. Some of the dialog even reappeared on Star Trek. It helped shape our notion about what a space opera movie ought to be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like playing this game, it is very fun. I don't understand the whole requesting and giving of lives though. That part is somewhat confusing.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Extremely addictive. I love the genre. What can be more fun than mutating your virus and wiping out the entire world.
B00005OCMR|5.0|TRON is not the main character in this Jeff Bridges movie, but Bruce Boxleitner plays him to perfection!  TRON is a program written to police the Master Computer.  When the Master Computer finds Flynn  (Jeff Bridges) looking for files to prove he was the creator and rightful owner of the company, he attacks.  Flynn is a real person reassembled inside a computer to sent to the game grid with other \\"troublesome\\" programs, to be deres'd (killed).  There are quite a few interesting programs found in the games, and Flynn and TRON are in a race to get the program TRON is carrying back to the real world and stop the Master Computer.  This movie was before its time when it first came out, with its computer aided graphics--it is simply good fun for all computer geeks and those who just like a good old fashioned good against evil type of flick!
B009VQ7ICW|5.0|I love all the Head First series of books. They provide a good jumpstart into whatever language you are interested in. They are written in a way that allows you to not only taste the subject matter but digest it as well.

B000P407K4|4.0|Peter Sellers, for me, is always fun to watch. Cool characters throughout. Fun story, with just enough bizarre to make this worth watching.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|No sound on Roku rental. Rented movie for 48 hours. Tried everything. Including powering down devices. Sound works on every other channel and device. No sound on this movie. Waited a day and tried again. Still no sound. If there was a place to report this I would have. I would like a refund.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|this was an excellent story, well acted, a surprising choice for Eastwood and very well directed, poignant but not maudlin,  and just possibly believable enough
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a handy device if you don't have a streaming device already. It's really simple. You pick what you want to watch on Netflix/ YouTube/ google play and direct it to play via the chromecast. I run it from my IPad and which I can turn off to conserve power with no hitch it stream. It's also really simple to set up as well. I only wish it was Amazon friendly.
B0000640VO|5.0|The cutest movie to watch when you are sitting home on a Saturday night! everything about this movie is enchanting to say the least. The way the colors present themselves and the way the story flows just melts you away. The director sets the story up in a way in which you feel like you know the characters personally. Buying this movie was one of the best idea's ive had in months!
B000YDAYW2|4.0|My fiance ordered these boots in a 10.5 Wide, his usual shoe size.  After receiving them and trying them on it was very evident that they run large but are true to width.  He ended up getting a size 10 Wide and they fit much better, still having room to wear thicker socks with them.  These boots look great with a pair of jeans and can be worn casually or even be dressed up.  My fiance loves these boots and raves about how comfortable they are.  The color did vary a little from the picture, they were a lighter brown than was shown but he ended up liking them more than the dark brown pictured. He ordered them in the burnished brown color.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ever since they made Candy Crush ive been waiting for it to come out and it finally did # :)
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I had a lot of trouble getting this movie to play on my pc.  I followed instructions, but they were unclear.  Amazon's description of their downloadable videos itself wasn't clear.  someone needs to do a better job telling consumers in an easily understood explanation what they are buying and HOW IT WORKS.  The tools a consumer needs to use should be easy.  The technical explanation of how to correct the situation was above my head.  Let's keep it simple for everyone folks!  user friendly companies make profit, right?
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This book was pretty good, John Green is a fantastic author. My favorite part of the book was at the end.

B005CAATXG|5.0|I like to shop at Christian supply for cheap music cds with positive messages.  I came across this and thought I'd give it a try.  I am beyond glad I did.  I've been needing something new to listen to and help me reconnect with what really matters.  I LOVE THIS CD.  When my brother heard it he had to have a copy to.  What amazing music.
1476727651|5.0|I thought this was a great sequel to The Shining - a book from which I did not really expect a sequel. But there is King for you - you don't really know what to expect! Thanks to whoever is in charge of great writers for that blessing. The scary parts were definitely scary, but the realistic parts (Danny as an alcoholic, the meetings, his struggles for sobriety) were scary for more than just this Reader, I'm sure. All in all - another excellent book....I just hate that I read so quickly and that new books come so slowly.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised. Netflix, YouTube and casting Chrome tabs works great.  However, casting a video from a Chrome tab is a bit laggy.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Very good movie and the blu ray cersion made it better. The extras are cool too. Muat have for a bruce lee fan
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written and kept me guessing for quite awhile.  Interesting story lines and well-developed characters.  The ending was quite a surprise.
0824835921|4.0|It took me one year to get through the book. In parallel I memorized every Kanji using Anki flashcards.<br /><br />It starts relatively easy with good stories to remember the Kanji.<br /><br />After about 2/3 of the book one has to invent his own stories. There it gets tough.<br /><br />When you are through with the book, you have an idea on how to look at the Kanjis and distinguish them. But you will still not be able to read Japanese books, but you will be able to guess the meaning of the sentence.

B009ZQFSRA|3.0|This movie has some thought provoking themes about strictly controlled societies and ethical standards.  It does ask questions typical of the best science fiction by taking a situation and stretching it to its extreme, in this case, creating a society that values peace so highly that it bans emotion, ending up suppressing that which is the greatest in humanity for the sake of preventing the worst.  Of course, it backfires. Although the actors are excellent, the movie falls short in its depiction of human character. There is only black and white, only gray.  People are either government zealots or rebels.  Stupid choices are made by the protagonists and antagonists that are unbelievable. In addition. the obvious statement against widespread use of psychoactive drugs to control behavior is paper thin.  Still, the movie is watchable and intriguing, the fight scenes well choreographed, and the overall setting grand and compelling. I watched to the end, and because I am a fan of science fiction in general that undertakes a close look at societal trends, I found it acceptable.
B005M5OSBK|4.0|Love the songs, but the sound quality isnt great. Maybe I should have bought the individual cd's. Go to their website and buy their dvd concert. its cheap and fun to watch.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I really did enjoy this movie, but felt very conflicted....with the alternative timeline they seem to be rewriting Gene Rodenberry's vision.  I know Gene and his lovely wife, Majel, are no longer with us (I do so miss her voice as the ships computer and I caught the reference that Nurse Chapel (Majel's original part) had been reassigned) and a fresh take on the story is always welcome......but how far can it be taken.  By changing ONE thing you start a domino effect that changes a whole lot of things - like Khan, it was originally Kirk that discovered him on the 5 year mission.  I know, I know - major Trekkie nerd freak out there - - but how much more could it change and how much more can it change Gene's message.<br /><br />I did love the references to some of the old episodes, I kept catching little bits here and there, like the ship they took to the Klingon world was a ship they got in the Mudd incident a few months before....and OMG a Tribble in sick bay - doesn't McCoy know better?!<br /><br />But these ALSO happened during the 5 year mission......and how can they explain how the Klingon's head are back to the Next Generation look (which Worf refused to talk about - have to be a hard core Trekkie to get that one) as opposed to how their head ACTUALLY looked when Kirk and the Enterprise encountered them when they were not part of the Federation?<br /><br />Okay, I know I just did a major geek out there and did a lot of nit picking - I'm not a purest, but I would really hate for the vision that Gene Roddenberry put into motion be lost for the sake of an rewritten future.  Remember every science fiction movie, once you do ONE THING that changes the future, it causes a cascade that effect.....and yes, I know just a movie and they can rewrite it so that cascade doesn't happen, but just saying, ya know.<br /><br />Now after ALL that nit picking, it is a very good movie, I recommend adding it to your collection if you are a Trek fan - it is well worth it.

006202406X|2.0|I have to admit that Divergent is one of my all time favourite books. I do not say this lightly, me being a huge bookworm. But I believe its plot is unlike anything I have ever read before, it is also one of the first Dystopian books I read and Veronica Roth executed it perfectly. Insurgent is not as good as the first book, however I still believe it maintained an interesting plot that delved further into how the society operated.<br /><br />I'm just going to start by saying that this is my first review ever for a book and I feel the need to write one because someone needs to be brutally honest about why this book is such a let down. When I first read Allegiant I told myself that I really enjoyed it because I had waited ages for it and finally had it in my possession but also because I loved the first two books and wanted to feel the same about the third. But then I read some reviews on Amazon.com and found myself agreeing a lot more with the negative than the positives ones.<br /><br />Spoilers!!<br />Firstly, I just want to point out that at first I didn't mind being in Tobias' head, I thought it would be a nice change to find out what his opinion was in certain situations. However, it was almost impossible to distinguish the two characters, both of them have the same way of thinking! There was hardly a contrast between the two protagonists so much that in the end it was annoying to be in Tobias' head. Also can I just say, what happened to the mighty Four with only four fears? Half the time he sounds like a whiny child that doesn't fully know what to do with his life. It is clear that Tobias is meant to be a leader and does not do well taking orders from people (as we already know with Eric from Divergent). Therefore it was unwise for Tobias to needlessly agree to join a dozen rebellions that were all as pointless as the previous one! Alternatively, since when did Tris turn into such a 'know it all'. She's worse than Hermione most of the time because her arrogance comes out of nowhere, in this book. Why does she all of a sudden feel the need to tell him what to do? Ridiculous!<br /><br />Secondly, I feel like the plot is lacking in excitement. While is was reading the book it felt rushed with pointless descriptions of people and places that weren't particularly relevant at that point in the story. I am sympathetic towards Roth because she had a deadline to meet but I feel as if her writing style took a 180 spin in the other direction. The style with which she wrote Divergent and Insurgent was perfect because the words flowed naturally and made sense. However, Allegiant is very muddled and some of it was a bit predictable. When Tris and Tobias aren't arguing for the umpteenth time, someone is planning a rebellion. If someone isn't planning a rebellion Tris is taking out her anger on someone (Caleb, Peter, Tobias).<br />Also, did Tris not come from Abnegation? How is it that she is so unable to forgive people for crimes they have committed 200 pages ago when she is no angel herself. What was the point of willingly going beyond the fence for a fresh start if Tris was just going to dwell on the past 99% of the time!<br /><br />Thirdly, I was hoping that the outside world would reveal a completely different society to the one Tris grew up in. Either aliens or a world of famine/disease in need of a cure, but all there is beyond the fence is more people in power making stupid decisions 'for the greater good'. Although, in this society the people who are Divergent are the favoured ones and everyone else is basically 'damaged' and are uncared for, left to starve and have to make their own living...sound familiar at all? Also, why did Roth decide to make Tobias non-divergent? What was the purpose of this but to cause another rift between Tris and Tobias? Who knows!<br />Tori's death while unexpected was in no way emotional. It was so unexpected, I forgot to be surprised or care. It was only after her brother was mentioned when I started to feel slightly sympathetic.<br /><br />Lastly, not only does it takes guts for an author to kill off the main character but it also needs to serve a purpose e.g. sacrificing oneself for the greater good, dying with your OTP to save the world etc. However, there was no true reason in Tris' death. It was as if Roth said to herself 'What will shock my fans the most? I know, a death! But not just any death it had to be Tris who not to mention has already been sacrificing herself a lot since the second book so it hardly came as a shock when she stepped in to die instead of her brother.<br /><br />Sometimes I'm a sucker for happy endings but I don't object to a meaningful death now and again e.g. Uriah's death or in the book Noughts and Crosses (if you haven't read it, you should). But Tris' death was in no way necessary. I think I speak for everyone when I say 'Tris and Tobias should be together'. Many people have said that it would have been more dramatic if her memory had been wiped or if Caleb had died. I prefer the latter but either way I wanted Tris alive.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell people not to read the book, especially if (like me) you have waited for this book for a very long time. But I will say, read Allegiant with low expectations that way you won't be disappointed by the anti-climatic ending.ed to feel slightly sympathetic.<br /><br />Lastly, not only does it takes guts for an author to kill off the main character but it also needs to serve a purpose e.g. sacrificing oneself for the greater good, dying with your OTP to save the world etc. However, there was no true reason in Tris' death.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|**Spoilers**<br /><br />The OCEAN at THE END of the LANE is the kind of book that stays with you long after you've read the last sentence. The story spotlights a disturbing aspect of the human condition: often, broken people can't be fixed. We recognize this in the nameless protagonist and in some people around us, but we fear it might also be true in our lives.<br /><br />The protagonist comes back to his childhood home for a funeral. We aren't sure who has died, but by the end of the book our best guess is that it's his father. After the services, instead of returning to his sister's home, he takes a drive and ends up at the farm at the end of the lane, which is where the duck pond/ocean was. Both the farm and the three women who live there are magic, filled with an ancient magic that goes back to a time before the earth was formed.<br /><br />The farm girl, Lettie, her mother, and grandmother befriend the protagonist when he was a lad of seven. The mother still lives on the farm and allows him to walk to the pond, where he sits and remembers what happened when he was seven-years-old.<br /><br />Two things are apparent almost from the beginning: the narrator/protagonist is unreliable, so we can't trust his judgment, and he is a broken, misfit. He's a friendless boy whose world becomes bearable through the books he reads.<br /><br />This is a story about how unfair, chaotic, and frightening childhood can be. It's about a lonely boy, living through a time when money is scarce, parents are inattentive and neglectful, and fantasy become more real than anything else. It's a story about how books and perhaps imaginary friends can help a child survive.<br /><br />Our hero is surrounded by strong women: the three farm women, who are strong, powerful, and protect him from the evil that has entered his world; his sister, who is an annoyance and has no clue the trouble he's in, but takes pleasure in making his life miserable; their new governess Ursula Monkton, who is an evil entity from another realm and tries to imprison, harm, and finally wants to kill him; the mother, who is mostly absent and inattentive.<br /><br />Ursula gives people what they want: money to those in hard times trying to make ends meet; sexual favors to the father; attention to the sister; freedom to leave the house to the mother. These gifts bring negative consequences. Ursula only wants to take from the protagonist--he was her entrance into this world, and she will use him or kill him as it suits her.<br /><br />The father is the second villain of the story.<br />What kind of father scoops up a seven-year-old boy and takes him to see a body? At first, I thought he was clueless. Later, I began to realize the father does not consider the needs of his son. Whatever the father's reason, the protagonist was traumatized by seeing their lodger's body after his suicide. It's the police officers, not the father, who suggest the boy go with Lettie away from the crime scene.<br /><br />The father's insensitivity foreshadows greater cruelty to come: a father trying to drown his son. Water imagery abounds in this book. The pond is really an ocean, and it's magic: it can heal, carry things out of the world, and bring things into the world.<br /><br />The bathtub scene reeks with the kind of terror and betrayal that scars someone for life. It's obvious that the father suspects that his son has seen something and will tell the mother about his affair with Ursula. In the end, even the father's death does not release the son from the brutality of his childhood.<br /><br />The story ends with the protagonist leaving the farm to return to his sister's house and re-enter the real world. As he moved away from the pond, he already starts to forget the story, that Lettie isn't in Australia but in the pond, that the farm is magic, that for a while he remembered. Lettie's mother knows he'll return, the reader knows, and at some deep unconscious level he knows. But for now, all his memories slide away as he returns to his adult world, the same broken man he was when he drove to the farm.ies slide away as he returns to his adult world, the same broken man he was when he drove to the farm.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Having read most of the previous agent Pendergast novels I expected a bit of the odd and unbelievable but there is usually enough believability in the plot to carry the rest of the story through. For me, not this time. If rating on story alone I would have given 1-2 stars but the writing (and the editing) were worth more than that.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|What a treat!  Every episode entertaining.  Every time we think we must have seen every show, one crops up that is not familiar.  Never disappointing.
1455809365|5.0|Fabulous set.  Listen to them in the car and the time just flies by.  Great voice and story interpretation.  Very positive experience.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have known about Lindsey for awhile, not as long as others, but have always loved her videos on you tube, and now being able to see her have an album out is a wonderful step forward.  Glad that she is staying independent and not having others tell her how to handle her own music.  That is what makes her so special is that she stands by her principles and does not let them get tarnished by what others want her to lower herself to.  Music that uplifts people is how I would describe this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|At times I found myself asking:  What do I care about the fate of these two juvenile 30 something adults?
B001E6X4W0|4.0|You can sympathise with the characters. The story is interesting. Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, TOM CRUISE. So many stars. Oh, and Kirsten Dunfst.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love this series!! Cried.. laughed.. and got angry!!! RIP Tris and all the good folks that died in the books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so thrilled that Candy Crush has finally come to Kindle!  Great game!  Hours of fun.  You have to pace yourself or, if you go too fast, it won't last:)
1439148813|5.0|A fantastic book, packed full of information from the expert point of view of one in charge on the ground
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book.  Like any Grisham legal novel, this book is hard to put down.  Great story and great ending.  I don't really consider this a sequel to a Time to Kill.  There are some of the same characters like Jake and Harry Rex but this story line has nothing to do with &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B000006OS2|1.0|Awful quality. So disappointed. Bought this as a gift for my dad and now I can't find my receipt to return it. Will be buying another DVD from best buy that is actually of good quality. Do not buy this!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|It's a good quick read in the series, but overall series is a little monotonous.  It needs a little more suspense, very predictable.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Now that &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is over, Walking dead is the most well written drama on television. The tension and care in the writing is intoxicating.
B003XDZNLW|5.0|Wanted to try Crocs, these feel so good on your feet !  I will be buying others, including one for the Hubby!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Loved Divergent and Insurgent, both of these had an excellent story arc, and I was excited for Allegiant, so I pre-ordered it. I have recommended this series to friends based on Divergent and Insurgent and feel like I have to stop doing so because of Allegiant. Roth switches from Tris to Tobias's perspective but they don't have distinct voices. The plot is terrible so I felt completely disappointed with the resolution (totally anticlimactic). Riddled with holes. Series totally fizzled.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved how the book was able to introduce then follow the lives of its characters, each traveling down such different paths only to find that in the end, no matter what opposing directions they all travelled, they were still bonded by the roots of where they came from. I think it is a great read for a Book Club because there are so many interesting characters and while the book doesn't go too deep, it goes just deep enough to spark some interesting discussions of how they all evolved.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Really great story. Nice to revisit characters from previous book! Maybe he could revisit The Stand. I have always wondered how Stu and Fran are doing.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I haven't played it, but my kids have loved it!  They have been trying to beat all of the levels, and my two boys have set timers to make sure they get equal time.  I'd say it's a hit!

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|this is the best zombie show ever.  We watch this every weekend.  I wish they hadn't killed the character of Merle off though.  He was so funny.  We love all the characters in the group and we hope this show goes on forever!
B001GQSY5K|3.0|Having first seen this in the theaters I can attest that the film experience was less than spectacular.  In light of expectations (high) it is probably better than most people (including myself) give it credit for, but not by that much.<br /><br />This adventure, that finds Anakin Skywalker being paired up with his new Padawan Ahsoka Tano, lacks the compelling emotional characters that can make a fantasy film fun or great.  I think that Anakin here is better than Hayden Christensen's version when speaking of emotional depth and characterization but he's still not the engendering of a hero at this point and the Kenobi mentors Skywalker mentors Tano balancing act, while not hindering the characters, just falls flat and that's too bad because that's where this film could have been really fun and moving toward good (rather than just okay).  As it often seems Obi Wan Kenobi is given the ability to be the emotional and mental balance of the film and his poised confidence remains the nucleus around what all of the other characters can look to and draw from (Ahsoka is fine as the new Padawan, not irritating or ingratiating, and you do root for her but she's not allowed to develop into her own).<br /><br />My main complaint with the movie is that I find the Hutts an irritating lot, whether it's Rotta (Jabba's sluggy offspring) or Ziro (who sounded like a wheezy Isabel Sanford from the Jeffersons).  Still, it has been good to see LucasFilm expand its franchise as this has spun into the almost excellent television series.<br /><br />Here's looking at you, Jabba.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I love the game it's fun but needs updated some of the buttons don't work on main screen but great fun it was a great price also

B0040HO01Y|5.0|If you like Downton Abby, you'll like this.  Fun and interesting characters, compelling stories.  A quality cast with great acting.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Are people really starving for 'action' novels so badly that this trash would be published? I really wanted to like this - as an easy-read action/mystery series.. However, it let me down severely.  Let me get to the point:  This book is beyond ridiculous.  The entirety of the plot and characters seems to be written by the fantasies of 12 year old boys.  This is Twilight for guys.<br /><br />1. The main character is 6'5 blonde haired/blue eyed super-musclebound killing-machine who gets to sleep with the hottest chick in town moments after arriving.<br />2. The weapon he uses is a Desert Eagle - .44 magnum pistol Dirty Harry style.. Really?<br />3. He is smarter than everyone. Everyone.<br />4. He has superhuman 'deduction' skills and tell what you ate for breakfast by the color of your shoes.<br /><br />The main bad-guys are so laughably evil, it is absurd. One of the main bad guys is giant who happens to be able to take 2 .44 magnum rounds and laugh them off - like a boss-battle in a video game.<br /><br />Not only are the characters absurd, but the action is very poorly written with very little detail.  By reading the book, it is very difficult to tell what is going on during the action sequences - other than the fact that the hero is stronger and smarter than everyone.<br /><br />Everything about this book will make you cringe.  .22 gauge, what?  Shrug. I will not read another one of these novels.  I suggest you don't either.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Great book.  Love the characters and the alpha male.  Dragons how and transforming in to big bad male.  The female is not that bad.  If you like Christine Feehan the Dark Series then you will love this one as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thought this was a different and fun game. Looking forward to more levels and rooms! It was a bit of a challenge and made me think. School definitely play again.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|A very disappointing end to what once promised to be some really good series. It makes me think authors sometimes are better off left alone so they can work on their stories until they actually dim it perfect (as I am sure Veronioca Roth did for Divergent), insted of having to work agains an external date.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|My sister told me about this book; I looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  It is so nice hearing (ok, reading) someone else's perception of energy and what it really is all about.  I found Pam's  ability to break it down, but still use the science, and make it work.  I've abandoned many books that initially sound worthy of my read, but fail to hold me.  Again, a very worthwhile read.  Enjoy!!

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great sequel to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and left me wanting more. I read the entire book in less than a week, even with my busy schedule, because I just couldn't put it down. I can't wait to ready &#34;Mockingjay&#34;!

B0073COMUW|4.0|Very affordable LED bulb for regular household use.  I own 7W version of the bulb from the same company and like it so much I ordered this 10W version.  Not disappointed.  It is noticeably brighter than 7W bulb.  The only difference is when I turned it off it left a glow like CFL bulbs.  This doesn't happen on 7W LED bulb.<br /><br />When I take it out the package, i could feel that there's something loose in the bulb.  I can hear something moving around when I shake the bulb a little bit.  Minus one star for that.  I will update the review if the bulb goes bad.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is a great book. If you enjoy Brent Weeks books or The Warded Man then you will probably like this book also.
B001BANK32|5.0|Recognizing that the world hardly requires yet another commentary on this particular modern classic horror book, I am nevertheless throwing all to the wind and talking about it anyway. I have chosen here to... poke about at some things that I find interesting rather than 'review' the book in the proper sense.<br /><br />Is it necessary to say 'spoiler alert' for a piece of media more than thirty years old? Probably not, but I just did, so be warned.<br /><br />What struck me while reading this for the first time was the way it begins as a very human story, a trait King is extremely talented at portraying. For the first hundred pages or so, we're just hanging out with the Torrance family, and while there are foreshadowing moments of uneasy things to come, for the most part we're just getting to know Jack, Wendy, and Danny. They are far from a perfect family, largely due to Jack's violent and drunken unpredictability, however at the time we meet him, there is the sense that he has turned a new leaf and seems to really be fighting to give up drinking for the first time in his life. Sure, there have been major wounds done to his family (largely swept under the rug, though tensely present in Wendy's every thought), but all that unpleasantness is seemingly behind them and Jack wants to get back to being a good husband, loving father, and hard-working writer.<br /><br />I describe this section of the book as being so 'human' because King is comfortable with just letting us hang out with these characters for a while and get to know them. We see hints of Jack's temper (albeit only in his thoughts) during his meeting with the arrogant hotel manager Stuart Ullman, but outwardly Jack keeps his cool, indicating a conscious effort to change and better himself. Wendy is a sweet, mousy, rightfully protective mother rattled by the past sins of her husband, hoping beyond hope for Jack's transformation to be permanent and true. Danny is brilliant for his age, and talented in a way even he doesn't realize early on, and yet there are many scenes where he is still very much a curious, playful five year old. It is in these beginning pages that we really develop a fondness for this family unit, which makes circumstances all the more devastating when they are torn to pieces.<br /><br />To paraphrase a comment from an interview I recently heard with Joe Hill: real horror isn't scary until you care about the people having horrible things done to them. That formula proves to be quite true in The Shining.<br /><br />Speaking of getting to know and love characters, the shnerky, jovial old Dick Hallorann is a delight, and shines (HEH-HEH) some comic relief and hopefulness into this heavy tale. He is immediately likeable, easy to relate to, and becomes the kind of character you rather wish you knew in real life. He is Danny's deepest and only trustworthy confidant (though they are also confidants, I'm throwing out Wendy here for her lack of understanding of her son's power, and the imaginary Tony for his sinister intentions and lies). Dick Hallorann is the most sympathetic person in the entire story (by which I mean he shows the most sympathy and human warmth to others) and makes the hard choice to save the boy, even though he realizes it could very well be his own demise. But the bond Dick makes with Danny is strong, and deeper than friendship, though they have only spent brief moments together in person. Perhaps more than any other, you find yourself rooting for Dick to succeed in the end because his actions are so noble and selfless.<br /><br />The scares come aplenty, though in differing ways from the film. Perhaps the most unsettling element in the book are the ghosts (or demons... or whatever they are) within the Overlook Hotel that whisper mad things with increasing frequency into Jack Torrance's brain. He spends many hours in the cellar (seated next to the ancient, precarious boiler) reading mysterious scrapbooks containing news-clippings of horriblethings that have happened at the hotel over the years, and it is in these solo escapades that his mind begins to unravel. Oh, sure, there's the decomposing bathtub lady who strangles Danny, the two dead mafia men with their brains splattered across the walls of the Presidential Suite, and the thorny hedge animals in the courtyard who come to bloodthirsty life, but the deepest horror comes from Jack receiving demonic, violent thoughts towards his family. When he finally snaps and lets the hotel's whispers overtake him completely, shit gets real.<br /><br />One final element I realized is how a large portion of the book is Danny-centric, where is the film is very Jack-centric (with Wendy being the most minor character of the trio in both versions). So much of The Shining is sympathetic towards Danny's honest fears and trying to understand why Mommy and Daddy aren't getting along well. He is actually more brave in the face of dreadful visions that his shining talent presents to him than he is with the very common fears of a young child uncertain if their parents will stay together. Danny has sufficient psychic ability to peek into Wendy or Jack's thoughts (as he reveals to Hallorann), and yet his pure sense of young morality keeps him from doing this too often as he worries he is intruding in an unfair way. This sort of depth is what makes Danny seem so genuine, and his thoughts are so true to his age. King has a theme in many books of being sympathetic towards children in terrible situations, and he interprets their thoughts in a way that feels very familiar and true.<br /><br />So, to bring this back around, The Shining is (I feel) better described as a human story that happens to end in horror. It is, at it's heart, the story of a family struggling to hold things together in the aftermath of violence, drunkenness, and pain. Ultimately, they end up in the worst place that a family in that position could have gone: stranded in a snowy prison inside a hotel with a dark history of causing people to go mad. It's funny the way things in our culture become well-known for certain qualities, when often those qualities aren't even the point. The Shining is arguably King's best-known work, and a household name for the horror genre. But while it is scary, there is much, much more going on between these pages, elevating it (in my mind) to a great piece of literature that supersedes genre.things that have happened at the hotel over the years, and it is in these solo escapades that his mind begins to unravel.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|When I saw this movie was coming out, I didn’t really want to see it because I felt I had enough of big blockbuster zombie movies for one lifetime, but when I finally did get to see it I found it really different from other zombie movies out there.  There were several differences in the movie “World War Z”, differences that sets the film apart from others such as “Dawn of the Dead”, “Resident Evil” and the classic that started it all, “Night of the Living Dead.”<br />“World War Z” stars Brad Pitt as a United Nation hotshot (Gerry Lane) who is living with his family when the zombie outbreak begins in the heart of Philadelphia.  Utter chaos ensues as the living dead take over and begin to turn frightened humans into an exponentially growing hoard of the walking dead.  Due to his prowess and skills learned through years with the U.N, Gerry gets his family to safety and then embarks on a journey to find the cause of the virus and stop the pandemic.<br />“WWZ” stands out among all of the other zombie movies because the film is not about surviving the zombie apocalypse and the degradation of society once every human is fighting for their own survival.  “WWZ” takes the audience on a journey of attempting to understand how a pandemic of this magnitude is possible in the present, and begs not the “What do we do from here?” question, but “Where did this come from, how can we stop it?” making the plot of “WWZ” extremely intriguing.<br />In most zombie films, the only way to deal with living dead is to completely destroy all brain activity in the ghoul, whether it be from a shotgun shell to the head, decapitation, or severing the spinal cord.  “WWZ” however, uses a scientific/detective- like search for a cure or vaccine to undead virus and in the end uses an ingenious way to fool zombies into not attacking living flesh.  In this way, “WWZ” brilliantly flips the art of avoiding zombies on its head.<br />But, a lot of people out there criticize this movie because it had nothing to do with Max Brook’s book with the same title. In “World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War”, Max Brooks writes of several tales, happening all around the world, interwoven with each other as society tries to survive the living dead.  There is no solid plot line, no connection of stories with each other and no real beginning or end- a great fiction read.  The intentions of the film “WWZ” were to provide a plot and center on one character and the journey through the pandemic.  One cannot compare the two, or criticize for their lack of similarity because they are two different pieces of work.  “WWZ” was not an attempt to adapt the book, merely using the book as a guideline and for the name, which in itself sparked major interest.<br />In the end, the movie “World War Z” gives a refreshing take on the zombie genre and may lead to possibilities that have not yet been explored.  Simple twists to the zombie apocalypse framework of hundreds of movies before, creates a different, highly profitable and more relatable horror movie reaching a higher number of movie watchers than ever before.  The film should not be discounted because of its name and relation to a fiction novel, but should be viewed on its own as the instant classic and welcomed addiction to any zombie movie collection.  See it!

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King's constant readers remember Danny Torrance, a young boy using his \\"[[ASIN:B001BANK32 shining]]\\" talent to battle the evil forces in Colorado's Overlook Hotel.  When the hotel burns to the ground, these evil forces are dispersed.  But other evils remain in the world, both human and inhuman.<br /><br />This book finds an adult Dan Torrance scraping bottom, drinking to dull his psychic senses and drifting from job to job, from town to town.  Dan eventually gets off the bus in a small New England town where he finds a job, a room, and a few new friends.  With the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dan builds a new life one day at a time.  He finds work in the Helen Rivington House, a hospice where terminally ill patients spend their final weeks.  Dan's abilities help him ease the final hours of their lives and their transitions to what comes next.<br /><br />Abra, a young girl with strong shining ability reaches out to Dan and be begins to mentor her.  They learn of The True Knot, a tribe of human-seeming creatures who feed on the shining ability of children.  The children do not survive this process.  The True detects Abra from afar and begins searching for her.<br /><br />Stephen King tells a good story.  He makes effective use of the real world, educating readers about alcoholism, terminal patients, and the hidden places of New England.  He invents a new kind of evil, borrowing from legends of vampires, gypsies, and the \\"ghostie people\\" Dan Torrence has encountered before.  These hungry creatures hide in plain sight among caravans of retired Americans crossing the country in their Winnebagos.  Readers are given one more thing to fear, not only on King's pages, but on the lonely highways of real life.  Nicely done, Mr. King.<br /><br />Much as I enjoyed this book, some things troubled me.  First, while members of The True Knot are cold and ruthless toward humans, they show genuine affection for each other.  This is hard to reconcile with other, more traditionally evil aspects of their natures.  The second issue involves a spoiler, but only in a general sense.  Everything seems to turn out fine at the book's end.  And it's not like [[ASIN:0451183940 The Shawshank Redemption]] where the good feeling is achieved by a long climb out of darkness.  The book just builds to a medium level of suspense, then levels off and floats happily to the end.  One wonders if Mr. King has mellowed a bit too much for a horror writer.  A distressing possibility.<br /><br />The book has many strengths, few weaknesses, and is written in the unmistakable voice of Stephen King.  A proven storyteller, he is worth listening to.lly evil aspects of their natures.  The second issue involves a spoiler, but only in a general sense.

B00G32QIEG|1.0|We paid to view this movie and then tried our best to make it through, but we just couldn't stay interested. It was a ripoff of &#34;Men in Black&#34; and other similar movies. It was a complete waste of time.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I read the entire book in the first weekend I had it, then gave a copy to my partner to read.<br />Bought another copy of it and gave it to a close friend.<br /><br />We've been bantering back and forth, keeping each other focused on our One Thing for months now.<br /><br />We all know that we Should focus, we all Think we focus, but in reality, we don't.<br /><br />Keep your copy of The One Thing next to you at your desk, and find an accountability partner to help keep you on track.<br /><br />The One Thing goes beyond just a To-Do list, it narrows down that list of 30 things you \\"need\\" to do today, down to The One Thing you need to do right now.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for individuals, teams, and for your kids that are trying to focus on their homework and school.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman's work but find it difficult to review.  Like a fine wine or wonderful perfume it has so many notes and tones that it stretches my meager skills as a reviewer to the limit.<br /><br />I found The Ocean to be a little different than Gaiman's other work.  It carries dark, fierce undertones like Clive Barker's work with the spiritual whimsy of Madeline L'Engle in it's upper notes.  Gaiman always knows there are Mysteries around us whether at a roadside diner or a simple country pond.<br /><br />In Ocean we have a middle aged man feeling that quiet , cavernous sadness some of us feel after losing a parent.  After the funeral, not ready to deal with the meeting of close family, friends, acquaintances, and assorted relatives only distantly known to him he follows a meandering path to to where he spent his youngest childhood days.  He knows the house is gone.  A middle class housing development stands there now.  It doesn't matter - the memories are still there.  Things pushed deep down inside; the damage only vaguely surfacing throughout the years.<br /><br />He drives down the street which turns to a lane and , finally, becomes and dirt and gravel road.  Another house from the past sits there escaping the ravages of time and progress; the home of Lettie Hempstock.  His best and only friend when he was 7 and she was 11.  She along with her mother and grandmother change him forever.  Was it worth the prices they all had to pay?  Read The Ocean at the End of the Lane - see if the journey changes you.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love the update.  I truly believe this is how Holmes would be if age 30 and in the 21st century.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are excellent.

B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Great book. Told with the color and suspense of fiction but it's all real. I find it hard to sleep after reading this book.

B00G32QIEG|1.0|This was a total MIB rip off!  What was Jeff Bridges thinking??? He's better than this movie.<br />The story is derivative, the acting was poor and JB phony accent started bugging me about<br />10 minutes in to the movie.  Bad just bad.
076535618X|5.0|John Scalzi wraps up the Old Man's Universe with the last possible tale to tell. We're out in deep space with the army and special forces defending new colonies. We've told the army's story. We've told the Special Forces's story. Who's left? The colonists.<br /><br />It's not an examination of colony life, although those glimpses are present and interesting. It's more about how the how the watershed conflict between the humans and the rest of the universe takes place. It's about war, it's about peace, and it's about the distance between people and government.<br /><br />Scalzi is the guy that writers want to be. I don't how the guy can keep the plot moving when nearly 90% of his writing is dialogue, 9% is infodumping (but done in an entertaining way), and 1% is the gunfight at the climax, but he does it. I think it's because he doesn't just give a narration of what happened, he teases and toys. He's standing on a stage with a bunch of upside-down boxes, and he delights in turning them over in just the right order to keep you intrigued.<br /><br />It's the best book I read this year, and the most memorable. My top pick for Satisfying Reader Experience(tm) of the year.
B00EVCGUNY|4.0|London Grammar's &#34;If You Wait&#34; may have arrived several years too late for its own good, as the inevitable comparisons to Florence and the Machine may, in the minds of some, make this album seem more like a pastiche than music with its own identity.  There are sounds here that are also evocative of Annie Lennox and others, but the overall product is quite consistent in style, and any influences have been integrated into a largely coherent whole, as opposed to a random walk through the band members' personal music libraries.<br /><br />In my opinion, the first half of the album is the strongest, with the first five tracks being remarkably good.  However, even the tracks that work less well (in particular, &#34;Nightcall&#34;) still have saving-grace moments, and the entire album is well worth recommending (especially considering the album versus per-track price).  Highlights for me are the infectious &#34;Hey Now,&#34; &#34;Stay Awake,&#34; &#34;Shyer,&#34; &#34;Wasting My Young Years,&#34; &#34;Sights,&#34; and &#34;Interlude (Live).&#34;  Production throughout the album is top notch.  This is a confident debut from a group I am eager to hear more from in the future.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This book takes you from the beginning and keeps you there the whole time. Read it in only a few days

B00EUUJID6|5.0|If you love these guys you will love this CD.  There are more English numbers on this then any others, I think.  Enjoy the holidays.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a disappointment.  After reading and thoroughly enjoying the previous two books, this book was a huge let down.  The writing was substandard and the plot just didn't get it.  It was like this book was written by someone else.  I'm very disappointed. I did not like the way the book went back and forth between and characters and the clarity of character was not evident in the writing.  Very poorly done.
0316204366|5.0|I love the way he writes, using his questions and research, and putting it all together in a very interesting way!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I chose this based on reviews, and was not disappointed.  This was a read-aloud for my children.  The young ones listened but really did not get into the story, but my 7 and 9 year old daughters LOVED it!  I was a bit concerned at first because it seemed that the magic on the book might lean towards the darker side, and there is a fire demon.  I kept going, thinking that I would just stop if we hit a point where I thought it went too far.  I am very glad I did.  I do not want to give away any of the plot so I will not go into details.  It was a story with fun twists and turns that kept my children engaged and wanting to read more each night (I even had trouble stopping).  There are lessons about self-sacrifice, love, and family; being who you are; thinking about your actions before you take them; and things are not always what they seem, .  The best endorsement I can give it - when it was over my girls screamed \\"UGH!\\" and begged me to buy the next book in the series.  We begin tonight.......
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So fun I this app a lot it's fun and you have to pay attention . Also there are coins that you can buy. But if you don't want to buy things you can buy them with bananas. You can also get different characters to use with the coins. This game is an awesome game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this idea a lot. You can play minigames and the more you play them and the higher the score you get (you need at 5000 points to &quot;complete&quot; the game) the more coins you collect and you can buy more games with these coins. Watch out - some of these can be very difficult but that can be what makes it addicting.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|I got to admit that I bought this one only for the DVD and I was not disappointed. The sound is studio quality. The performances are fantastic. I really like the song selection also. The 'Live In London' was an excellent selection of older Testament stuff. This is more of a total catalog of Testament tunes. I really wanted to hear and see a mix of newer stuff with older thrashers. I know everyone can think of a Testament song that's not represented here but I thought they made good choices for a full concert. This is worth every extra penny to have the DVD included. The sound is just stereo but it sounds even better than 'Live In London', which I  thoroughly enjoyed. Besides, don't most 5 channel receivers have multi-channel stereo or 5 channel enhancement? Get this, it's TESTAMENT at their best!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Addictive and I'm just playing for fun!!!  Good thing I cant play at work or I would never get any work done.
B0089LOG02|5.0|From the beginning to the end the story grabbed my attention. Their independent life stories and their intertwined time were all very compelling and heart wrenching.

B000H7JD90|5.0|Shipment was fast. Received the item in good condition. Great piece of  record, highly recommended, justin voice was special and nice to the ears.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad  it's on my kindle now :) love this game &amp; my kids love it too!  The only bad thing is not having more than 5 lives that part stinks!!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Good Bond movie with lots of action.  Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet.  Would recommend movie, but keep the young kids from watching it.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like to play this game and I love to play it all the time it is the best game in the world to play.
B00466HN72|3.0|Fair enough the case got damaged however I got another one but plastic cover missing, but DVD in good shape
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicted to Candy Crush Saga and now I can play on my Kindle. I don't know what could be better.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A device with great potential held back with the lack of supported applications and services.  There are currently only six supported applications so there's not much variety you can use or do if you use multiple and different services.
B00ECLTYOG|5.0|Just awesome. This is the third movie of the Hangover Trilogy. They did an awesome job in this movie. Funny as always.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm definitely getting another.  Being able to get streaming content from my google chrome browser is EXCELLENT.<br /><br />Setting this up only took a few minutes and is very easy.  The directions are clear and easy to understand.
0446310786|5.0|Can I even write a review that does this book justice?  I bought this book so I could read it again as an adult and remembered why I loved it as a kid.  Stunning.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|If I had to describe the film in as few as words as possible, I would say: &#34;Men in Black, but with dead people&#34;.  Not saying that is good or bad, just that is what this film boils down to.<br /><br />Cop dies, given a chance to forego final judgement by working for the RIPD to police dead folks, ensuring they stay dead.  Cop gets trained by seasoned vet of the job.  Friction between the two, one-liners, gun fights, bad guy chases, end of the world plot...  Overall, not a bad film.  To be fair, I am favorable to it because I do enjoy seeing Jeff Bridges in most things, even if he is partnered with the guy that groin-kicked the Green Lantern name.  lol<br /><br />Rentable, enjoyable, buy if you already have MIB in your collection and don't mind similar plot lines.
0316228583|5.0|This is NOT the book for anyone looking for Harry Potter 2.0 (or well 8.0 I guess!)  However if you miss the sheer eloquence and amazing way Rowling can string together the English language, this is the book for you.  Beautifully written, and I look forward to more adult novels by J.K. Rowling!
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|Old house.  Big family.  Old curse.  Weird stuff happens.  Poor dog.<br /><br />The Conjuring is a &#34;haunted house&#34; film, loosely based upon a case of a couple of investigators in the... I want to say '60s or '70s, can't remember without looking.  Right off the bat, ignore hype.  If you have ANY experience with high profile horror films over recent years, you know they don't live up to the hype.  The Conjuring is not the &#34;scariest movie ever!&#34; or &#34;made me wet myself!&#34; or any of that hype babble, so just... ignore it.<br /><br />That said, it is a decent run at a &#34;haunted house&#34; film.  They explained why the house is haunted enough for me to buy it.  Shock scares are there, but not done to death.  Actors were believable.  The house is just perfect for a haunted setup, a nice old house you would know has history.<br /><br />My only real complaint, though not really big, are the build around the &#34;doll&#34; and then, they didn't follow through.  They could have made it a larger role in the film, especially towards the end, but they didn't take the opportunity.  Also, I think they jumped too quickly to concluding the dog's part in the film.  Animals are great &#34;ghost detector&#34; mechanics and I wish they would have utilized that accepted plot tool a bit more before removing it.<br /><br />Worth a watch, maybe repeated viewing to catch all the &#34;corner of your eye&#34; moments.  Buy if you are into haunted house type films
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, great story, great characters. I loved it. I am like a sponge tho, when it comes to emotions and this is a very emotional book, dealing with a very serious subject. I don't know if there will ever be a continuation of this story, but I find myself wondering if they will be okay and hoping that they will stay together.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Mindless film.  No, that is not a bad thing.  Every once in a while, people like a film they can turn their brain off and just look at the pretty lights and pictures.  To me, Pacific Rim was always going to be such a film.  I never expect a solid story, character development, or even &#34;realistic&#34; situations.<br /><br />What I expected was big robots and big monsters having a good old fashion grudge match through various locations.  Was good enough for the old Godzilla films and it is good enough to carry a few films today.  PR delivers just that.  Big robots over there, Big monsters over there.  Ocean, cities, underwater locations back there... and go.<br /><br />My only real gripe is they focused too much on one robot.  Nothing against Gypsy Danger, great bot.  But, this was supposed to be a world defended by big robots.  Let, we get 4 with any real screen time and the other 3 don't get much time at all.  The big monsters got more defining screen time, so you can tell their specific details.  Missed opportunity.<br /><br />Rent, yep.  Buy if you like the genre
B000YAA68C|5.0|Truthfully, this is my favorite movie ever! It is so romantic! It makes me want to visit Ireland. Also, this movie made Gerard Butler one of my favorite actors.
B008JFUORW|4.0|What can I say... it is the third Hangover film.  If you have watched one, or both, of the prior films... you know what to expect.  They didn't change the formula one bit.  They only wished to tie up all the story and plot lines and end the &#34;saga&#34;.  Nearly everything about the prior two films is referenced or featured in the film, sometimes actually useful to the story and sometimes merely because they could.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first two, watch them first.  As I said, this is the wrap up film, tying everything together.  While you won't get lost watching this film as a stand-alone viewing, without knowledge of the first two films, you likely won't get the references and cameos.  Part III says it all, you'll only get a part of the big picture without the other two.<br /><br />If you liked the first two, the third is more of the same.  If you didn't like the first two, third hasn't changed!
B001FB55LW|5.0|One of my favorite movies, it always uplifts my spirits! Jim Carey is funny, and motivates me to say &#34;Yes&#34; to more things in my life!
B0000025D0|5.0|[[ASIN:0978415612 The Light in Darkness]]Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town broke new ground for The Boss in 1978. A counterpoint to the operatic elegance of Born to Run, the album was an angry, raw record that burst forth after a three-year hiatus. Because of its darker tones, some might call Darkness a difficult album, but despite this, it's a cherished gem for many. Many fans never gave Bruce's fourth album much consideration; those more partial to the high-polished sounds of Born to Run or the stadium-rousing choruses of Born in the U.S.A. For the skeptics, just listen to the tales of those who struggle with the dark and trembling frustration of \\"Something in the Night,\\" the open-road emptiness of \\"Racing in the Street,\\" and the too-faraway hope of \\"The Promised Land.\\" A troubling album indeed. But the passion, the connection, the thrill of the listener as they explore this classic record will make a convert of anyone. It was a long wait. From the time Born to Run came out until the release of Darkness on the Edge of Town, fans had to suffer through a three-year hiatus, a lifetime for a musician to be off the radar back then.  And in the days before the Internet and MTV, Bruce's fans often had no idea what was taking him so long, and little means to find out. We resorted to scouring the pages of Rolling Stone and Creem magazines for any mention of Springsteen, any hint or clue about when the new record would be released. We all know now that legal wrangling with his first manager, Mike Appel, kept a new record off the shelves for those three years. When Bruce finally came out victorious and replaced Appel with music writer Jon Landau, the stage was set for the next record to be released. But few would anticipate the frustration that had built up during those years, anger that Springsteen would channel into the new album, and at his legendary three-plus hour concerts - shows that embodied all the manic fury of a revival meeting.  The Light in Darkness shares the stories of fans coming to grips with this new record and this very different sound from The Boss, finding that Bruce's struggles and frustrations often mirrored their own battles in life. A frayed relationship with a father, a body made sore with factory work, or the suffocating fear of being trapped in the badlands, fans have lived the stories Bruce tells on Darkness - the album is part of their history.ss shares the stories of fans coming to grips with this new record and this very different sound from The Boss, finding that Bruce's struggles and frustrations often mirrored their own battles in life.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. It was challenging, but not frustrating to the point where I wanted to give up on it. My only complaint is that I wish there had been more levels!
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Superb! Everyone loves Warren Haynes and he outdid himself on this CD. So glad I got this for my hubby's birthday, he was delighted.
0307454568|5.0|A great read. The whole trilogy was pretty compelling. Very interesting characters caught up in crime, intrigue and personal challenges.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|Amazing book.  He can make the smallest, everyday occurrences seem monumental.  Similar in feeling to Virginia Woolf's style. I found myself analyzing my days the way his characters do, with a new viewpoint.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Best show ever! Love the storyline, acting, everything. Very clever remake. Does not lose the feel of Sherlock Holmes in the slightest while bringing it to the modern day.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the best movies ever made... And this version of it looks great! The depth of the B&W is incredible, every frame is a well composed piece of art. Pay special attention to the use of shadows in the background and the quality of light used on individual actors to convey meaning.
B0002EXH4K|3.0|Being that I was a big metal fan back in the eighties (and still dig a whole lot of it...dig?) i still watch VH1's That Metal Show this weekend on demand. So anyway, da guest on it is crazy-azz Dave Mustaine. Anyway, he goes into one of these \\"we're better than any music out there\\" rants and disses my favorite band, The Grateful Dead with a statement like \\"When the drugs wear off, they suck\\". So rather than get all offended, I put my ears to a little listening test: I broke out dust-covered copy of Countdown To Extinction- the very album Mustaine said was his favorite on That Metal Show to give it the \\"listening test\\" in my car. As annoyed as I was by Mustaine's statement, Countdown To Extinction doesn't sound too bad after all these years, especially, Symphony Of Destruction, a classic metal track. Honestly, I put it back in it's case after a few songs, and put on one of my many Grateful Dead shows, driving happily along the freeway. I still dig metal, heck, I bought Megadeth's Peace Sells on cassette before even ever getting anything by Metallica. So I will give this a few more spins. I do have great memories of doing decline bench press sets while blasting Symphony Of Destruction. Try it, it'll pump u up! If you haven't heard this and like stuff like Metallica and Pantera, check it out, it's pretty good.
006202406X|4.0|When went into this book, I knew about all the bad reviews, but I didn't know why. Something terrible must have happened to have angered so many fans. I had just reread Divergent and Insurgent before reading Allegiant, so the details of the previous books were still fresh in my mind. As I was rereading, I noticed so many hints as to what could possibly happen in the final book. In an interview, Veronica Roth stated she had the ending planned out since Divergent. It was not a last minute decision. She had this planned out, and there were plenty of indications in the last two books. Yes, the ending was truly heartbreaking. I wish it had a happier conclusion. Emotions were rolling through me. It still pains me to think about it. I would not say Allegiant was my favorite of the three. Divergent is my favorite, but the ending did not stop me from enjoying Allegiant. There were things that I liked and things I didn't like. For one thing, I wish there was more distinction between Tris and Tobias's perspectives. I would pick up where I left off reading and think I'm reading Tris's pov when it's actually Four's. There were heart wrenching scenes, and beautiful ones. In fact, Roth left us a little hopeful message at the very end. We cannot just dismiss her skills as a writer for an ending we did not want. Veronica wrote a beautiful story. Tragic, yet beautiful.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Classic Christmas family comedy.  Anything that can does go wrong, but the spirit of the season pulls everyone through to a great ending.
B00F8MIIKO|2.0|Once again Pixar fails as a bastard of Disney's arcane machine, turning the wonderful world of a childs imagination into a long, dragged out sitcom.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I am absolutely shocked by the 1 star ratings this movie is getting.<br /><br />It had incredible special effects, wonderful story line, great plot, loads of action, and a great father - son story.  Jaden Smith was phenomenal as the hero of the movie.  I'm looking forward to seeing more of him.  As for dad, Will Smith did an incredible job of making his character believable.  It had to be hard having his son in that role.<br /><br />This was a 5 star movie for me.
B000FC130E|4.0|Suspenceful and well written. Really in depth view of the characters. Good description of thoughts and happenings. Hard to put down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show, but I didn't like some of the story lines in this season of the series. Too sad!
B00A83075M|1.0|I received the DVD and it skipped and had  a scrambled line at the bottom. I mailed it back and received another one with same problem. Very unhappy with the seller of this product. Purchased wreck it ralph at wal mart and it works fine so the problem is coming from this supplier.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Works well with all my devices, I get about 2 charges on my Galaxy S4.  I was surprised by the great tech support, after the purchase they followed up with me whether or not the device was working out for me.  I had an issue with it and it was promptly replaced with a brand new unit.  Good customer service is something that does not exist any more, and I am glad to see that a company, like Anker is willing to stand behind their product.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The whole series. I loved it and wish it hadn't ended. A must read. I am even going to suggest to my dad who is a very picky reader.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon finally got on board with this game. It's fun, entertaining, and challenging. Link to your facebook songs ply with your friends, and great for the whole family! I love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I can't seem to get interested enough in this book to finish it and it is not like me to put a book down. I can't put my finger on what it is about the story that I don't find engaging. I will likely go back and finish it, eventually, when I have exhausted everything else I have to read.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|It just didn't work. I really love the game and have it on my computer, but the kindle edition is waste of time!!
B000H7J9QM|4.0|Great movie for a car lover, picture quality and audio is questionable. I am glad I bought it but I wouldn't if I had the DVD.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Read on in one flight LA to Paris. Page turner interest and exciting read. Many facts in the story create believability
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the user friendly way Amazon Instant videos's site offers. It shows you where you were so yo can resume each time you return to a season.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Totally addictive and well worth watching. Each season just gets better and better.  Zombies, gore, drama, romance... the whole package.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|The movie is about 30 years old but it still is the best Carmen movie I ever saw. The cast is superb.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|It's a classic! Easy to read and relate-able for most of us! Not everything we do in life is a mistake, even if it's not the right path. How do we know until we try?
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very addictive...and fun...love it... and also strangely relaxing..don't think hubby too impressed though when I'm in the bath for an hour..lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, and l find it more fun on the kindle than on the computer.  You can accept as many lives as you need from your friends, so none go to waste like they do on the computer version.  It is free, so just try it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is honestly by far the best book I have read it has a great plot and awesome characters I would definitely recommend this book to someone
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What an amazing season! This is such a good show and I can't wait to see the next season. Amazing.
8866135704|2.0|I was confuse with the size. and expecting to get the normal size, but when I received it was the smallest.
B000FIMG68|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time.  This is a great season and gets you ready for the twists and turns that are coming in the later seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't like how long you get stuck on levels especially the lower levels & how u clear everything & stuff drops again. Makes me stop playing often.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great show! If you like suspence and thrills and zombies, this is the show for you! I love the human element to it as well, you get so attached to the characters.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|As a huge fan of Simple Physics, I was psyched when Simple Rockets was the free app of the day.  The tutorials make what could be a complicated mess of a game pretty easy to learn, though not necessarily easy to master.  However, a tutorial for advanced rocket building would be helpful, as I don't quite know how to make my rockets structurally stable.<br /><br />The only part of the game I don't like - and why I nicked off a star - is the rocket building interface.  I find it to be a bit clumsy when trying to line up rocket parts, and the stages it automatically sets are almost always wrong requiring tweaking.  To improve the build interface, I would suggest making the connection points \\"magnetic\\" so that they line themselves up properly, and adding an undo/redo button.  It's also very annoying when a part is accidentally lost behind the rocket - given the 2D nature of the interface, that shouldn't be possible.<br /><br />This was a fun game to play for a few days and worth the purchase if you enjoy games of this type.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive so make sure you have plenty of time and someone to do your housework! Easy game to play with frustrating results at times.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|This book touches on many points familiar to anyone who has been keeping up with personal and portable computing over the last few decades, winding a saga of technological development around the life of one its patriarchs.  Though the main points may be recollected by many, each chapter has some gem(s) of uncommon knowledge or insight that made the book worth reading.  Watching the movie &#34;Jobs&#34; did not spoil the majority of the book and even reinforced my appreciation for our hero's human side.<br />To a systems engineer, Jobs' philosophies and guiding principles are of particular value.  Yet, this book is really more a case study for would-be entrepreneurs.  The title could have just has well been &#34;Apple,&#34; since the late CEO identified so completely with the company he co-founded, making any biography of the man equally that of his company.  There is so much to admire in Steve Jobs, while difficult to get over the conflicts in his interpersonal behavior.  Yet, having read this book that exposes so much of Jobs as a person, I would not be surprised that his greatest gift to me might someday be, not the iPhone that I use every hour of the day, but something I learned from this book that I am able to apply to my own business life.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I, like many others, have really enjoyed playing this game! My only complaint would be that you need Facebook in order to play on to certain levels, or you are put in dime sort of time out and have to wait 24 hours between levels! Not sure why Facebook has to be connected to this game!
B00985E3UG|4.0|Eye opening read about the food industry and their disappointing lack of real family values.  We are on our own folks!  Let the buyer beware....
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Simply amazing! This show kept getting better and better as the season progressed and then the last episode just put the icing on the cake.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Movie was very entertaining, we had streaming issues during the movie. This was are first time using amazon to stream movies.
B00593JNJW|4.0|My inner cynic looks at Where She Went and perceives it as a money making addendum. Which is not only spectacularly unfair because, it's only because the first novel is so brilliant that we want to know, and deeply care about what happens next but also because in a lot of ways it is just as emotional, gripping and as much of a page turner as If I Stay.<br /><br />It still does fall short (in my opinion) of the first novel as it seems hard to buy into both the separation of the characters and the resolution of the issues, while gratifying for the readers, seems to fall short of the build up of both the novels with everything seemingly falling into place with little effort. While it's certainly what these characters deserve, it doesn't seem to ring true in the same way that made If I Stay so brilliant. It's definitely worth reading if you loved the first like I did however.
0739319175|1.0|This book was clearly a disappointment. Mr. Brown basically does the same plot as his previous couple books and just substitutes in new characters. Very weak.
B0031RS3K8|5.0|On the surface it seems like what may be a devastating, but perhaps simplistic or limited idea: whether you choose to stay in a world where your immediate family has died, or leave everyone else behind a move on. The way Gayle Forman writes however draws you in - right from the very beginning, and you become completely invested in Mia, her family, friends and life before you know it.<br /><br />While aspects of it, especially Mia's out-of-body experience allowing her see, hear and listen to the people in her life while in a coma reminded me strongly of The Lovely Bones (Alice Sebold), Forman seems to draw the reader more effectively into Mia's life itself. There's definitely a far stronger relationship between Mia and her boyfriend Adam but the book itself is far more centred on Mia as the protagonist and centred on her life and loss as opposed to the world around her. If I Stay may not be entirely original or realistic in it's conception but the execution is flawless - emotional, gripping and the reader can't help but invest in Mia.

B002PMV9FG|5.0|Very good, one of the best, of the Harry Potter series of movies...and the price through Amazon was too good to pass up.
1843106698|4.0|The Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome was the first book I read about AS and it’s still the best I’ve come across. Dr. Tony Attwood takes a no-nonsense approach to explaining what Asperger’s Syndrome is and how it affects people at all stages of life. He writes in a conversational style that makes some of the more technical aspects of AS easy to understand for the layperson without “dumbing down” the subject matter. He addresses the symptoms of AS as they manifest in both children and adults. His tone is frank but positive.<br /><br />Each chapter is a mix of background information, anecdotal stories from his practice as a clinical psychologist and strategies that adults and children with AS or the supportive people in their lives can use to tackle the challenges that AS presents. There is a wealth of additional reading material referenced in the text, from scientific studies to online resources and online resources. If you get just one book about AS or are looking for a good first book, this is the one.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|I admit it, I am a fan of the Moody Blues...so I am obviously biased. But this is a good album of theirs, a classic from the early day.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I like all of their recordings.  This is not my favorite but I'm very satisfied and enjoy it.  Good buy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I got very addicted to this game very fast, but you definitely reach a point where you have to pay for a lot of things to achieve real progress. I would so much rather pay a reasonable flat fee and then enjoy a whole game.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It was hard to like either character in this book.  There are two sides to every story and in this book they're both bad.
0812973992|5.0|One of the most humane, inventive, and well-written American novels that I have read in a long time. McCann's uncanny ability to create distinct and believable voices sets this novel apart from many other post-9/11 novels. Those who appreciate the New York of Don DeLillo's novels will be pleased to discover it again, in McCann's novel, which takes place in the early 1970s before concluding in the late 2000's. While not as sweeping in scope as DeLillo's 'Underworld,' 'Let the Great World Spin' seamlessly blends historical events and place into a fictional narrative that meditates on the lives touched, and those ignored in the shadows of, the newly constructed Twin Towers.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game, I cannot stop playing it with gadgets,clothing,vehicle upgrades and more I  guarantee you guys would love this game!
B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I had my students watch it and I think they understood the horror of the Holocaust from a new perspective that they had never thought about. I highly recommend this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I LIKE EVERTHING ABOUT THIS GAME BUT THE LIFE THING. BUT I GUESS IF THEY DIDN'T DO THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHALLENGE TO THE GAME.
159514188X|5.0|‘Thirteen Reasons Why‘ was an unforgettable, thought-provoking novel that took me inside the mind of a young teenage girl who had lost all hope.<br /><br />This book had an edge to it that had me initially feeling that the girl who narrated on the tapes was selfish and sort of self-serving in her way for wanting to make others feel guilty for the fact that she had taken her own life. But as the story continued, my heart began to break for her. She was a girl who was just trying to fit in, only she drew the attention of the wrong people and that started a chain of events that would lead to her destruction.<br /><br />The narrator of the book, Clay, was a character I connected with straight away. Even though he made mistakes, they were minor and unknowing ones. He was so likable with his sincerity in how he felt about things. The anxiety he felt at knowing that he was on a list that Hannah had listed as the reasons she had killed herself was just heart-breaking to read. Even more so when I read about Hannah and his relationship and what could have been. The range of emotions he felt over his actions as the novel went on made me cringe in sympathy.<br /><br />There were so many cries for help in this book that were overlooked time and time again. I’ve heard of an expression that went along the lines of ‘rumors can kill’. This expression certainly played a pivotal role throughout the whole book. For those who have read this book, they will hopefully understand what I’ve meant by this – for those who haven’t, well, you’ll find out as you read it.<br /><br />The writing style of this novel was brilliantly unique. I’ve never read a book where a person’s story was told in a series of taps and a map. There was this feeling that Hannah had planned everything down to the last detail. And added to the mix was Clay’s story as well. Just the way both narrators’ stories blended together was intriguing and had elements of near genius.<br /><br />This is certainly a book that will make you think about it even days later. There’s that haunting feeling that the character you grew to love was not truly gone, but just … absent. Or they’re playing a joke on you and that any minute they’ll appear. But then you realize they won’t. And that’s the realism with this book. The part that hurts, because for anyone who’s lost a friend or family member to suicide, that’s the part you wish for – to see them again.<br /><br />I don’t think there’s a person I wouldn’t recommend 13 Reasons Why to, but I would add that there is the possibility that, although the novel isn’t written in the hard-hitting way of some other books, the subject matter could be a triggering one.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|I've read all of his books and love most of them.  This one started out ok, then just slipped into &#34;I don't really care if I finish it&#34;
B008D28HYS|2.0|Interesting concept, but the puzzles appear small on my 10&#34; tablet and the gameplay just didn't hold my attention.  After trying it out once or twice, I've never revisited this app.
1597801585|3.0|I mixed the ebook version and the Audible version of this book, and for me it helped a lot that the narrator of the Audible version added a Thai or Chinese accent to the spoken sentences of the book. It helped me put a more complete picture to each of the main characters.<br /><br />I've read quite a few books in recent years that feature explicit sexual or violent content, this book contains quite a few. If they're not your thing, then you might have to skip over a few key chapters.<br /><br />I love the genre, read Crux and Nexus (by Ramez Naam) before, which is set in the same area and in a similar genre, I really loved how Ramez wrote the ethical discussion more into the narrative, which, as a reader got me thinking. I have a feeling that Paolo didn't really give much thought to how the other characters would fight their own ethics... Or he considered them and found quite a few of them real bastards with only money in mind.<br /><br />All in all an interesting read, in an interesting setting with abundant interesting twists. But there was room for more.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I recently read an interview where Ms Roth said that Tris' outcome was always her intention.  I suggest that when she released her two previous books, received good reviews and hooked tens of thousands of young adults with Tobias and Tris' journey, she assumed a responsibility towards those readers.  Why, in heavens name did Ms. Roth create a young woman (skinny, plain, flat-chested), allow her to catch the hunk (who loved her for her abilities not her appearance), and then kill her off?<br /><br />For crying out loud, why couldn't this be another cinderella story?  Right now, the world has so many problems with so many negative and heartbreaking events, why would you, Ms Roth, cause more pain?
B002KJX4IE|3.0|It's a Fun - old school '80's throw back goofball movie. A Halloween Classic without being a Horror flick. Good times!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|When recently purchased my new macbook pro with retina display I thought I would say goodbye to ethernet forever. However, I quickly learned that one or two business trips would put in the land of &#34;companies that refuse to use WiFi&#34;. But I also forgot that macbook pros do not have ethernet ports.<br /><br />So, instead of searching for an Apple store I decided to buy from Amazon and ship to my hotel. It arrived the next day and from the box to my macbook pro and Voil&agrave;. A quick connection and plug in the ethernet and I was online in seconds. I didn't have to do anything except start surfing and check email (the way it should be). This item is a true Apple computer manufactured item. No imitations.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|the quality of the picture when using this device is not good.  It is bad enough that I resorted back to hard wiring my TV to the computer with the HDMI cable.  Also I have to keep my computer on while casting to TV and the delay time is so obvious that it is completely distracting. Also doesn't work with my IPAD (I have the old version of IPAD).  Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me, but a slick idea.  maybe once they perfect it?
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Great, creative game.  Very clever puzzles. It's relaxing and challenging and artistic all at the same time. I can't wait for more levels!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I had never read The Shining (and still haven't seen the movie), so decided to read Shining/Dr. Sleep back to back. I was not disappointed. I thought the Shining was a pretty weak novel, and without the nostalgia from bygone eras found Doctor Sleep to be significantly better. It acts as a true sequel and picks up almost immediately after the Shining. I'm only subtracting one star for the ending, as (without spoilers) it could have been a little more 'epic.'
B009IU6BIS|5.0|It's a classic, what else is there to say?  So many quotable scenes.  We watch it at least once every year.
0547884591|5.0|As a self-described learning geek, the hardest part about reading this book was figuring out how to limit the number of new skills I wanted to learn.  This one will stay in the bookshelf for a long time....
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this series, but once I started I was hooked and I watched the whole series in 3 days.  While watching the series I was googling facts about Henry VIII and was surprised that the series followed his life pretty accurately.  Doesn't hurt that Henry Cavill is such a hottie. :)  It also made me interested in the history of those times and it made me look up the events after king Henry's death.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|the company sent the dvd on time an no complaints. i was expecting a much better movie and waited a long time to see it. the thing that bothered me the most is this movie was so anti wolf. ive owned and raised 100% wolves and they are intelligent can be very loyal and never never had one ever try to bite me or my daughters. If any animal is hungry yes they will attack even me. but this movie was so unlike wolves. first wolves will avoid people. alfa's are more bold but still alaska has enough food for them. i hate the witch hunts they have on wolves. wolves keep our coyote populations down. most ranchers lookat wolves being at fault for what coyotes damage does. if an animal is weak or sick it needs to die.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I was a bit weary of watching a superman movie not with Christopher Reeves, but Hanry Cavill is the new Superman.  He is hot and very charismatic as Superman.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This product is nice but it's not what I expected. it's very limited in the mobile apps it works with. as I live outside the US I am practically limited to YouTube. however, it does works nicely with my laptop based chrome, from which I can cast practically anything that is on the web.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|Very long book that's flows really easily. Ingenious thinking to work the whole thing . Look forward to next book

B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to use and I like the weather I formation. Using music to wake up to is good and not taking g an alarm clock with me is great as my watch does. It have an alarm.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I've read all of her books and they are all disturbing, but this one more so. There was nothing positive, no &#34;good&#34; characters, except maybe Lyle. It seemed to go on forever, never getting to the point and then, WHAM!, it's over.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I love watching the episodes again -without commercials- so I can pick up on anything I may have missed.  There are 3 disks in this set.  Love it!!  One of my favorite shows!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting forever to get Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle.  At last it is available.  I have such an addiction to this game that I can hardly wait for the timer to wind down so I can play again.  This is a very challenging game.  It is my first choice when it comes to playing the games. It synchs with Facebook on the computer, too, so I can play interchangeably.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Fast paced lot's of twist and turns, hard to put down. Can't wait to read the rest of the King and Maxwell series.
B00EJKG5M4|5.0|This is a very challenging puzzle.  If you don't do well the first time, can go back and do it again, to try to get a better score. What looks so easy, to match the colors is not so easy, as the levels progress.  I enjoy this game.  The PRO version provides oportunity to be shown how to solve the puzzle.  I do that as a last resort, when I find it impossible to solve it.  Another excellent time waster.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What an interesting story.....talk about being responsible for one's actions.....the thought process in all of this is mind-blowing, surprises, intriguing and everyone has a secret....recommend this highly as a good summer read.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|Two words... CHARLES BRONSON. I am so glad that Clint, albeit I love him, Eastwood turned down this role. Bronson is a mans man, an actor whose weathered face portrays more than any actor today could. For that matter the same could be said about Jason Robards, just chops. And Henry Fonda, one of the best ever. I am of the &#34;MTV Generation&#34; and love film. From Errol Flynn to On The Waterfront to Deer Hunter I have seen them all. This movie took me about three or four times to finally watch it just because the pacing is so deliberate and slow, but once it starts, hold on to your hat, both literally and figuratively. Leone's style is going to be tough for some of my generation, but you need to just appreciate the nuances of the film and music and wait for the story to really kick in. This is how film should be made, it should be an event, not a 90 minute 3D drool fest. This is how actors should act. Hell this is how men should act, and Ill take it a step further and say this film should be required not only for film lovers and people studying the craft, but ALL MALES. I know that sounds horribly dated but I think we could use a few more Charlie Bronsons and Gary Coopers (HIGH NOON!! another brilliant film) these days, the closest thing we have is Mel Gibson, and hes great but not getting any younger.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is loads of fun, no matter what your age is, and to top it off, it's freeeeeee!!! :D
0920668372|1.0|I was given this book as a gift twice.  The first time I read it to my infant son, I was in tears (post partum hormones didn't help).  It was such a sad and morbid story to read to a child.  Completely inappropriate & depressing, and I have since recycled both copies.
B007SGM084|4.0|It's not that great, you get a few thrills, somewhat of an interesting plot. Keep in mind I'm a guy reviewing this, but in my opinion it's not worth full price, get a kindle edition or a used copy.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This is a good movie, but kind of rushed and short (no pun intended.)  It is a prequel to the Lord of the Ring movies, and if you like the other Tolkien movies by Peter Jackson, you will probably like this movie.

0062255657|5.0|Great story and extremely well written. If you're looking for a book to get you across the country on a flight, this is a great choice. It's short, but there are a lot of great lessons to be learned a lot of thinking to be done at the end of it.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is fantastic. I had some idea what I was getting, but I'll admit I wasn't entirely sure (which is something that should be fixed by both Google and Amazon). If you leave it plugged in, it will overheat. That said, it's amazing. Being able to stream that well from almost anything is great. Here's to hoping more programs, apps and services add Chromecast compatibility going forward.

B003NX75B8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, along with every other one by this author that I've read. It taught me just a few more lessons on how to survive in this world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't expecting the book to pull me in. I unfortunately watched the movie before I ever read the book. I think if it had been the other way around I would have enjoyed the movie in a different light. This book was amazing and I cannot wait to read the next one!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Love it. I would recommend it definitely. It's been 4 days and I'm actually getting this stuff through my head.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|A ripping yarn, with some very imaginative scenes, and a morally equivocal ending that leaves a lingering  afterglow of conundrums.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Outstanding acting, wonderful story well told. Maggie Smith is not just an English treasure, but a world one.  However, all the actors were not only right for their roles, but were believable.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|The kids love Octonauts and loved getting Gup-E to add to their collection. Can't find this one in stores for the most part.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Entertaining keeps you busy so you don't get bored between collecting coins and feeding animals. The story line is cute too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and mindless.  My two negatives are having to wait for more lives and the &quot;options &quot; for further game play.  Asking for a buck to continue this &quot;free &quot; game is ridiculous.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I thought the actors were very good, but the beginning was hard to follow. It seemed to jump from one scene to another without explaining what was going on.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Best zombie movie, if your into zombies, I've ever seen! And, no, as a rule, I'm not into zombies. But, these were very believable!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and had to read it again. Nicholas Sparks really out did his self with this story.  Dawson and Amanda are from different worlds, she has money and a family, he has no one but himself and an old man named Tuck who becomes more than a friend a father. Dawson and Amanda fall madly in love, but he lets her go so she will have a better life than he can give her. Their story spans over twenty years and are reunited when Tuck passes away leaving a final request from them. I would love to tell you the whole story, but I'm not because I want you to feel you are with them like I was never suspecting it was going to end like it does.

B00EB6ENXO|4.0|even though i cancelled this item  when i got the streming  movie from amazon  was a fine way to watch the film.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Superb story line, acting and character development.  Disappointed that the main character,Matthew, will not be back.  He had too vital a role to leave after 3 seasons.  Perhaps he was not paid enough.  It will be interesting to see how the plot line will develop without him.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So good, I recommend it to anyone. I have a love hate  relationship with the ending however. If you can't sit down and read a book for hours do not read this series, impossible  to put down.
B00004X10B|5.0|This bag will hold a large amount of equipment for your camera to incluse the camera body.  there's enough room that you can store 2 camera bodies in it with lenses attached.  the wife loves it, but doesn't like the weight when she loads it up with everything.  It does get heavy.
0743270754|3.0|Book Review: Team of Rivals<br /><br />This is the longest book I have ever read about Lincoln and his assassination. I knew from the earliest chapters, when the author was going into the selection of the secretary of State that this book was too wordy.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the Civil War parts of the book. In my opinion, if the book had a better editor, this book could have been trimmed by at least 200 pages but that was not the author’s style of writing as it turned out. It is a thorough book of the account of Lincoln and his cabinet. It was wonderful to read but took me a long time to do it because it was very wordy.<br /><br />I only read this book because I found out some parts of it was based on the movie Lincoln. It was nice to see in print the speeches that were given and the anecdotes Lincoln shared throughout the movie. But they were too far and in between throughout the book. The sad thing was that the cessation delegates were only about ten pages. I felt this was a misrepresentation of the book leading to an award winning Movie. I was disappointed that this was not longer and the events of the movie that drew out the month of January to encompass the passage of the 13th amendment were not drawn out in the book like almost every other thing in Lincoln’s presidency was.<br /><br />Overall, I give this book three stars.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|I WAS NOT A STEPHEN KING FAN BUT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN, I READ 'IT'.  THE FIRST CHAPTER ALONE SCARED ME.  THEN FOR YEARS I DID NOT READ ANYTHING BY SK UNTIL HE CAME OUT WITH 'UNDER THE DOME'.  I LOVED THE BOOK BUT HATED THE ENDING.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAINLY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT SK'S ENDING IN MANY OF HIS BOOKS.  NOW I KNOW WHY.<br /><br />AFTER READING 'UNDER THE DOME', I GOT INTO SK BY PURCHASING AT LEAST 5  OF HIS BOOKS AMONG THESE BOOKS, I BOUGHT 'IT'.  I NEVER MAKE IT (NO PUN INTENDED) A HABIT TO READ A BOOK TWICE BUT DECIDED TO READ 'IT' AGAIN BECAUSE LIKE THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK WHO FORGOT THEIR CHILDHOOD UNTIL THEY RECEIVED THE CALL, I TOO FORGOT THIS BOOK.  TRUTHFULLY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST CHAPTER AND I ALSO REMEMBERED THAT THE BOOK TAUGHT ME TO CONFRONT MY FEARS, NOT RUN AWAY FROM THEM BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I REMEMBERED NOTHING.<br /><br />NOW THAT I AM READING THE BOOK AS AN ADULT, IT SEEMS LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOOK.  MANY COMPLAINED ABOUT CERTAIN PLOTS, FOUL LANGUAGE AND SUCH BUT I NORMALLY TAKE EVERYTHING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.  TO ME READING THIS BOOK IS NOT UNLIKE LIVNG IN THE REAL WORLD.  PEOPLE STILL SWEAR, PEOPLE DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER.  I COULD GO ON FOREVER BUT I KNOW YOU GET THE POINT.<br /><br />I STILL HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK BUT SK CAN WRITE EVEN IF HE HAS A FILTHY MOUTH.  THIS BOOK IS ONE OF HIS FINEST.  I HAVE NOT READ THE OTHERS SO I CAN'T RANK IT.  I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING THOUGH, ALTHOUGH SK HAS BEEN KNOWN AS THE TOP HORROR WRITER, I THINK THAT THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE TRUTH.  SK WRITES ABOUT GOOD VS EVIL, CONSEQUENCES OF CHOICES WE MAKE, WE ARE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE CHARACTERS IN HIS BOOK, FEAR CAN TAKE SHAPE IN MANY FORM, ETC.<br /><br />IN SAYING THIS, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINKS SK ONLY WRITES HORROR, I DARE YOU TO BUY ONE OF HIS FINER BOOKS SUCH AS CARRIE, THE SHINING, THE STAND SO FORTH.  YOU WILL REALIZE THAT I AM TELLING THE TRUTH.<br /><br />I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I HAVE FINISHED READING THE BOOK.  SO I WILL STOP MY REVIEW HERE AND GET BACK TO READING THE BOOK (THAT HAS MADE MILLIONS SCARED OF CLOWNS).  LET ME REPHRASE, MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF THINK THAT CLOWNS ARE SCARY, BUT ONCE YOU READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL BE ON THE TOP OF \\"THINGS TO FEAR\\" LIST.  SEE YOU SOON WHEN I FINISH THE BOOK.E I HAVE FINISHED READING THE BOOK.  SO I WILL STOP MY REVIEW HERE AND GET BACK TO READING THE BOOK (THAT HAS MADE MILLIONS SCARED OF CLOWNS).

B0073COMUW|2.0|This bulb has white white light and glows out the bulb in.  It is dark behind and to the sides of the bulb.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book immensely. It contained both beauty and sadness, which I feel was the intent of the author, to explain life and all it's joy and sorrow. I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially those with &#34;sensitive souls&#34; and enjoy art expressed through words and paintings.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A no nonsense factual  description of the team that terminated bin laden.  No flowery prose, but a crisp description of the life of a navy seal.  Very interesting .  Highly recommend.
B005SBJG60|5.0|Although anything from Radiohead is tops in my book, this is clearly a bargian for the amount and quality of remixes from TKOL album.  Highly recommend.
B005IFZ36I|5.0|This is a treasure, a library-worthy volume with a dark blue-and-black embossed cover and over 1,000 silver-gilt pages, containing all the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The short stories and novels are presented in chronological order of writing, from &#34;The Beast in the Cave&#34; through &#34;The Haunter of the Dark.&#34; An appendix contains all the extant juvenilia and the long non-fiction essay, &#34;Supernatural Horror in Literature.&#34; There's an introduction by Lovecraft's idefatigable biographer, S.T. Joshi, and each story has a preceding paragraph of comments and first-publication information. Having purchased it only because I wanted a single-volume collection, I now think it's essential for any true Lovecraft enthusiast. Highest recommendation.
B001675YQ6|5.0|This is an adorable film.  I saw it this summer and decided I had to own it.  Brittany Murphy plays an Audrey Hepburn type character from Breakfast at Tiffany.  Her make-up and outfits are fantastic.  It has a cute plot and I really enjoyed.
0061950726|3.0|This is a bit disappointing as there is not much history of the orphan trains. The 1929 orphan train is simply an episode in a very average little novel. There's interest in the social services organization before the big government era. Apparently, at least one associated organization is still in existence and looking for contributions. I would have appreciated more about life in NYC before transportation. How may of the kids were illegal immigrants? Background before 1929 is not given. Wikepedia fills the gap to a small extent. Perhaps I'll try the PBS program or a non fiction work. The most interesting items in the book are bits about Michael Collins and the Irish civil war as Kline develops the background of the orphan train protagonist and Molly Molasses a Penobscot woman of the early 19th century, prototype for her modern principle character.<br /><br />The plot follows a now common, since Michener, literary device of alternating between old and modern venues. Unique here is first person account alternating with the modern scenario third person narrative. I didn't get the point. The story culminates, or rather peters out, as the now very old protagonist discovers he magic of Internet to discover the fate of some of her childhood companions.<br /><br />Kline's development of female characters is well done and there is a good depiction of social structure, family relationships and economic conditions in Depression era Minnesota.
B008966SI0|5.0|I bought this album without having heard it in its entirety, simply because I figured any new Grizzly Bear album couldn't be too much of a waste. I was not disappointed. As with much of the band's other work, it's an album best heard on vinyl. It really allows the subtleties to stand out. The records themselves were a bit dusty, but I'd imagine that's something to do with the manufacturer. Overall, a great purchase.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|the game is so cool because it is free and it is a hunting game it has good graficsand it looks so real and cool guns
B00C5R8364|4.0|I really like Frederick Forsyth's style of writing and will continue to read his work. &#34;The Kill List is one of those books that it is very difficult to put down.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Good CD. She has a different style. Enjoyed it<br />She is very young but has quite the voice!<br />Royal is my fav song on the CD
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Muy buena película para disfrutar en el cine en casa. Hay películas que las estoy esperando para volver a verlas en pantalla gigante con la nitidez que nos brinda los blu ray. Muchas gracias. Excelente película, y excelente los extras que trae.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|There's nothing new I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. Buy it!  You will not be disappointed.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|This stuff is fun! I got it for my niece and nephew as a gift. If you fold it like a ball of dough it produces this really cool effect. I'd recommend picking some up!
B006UV8DJS|5.0|I love this app! It's very easy to use. No pop up ads which I love. This app worth down loading!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|App states you can plant ANY Rare Plant to earn Rare fish....not true! I needed to plant 10 ANY Rare plants to earn the rare fish of The Vampire Crab, within 48 hours. SO I planted 4 rare plants for $1200.00 sand dollars each, plus 6 rare plants for $10000.00 sand dollars each, plus 2 rare plants for 10 pearls each,to earn the vampire crab. The application only recognized the 2 rare plants I paid for with 10 pearls each and the 6 I paid $10000.00 each, not the 4 that I paid for with &1200.00 each. Time ran out and I Did not earn the vampire crab...bummer!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app.  I play Farmville all the time and thoroughly enjoy it.  My day would be totally horrid without this app.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Enjoyable look into a crazy hedonistic life . The author paints a vivid picture into a crazy life that frankly I'm shocked he can remember
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Same reasons as &#34;Escape Challenge&#34;.  You really should include some kind of instructions to these things so people won't get frustrated.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|After all the hype disappointed by this. Maybe should have started with first book. Have lost interest in this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This helps me keep up with the weather and to track it during stormy weather.  It also helps me to decide how to dress for the day by letting me know what is expected.
