B004HMBK5G|5|Iv'e used these for years! Love em! good deal! quick delivery!  A++++++
B00GSAUHB8|5|I bought one based on reviews, fits my Nissan Armada great, temperature in the car is so much lower now, easier for the a/c to function.  Bought a second for my Ford Escape...larger windshield, still fits.  Great product, have only had for about a month so can not speak to durability, but so far so good. would buy again (as I did).
B000ET5264|5|I got this to check the air on my tires, I have not tested it yet but when I do, I will update the information.
B000I60SGC|3|Good ramp but I particularly wanted a feature shown in one of the photos which is not actually included with the ramp.  The flat rubber coated pads at the end of the ramp shown in one of the photos not included.  Instead they send some rubber tape to wrap around the edge which sits on the tailgate.  Disappointing, but otherwise a great product.
B00I548PZA|1|Max mate sidebars did not fit my 99 wrangler tj. The brackets did not have enough room in the slots to install. I had to modify the brackets. The bars were too long for the brackets I received.
B00DSIIQNO|5|beats the heck out of my old ghetto tennis raquet wraps. Had to modify a couple things as the length did not match my Honda but that was my fault. Check your exposed length on your acelerator side or if you are smarter than me, just loosen and move the starter switch housing
B00JOY6U7U|5|Well built gator clips that get you a cigarette outlet from your battery post.  Works great with trolling batteries on boats with no cigarette outlet.
B001O7PNNM|4|Made six year-old Toyota look 4 1/2 years old.
B007B8PIWE|5|Got the item on time and as advertised.
B00029XDA8|2|Product (Trim Brite) appeared to have exceeded its shelf life.  And it did not adhere very well.  It seemed to have been dried out.  Shipping costs were confusing.  It showed $4.00 for the product with a total of $15.00.
B002ZTMA02|5|perfect fit ! High Quality
B0006VORDY|5|Awesome and heavy duty!
B00CO853RG|5|Excellent product / delivered quickly and packaged to prevent damage. Installation simple.
B00P2D41OQ|5|SO much better than stock Toyota backup bulbs--we can actually see something now!
B0014B9RDK|5|Work great no dust at all
B003J9IXT4|1|didn't fit car although it was listed it would.
B000EH4V18|5|excellent
B009WDX1NE|5|Quality product.
B00T5EGQSW|5|I have had envelope style cargo net in my cars for over ten years.  I brought a new 2015 Chevrolet 2LT and surprising there was no cargo net.  The dealer wanted $60 for the cargo net.  This net is no different than the original net, and cost $22 and fits perfectly.  I am completely satisfied.
B000CRO4FI|5|works great
B001NZO8YU|5|Saw a video on YouTube about how to fix my air conditioning in my f150, and it sent me a link to Amazon for this part I needed, and everything worked out perfect!
B007Y85O3O|2|This did NOT fit my FOCUS 2002 ZTS 2.0L Standard Transmission and no help finding the correct one but return and refunding was prompt upon return of the part. Not Awful just not good going through hassle of installing and removing to prove it would not work without correct hole alignment for all 3 bolts not just two.
B000TCTD3Y|5|I've been using Odyssey batteries for several years now, and in my opinion, there is no better battery made. It doesn't matter what the purchase price is, I'll always purchase Odyssey. I'm currently using the brand in two motorcycles, a Dodge pickup, and a ham radio aprs tracker.
B00192JFBI|5|bugproof
B006FZBLJ8|5|Haven't installed yet, but came well recommended.
B008BE02GO|4|Not a blue hue they're whiter just not by much Still all in all they reflect better and brighter white looks better than nasty yellow
B00W92PG7E|1|Therefore I ordered another serial number, but got the same one. Obviously it still does not fit!
B00026Z3E0|5|Very sturdy and easy to use.
B007ZLL03S|5|Fit great on our car.
B00UDTBCPA|5|I love SAMOA!!!!
B0009IQZJS|5|High quality, solid orange, smooth no bump grips....
B003ECULUU|1|Not worth it.
B000E2CVI8|5|Have been using K&N filters on my Triumph T Bird Lt since I got it last year, have used K&N on most my vehicles and they have alwayd performed great. I love the hex head on this filter it makes it so much easier to change.
B00COORWXI|5|These lights/ballasts work great. I installed these and new headlight wiring in a 1986 pickup. One of the bulbs arrived damaged but the seller quickly sent a replacement.
B0010GG7YG|5|Works great on my 2010 GMC sierra Z71 SLE
B00FGLS4PQ|5|This shield is great. I got the Dark Gold color, and it is a little more blue/gold depending on the angle, but personally, I like it. It is a little easy to get fingerprints et al on it, but I think that would happen with any mirrored shield. It's not TOO dark that it can't be used in twilight hours, but definitely too dark for anything less than a very well lit street at night. Bell did a very good job with the newer release system on their STAR/RS-1/etc. shields. Being able to take one off and put the other on in 15 seconds is great. No tools required, just pop it off and click it on.<br /><br />I will update eventually with how well the finish holds after a couple riding seasons.
B000AURZ08|5|Best I have had. No more brake boiling. Used on track car. Great stuff
B00DILTFP4|4|Bosch 40320 SteelTech Wiper Blade - 20&#34;<br />This wiper was crazy easy to install took under 2 min to do unlike the other wiper we installed on the same day<br />that one on the other side of the window took nearly 15 min lesson learned will replace with this brand from now on.<br />Has been working great so far nice clean swipe does not leave any streaks behind. Great solid contact with the window.
B00L4TF32G|5|I use this the keep the cover of my SC hot tub in great shape. No silicone and very easy to use. Hard to find in the economy size and the price fit my budget.
B001TXDO8C|1|Didnt fit my bike, i know i ordered the right ones but for some reason they didnt fit
B0006N5RYK|5|Excellent replacement cap. now have option to empty grey water without removing entire cap.
B008BA97WS|4|Great
B00QL6PIZ4|5|Had it installed and seemed pretty simple. Looks great and serves the purpose I needed.
B00076NXYM|5|Good secure fit from interstate to mtn. roads.
B007I6RDW2|1|it said it was for a 2013 Honda crv it did not look like the original one that was in the filter box so went to local store to purchase the right one.
B00KWLKSAO|3|I ordered two, so I'd have extra on hand.  One was in good shape, the other came looking like someone was trying to cut it & stopped part way through. So, two ordered, only one useable.  I still want an extra on hand, so I will get one elsewhere.
B000E4RYLA|5|Works better then original
B00C7XZHC4|2|Because the discription had &#34;RH&#34; in it I thought it was only one side and ordered twice to get both sides and wound up with two sets.  Confusing.
B0000ATZD5|5|Bought this to lock the spare on my SUV. It is the perfect length for this application.
B007VREENY|4|Great jack  does a good job ,and lifts high what a nice surprise.
B006R5QI4Y|5|Does what it's supposed to. Our Audi A4 Avant with panoramic sunroof was having issues closing all the way. After looking at the mechanism, I could see the slides and rails were dry as a bone. I cleaned them out then applied this to the proper places and the sunroof is now working better than it has in many years. Item shipped quickly. This amount should last us many years of regular maintenance.<br />You could try other &#34;normal&#34; greases but this is specifically designed to withstand the elements, huge temperature swings, and dirt that the car would normally encounter.<br />Doing this yourself is easy and will save a lot of money compared to a dealer visit.
B0036GDL2O|5|The rotor arrived a day or so ahead of time and is just what I had ordered. Installation was not difficult and the included ABS ring screws was a nice touch.<br />Best of all, no more &#34;cowbell&#34; or brake squeal.
B012B5WF2C|1|I needed to insulate the generator compartment on my motorhome to cut down on the heat and especially the sound.  The Noico hood liner was $10 cheaper than the DynaMat at Amazon for what appeared to be the same product.  I have used DynaMat for years on several different vehicles and should have known better than to change what I found works just to save a few bucks.  In my opinion the Noico is a cheap imitation.  The foil is thinner, the release paper on the adhesive side is difficult to remove and tears as you pull it and the adhesive not as strong.  It may cut down on the heat, I don't know yet but it definitely did not decrease the noise level.  Sorry I used it, should have returned it.
B000CPI5ZK|4|This seems to have cooled down my WRX a bit....I've made many upgrades to this machine and it was beginning to have overheating problems....adding this to the fluid in my radiator has helped.
B000C9DHIG|5|Perfect fit to replace the factory one the broke. Same functions as factory. Would recommend to anyone needing to replace their stock unit.
B003U1NQOS|5|BOUGHT THIS FOR MY CHEVY CAMARO. LOVE IT. JUST ADDS THAT EXTRA &#34;PLEASE GIVE ME A SPEEDING TICKET&#34; CHARM. EASY TO APPLY AND STAYED ON IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER. WOULD BUY AGAIN.
B001UCGQ28|5|work fine
B00032KBFE|5|This is great hardware!  Just FYI, the plastic boots the screws set into make your plate stick out roughly 1mm or so, enough for moisture to get behind, so protect your plate.
B005R4KXUG|5|Really great product at an affordable price was satisfied because they were brand new and easily installed them in my truck.
B0007OWD2M|5|This is the best glass cleaner I have ever used.
B005C5DL54|5|Straight out of the box and onto the bike.  All I needed was a little Permatex for the bolts and it's doing everything I ask of it so far.  Big trip in<br />October will be the acid test but so far--so good.
B00INSRXPG|5|Nice looking and holds to vehicle well.
B00MP08TOC|2|Each of the products (4ea., two shipments) has allowed moisture inside and turned the silver reflective coating around the LED’s to turn black.  I have replaced the defective assemblies with newly ordered ones. This time, I sealed the front lens with silicone rubber caulking. Time will tell if this works.  The mounting hardware is NOT stainless steel or rust resistant. I replaced the hardware with stainless steel nuts and bolts from the hardware store. The mounting bracket remains plain/painted steel…..will not last long on my 20’ pontoon boat.    Next step is to make a pair of aluminum mounting brackets or purchase a “outdoor” set of LED lights which are truly marine/automotive quality.
B003TUNRGM|5|Worked great; did the whole rear compartment of my 2015 Corvette. Not a night and day difference on sound but an improvement with road noise..
B005X97OHA|5|I give the dometic freezer a five because it does exactly what it says it will.  Through the years of Trucking and working construction I have owned every kind of thermal electric cooler that is made.  The size is perfect if you want a bigger one they make one just order it, but for what I do and what I use it for it is the perfect buy for me.
B00171V262|3|THis is NOT universal.  It did not fit my 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander without some major modification.  But it was still cheaper than buying from the dealer.
B0058V9CF0|4|Easy to trim, feels durable. Looks very nice too.
B003RAQAR2|5|Great helment fits well looks great!
B000E2AJ3C|5|still waiting on hardware but all is good
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent seller - Product arrived on time and was exactly as described ! Even though there are no sunshades out there in the market that can keep your car cool in 100 plus degree direct sunlight, I can definitely feel the difference when using the sunshade than when not using it ! My car cools a lot quicker when I crank up the AC ! That alone made me a satisfied customer !
B0097SUG5U|5|Warn, nice stuff
B001T1D0QA|5|removed the old lens and installed the Marelli lens in about 10-15 minutes... very happy, they look great and a great alternative to replacing the entire headlight assembly.
B00LMAXXYW|5|Bought them with my new axle and I have a 100 hours and they are still holding up strong.
B0002M79Q4|1|Did not hold right on the boat
B00B25PN0O|5|Wires were perfect, I should have bought a whole a stereo.
B000EPUCO0|5|Really works good!  Removes the bulk of the water making drying my vehicle with a single micro-fiber towel a snap!
B004A2WL74|5|works great, and for the price is a great value.
B00L40E1VO|5|Love them, just wish I were able to choose a color or scent
B000BUQOAE|5|works for me
B00EOE2L6O|5|Very nice. Easy to install. They look great. Everything I expected. Thank you!
B00JA80PEO|4|doing 4 stars because the holder that it clips into broke putting it on(gonna hotglue it i guess).  the little clip that locks it down is what broke off.  Volume is almost as loud as my earbuds.  didn't read the info on it but it has fm also.(nice to have but i mainly only wanted it to remove my headphone cord.)  made a phone call and went riding can hear just fine while cruising and mum said she only heard my bike when i took off from a stop(03 r6 with a straight pipe for a exhaust its loud)  she said no problems hearing me. and if it wasn't for me taking off a little fast to merge into traffic she wouldn't of known i was on the bike.  only hit 65mph but was able to hear loud and clear for music 1 song and 2 min phone call.  also only comes with 1 wheel light(not gonna use it just a fyi)  light isnt 1 color its all colors and fades and flash's between colors.  just gotta warm up my hot glue gun. so i don't loose it going down the road.  but will be ordering another one soon for the miss's  any issues i will update review but atm satisfied with it.
B0045YLG1E|5|Great product !
B009LQ7YAI|5|great product
B00T2G2UJC|5|Fit perfectly on my 03 Audi A4
B00C908EQ6|4|I used this to line the inside of an outside light to give me a yellow light for keeping insects away from my house light mounted near my front door.
B000GTZE5G|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B006H8KLLC|5|The person I ordered for, said it was exactly what they were searching for; very satisfied.
B005R5TLBM|1|Why in the hell do yall pair this with VCAN 136 helmet? It doesnt freakin fit ill be reporting.
B00KR3SB1A|5|This is a cover that you have to staple but if you have any sense you can do it and it looks awesome
B000HZW6I2|5|This is a great seat with lots of room for your passenger at the back. It's over 15&#34; up front and about 12.5 in the rear. The back support for the rider is just right and I comfortably put over 70,000 miles on my last one before it was starting to show severe wear and tear. I highly recommend it.
B00GSAUHB8|1|Very disappointed with this product. After seeing that wrote up from cupplier I thought the product would actually keep the card ask and car cooler. It does NOT. Maybe it's the sun here in Jamaica. (Must be hotter than anywhere else in the world. I'm being sarcastic now)<br />After using the product for 4 hours the dash was extremely hot as if it was not there. I can compare because I have used another brand. The accordion silver type, and it keeps the car much cooler. Very disappointed and to think that I bought two of them.
B000C3XDB8|5|Don't skimp on oil filters if you value your engine.  I use K&N oil filters on car, truck and zero turn lawn mower.  Yes, they cost more than a cheap filter and a whole lot less than a new engine.  Best oil filter made.
B000C2Y7B4|5|Fits pointed end facing into the engine, inside the black plastic sleeve on 2004 2.2 ecotech engines
B003VAXRF6|5|Look great!  a little of the brass stem shows, but not really noticeable.
B0085YFJ8Q|5|I use this on my black 04 Infiniti g35 sedan.  It works great at removing dust and reduces the need to wash the car as often.
B0041MCLW8|5|Perfect!
B0013REXO8|5|fits perfectly over the 2015 Wrangler tail lights.
B000AXHPRS|5|Absolutely perfect, exactly what I wanted and expected.
B00E9CZLF4|5|Perfection
B00U46XXPE|5|I am really impressed with the quality of this seat cover.  It's sleek and molds well to the seats.  It's very simple to put on and take off.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00IN5X2P4|5|Excellent. As described and fast shipping.
B0036E9VB6|5|RESERCHED ALL TIRE PUMPS.  THIS ONE  HAD THE BEST REVIEWS AND RATINGS!  GREAT LITTLE PUMP!  BEST PRICE  I FOUND ON THE INTERNET!<br /><br />  JUST RECIEVED  8/13/15  TRIED IT OUT.  PUMPS A LARGE VOLUME AS ADVERTISED!  ABOUT A POUND IN 10 SECONDS ON A 15 IN. TIRE!<br />I  RECOMMEND  THIS  PRODUCT !!
B00IDHGQ8C|5|Ok
B004PHDWMM|4|Haven't had to use these but I am glad to have them. The are nice and compact and look easy for kids to operate which was what I wanted. I installed them (very easily) in the bedrooms for extra precaution. My son said he feels safer knowing it's there and how to use it. I sure do too!
B008NCBT1Q|5|Got rid of the somewhat notorious BMW AC smell.  Happy/  Not much more to say.
B0076TH6W8|5|Great product at very reasonalbe price.
B00S0W6BIK|5|Still thrilled to be able to get gear for my Challenger here, no one carries these, they are great.
B00EIIH6PC|3|Product did not meet expectation.
B00ABW68N0|5|very good and it fits perfect.
B000C2ACTA|5|There I was, sitting at a traffic light when a 2003 Honda Civic rolls up large on me and my Corolla at the stop light. We exchanged glances, knowing nods, and then lit up the intersection with all the rage and fury that two 4-cylinder slush boxes can muster out. I was handily defeated, and in my shame I began to think of all the ways my manhood didn't measure up. I was defeated, embarrassed, and feeling a little but of water pump gasket envy.<br /><br />Thankfully the Fel-Pro 35643 Water Pump Gasket was there to save the day. It didn't actually fit my Corolla, but it does tell people despite my anemic car, I have much to be proud of. Thank you for making a great product to augment and enhance my sweet whip.
B000C94EDS|5|It really filled the space between the cat and the muffler in a way that not only contained exhaust gases and noise but also supported the front end of the exhaust assembly. Well done, Walker!
B000BXKZUG|5|worked really well on the trendmill
B0024NSLMA|5|Lights were as promised and make my 12 year old Tundra look like new.
B000C81NR4|5|Fits perfect, works well. Shipped quick too!
B00GUSKOP2|5|OEM emblems, very satisfied
B0017KOO86|5|This hitch was put on an RV in place of the regular hitch, this is the second time we have used the Rapid Hitch with great success .  The ability to pull a large RV without having the bulky in bed fifth wheel hitch taking up the hole back of the truck is a great plus. Gives you room for hauling extra items in the bed at the same time as pulling the RV.  The hitch is easy to handle and with the set back provides better ride and turning ability.  The vendor was excellent with great response.  Highly recommend the hitch and vendor.
B00QSHYVTA|5|Absolutely love these doors did not come with instructions but pretty easy to figure out they are very well-built aluminum fit on my 2015 four seater perfect I did one side my 15-year-old son did the other side so they are very easy to install got to adjust them a little bit but if you leave the screws loose and close the doors then tighten the screws up .for  the price they are absolutely awesome you will not be disappointedI have a few friends that bought the expensive doors and my doors actually look better and they paid almost $700
B000C9KF54|5|Quality OEM part
B00N39AKCS|5|These look great and worked well on my 2008 Silveraydo 3500HD Dually. Only problem I had is lug nut hole is a little tight for standard lug nut sockets
B00BXX7BCS|1|Can you post a picture, interested
B0049HKFIM|5|Perfect fit. Exact replacement.
B00FWOKKGI|4|has been working very well, very bright. hardware rattled out a few times before we locktited it in.  working great now.
B00GG9FSE2|5|I don't know how I've lived my life without this.<br /><br />I just got a new 2015 WRX and I've been washing it every week, luckily I have a heated garage. I like this stuff so much that I don't know if I'm going to switch to regular car washing or not when it warms up. It leaves an amazing shine and protective coat that I just don't see from normal car washing detergents.
B00CDDBAQU|3|not bad come in handy when others block vision, could use a spring at least for price
B000WK4VPS|5|Works just like the original.  No complaints.
B0082365AQ|1|The formaldehyde odor from the product tires was so strong I could smell it while still in the box at my doorstep.  Left it outside for three days to air out, hoping the odor would dissipate, but to no avail, returned it without bothering to try it out.
B000M6TWQK|5|This pad is the bomb!  I have stenosis of the lumbar spine which can be pretty painful on even a short ride.  Well no more my bro an sistas...I can keep up with the youngsters thanks to my airhawk!
B0000AYFTV|3|The only thing I didn't like about his was that the white wire was really short.  Had to connect more wire to get it to my lights as putting it into the frame of the trailer did not work at all.  This would be 5 stars if the white wire was as long as the others
B0081KZJAM|1|This thing can't cover half of a honda civics windshield. Period.
B000GRS3C4|5|Ordered on the weekend, arrived Monday, installed Tuesday.  Fast, easy install.  Looks good, does the job.  To remove takes only a few minutes by undoing only 4 screws.  I used a small metric socket wrench to tighten the acorn nuts once installed.  Fast, easy, looks good, works well.  Adjustable angle.  Thank you Amazon!
B00ZC20NUS|5|Just got it in today and it works perfect. The design is amazing. Love how it works. I'm gonna keep it in the glove box for when I need it
B00EUU7ITM|3|These are definitely whiter than the stock bulbs that came with the car. However, I don't find that they put out as much light as the Sylvania Silverstar ZXE or the Silverstar Ultras. But in terms of getting whiter/brighter bulbs over stock, these do the trick without needing to adapt H11 bulbs to H11B on KIA/Hyundais vehicles.
B0075NXIMM|5|These are the perfect replacement for your stock MINI brand plugs.  They are the exact same but about $40 LESS PER PLUG!  Have you priced out the plugs from the MINI dealership?  You will poop a little in your pants.  I am not kidding.  They are outrageously overpriced and they are exactly the same plugs as these.  I guess most people wouldn't change their own plugs but it's easy to do.
B00CVVUQ50|5|These are cool, Just installed the hood, truck and steering wheel this evening..  the wheel caps been on nearly a week, they have stayed in place well, fit and I took a 700 mile trip to San Antonio and then Houston this weekend and they all are still secure!!!  The hood and truck were simple to add, the steering wheel cap might need some glue its on but I am not certain it will stay on in the South Texas Heat!  Love the look and they are cheap to buy but look great !!!!!!!  Can comment on how they hold up in the weather since they were just installed!
B00ARAY46O|2|Not too happy with my purchase... They came off not too long after I put them on...
B000BQW5LK|5|it's a pump. works good.
B00UQ0WXIQ|5|These worked great on the front of my off road golf cart, and I just ordered another couple of sets for some of my Jeeps. Really nice light for such a cheap price. Great for backup lights, and lights pointing to the sides on the roof racks of our Jeeps. I will probably get more after my second order arrives. I purchased the wiring kit from another vendor on Amazon which made it really quick and easy to wire them up.
B0012X0MWA|5|As part of all new suspension on my 10 year old Grand Caravan, these were a great deal on a great product and now my van rides like new!<br />Having a second set of hands helped tremendously with getting the top bolts lined up!
B00XVC5NFQ|5|Worked well
B00K4C1MLA|3|Fits well decent viability  cheep but works
B001O1UE9Q|5|Very well made, comfortable, and looks very nice!
B000CPCBF0|3|I ordered this for my transmission, only to realize that I need their MT-90 formula instead (Red Line (50304) MT-90 75W-90 GL-4 Manual Transmission and Transaxle Lubricant). Use Red Line's guide online if you're not sure which oil to buy.
B00GRK06NS|3|Thought these were mirror amber not clear, no biggie use them on overcast days fit is really comfortable
B000CAVSQI|5|excellent item thank
B00OXWZ60A|5|2006 dodge hemi ram 1500, had the code ,cleared and poped up againg in less than 30 miles, installed this spacer on sensor 2 bank one, the one after the catalitic converter, 900 miles so far no mil light, I think that moving the exhaust sample pick up point it is what is changing the behavior of  the mil, since is less sensitive to changes in the lecture of the O2 from the  exhaust, it does not triger  the light any more, mpg same, engine performance same, price, you tell me 700$ for new oem catalitic converter Y pipe, 400$ aftermarket universal, 13$ the spacer, well for 13$ you can see  the  savings anf vehicle performs perfect.
B00IPMHALM|5|The only review I can write is weather it was the a Honda part or not. It's a Honda part, came in OEM Honda packaging, and works the equivalent of the OEM Honda antenna.
B0067UESK0|5|On Cavaliers and Sunfires, these mounts are a known problem.  They are easy to replace and make a world of difference in the stability of the engine.  A quick and easy fix.
B000CINDQI|5|Exellente
B0024E6UE0|5|Perfect fit
B004I0TH0W|5|Ok
B00TR47LX4|5|Excellent addition to the f150 for towing.  My truck did not come with one from the factory.  Installed this in about ten minutes, then took it to the dealer to have the computer flashed to activate it.  This will only work if you have the factory 7way plug at your hitch point.
B0022XKMUG|5|perfect fit.
B004IQ8RMU|1|Item is so poorly made it cannot be used. The nuts slide over the bolts without engaging the threads. The quality of the metal used in construction is also substandard. Plastic case is snazzy though.
B00J39CWK0|4|This brackets fit my jonway 50cc after the original bracket which came with the moped cracked and broke.....so i bought this one...it arrived quickly. ...better built! (welding)but still alittle flimsy....needs to be stronger so it wont break so easily! ..the new bracket is alittle tricky to put on!...i got mine to fit after some work.
B00E7VF22E|5|This is the third item I've purchased from Diode Dynamics. The shipping is always on-time and items are packaged very well. The plate is super sturdy and the adhesive dots they sent with the plates worked great for the door handle plates but I did not use them for this plate so I could easily remove and clean it as needed. Overall I love their products and enjoyed the style of these plates so much I had to take pictures and brag about them on Diode Dynamic's Facebook page. Get these plates!
B00W1WK9HE|5|Bought for our 2015 Jeep Wrangler and it works great. Only downfall is that you need to have the back of jeep loaded and both trunk top and bottom doors shut for trip because once the rack is on you cannot open the doors because the tire hits the frame. The inconvenience outweighs being able to bring what we need safely.<br /><br />Other wise, we love it.<br /><br />For storage, we placed hooks on the garage wall and it hangs nicely out of the way.
B007JMTQTS|5|Excellent Quality for the price point.  Well constructed, should provide years of use
B00AO6I4DU|5|Love this helmet 2 summers later...lightweight ..well made and very comfortable..<br />The clear visor is easy to remove and the sunvisor works 100%..Easy release strap very nice..<br />Just a greta product!
B00826OVWW|5|Love it, good product for a good price.....Helps save your back when working out in the garage...
B007TMPW28|5|Marines to stupid
B00QZA9O1K|5|Good parts!!
B000JEB3GM|3|Faded and flaked over a short period of time. Not good for cars or anywhere with direct sunlight and weather.
B006QNN41M|4|Mounting tape can come loose in hot weather, looks good and does a good job protecting the lid.
B002EIE2J6|5|great intake. fuel consumption is the same as stock. nothing changes. however, i felt like the car breaths easier. i can hear the air coming in when i step on the throttle.
B00276GB6M|5|The door hinge was the right size and I thought it would be easy to change----WRONG.  They are very difficult to get out, and then very difficult to put in.  WHY?  Because the door --unless supported perfectly square so that there is no pressure on the hinge from any direction, --binds it in tightly.  You actually need a puller or tool to get it out--there is no way to do it without it. (the tool)  In my case I managed to get it out, but not without saying many bad words.<br /><br />I would suggest you either get the tool, or see if your local discount auto parts store, (zone/oreilly) would rent it for free to you.  (they do loan many tools).  Its a hinge pin remover tool.  Good luck.
B008A5Y2GA|5|Perfect. Don't know what else to say.
B002EW5FWU|1|Destroyed my paint and windshield.  Be very careful, this stuff is lethal in the heat.  You cant leave on long enough to do the job before watering or it will oxidize your paint and degrade your windshield.  Please be careful - I have a 2014 and the paint and windshield is ruined.  I have a professional detailer that tried multiple times to get the paint back and the windshield but no dice!  Buyer PLEASE BEWARE!
B001F0GHSS|5|works great
B0000AXRH5|2|The sticker on the outside was the hardest thing to remove I have ever encountered and after trying gasoline to try and remove the film and failing this thing met the bottom of our trash can.
B0002UHVAA|5|This thing is awesome. Simple way to clean out the black tank,  mess free. No drilling holes into the Tank,  no jamming things down the toilet and worrying about splash back. Works best w good water pressure and some patience,  I usually run 5-6 fill / drain cycles before the tank really runs clean,  but that's fine by me. I usually bust this out every 3-4 trips or so and give the tank a flushing.
B000J3HS9E|5|Work great but instructions said there was a mark on left or right couldn't find it but easy to figure out.
B0009IQZH0|4|Work well for window cleaning and polishing car.  As compact camp towels, not so sure.
B003OGZZ5M|4|Hope it holds up to the rain but works very well for the sun.
B00SQWKCV6|5|Works great on my pitbike, and it's even a bit smaller than the stock one so it's easier to hide. Worked for 110cc motor and 125cc motor.
B00Y5GBDJC|2|RED COLOR RING STARTS FADING WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS ...
B009EU5ZM0|5|Tough stuff. My cat broke the top off of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X8V6I2 with his butt, and it has held ever since repairing with JB ClearWeld.
B003ZOLC8M|5|Works perfectly, and exactly what our Onan Generator needs, thanks!
B00LK20RPK|5|High quality, very easy install and nice exhaust tone.  Not too loud, but you know it is a V8 and a little louder than stock at idle.  No drone operation and quiet at highway speeds.  Very nice!
B00A7XY07O|4|Took awhile but I got it installed..it's working fine..
B000JZGMYE|4|good price
B001EOWRUW|5|Very pleased with this hitch.  Highly recommend !!!!! Reasonable cost and very versatile to move load forward or back, if room is needed in the truck bed.
B009OBVS20|5|After watching YouTube videos, I purchased Meguiar's Compound to use on my black enamel stovetop.  When the last tenants left my apartment they must have cleaned the black enamel stovetop with those green scrubby pads...it's a scratched up mess.  I was looking online to see if there was anything that could be done to cover up the scratches (I know short of painting they'll always be there).  For 10 bucks, this was worth a try.  I'm sorry I didn't take before and after photos because my stovetop looks amazing!  Yes, you can tell there are scratches there but it's 100% better than when I started.  Most of the really bad scratches around the burners are covered up.  Man, is that stovetop shiny!  I figure if I treat it again, it may cover up a few more of the scratches.  If Meguiar's Compound works this good in the kitchen, I should see what it'll do on my black car.  I think I'll pass that job onto my husband...
B0058J4ZCW|4|Have not installed yet as car is at shop having engine rebuilt.  Parts look great will look good once installes
B0049IBLR0|5|Thanks, These look really good and fit perfectly.
B00YIA2VH8|2|Too big for my car
B007LLAC22|3|Color was different from the picture.  The cover is pretty tight but it works.
B00U82F5YQ|1|Part came defective. I guess you only get what you pay for.
B00BVB58R2|5|Got here faster than I thought,  love it
B002XL2IBS|3|works like stated, but it is cheaply made plastic. Not sure how long it'll last.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great tire pressure instrument!!!!  Love this because it is easy to use and big enough to see the numbers!!!!
B006EGQALC|4|rec'd as promised and as advertised
B006GFU5E4|4|Fast shipping... Bought them for my 95 1100C2 shadow ace. Bolts were too long had to cut down but fit good. Had to take the helmet lock off because it was in the way. Took two people to do that. Other than that it works good.
B000VUASBK|4|The relay worked. If you are purchasing this because you think the relay is made in Germany, it's not. Similar to many of the other German parts manufacturers, the non-dealer parts supply is made in China. However, the hope is that the quality control is there because it has the Hella branding.
B005HRV2OE|5|Looks awesome on my pro-4x!!!
B00FF1K7BQ|5|Smells like new car leather, fast delivery!  Thx
B003WOIT04|5|Ordered this part and received it promptly.  It was exactly what we needed to seal the toilet bowl, and eliminated the leakage.  No more sewer odor.  Highly recommend.  Easy to install!!
B00PWYM5ES|5|Perfect
B00FY7ZH52|5|Just what I needed, and it arrived on time
B00629VX54|3|Print the instructions off of the internet.  Instructions that came with mine appeared to be copies of copies of copies of copies, etc.  Pictures were so faded I couldn't tell what was what.  If it was 4&#34; wider it would be better, but it works fairly well.
B000N5U5VG|5|Great battery!!
B0040MC4NK|4|I am very pleased with my draw bar except for one thing. I had to grind out one of the holes to get my locking pin to go through. I expected this from all of the reviews that I had read but there is still no excuse for this. If they can't figure out how to center a hole and drill it properly maybe they should hire me.
B00SX9XU1G|5|Fast shipping good product
B000BC976K|5|Man is this thing absorbent!  I've previously only ever used genuine leather chamois to dry my vehicles so was a bit hesitant to swap to a synthetic towel, but this thing works amazing!  Very happy with my purchase.
B00NWCM4Z2|5|So far so good.  Water seemingly wipes away once I put these things on my metal window sticks.
B00KWGHLOK|5|It's from VW it should work the best
B00P2K08J6|5|great item A++++
B003B04ND6|5|This is great stuff for my FLHR Road King tranny. Add the cost of shipping and this gets pricey. I wish I could find it locally here in the foothills.
B00B73ERHG|5|great item A++++
B00JU3X7BC|5|Nice!
B00KLZ65GM|3|Made a little cheap and smell. Price was great compared to others and you get what you pay for. I bought several since I don't expect them to hold up. Looks are OK not great.
B00CPYFOVO|5|👍
B009LQ88KS|5|fit like old ones. went on easy.
B002N59LLO|5|They're fuses and they work.
B000IZ29XS|1|Wrong part
B004J3MAS4|5|Smooth stops, no noise....haven't noticed much in the way of dust yet but this is only week 1.
B004ZBD69M|5|i love it...as expected
B001TPSVW4|5|Fit perfectly and was a great price.
B004HIGDY8|2|System is not as loud as I thought it would be, fitment around spare tire and rear is a little tight.
B00GRSOJSS|5|Well satisfied with the results.....easy, fast and safe..I would recommend it to anyone.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with Torque Pro.
B00RY8XCUQ|5|GOOD
B002UC2V26|5|exact part we needed
B001KSCXEM|1|This DOES NOT FIT my 2008 X3! Even the Beck Arnley site lists this as the correct part, but it is a different size than the pan I removed from the car.  Very inconvenient! I'm now waiting for the correct part and paying for next day air.  I won't be trusting BA again.
B00RAJ4VAE|5|Looks great on the bike happy with the purchase!!
B001MSIE52|5|matches my other one perfectly
B001UGNDIE|3|To small
B0002Q7ZKK|5|Plug and play. No wire splices. exactly as described. Worked perfectly on my 1997 Toyota Tacoma. Fast shipping. Easy to follow directions
B005JXH6YQ|5|These have LASTED ME A LONG TIME!
B00RLY4G1M|5|great price great item
B00IQVY35S|5|Good product
B0027M6WRY|1|Yamaha must be joking to think this piece of dung would be at all useful. A true knuckle buster.
B00OX1WIT8|4|I had to do some finagaling to get this to fit and stretch open on my backseat, but it works well and serves its purpose. I use it as a back up diaper bag, its filled with diapers, wipes, extra clothes and bottles. I love not having to panic if I forget anything!
B00JM9TMZY|5|Good quality
B000C30J3I|5|Fits 1999 Chevrolet blazer perfect. Not a squeal or noise.
B00KMDEUJM|5|Good
B003E60T6M|5|This one replaces the super loud Sachs clutch my shop recently installed.  The Hella is a perfect fit on my 2005 325XI and so much quieter.
B003AT8LMW|1|Despite claims: Did not come with hardware. Did not fit standard 1999 Cadillac DeVille. Did no have instructions. However, they did return my money.
B0013THZ3M|3|One of the plugs didn't work in my mower, but thats some times happens
B004K9GJG6|5|Great
B000C5YCZ2|4|Product was as advertised is working well check engine light when tout with reset
B00B9DE9EA|5|I love this spray wax - it is very easy to apply and buff out and it shines better than any of the other products that I have tried (and as a clean car fanatic, I've tried a lot of different waxes over the years).  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.
B00V5QDJI8|5|These knobs work great. They allow you more precise movements.
B000KDZJL2|3|The unit is ok it looked used because the Velcro that holds the speakers and boom mike in place liked like they had been stick to cardboard or something...
B00O6HDULE|5|Looks great in the front of my car!
B00IAOSK46|5|Great cover. Fits snugly. Not only does it have the mirror pockets, but it has an antenna pocket with a small hole for the cover to slide over the entire antenna. Took me 5 minutes to install by myself. Great price.
B002SB03IS|5|Works great and looks great on my 2015 Tacoma Long-Bed.  My cargo no longer slides around.  Easy to remove and replace as desired.  It's such a perfect fit and look, I wouldn't mess around with non-Toyota mats that might be a little cheaper.
B001TNX0IQ|5|Best freshener ever invented.
B0058P3D2E|5|Fit correctly & is holding up well so far! Thanks
B00RW7WB38|5|look nice and work great. a great price for 2.last more than 10 months
B000VKZMWA|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).  I added a new rear Oxygen Sensor as well, given the 10 years on the original.<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B008FCE8IA|5|Great product!  Exact OEM fit. It took about 20 minutes to install.  This is a must if your Traverse only has the hollow plastic side rails.  You need metal side brackets which fit into the plastic rails you have in order to mount the cross rails.  The flexibility to now use my rooftop cargo carrier on long trips is great.  No need to lose the rear seats to luggage/coolers/tents/etc. Wish I had purchased years ago.
B0012WW3X2|5|The rear gate on my 2005 Grand Caravan opens and closes like new!  Just remember to mount the new lift to the body, before attaching it to the gate!
B009VOQ05U|5|Great product, all ready have had people ask where I purchased this from. Looks great on my truck!!!
B00QMF1HCW|4|Great thanks
B000AL8VD2|5|Love this stuff for improving contact on electrical connections.
B002A33S2W|5|Used when replacing the rear diff fluid on a 2005 Honda CRV. They look *slightly* thinner than the originals, but got the job done.
B00W2O5YW6|5|looks great, fits great.  Very well built.
B003ZVPMFY|1|Not genuine
B00KUI13C6|5|excellent product
B009CC0Q92|5|This was very easy to install in my 2011 Sierra 5.3l. I can tell a good difference in performance and a small gain in fuel economy. It also looks great!
B00B72IJWG|5|Exactly as pictured, true GM OEM part.  Don't fall for the other guys that &#34;say&#34; theirs is OEM and they send a knock-off.  Buy genuine GM OEM parts from this guy.
B00YW8KTKM|5|Good looking and nice
B001F1B93K|5|This is made for a Ford Focus sedan, but also works great for the first generation Mazda 3 as well!  I installed these into my 2004 Mazda 3 hatchback (which is lowered about 1.5&#34; on the eibach prokit--you have to modify the spacers if you are lowered like I am) to reduce rear squat when I load up my hatch or have people in back. It works wonders! It really helped restore the good handling of my vehicle when loaded down. I definitely recommend this.
B00OPZ6ST8|1|One of the lights did not work out-of-the-box, unless I wiggled the cable just &#34;right.&#34;<br /><br />The LEDs and their apparently all-aluminum housings, are great.  The color and brightness of the LEDs are better than two other brands I have tried.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the wiring of these lights is of such very poor quality, that I returned them, immediately.<br /><br />Not only does the wiring look terrible (a long, kludgy, mess of thin wires and delicate-looking connectors - look at my photo to see how these lights compare to two other brands); they also feel like they would not hold-up for very long to the temperature and vibration conditions under the hood (...given the fact that one light failed out-of-the-box with a poor/flakey connection, I don't think I'm jumping to some paranoid conclusion, here).<br /><br />...anyway; it's too bad the manufacture didn't take the time to develop a cleaner, more robust cable assemble for these.<br />I could have really liked these, if they just had OEM-quality cabling and connectors.  :-(
B0039T059U|5|We replaced the univolt in our 1977 Excella 500 Airstream camper and the Progressive Dynamics converter is working great.<br />We are new at the camping and renovating the airstream,  and this was the first time with<br />the electrical.  We ordered the converter from Amazon, and it arrived promptly, and was<br />very easy to install.  We checked several places and Amazon was the best price.
B000C8NTJE|5|Works great. Perfect fit on 2004 4.3 impala. Took care of squealing, misaligned belt due to outer ring slippage on the old factory one.
B004YHOAMY|4|The Black light did extremely well on my Black Lexus GS350 made the Black darker and gave it a good shine however the V7 Optical wasn't really anything special other than it smells like oranges when putting on? The applicator pad is pretty good quality and seems to do just fine applying wax onto the car- easy to clean as well.
B00U5LPYYG|5|great value good product
B0020T17J2|5|good deal and fast shipping.
B002J7VX4Y|1|Smells of melting plastic
B003PJJY1E|5|really pleased with this product.bought this as a replacement for the class 3 hitch that didn't fit my 90 Isuzu amigo as described.I had to party for return shipping on that but finding this unit for the low price made up for the first unit's return and I still saved coin.installed easily, all hardware was present and clear instructions were included.I torqued the bolts per instructions and used blue thread lock as an added measure.
B00AZ8HXKW|5|best gloves
B000C9GK9O|5|1256-7733 is the GM part number. If you go to the dealer this part is $57.50, this is an awesome buy. If you have the money for a little bit more you can purchase the valve that already comes screwed onto a new pipe it's worth the money.  These valves are tough to remove from the pipes and if I ever have to replace them again I will purchase the ones screwed on to the pipes already unless you want to wrestle with removing the old valve and just using your old pipes. Don't forget to buy the washers if you're replacing these either.
B005UK3AWU|5|Great quality, fast shipping.exactly as described
B000IYSKAK|5|needs a small cut to fit , found video on you tube took less than an hour to install, fit perfectly . great product , cheapest price by far .
B002092DWC|3|Cheaply made but does the job
B002YK7G24|5|Got it, Thanks!
B000JFJLP6|2|Purchased this product as an emergency backup for my boat.  Charged it fully and used it once within the first 90 days from purchase.  I went to recharge it and the recharge light didn't work.  I called the company and they said to send it back.  $30 in shipping and they sent me a refurbished one as per their service contract.  I don't think this is a quality unit and I believe most people will purchase it for emergency use or a backup. What is the sense of having a backup that doesn't work properly.  Most likely it will fail again when I need it most.  If nothing else the return policy should cover freight as it is expensive sending it to KS for repairs.
B00DBESE64|5|the lights work great look nice thank you
B00KR3SGZ6|4|Works great
B0050SFZBG|5|Good Products/ Good Prices/ Fast Shipping
B00HNW8MJ4|5|This is finally a steering wheel cover that fits my car, feels good, and grips the wheel safely without any slipping or the outer layer peeling off.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Great price for 10 bulbs.  They've only been installed in my dad's car for a week or two, but so far they're going strong.  He absolutely loves them.  It's an easy way (depending on the make/model) to class up your car and add a lot more interior light than the stock lighting.
B0087XWEQ0|4|I had to get additional sticky strips to make sure it would stay down.  Still bumpy in one stop.  It make the dash look a lot better.
B000LDGNN4|5|This is by far the BEST hand cleaner ever made. Hands down. I have tried pretty much everything on the market as a diesel mechanic on a ship. This stuff makes Gojo look like a girly dove body wash. Not kidding, this stuff works better than dawn dish soap, lava soap, gojo and diesel fuel and any other tricks to get engine dirt off you. It removes the toughest carbon, grease, soot, oil, tar, and even paint.  This is the only thing we used in the engine room of the ship i was on in the military. As a side bonus its also not as rough on your hands as the other scrubbing cleaners and actually leaves your hands moisturized compared to the drying effect other harsh cleaner leave you with - for someone that scrubs their hands really well more than a few times a day, this is awesome. Once you try this stuff and realized how clean you can actually get your hands - you wont use anything else.<br />It gets carbon/soot out of your pores, wrinkles on your hands and creases by your nails and even under your nails. its really really amazing stuff. worth every penny!
B00NAU9Y0Y|5|Great little carb. My pitbike runs better than ever. Needed barely any adjustment right out of the box.
B007GR4LIC|4|This cover is huge. It fits our Polaris 6x6 with room to spare.
B001F0IELG|5|perfect
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Looks great, works great. Appreciate &#34;ruggedized&#34; exterior.
B00PX1H9Y6|5|Well constructed and sturdy.  This is not your cheapo roll around shop stool by any means.  I suspect I will receive years and years of service out of this stool.  I would recommend this stool.  If there is a drawback to this stool it might be the design of the seat front.  I'm 5'10&#34; and at the fully raised position it does bite into the back of my legs just a bit  but not annoying enough for it to be a deal killer.
B00JIV0VX8|5|Awesome value, and it has provided loads of safety, I can now see much more than my shoulders.  Worth every penny
B00UZ0OHIQ|3|At first i thought this was a great idea and had been waiting for them to make this work with my 2011 jetta tdI. i used the app and was really good about checking it and making sure i had a good score but over time i just really didn't bother with it any more. Some of the features that would make it work better don't apply to my. like being able to really calculate the gas usage and how much is left wasn't available for any of my volkswagens my family has. i leave it plugged in still every day but i dont really check out the app. but Im going to leave it installed for if I ever get a check engine light.
B006X8AEDQ|5|Followed instructions and it fit perfect
B004JMV2UW|5|READ THE DIRECTIONS. I just went at it because other 3M installs I've done, but this one needed to be done in sequence as far as exposing tape is concerned. Good quality product and looks great. I was to the only issue with this product.
B001EK912I|5|I bought this to check the inside tires on the duals of my RV. It has saved some knuckle busting.
B00V5QDIU2|5|These knobs work great. They allow you more precise movements.
B00VIX5V70|4|the product runs small<br /> normal 3x ordered 5x fit nice
B00FOX5T6I|4|I have just finished installation,so I  would like to test it a little be longer to have a better opinion of it, it came without any diagram or whatever to connct it,so I did write to Kensun and they replay me inmediately.
B00C7Y8FGS|5|My husband was very pleased.
B0055PD1H4|5|Meguiar's has been in business since 1901?  And I've only known about it yesterday? Unbelievable.  This restored the plastic bumpers of my 20 year old car!  The other stuff too that cleans cloudy headlights. Amazing!
B004I0FCE2|5|The lights are perfect and they make my car look like new.Before this purchase my lights were glowing now they shine. Thanks Amazon.
B008CLNSFS|5|Great product and work's just as expected and great seller also.
B0030J3TCY|5|It's a nice sizes an firm
B003ALQCO4|5|Nice wire
B0082OYG3I|5|Works great
B0098M5LUK|5|Easy to install and worked very good
B000WJX2YA|4|EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, AT A GOOD PRICE..
B004RCRS9I|5|i have bought the costco brushes every other year for years only to have them fall apart.  I decided to look online instead.  This brush head is perfect and the bristles dont fall out.  It fits into a bucket just right and it has bristles on the side so you don't scratch the crap out of your car.  Just put an old broomstick on it and your good to go.
B00KTHU9MI|5|So far it works great !
B000C5YCYS|1|not at all still says it not working guess i got a bad one
B00ZZKGVY4|5|excellent
B005C5DL54|5|Excellent quality and perfect fit. Factory original at best price on the net.
B00KIP9VQ6|1|do not buy, fitment was way too tight, had an oily residue all over it and when I attempted to clean it off the vw symbol came off easier than the oily residue.  also everytime I went to remove the sunshade it would move my rear view mirror.  Junk.
B00390BS7C|5|It's a tool, worked and didn't break- what more can you ask. Seems to be decent quality.
B000BZIFV0|5|No complaints at all.
B007QXNIG2|4|Very bright
B0007VF9XK|5|Not as pictured, but thats okay, did the job to mount the Fey bumper to my truck with ease.  Attach everything loosely and the adjust for pitch and depth as you tighten everything down.  No complaints at all.
B00BCRMC1U|5|Omg this is perfect for my suburban I love pink, the seat cover are soft and durable, and its great that the bench seat cover unzips in the middle so you can put the seat up and its such an affordable price for everything that comes with it.
B005ZZH7G0|4|They look great, seem sturdy enough; they fit the shape of the fender fine, but the screw-holes of the mudguards did not match the holes of the truck.  I had to drill 1 new hole in each guard.<br />I am concerned that the shell shape will catch too much air force at speed and act as a sail which may have the effect to loosen the screw, or work against their grip.  We'll see about that.  The original guards lasted 10 years; I'll be happy with 5 from these.
B009IHQ1RC|5|A great product for someone that is looking to add some extra style to their car or truck. Works great in my 1992 Honda Prelude.
B00VGL86SU|5|Looks good.
B000VLF990|4|I thought this was original part.  It works but had to change the hardware on the vehicle, which was included
B002SA0TME|5|Just what the doctor ordered !!
B00GURLNVM|5|works great
B00192JGY4|5|Its somuch easier than guessing if you can pull the grilling event off with whats left in the tank!!!!!
B00MUF4Q6M|4|Seems well made and durable. Valet key comes off and on easily.
B00MJ7U0FC|1|Doesn't look like any of the pictures. Unless it's in direct sunlight it looks like plain black vinyl! If it wasn't so cheap I would have sent it back. Would never order again.
B00DV7FAJK|5|Perfect. Great quality, easy to install
B006M4AOCC|5|Item as described. Speedy service!
B00KJ8IY60|4|Totally worth the price... visibility is increased greatly... if you are looking for super bright, go with the 55 watt...
B0024NSMLA|5|Great buy
B00J3NPOG0|5|fits perfectly
B005JU5VUK|2|Was only a few weeks before they started leaving streaks.  After reading the reviews, I am very disappointed in these.
B00QRCQNU6|5|Love this!
B00JXYGXY6|5|The ite m was exactlyv what I needed and wanted
B001UGLPAC|3|CAUTION - This kit does NOT fit BAL SJ24 LoPro stabilizer jacks!!  If you have SJ24 LoPro jacks this kit will cost you another $150-$200 in different stabilizers. I learned the hard way... Purchased the kit (seller and delivery was great) and quickly realized that the swing bolts that fasten to the base of the jack were too short!  In summary, I had to buy 4 new jacks (Husky) which are FAR better than the BAL's in order to use this kit. After installing the new jacks and stabilizer kit I was not wowed by the results.  It did remove quite a bit of the movement, however, do not let those embellishing on the idea that this kits is &#34;rock-solid&#34; be your deciding factor to purchase. I also use 2 BAL X-tend chocks during setup to help with front to back movement. They are great wheel chocks and highly recommend them. In addition, Lippert Components is yet to return my email about the issue of not fitting the LoPro jacks... The company seems very mediocre in general and seemingly does not care about prompt replies to a customers issue with their products.  Overall, for the money it is an &#34;okay&#34; setup.  Actual construction of the product is good, installation instructions on the other hand were pretty much useless... Being a handy man with the tools and space needed to install this kit I would have rather paid someone else to install it for me.

B00GZHC2L2|1|The original bulbs for my car are better than those by far these bulbs just did not make the cut
B004T7Y5EW|5|Good steps
B002SA0SCA|5|just what was needed,very good product.
B004A30F6M|5|Fits my 2007 Impala perfectly, went on with no problems
B000N3CP7A|5|Looks and works just like the original fuel filter.
B009K4DKLS|2|It was ok. Not enough suction. But it worked. .  Have to vacuum. A long time with. Low suction.
B00JRLVO3U|4|It's really nice for the price. But you can't open the can to clean or replace the steel wool that it also doesn't have. All and all really nicely made and most important cheap..
B00O2JTF7Y|5|Looks perfect on my Vespa!
B00N7KNI1S|5|Love it!! Looks great, fits well.

B00B6QEV0M|5|good
B0068EROF6|5|Did 1800 miles in 3 days on a CBR1000RR.  Took the rain suits just in case.  Worked great, we hit rain a number of times.  Would buy again.
B00JO7M774|3|Good quality! Fit !
B00K72C1T4|5|Keeps my technology loaded car charged during weeks of sitting.  A cheap and simple solution that has kept my battery from being ruined. because of all the automatic monitoring that takes place while my car sometimes sits for weeks at a time.  The parts that connect to the battery can stay in place as I drive and I only need to connect the one cable when I return it to the garage.
B00NRVCOZS|5|Extremely easy to install. I bought a HID set from another manufacturer before this and I had to splice wires together to get it to work. After that set fell apart within 6 months, I bought Kensun's product and was pleasantly surprised. This particular Kensun set is extremely easy to install although the lights are slightly dimmer than my prevoius 6k set.
B00PQZPMYI|5|Love my seat covers
B004SSAEYM|2|Only a couple of weeks of use and one of the eyelets fell off. Fits very tight on a standard cab Ranger long bed.
B0002SA3WA|3|It's nice except for the fact that it has snaps instead of using the channel.  Had to screw it into the windshield.  Not what we thought it was going to be.
B002MRAB62|5|Really good product , perfect for customizing or just painting personal things
B00G2586NK|5|Great item!  Fast shipping!
B00062YA44|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B000H3TUE2|3|Pricey but worth it. Very bright
B00U68EBWO|1|Like I said rusted without rain exposure which in return rusted screws, garbage<br /><br />Hopefully the set I recovered was defective they were beautiful wanted them for my wife's car but can't take a chance again
B004H4ALIQ|1|Not cold enough
B0015FYQ90|3|not too much better that than my original rearview
B004C65DYQ|5|Great
B00EZWCFAM|5|Easy to use well designed no problems using it on newer pr older snowmobiles.
B00N3AG4C2|5|Great Vac for all kinds of clean up.  This is my third purchase.  One for the house and one for the garage and one for a gift.
B001IGE6ZK|3|These dry rot outdoors in a month or two here in Texas.  But they are cheap and useful to have around.
B00EM2HU46|1|Wrong size. But other than that, everything worked smoothly. But how can i return for smaller size?
B00S1JRHJY|5|Gift
B00B9EXNTQ|5|Came in a big box and in perfect shape, no plastic bag. Fit perfect and seems very sturdy. Also comes with retaining clips.<br />Excellent product. 2003 Tacoma 4x4.
B007N6R2NM|4|I ordered these to replace the extended shocks that came with my pro comp lift.  After about 4 years, my pro comp shocks had worn out, they were bouncy and sagging. I ordered these Bilstein shocks as replacements for FJ Cruiser.  They look nice and ride much smoother. The price here on amazon was better than the usual place toyota owners order from.<br /><br />Bilstein shocks are a good solid middle of the line brand that put out a solid product. You can definitely feel comfortable buying these shocks. They also make the 5100 adjustable series to lift the front the end of your vehicle.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend them anyone looking to lift their vehicle.
B00V39RAQO|5|Much better than I hoped for Easy installation , looks great, neighbor is now envious .. Thanks , I would buy this again if needed .
B00UHD4HJA|4|There's a decent variety of stickers in here. I used about 50-75% of the stickers I received to decorate my laptop & a uke. The rest you can easily give away to friends for free orrr for a dollar or two if you really want to turn a profit. Pretty decent, overall!
B00NPKDGEE|5|This little gadget matched my flint Micah scion perfectly. Install is a little tricky as long as you didn't self improvise your hardware for daily use I.e. cut the cord or mount the trunk handle switch off to the side. Sadly, I missed the recall by one month and Scion USA wouldn't budge so I hopped online and found this. The OEM replacement from Scion will break again, it is mounted to 4 plastic clips that are not meant bear any load. This gadget not only fits perfectly but it shifts the weight to the metal on the trunk itself. There are no instructions but there are several good videos on YouTube just search &#34;Scion TC hatch handle replacement&#34; and the first 3 videos should make it easier to understand. I will add that the plastic cover on the inside of the trunk lid itself is held by 6 heavy duty plastic clips that you need to pull apart. You will see two indented surfaces in the molding that you use to accomplish this. Keep in mind that once you remove the old hatch handle that you will need to re-use the gromet that surrounds the cable that goes from outside of the vehicle (switch) to the inside of the trunk lid. this will keep the water out and keep your installation flush. I've been using this for 5 months now and pull full force on the hatch and it opens perfectly everytime! Too bad Scion didn't just pay the maker of this and use it for its recall. Anyway the price is rich and much cheaper then the out of warranty,  temporary $196.00 band aide solution  I got from the dealership. Thanks MotorKing!
B00H43IABM|5|Great Moog quality and faster than expected shipping.
B00N9BU5YS|5|Boot was good as original, no problems with installation.
B000GKD5NI|1|Keeps falling down, it doesn't stay in place ):
B00JKSVT5S|5|Works just fine.
B00C6MSVQU|1|Product does not fit LEXUS RX350 2007. Product too short. I bought 2. Now stuck with them
B002XM4ZTK|3|The carpet looks good and provides a non-skid surface to the steps.  I was disappointed in how they have held up as two of the three I purchased have started to tear in the back.  These were more expensive than other step covers and I expected much better performance.
B006EGAIII|4|Product received was what I expected and performs for the reason I purchased.
B000C7W248|5|Great item..fast shipping
B0030ICO3U|5|Works great. Super easy install with minimal tools needed.
B00O9GWZ1S|5|Fit with no problems, super easy installation
B001AWJ90Y|5|Sweet
B001QVA6TW|5|3rd best on the market for replacement ball joints for a dodge front axle... Only thing better are dynatracs and Carlisle's
B0016LG0CY|3|Yep...fuse was blown when I got it. Factor in the cost of buying a new fuse (I got a 15 amp instead of the 2 amp one provided). Otherwise, it's okay.
B00JVTJSMW|5|Easy to install. Fits perfect in my 97 v6 mustang.
B007TY4QAK|5|good product
B00BSVUWOY|5|Love this product. It's made of towel material so its easy to wash, which is great because i use it to protect my leather from sweat while driving home from the gym.
B000ZFUYOM|5|Good quality and price.
B0052LQQFK|5|A must have for a dry seat on hot days. Well worth the money.
B00HAPGNAE|4|Fits  the Suzuki Alto  RA410
B002KNYN44|5|Fits perfect good quality very happy with purchase fast shipping , came within 3 days
B000F6F99G|5|Works best when plugged into door opener light. Keeps laser off when not in use. Children and small pets aren't tempted to look into red light.
B002SE1G9U|5|They look good and have performed well. They fit up to my F150 nicely and function as designed. These are flush with the door trim and do nqot bubble out like other brands.
B00TSSR1YS|5|Extremely happy, OEM Emblems, can't go wrong
B00EVSXMN4|5|Works awesome. Stops the 185 like a champ.
B0040D2QVE|1|These clips need to be modified to fit correctly on my 1999 Jeep GC
B007P4V7A6|5|Awesome and quick
B00SK63E54|3|It's a little thinner and flimsier than I thought it would be.  It does keep it nicely in place and has many different mounting points.  I went through the carwash with it in place and it turned slightly.  I do have one concern; it is made from aluminum and the tow hook from the car is made from steel.  If a salt gets between the two and water is added there's a chemical reaction between the two and it will make it impossible to remove.  However, I do like it and people have commented that it looks great on my mini.
B00A7LO4O0|5|Excellent quality product! Parts showed up earlier than expected. Very impressed with this value. Parts department at the bike dealer wanted $50+ for this hardware. The red anodised aluminum looks great as well. Won't hesitate to purchase from this vendor again. Great job!
B00GIY7OPG|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00U9YUHY6|3|The quality is a bit cheap but so was the price. The roof vent does not fit the sky slider.
B000B8N3GE|5|Received, thanks.
B00S8A0932|1|I like that it stops things from falling between my console and my seats but I have a small Chevy that has cup holders between the two side pockets.  The side pockets effectively cut off my ability to use my cup holders so whenever I have a drink in the car I need to remove the side pocket...This makes having the pocket useless to me.
B00AUMKVN4|1|This coil sucks!! It hardly fits it's too big, I broke the plastic boot fist time I fouled a plug and tried to remove a plug.
B005C2OK3O|5|Good value, lasts thru carwashes.  Hasn't gone thru an Indiana winter yet. True to pic.
B00DQU9WWI|5|Great product!  Easy to use, not too heavy.  Plenty ample sized.  We use under a carport... so weather production wasn't the issue.  Protecting from cats was!  :)
B000QQZ9H2|5|:)
B00UW1T31Y|5|worked great
B000AS3D3S|5|they are oil filters, nothing else to say. they are OEM ,so quality should be OK .
B000TM7HXC|5|I bought this thermometer for baking, to measure the temperature of my baking stone/steel.  It has proved more than adequate for the task.  Temperatures are quite accurate throughout the range, the laser is on target, and the shape of the grip is nice.  I especially like the fact that it takes AAA batteries instead of the 9v ones you find on some other thermometers.  The case it comes in ensures the thermometer is fairly well protected during shipping, and the meat thermometer thrown in is a nice bonus.<br /><br />You can't use this to read the temperature of shiny polished metals e.g. stainless steel cookware because it does not have adjustable emissivity, so it will give you false values.  However, you can use it to read the temperature of oil, so if you cook with stainless cookware, just measure the temperature after adding your oil.<br /><br />Overall I've found this thermometer to be good quality, and very useful for me.  It helps me know when my oven has reached the appropriate temperature so I don't need to preheat longer than necessary, and I can check whether my pans are hot enough, again without preheating longer than necessary.
B00CJ3KIEY|3|Didn't realize that it was only 15 oz. rather than a quart.
B000GV2XSU|5|Got this for my 07 Kawi. KFX. 700. NEW BARS CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER , HAD NO ISSUES WITH THEM. AND WERE FAIRLY EASY 2 INSTALL ,  ALL ON MY MACHINE .<br /><br />I'D DEF. RECOMMEND THESE FOR YOUR QUAD.
B00AEW1XQO|5|Great shipper!  Product is as described.  I received the product so quickly!
B00B2YHFO2|5|Great lights super bright put in ford passenger van all lights work great
B00473VOTC|5|Nice looking, work great.
B00IX5MOD0|5|Awesome!!! You can customize it and they do great job. Here the customized one pic
B00V2I85ZG|5|Awesome, thanks!!
B000WJNN8K|3|Expensive for plastic that is &#34;EASILY&#34; scratched. I would hold off until something better comes along.
B00MFZTUUO|5|Excellent value, a gain of 3mph top speed and better acceleration.quick delivery too
B000IE0EZO|5|Gave these as gifts on Christmas with a keychain flashlight.
B0007XTGCI|5|REALLY nice pin type jack stands.  Seem to be built well.  Works simply and easily.  I like 'em!
B00D8BFJP4|5|Looks good on my car. High quality vinyl.
B006DZEX1S|5|Exact replacement for my 2012 Mustang.
B003TNHEO0|5|No more hot seat! I hardly know it's there and it does the job I wanted it to do.
B005H6W0BO|4|One corner fogs up in the wash but I contacted Chase Limpert at The Retrofit Source and he is able to seal them properly.
B00JW57UH0|5|Nice
B00OWS4OEO|4|Really happy with this cover. Easy to put on, wish it was slightly wider to cover the holes on the top of the bed rail in the front front and rear. It was REALLY good to go to the Bestop website and watch the installation video. The instructions just leave out enough detail to make getting it aligned adequately a bit of a trial and error fitting, took me about 20 minutes by myself. I hope it helps with mpg for highway travel.
B0036WC7CS|3|Faded quickly
B000AP1MU2|5|sweet
B006UH69Q6|5|WorKS as advertised
B00M0CQNWA|5|I really like it but it doesn't fit on the sxt model..
B007ACZHOK|5|Worked as it should. Makes the system easier to maintain.
B0035B04HA|5|What can I say? It's awesome.
B007TY0G1I|1|Not good design, two pieces don t fit well together and no hardware except 3 plastic pins save little more money and get one piece design oem replacement.
B004IY9I0M|4|Hefty.
B004DRUPO2|5|great fit
B000VU91SG|5|For those of us who want some bed protection at an economical price, but don't need the full protection offered by a spray or drop in bed liner, this is a great choice!<br /><br />I have hauled everything from firewood, to a snow plow, to four-wheelers and a motorcycle, to mulch on this bed mat, and after being sprayed off, it looks like new.<br /><br />The soft rubber compound is tough but yet helps to stop things from sliding around the bed. This is probably also the closest thing to a drawback of this product, as it does not permit any sliding, so loading and unloading some items can be a challenge, but that's to be expected with a rubber bed mat.<br /><br />Overall a great bed mat for the price and offers outstanding protection for you bed!
B00S4QFGMO|5|works great
B0002MA4X4|5|Bought these for loading my lawnmower. They worked great.
B00BLKXW9O|5|good deal for the fluid.
B000CF6RX2|5|Excellent product
B0049I6TJA|5|works great
B00RIU09C4|4|Worked perfectly on his 2005 4Runner.  Great that it comes out if you want the entire space for occasional storage.<br />Took the full time-horizon to arrive, was slightly disappointed about that but was quoted delivery accurately.<br />No issues or concerns about the seller. Thank you!
B00UVXDIS2|5|I love my car even more with these minion decals. They're so adorable. Very easy to put on.
B00EFFYC6Y|1|Item did not meet state requirements to display the state of registration.  Therefore it was a waste of money
B00KTJ4WMO|5|Great,easy to install and feels better than original.
B009PHDNIU|5|Worked and fit perfect good job.
B00M1OUBES|5|a great product, i tried connecting it directly to a 2.4L Toyota Camry and it started the car, i wasn't pretty sure about this product until later i jump start a car with 5.6L V8 engine, and it did start the car so im very impressed with this product. a must have in every car.
B003U53JYG|4|I was hesitant at first to go waterless, but I after I had my car washed from waterless company I was impressed with the job they have done and off-course saved the water.<br /><br />I ordered the item and thought of giving it a try. I was impressed. I use microfiber towel with this.<br /><br />How to use this product:  terry towels or microfiber clothes.  Spray product generally on the car surface, let it soak for a minute or so in order to loosen any dirt or grime logged in the car surface. Then use a clean towel to wipe down.<br /><br />It took longer than expected but results were good.<br /><br />If you went for off road driving and wanted to clean your car/truck with this product - good luck.
B003EOX8OO|4|Winch plate is great and fits perfect.  Very strong and have no doubt it will hold up to anything I throw at it.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was missing some of the hardware from the hardware bag.  I was still able to mount the winch and plate, but had to use washers instead of the 1/4&#34; spacers that were supposed to be included.  I contacted Smittybilt and they quickly shipped me a new hardware bag free of charge and it now contained the correct 1/4&#34; spacers.
B003G9I4DW|5|Great replacement part. Fits and works like the original
B00SIQH8A8|5|Protects my classic cars
B004ME8MZ0|5|very fast shipping - perfect fit.  They were a little tight going on, but fit securely once they snapped into place.  The only issue I have is, I broke one while driving (narrow road - slapped mirrors with an oncoming vehicle) and can't seem to be able to replace just one mirror.  I don't want to buy the pair again.
B00YTFKWIW|4|this is a pretty nice set for the money. Mainly because of my ignorance, I failed to realize that the word one is for Chevy and the star one is for ford. Whoops! but I did find spots where it looks nice on my ford excursion  so all is well. One more thing, I didn't realize that the chevy version(worded) is actually individual letters BUT you can use the protective cover as a template to make it straight  Pros: Large(looks official) sticky high quality looks metal  Cons: Plastic(its strong plastic but would have preferred metal never the less) Individual lettering(template helps)  Would Buy again? Yes.
B001OKA1S6|5|Worked great in my Stihl blower.
B0008G5HMW|5|thanks
B000R4PFFO|5|Worked well on my pontoon seats.  You could tell the difference and made cleaning easier after application.
B002ESYSOK|5|Installed sockets in headlamps of 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Sockets functioning properly.
B00G53JCDW|3|The outter mounts are like rubbery plastic and doesn't hold in place very well also the studs are to short for the upper mount. Other wise work good defintly change it to hid lights those h1 bulbs are not bright enough for a lifted truck. Oh one othe thing pain in the butt to adjust up and down have to remove whole housing to do so. A lot of adjusting and mounting
B00CDJ8RLU|5|Nice product
B003RYOWH8|2|Uhh, I don't like these for &#34;my vehicle&#34; but will do for now.
B00DOOY88E|2|Item is listed as fitting Sienna 2005 - installed nicely but length of shaft is about 1.25 inches shorter than OEM shaft length.  Never used to bang my head on rear hatch (I am 5'10&#34;) - now it is common that I have to duck my head to enter interior of van.  Beware of this - a royal pain esp. if you forget to duck.  Otherwise product works.
B00GHS0BVW|5|Worked like a charm.
B004QEKG8C|5|We're using it this week for the annual beach trip.  It was easy to assemble and works great.  Carries a lot.  We thought there may be a little bit of wobble as it's not quite as tight a fit into the hitch, but it's fine.  One thing -- ROLA Expandable Hitch Tray Cargo Bag that's recommended with this...it's quite a bit smaller (in length) than the carrier itself.  Its a lot of wasted space that's not able to be filled in the cargo bag.
B000SL4A84|4|Great little kit to keep in your car or bathroom for any emergency situations
B004OFNJZ0|3|They're super pretty, unfortunately not very effective for me:/ It might be the crazy heat in Texas that it didn't work as well as the other reviews said, but it's not too bad.
B00SXKULY4|5|Fits perfectly and is made of high quality material
B001CMX45I|5|The right price for the right job
B00B57UFAM|5|Excellent
B00HJPFYZ0|4|Good sticker. Keeps its color well, even in AZ sun.
B000B6VTDU|5|Looks great as a front plate. Just 1 needed in FL.
B0094JURYM|5|The product seems to work very well.  I only just started using it so time will tell, but it is true it does not create pressure in the system.
B00DGG9Z8I|5|Great product and fast shipping
B00W5TCTX0|1|I thought that these were hard plastic covers. They are not. These are basically stickers. How Lund can justify charging more than $25 is amazing. I am really disappointed
B0024E6W02|4|It takes my poop away as promised.
B00DJBQ1SW|4|The ramps are great I'm happy with my buy ,I would like to recommend that you lower your price by $12.00 so buyers can us the money to buy new stapes . The ones that come with the ramps are pure junk !
B000BZMBH4|3|Good  delivery and good product.
B001OSR4FQ|5|we rode out to Sturgis SD from Ohio and it stayed on the windshield all the way there and back
B00KRQP3X6|5|Fast, undamaged delivery. Large enough for easy peel off the back application.  Nice &#34;heavy&#34; sticker with clean graphics.  So far appears to weather well.
B00MLZ8JZU|1|No instructions.. I have a 2005 Hayabusa, I also have the wiring diagram and the maintenance book for the bike and I'm somewhat knowledgeable.. but i couldn't get it figured out..
B00WB2K3D4|2|Cannot use with windows 7 or higher
B00RMHTRKS|2|Did not fit onto our 2013 Nissan Quest van's visor; the product does not extend far enough to grab each side of the visor.  I gave it 2 stars, however, because my husband retrofitted it to work, and we enjoyed the product on our roadtrip through national parks this summer.  I may have missed a listing of vehicles that it works on (if so, my bad) - but if not, that would certainly be a nice bit of info to have before purchasing.
B0083G3AXC|5|I wish I would of bought 2.
B00VWZVB7S|5|That's actually my white s7 car.  Product is perfect.  Fits 100% no issues.
B000GKJKGE|1|BULLY tailgate lock has to be modified to work. If you are not good with a grinder dont buy it. The lock mechanism must be grinded to fit or it will not work. If you want the bezel to stay on you have to glue it on. Bully lock by Pilot you are welcome to contact me about your bad design. This is not worth the $ and agravation.
B001GRRCRA|5|Fits perfectly and does what it is made for.
B00E6M9LVC|5|On time.  Work great.
B00BPXN0E4|1|Falling apart already.
B0097MX2XO|5|Perfect!!!
B0014YFBJG|1|Washer fluid was steady dripping out of the bottom of the new pump.
B00180FZRY|5|Works great.  I didn't even realize just how far gone my stabilizer bars were until I received them and the drive improved greatly.  Almost like a new car!  They were an exact fit for my 2007 Saturn Vue.
B000WNZOZG|5|I bought these for my Polaris sportsman. We're in Colorado and have some of the most challenging rock climbs. While other tires were getting punctured these stood up to the challenge. Lower the pressure to less than 8 lbs and these get even better.
B00HPYPMN4|5|great
B004QE7T7I|2|Too frumpy! Not my style. I like more structure in a cap.
B00FBPWO0S|5|great mat for our RV life
B008F8Q972|5|i work at a dealership that charges $160 just to restore headlights--I paid $62.00 for these replacement headlights--and get this -these come loaded with bulbs-yes i'm a happy guy
B007J7E3RS|5|Loved them!!!
B00076QA4C|3|This just does not work for me. It is a high quality product, but I need something more sturdy.
B000FW2MCM|5|i love it...as expected
B00K24MLTM|5|just as listed
B00062YBSY|5|they are very shiny and give your engine a great look but they are very hard to keep clean if your engine bay is not closed off, great valve covers but didn't come with gaskets.
B006B20V9Q|5|just as listed
B00QLDDC50|5|I put this on my husband's car, he loved it!
B00449IQN6|5|Easy replacement after the old one cracked while changing hoses on the 2.0L turbo.  The 2005 Saab 9-2x is 99% the same as the Subaru WRX, so this fits perfectly.
B000XVZ8F8|3|I'm not sure if I was using it right but the signal it sent down the wire wasn't strong enough to pick up through drywall
B00IDN72WK|5|Really  nice
B001DH820O|5|Perfect match to my original.
B004C1XQWM|5|I waited and waited trying to decide if it was worth the money for this unit.  Wish I would have purchased or two years ago when I was looking at it first time.  10 minutes to install, made a world of difference in my bike.  No more decel pop, runs cooler and exhaust sounds better too.  Might have to pull out my quiet baffles, lol,  now it's almost too quiet.  Best improvement to date.  And of course, it runs so much better.
B0051SUMEA|4|There are better steps out there.  Im not a fan that you install them by removing 4 body mounts and using two of their bolts.  The steps are great, just think they could have done a better job on how they mount of to the jeep.
B00I4A6ON0|5|Great Product!
B00D4B3OQ4|5|Beautiful cover.  It fits perfectly and zip with ease!  There is a slight sparkle to the paint which is great.
B00FMHJYT4|5|Exactly as described. Arrived on time. Easy to install. 03 Tib GT 17&#34; stock rims
B009AA4R14|5|Cotacted the seller with the make and model of my vehicle, and requested clarification as to whether this was the part. Seller responded quickly and politely. Part arrived as promised and packaged for its safety. Mechanic had no issues with installation.  Bearing is sealed, five lugs. Perfect. I should also thank the other reviewers who answered my inquiries promptly. Kudos!
B00CHKQWGC|5|Really fun! I use it in my delivery car lol. Really strong at first so I wish I had left the bag over some of it.
B00URS735A|1|Doesn't fit 2015 Nissan Rogue
B000BUU5VS|5|Good item. Fast shipment.
B009GO6CYO|5|Very easy to install.
B006QMIILE|5|Very nice.
B00LG07MZE|5|I have a 2006 Hyundai Sonata, and the Jumbo car windshield sunshade fits beautifully. I have used the twist-fold circular sunshades previously, so I had no trouble folding it back into a circle for storage. I am so pleased with this product and am glad I purchased it. I have only had the sunshade for 2 days, so I cannot speak to how it will hold up. If anything happens to affect my opinion of the product, I will update my review.
B00P1N8QU2|5|Excellent
B002Z39YG6|5|great
B000CSD29Q|5|Item as described perfect good price.
B003SYVK6I|5|Great fit. Looks just like the oem part. Easy install.
B001GN3H5A|5|Works perfectly
B004AIG6W4|5|New unit works great. Very powerful from old weak actuator. Thanks
B004D5Q296|4|I am just using this product for the first time now.  The filter in general seems to be well made.  I cannot comment on the filtering behavior.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the seal consists of an O-ring that fits rather loosely in the groove of the filter body.  Depending on the application, it could conceivably become dislodged during installation.  I wonder if it would also have a greater tendency to stick to the engine mounting surface on removal as well, but maybe not.  I suppose if its going to stick, it will stick.  Its not a deal breaker for me.  I'd buy the filter again.
B008E7QQRC|3|I'w install it with the new disks but they are starting to leave scars. Seems like material they made from very uneven
B00CNXMSJI|5|Looks sharp on a bright red truck!!
B002NBOWI0|5|spot on
B005HAYDR4|5|2 min installed and perfect fit plus it looks good
B008IT8TAI|4|Love the look wish it lined up a little better in the rear.  It is fairly loud but not unbearable.  If you are on an interstate it can be a little annoying after a while.  Installation is very straight forward, but getting the factory muffler off can be challenging.
B000NBVFN2|5|You need this tool.  I was skeptical, but bought it anyway.  my spark plug socket and extension would not have been easy, this is sized perfectly and holds the plug securely on extraction.
B00LT26LL0|5|Great product, quality material, nice tight fitment. I recommend not using the supplied self tapping screws, but instead using nuts and bolts to secure it to the bumper. This way you will not risk losing it at high speeds
B006H34BUY|4|Since my car mostly lives in the garage, this type of duster is perfect inside and out for keeping the dust off.  A few minutes 'petting' the car before leaving the house and I'm ready to go.  I only have to wash and wax twice a year now, which saves on paint wear.
B009774GCA|5|Excellent product, it works perfectly.
B0052U9WKC|5|These compressors securely hold the spring so there is little chance of failure. they have done all I've needed. Very satisfied.
B001FAK4B4|5|Exelent product as describe A+++
B00COYNZJ8|3|Doesn't ever unfold like shown in the picture. A good price & was excited to have it in my car windshield but it just folds up heavily & never really looks like the picture. 3/5 is being generous
B000WJX0WE|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B0002M79Q4|1|The mount is horrible, it is not deep enough and too weak.  I also felt that the mirror was not as convex as others I have had and doesn't provide a very wide view.
B009K9458A|5|Bright light at a cheap price. This is mounted on the back of my boat to see at night. It has been through quite a bit of sun/rain/other elements. It has held up great. It really is TUFF STUFF. won't waste my money on the higher priced competitors when this does what it needs to and holds its own.
B00Y1HSB72|3|I am still trying to program.
B00063X7LK|5|I actually used this, based on the advice of a handyman to reseal the stone counter tops in my kitchen and bathroom. I used one of those 'magic erasers' to clean first, then once it was dry, I applied this, waited 30 minutes, then polished. The effect is brilliant. The counter tops shine, don't stain when water gets on them anymore, and are really easy to wipe down.<br />It stinks a bit while you are applying it and needs a bit of work to polish, but compared to the price for getting stone professionally resealed, this is a steal, and did the job perfectly for me.
B00G25GOCA|5|I hit the hose with the weedeater. Tape fixed the leak so I didnt have to replace 100ft hose
B008427CZ2|5|Good price , clip well
B00099DV30|5|ok
B00ZGUEDZC|1|Fits great, looks great, but the carbon fiber interferes with radio signal significantly.  I don't listen to AM/FM, but Satellite sounds like you're always under a bridge, or in a parking garage, even under big open sky.
B004A6JA2O|5|This fit perfectly in my 2009 Corolla. I noticed an immediate improvement in the smell of the air, which I had not noticed before when installing a new filter. I had unknowingly been using lower quality filters (# 1816) from an auto parts chain store. I would go in, tell them my make and model, and they would hand me a filter. These filters didn't fit well and were so flimsy the last one folded up like an accordion under the slight pressure it took to secure the filter slot cover. Since it didn't cover the entire area it was supposed to, a significant amount of air was bypassing the filter, which I think is the main cause of my AC drain line becoming clogged (in addition to the filter being installed upside down: see blow). While dealing with the clogged drain line and flooded floorboard, I realized the filter was collapsed after it had been in there for months.<br /><br />This filter is rigid enough to hold its shape, but you don't have to force it anyway. This is a great example of the &#34;spend the extra few bucks for drastically better quality&#34; effect—except that this filter was basically the same price as the cheap store-bought one because of higher brick-and-mortar prices.<br /><br />NOTE: as another reviewer reported, the filter had to be installed with its air flow direction arrows pointing opposite the direction of the arrow on the filter slot cover. This was confirmed with some light googling and a highly scientific &#34;lick your finger and stick it in the slot while the air's on&#34; test. Toyota's UP arrow indicates the appropriate orientation of the arrow on their stock filters, but these arrows are the opposite of the actual direction of the airflow (which is down, from the top of the slot to the bottom). Naturally, these (and probably most?) aftermarket filters use airflow direction indicator arrows.
B004EBPKN8|1|Leaks bad installed it completely closed the valve locked it down took it for a test run nor leaks an yep over spooled and blew my turbo do not buy this pile of junk
B002N5JA2Y|5|If you have an RV shower with broken rivets, this is the solution.  The process was easier than I expected and these seem very durable.  I sealed under them with a small amount of clear silicone sealant and it should be a waterproof repair.  This is a much higher quality item than the normal OEM shower rivet.
B00NGIE1TE|5|Excellent
B000E28MWM|5|Fits my Odes 800 Dominator
B001GH5OBG|5|Great replacement for factory bushings. You get a little lift in the process.
B00VR8126K|5|Comfortable and good for the price.  Bought these after hitting a bird at night and cutting my knuckles, I think these will help.  Not sure how much they will help in a crash but at least they give some hand protection from bugs and such.
B007KPR5QA|5|I got this for my wife instead of spending $450 for a new seat. We intentionally bought one bigger then than the pillion seat and it works great. We rode for almost 200 miles one day and she did not complain.
B00U7SUY9C|5|I can not say enough these things are great my ride and traction has been improved so much
B00FS84PO6|5|worked great good product
B00XC2ZTHC|5|Great chain for price! Perfect
B00G3MLUP8|5|Fits my 2000 Acura TL perfect. Takes some man power to get on but once on, it fits great! It can withstand a high level of heat. Product smells like leather but after the first day the odor was neutralized.
B008032QKG|5|👍🏻💪🏻
B00RW78EC0|1|sent it back mirror sucked
B00MQ1DIXW|5|great kit for a good price
B00FB83ETA|5|Perfect fit!!!
B001KS4MXC|3|good product but does not come with a filter and the one on my gm was no good so iminstalled it without the filter..also does not come with the o ring to install it...i think the common person should order from somwhere else.
B000C5YCUM|5|It's what I needed and it worked
B000RFUYQI|5|Good Products/ Good Prices/ Fast Shipping
B00LPNA75Y|5|Very solid construction.  It comes with raw metal, so you have to prime it and/or paint it, but it's definitely built to secure optima batteries.
B0084UK1Z2|4|Picture does not do product justice. Two actual pieces, does not cover hump.  After reading more carefully I see the information was there I just did not see it. I will be keeping product as it seems high-quality and will do the job.
B004BWU8H8|5|I keep my gun in this box when I can't carry it in certain places, like a court house etc. I can fit a P226 in this box if I take the magazine out its a tight fit but it works
B0024NSWEM|2|inadequately packed/shipped.
B00T9SSMOU|5|Great Retro style helmet.  It reminds me of being a kid.  This helmet fits well and is light.  If you like an obscured view this will work for you.
B00YBFVOXM|5|Shipped immediately. Doing lots of cooking in our RV and these need to be replaced every so often. Now I have a good supply.
B00P2HRLXK|5|Perfect for carrying the moonroof.
B0009IBJE4|4|It did what I needed it to do and it seems well designed and well constructed. The instructions were a bit confusing, but I finally figured them out. It did not switch from testing to charging automatically, but did switch to charging when I set the charging amps.
B00IPDDWHW|5|All Wizard products are amazing!! Use them on The Harley and the 2015 GMC Sierra
B00ZGGORFM|3|Easy to install. Not as loud as I thought it would be
B000H2BPLY|3|These are great lights, but one of them has already burnt out. Not as long lasting as I had hoped.
B00DSD777U|5|Exactly as advertised.
B002ML8D7C|5|I really like this, this was for a very, very, close friend. He will be truly missed.
B00BXLEI2G|4|the arc in the ramps are more severe than I would have liked
B00B32DF24|4|These airbags made all the difference in the ride quality and safety.  Easy install on my 2010 Toyota Tundra.
B003085W8O|5|I love those protectors, they are really good. They don´t last to much, but are worth it.
B0050SFVO2|5|Wish I had upgraded to this earlier.
B002PYBZJO|4|As  expected, but need more time to familiarize.
B008032QSI|5|Working. Really. Good. Very. Pleased. With. It. Thanks
B00539UDHS|5|as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks
B00GKTZAHS|1|To small for my liking.
B0058VF7KO|1|They worked great but the right is all foggy now
B0076O0C1K|5|Best stuff out no need to scrub most the time
B0012X0MWU|5|As part of all new suspension on my 10 year old Grand Caravan, these were a great deal on a great product and now my van rides like new!<br />Having a second set of hands helped tremendously with getting the top bolts lined up!
B00JRYHG70|5|My original breakaway cable got pinched under the 5th wheel hitch. So I purchased this, and it seems to work well.
B00MC6RQAM|4|Very bright and work well. I use them as backup lights in my 2006 Sierra. They are a little more blue than I prefer, but pretty close to pure white light. A 5000k bulb would have been perfect.
B002W2R700|5|GR8 item THX
B001G79M4Q|4|It ok
B007Y2D3YM|3|Will not fit my truck.  I have a 2015 Ram Express 2 door and the vehicle selector on Amazon said it would.<br /><br />They look like they would be awesome!
B004J0R9Z6|5|Fits perfectly and works better than the original did. A little quieter than the stock fan also.
B0091ULAZY|5|Well constructed and easy to install onto the existing factory roof rails.  All I need  is the cargo basket.
B000CMF3B2|5|i used to sell these  loved them then  love them now
B00E5OUOCQ|4|It blocks sun well enough in my 2015 Audi S5. There is some space between the two collapsible rings that allows the sunshade to fit narrower windshields. In my S5, the shade is at its narrowest, which helps to hold it securely, but also causes a lot of excess material to hang loosely. It takes some time to position all the material to fully cover the windshield, particularly in the outside corners. Usually I use the sun visors to hold the top corners in place. It's definitely not a 10 second setup, and so far I've only used it when I know my car will be sitting in the sun for hours.<br /><br />The case is appreciated, but has very little stretch and takes some practice to wrestle the sunshade into. I found narrowing it to fit the case opening by squeezing the collapsed rings together helps, but it still takes some wrestling. The excess fabric on the shade makes it very bulky and harder to stuff in the case, so I usually take a minute to tuck the excess material in when putting it away. It's definitely not a 10 second take down either. There is an elastic loop on the sunshade to hold it closed, but it's too loose to be useful.<br /><br />I think a stretchable drawstring case to replace both the elastic loop and current case would make takedown and storage much faster.
B003BEI0FY|4|Easy install and mounts lights well.  Although I didn't use the screws that came with it.  I re-used mine.  They didn't seem to want to thread in correctly and I didn't want to cross thread them.  No big deal, the OEM screws that you have to remove on the Jeep anyway work just as well.
B000O5DUP8|2|Generally, this was a nice unit, easy to install. The left side wire loom was way too short - I had to route it under a crossmember of the carrier in order to make it reach the hitch connection. The right side loom was three times as long as it needed to be, so I had to snake it back and forth to use up the excess!!<br />It would be nice if they offered a guard to attach to the carrier behind each of the lights to protect the wiring connections.
B0009JQYWA|5|It does what it's says. It's just like to original.
B00CGAERCE|5|Looks great!
B00APOF2SG|5|No complaints, very happy, they look great!
B00514C18Y|5|Super satisfied! Got it in 2 days. WOW !when they said installation took 10 seconds.It went on in 5 seconds.looks great.i couldn't be more satisfied with it.
B000CNMMMY|5|As expected, thanks!
B00G186POK|5|excellent product
B000C808SE|5|Direct replacement for the original.  Fits just like the stock unit.<br /><br />Good seal and perfect function...what more can you ask for?<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00VB5J1MG|5|Fits perfect
B004GZKV54|5|Awesome product for the price. Just tighten the crap out of the mounting bolts every 8 months or so because they go a little loose.
B0050FWZ0S|5|Needed to replace the piston before we went on a trip. The piston was a perfect fit! Atv runs great! Be sure to buy the jet kit. It'll need more fuel. If you don't your going to melt the piston!
B00B4XBQPU|5|Looks great on my car and the metal is nice and thick.
B004DRWP54|5|Perfect, brand new works perfect thanks !!!!!!!!! I can now actually see the road at night lol
B00U6QFQAM|5|Love these. They make it so much easier to put the top back on. No more ratchet. Thank you.
B005MZVLBA|1|Red stripes almost completely faded within less than a month. If i could rate this item a zero I would.
B000EDUTNQ|5|Bought for our van.  Worked well
B00G9WA0C6|5|We trailered to Sturgis, then rode about 4000 miles or a little more, there's some freying around two of the outside pockets, but overall was perfect for our trip!
B000EVYGZA|5|A gift for my my brother-in-law.  He really likes it.  Builds model planes and copters to fly, so the voltage and battery test features are particularly useful.  Might buy one for me, it my old digital meter ever dies.
B00CZ4VFOE|5|A friend and I used this system while on a week long off road motorcycle adventure, we were both very happy with how well they worked in all kinds of riding conditions. For the cost it's hard to beat. would definately recommend.
B00KVOTEE8|5|Got it cut at a local locksmith and programmed it myself. Both of the keys I ordered work perfectly with no issues. Before buying though make sure the grooves match your current keys because some come reversed depending on your vehicle, made that mistake once.
B0024NSMLA|5|Great high quality replacement and perfect fit to upgrade cloudy original lenses.  Very good price and easy to install following online how-to videos
B000FW4M20|5|Great product. I always get that second glance! LOVE IT!
B00PJ1OTQQ|5|Hilarious great sticker
B0066QMMDA|4|I ordered this from Amazon because I really needed an air filter for my Hyundai and the dealership was going to charge me 99.99 to put one in. So, when I found this one at an excellent price on Amazon I figured it was a no brainer. My husband put it in my car in a matter of minutes and I ultimately saved myself about 80.00. Not a bad savings for a few minutes of work<br />It is a genuine Hyundai part so I'm not buying something that is cheap and would void my warranty. It was a great deal and I love the savings.
B005TTZ78M|5|Great quality, easy install. Also disconnect very easily. Would recommend to anyone.
B00AZABHLQ|1|I returned this item due to it's poor quality. The idea seems sound but the metals used and the tolerances are so sloppy ie; threads that do not engage each other enough to be tightened, it  cannot be used as intended.
B0067UERWE|1|The part I received was defective and looked like it had been used. When purchasing, I was hesitant because it was made in China; poor quality and would not buy from this manufacturer again.
B00ZCE2Z5W|5|After reading the reviews so far I have to admit I was a little worried about how well this was going to work so to make sure nothing in my car melted or burnt out so I have a wall charger that allows you to plug in a car charger in the house. Why did they do this well my husband is an electrician and everything in our house is surge protected and We have GFI outlets so if anything were to go wrong I know a breaker would trip and I wouldn't have to worry. So far they have been on for about an hour and had no problems so I then went and put it in my car. The back of each light is plastic to cover the adhesive in which you can use when their lights are in your car to stick them where ever you please. There's also zip ties and a remote control so when you set it up to your stereo you can change the colors are have a go with the tune of your music. Love all the different different options it has it definitely works great and I think it dances with the music quite well. These lights are pretty bright and the strips of lights are very flexible without damaging the lights or connections. I am extremely satisfied with the way this works and would recommend it would recommend it to other people to get for their own car. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and try this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.
B001DBSEEO|5|I should have done this 10 years ago easy install and works great.
B00AN453KK|3|The product is sub par but still works. The first one I received was damaged. Customer service promptly delivered me a replacement. I installed the part and noticed that the seals were letting moisture into the unit. I contacted customer service again and they refunded my money. Overall excellent experience with customer service, however product is not so great.
B00030BFN8|1|The first one of these I recieved was crushed. Not sure if this was during shipping or was a return that was just packaged up and sent back out, but the incoming outer box looked OK so I'm assuming it was a return that was just sent back out to me. I requested a replacement. When I got it and plugged it in, it smoked and just plain didn't work. I've read that all of the battery charger companies were bought out by Schumacher and then they just cheapened everything. I don't know if that's true or not, but i CAN say that  the TWO and ONLY two that I have gotten BOTH were crap. My 25 year old craftsman charger is still working strong though.. American made.. works every time. Last time I buy a battery charger on-line from anyone
B000RZ5XXM|4|Exactly what I expected!
B0000AY9W6|4|Haven't used them yet but expect them to do the job nicely!
B002Y2ZP6Q|5|Fits perfect!!
B00RC8DAZK|4|Very good and a good price
B00C7OQKHO|5|I was a trans mechanic as a young man. This fluid is not an option for me. The service departments of most dealerships are clueless about fluids. Use this and all other synthetic fluids in all your vehicles all the time and change them frequently. I get more repair free miles from my vehicles than most people ever dreamed possible.
B00E9FS60S|5|works as expected, and is durable. i place tarps on my car for camping and it seems to take the abuse well when it moves
B00KJGCEXG|2|dealer could not cut the key to match the car.
B00REAPZCC|5|Fits and works great
B003FWV13U|5|My five year old mats rotted because of all of the salt where I live.  I was happy to find replacements.
B00L3Z8VI4|5|Perfect.  Really needed them and they are super strong
B0001L0DFA|2|Doesn't have enough patterns, especially gentle patterns to not disturb topsoil.  Would not recommend for gardening.  It's also a pain in the butt to turn on and off if you forget which end you're at, and also a pain to switch all the way over to get to the other end.  It may be sort of comfortable to hold, but there are also multi-patterned ergonomic nozzles out there.
B00C7Y7EOW|1|They billed me for 2.but I only got one item. Then the item didn't last 2 weeks.and it breaks.  Never again
B002XPDAMK|4|Good quality, fast shipping, good price
3228963691|5|Exactly what I wanted, thank you
B000OO4QIE|4|Didn't fit but credit came quick !
B00C9V4EHI|1|I ordered this for the motorcycle, #1 It's way too small to fit, and #2 is VERY thin plastic and cheaply made. Don't waste your money.
B009FZWF3Q|5|Awesome lights, great product shipping slow but thats no issue really.
B002YKGLUW|5|works great AAAAAAAAAAtttttttttt
B000SJOEQY|5|Thanks
B009OEM40C|5|Fits perfectly as described. Fast shipping
B00LKXJ3DQ|4|does the trick, perhaps a bit more bulky that I expected. There are newer versions that are smaller.
B00PYLFM4O|5|Exactly what I needed! Thank you!
B004YWPE88|5|Work great! Have had them in my 05 Impala for over 4 years!
B008XLGQM4|4|our grndson likes the helmet
B00P8BKKNI|5|Good gear!
B00D2HW8US|1|It did not come complete there are other parts I still need
B000E4SQIA|5|Fast shipping.. Fit like a glove and fixed the problem.
B00EKTJ56C|5|straight up good deal... im happy
B003BDW0TM|5|Very nice, have seen improved horse power and confirmed 1.8 MPG increase in fuel milage
B00A69992A|1|not what i expected, didnt work for my car
B000EDUTR2|5|Nothing much to say, does the job!
B00MBFOHEW|5|Best paint EVER, but it is a top coat only. Use their rust preventative coating in the red can if there is any rust, then put this on top. WOW. Amazing. Simple amazing. I've used it on trailer frames, wheel barrows, lawn carts, car/atv parts....its the most durable paint I've ever encountered for private use.
B000NVW1LM|2|So far, It has not even slowed down the oil leaks from the front and rear seals on my 05 Taurus SHO. also no instructions on haw to use, and how far to drive to make it work.
B000CINVA6|5|Hubby uses this stuff all the time. He says it's the best out there<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion
B004I0PCMY|5|it is so nice, thank so much
B00UHOMMVE|1|Terrible
B004N5WHE0|5|My favorite car wash.  Very good scent and protects wax on your car without stripping it with harsh cleaners.  If you are looking for a wash to use frequently after a good wax job, this is what you want!
B00HSWD38E|4|Fast reliable and good quality.  Just what I like.
B0000AY2Z6|5|very strong fan for car cig lighter
B009DJQRPG|4|solid product
B0067UDSNS|5|Good quality and no problem installing on my Jeep very good bang for the buck. Thks Declan.
B0022UP8XA|5|Excellent, came quickly and works well
B007DBICFY|5|Beautiful
B004I0XLKY|5|The installation was quite easy and the headlamp seems very comparable to the original Toyota part. I used a headlight polishing kit for my sun-corroded original headlamps and it improved night driving a little, but after a few weeks they were clouded up again. I was astonished to find new headlamps that were not all that expensive and yet made with quality in mind.
B0010DW608|5|Great Price, just what I needed!
B00IZZDRR0|5|Great product
B00BAZBYTU|5|Even when it's just plastic I'm really happy with this purchase! It arrived soon and very easy to install, you might want to use glue or make sure is tighter so people don't have the need to take it away, over all I like it! Makes for a better look!!
B0088EFQ6I|5|Great
B000KKLLX0|5|Great price easy installation and setup.
B00VQTAMPW|5|Installation was great instructions were correct
B00U21WK3M|3|Worked great. Only decent quality.
B00J7RB72M|3|Seems like a sturdy case. I expected more out of the pages, they are a little thin.<br /><br />My biggest issue is that there is a section I can't use. Once you start filling it this small section gets too crowded to fit anything in.<br /><br />Otherwise, couldn't ask for more from a cheap CD holder
B001P2GH90|5|I needed one of these to replace one of the ones that had separated on my husband's truck. I took the old one off using a screw driver and prying up under it. This one installed really easy. Just make sure when you are taking the old one off you try to save the old metal things that go into the nerf bars because that will keep you from having to buy new ones that aren't cheap. I was able to save my old ones without destroying them so I just reused them. The step looked great!
B00QXDF3LE|5|I've got 2 of these on my AGV helmet. They actually look better and more durable than i expected!
B0002TDUW4|5|This stuff is tough and looks great, looks like my buddies $500 spray on liner and feels just as tough. Looks great in my powerstroke, and will look great in my Comanche. I will buy again for sure
B005I4DNZ2|5|works very well! easy to assemble.
B000GQ6LF6|5|nice
B004I0M1CS|5|Fit my 2012 F250 perfectly after my stock one had a bad encounter with a telephone pole :(  This is way cheaper than from Ford.
B00LJ3BLM8|5|this little guy cuts perfectly and really helps get into the tight locations!
B00B0Y9EYI|5|Great
B001HIFKNQ|5|perfect fit, excellent
B001P29X46|4|Worked perfectly
B001G63LGW|5|perfect.  fit my needs exactly.  ac working great again, no leaks
B003ZK8YKU|2|The items purchased were not as advertised on the display. The head light purchased were not compatible with the wiring of my car.
B003V9UU66|5|I bought this for patching up my inner tubes for my bicycle.  Keep in mind that this is a contact cement, not glue.  Scuff up the area to remove any release agent on the tube, apply the cement to an area larger than the patch AND LET THE CEMENT DRY.  Then apply the patch.  I also bought 100 pack of patches so I'll never have to buy those tiny baby packs of patches and glue again.
B000COCUF2|5|It's a light bulb and it works. Not much more to say.
B0066R7QYY|4|Great quality product at a good price.
B00QXWLG8E|4|I have a 1960 Chevy Biscayne that I wanted a modern stereo in where I wouldn't have to do an under-dash mount or cut the dash or anything like that.  Reading reviews of the RetroSound Model Two compared to the Custom Autosound USA-630, I decided to go with RetroSound.  The unit has tons of features--smartphone/iPod/jump drive connectivity through a USB port on a cable at the back of the radio (I'd recommend getting the RetroSound USB/PORT extension unit, it's a great add-on that mounts under the dash for easy USB port/3.5 mm audio input jack access), Bluetooth (great for hands-free, not as great for music sound quality, IMO), RCA output for external amps and subwoofers, tons of radio presets, a microphone so you can go hands-free with your phone, 32,000 display colors, and comes with a faceplate made specifically for your particular car.  The Model Two comes as a box full of parts which you have to assemble and adjust to fit the supplied faceplate for your particular car.  It takes a bit of work to get it assembled and fit to the faceplate properly, but that's no big deal.  Installation of the Model Two in my dash was a bit tricky.  I wasn't able to reuse the original faceplate, as the Model Two &#34;snout&#34; is sized slightly different than the original AM stereo that came installed in my car, so I had to use the supplied faceplate, which is chromed plastic, unlike my original, which is chromed metal.  The one quibble I have with the Model Two is with the supplied faceplate, and is probably only specific to the '59-'60 faceplates.  The '59-'60 dash is very sculpted compared to most dashboards, and the  faceplate is also sculpted to complement the dash design.  In order for the supplied faceplate to fit properly to the dash you have to mount the Model Two in the dash with the display/knobs facing somewhat downward, which doesn't give you the best view of the display.  If you fit the unit facing straight out of the dash (like the original did) and the top of the faceplate is flush with the dash, then the bottom of the faceplate is sticking out about a quarter inch or so.  The wiring is dead simple, there's tags on the supplied wiring harness that tell you what to connect each wire to.  If you know your car's wiring system, the hookup is easy.  Once all the wires are hooked up to the supplied harness, you just clip the harness into the slot on the back of the Model Two, and you're done.  The sound quality is great (provided you are using good speakers that are mounted properly).  The controls are a bit complex but once you get them figured out, you'll find that you have a lot of features and tonal controls at your fingertips.  Pairing your smartphone, iPad, or iPod to the Model Two is easy, but I think that the Bluetooth music sound quality is slightly lacking compared to the music sound quality you get if you hook your smartphone/IPod to the USB port or 3.5 mm audio input jack.  If I could, I'd knock off only half a point because of the faceplate issue but I wound up giving it a 4 because it didn't quite rate a 5 and Amazon won't let me give partial points.  That said, if RetroSound fixed the '59-'60 faceplate angle issue (which would require a lot of mold redesigning and expense, I'm sure), the Model Two would rate a solid 5 in my book.
B004M2JZUS|5|These grips certainly exceeded my expectations! I couldn't be more pleased. PROTIP: Apply the supplied adhesive sparingly! I cannot stress this enough. If too much glue is applied, it will have a snowball effect when the grips are installed and will lead to all kinds of heart-ache for you. The supplied glue adheres remarkably quickly so speed is essential during the installation process.
B0048FU8B4|2|Poor fit on my ridgeline. I have to settle for the ends hanging off,  or big wrinkles in the middle.
B00AG6ELY4|5|Perfect. Just what I needed, fit great and good price.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|After seeing many good video reviews I decided to give this thing a try. I bought this primarily for jump starting my 2008 Scion TC's car battery since I don't use it very often. I tried it for the first time today and the car engine started with ease. Now I don't have to use someone else's vehicle with those big long jumper cables! I also like how small it is so I can keep in the trunk of my car to use anywhere and anytime for emergencies. I haven't tried to charge any USB devices with it yet but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever need to.
B00LCIHYIU|5|Nice OEM part. Fit perfectly.
B00SC6ZRP2|3|Was told it would fit my 1989 Ford seatbelt.  It did not.  Make sure that you verify this will fit if you have an older vehicle.
B00KFEOMAA|2|Very difficult to attach. Would have to remove for car wash. Looks odd on my Prius.
B00DDOTCAO|4|Great lights for a LED
B004I4B58A|4|Worked fine.
B00NET8TUM|5|Easy to program and seem to work beautifully no problems yet
B00WTIM1GC|5|The product arrived just as described, package well, and my mechanic was able to install and put me back to riding in cold air!
B007FTI35I|5|Works perfectly. Instructions are great. Easy enough for anyone to put in. Saved a ton of money. Thank you.
B000WMNCDI|4|Great for second helmet.  I have full helmet as primary.  Use this for just small rides.
B000FW2MWW|5|Just what I needed instead of running an extension cord across the floor and having the charging unit sitting on the floor.
B0010E00T6|5|I was told by a reputable Honda Dealer in the Dallas area that this filter would cost me $120.00 to have replaced. I bought 2 of these for both my wife and I's Honda Accords, and installed them both in less than 5 minutes time. It saved me over $200.00 to do this myself. My air conditioner is fresh now.
B00265A5SE|5|Excellent bulbs! Bought as replacements and are super bright
B00RCEJQV6|5|This little gem here took its time to get here. But once here, it was great.
B004RCQSZ8|1|Bad product sold by a bad retailer. If only a &#34;retailer&#34; would add in the time it took to ship in a 30 day return period let alone a busy life where you can't install right away. Not everyone can see how something looks after a week of normal use right away.
B000BRQ0TW|5|I fixed my pool above ground intex 100% in just 5 min awesome product
B00F7NEREU|5|Fits okay in the bucket type seat of my Lexus NX. I did not attach it but it stays in place most of the time with little problem. Seat stays reasonably cool in the hot summer days.
B00IIXNBFM|5|Good product
B00HQFB538|5|If you've got a Honda Civic from the late 90's or early 2000's and it's got a broken visor clip, this is what you need.  It was super easy to take out my old broken clip and install this one.  Now I can move my visor around and not have to worry about accidentally knocking the rear view mirror out of place.
B008AF765Y|3|These are not overly bright but they do work good. The plastic mounting system is really quite flimsy and cheaply made. I would avoid hitting any bugs. If only a little more strength and a better fit on the mounting bolt were done, I'd say these would be a decent set of budget lights. I guess this is a case of you do get what you pay for but only if you don't travel off road at all.
B002GQ4T1C|4|works well
B004T3KH2A|5|This has come in so handy!  No more embarrassment with asking for extensions in front of family or friends.  What I have observed is that many large people just do not even wear their seat-belts on planes because it is too embarrassing to ask then hand it back to the attendant in front of everyone.  Sometimes I don't need it which is always a pleasant surprise, and then there are times when I have been on the same size/company plane only to find the seat-belts do not fit the way they did the last time I was on it! (size of seats & lengths of seat-belts seem to vary)  The last thing I want to do is sit there and struggle to make it fit then have to ask for an extension!  Not. Fun.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it comes with it's own little bag with a card that says &#34;this belt belongs to ____&#34;.  I have never been questioned but if I was, it's nice to know that card has been provided for me.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Just received this product. I am very happy with it. It cling to the rear window without any problem without wetting the lining. Regarding if does work to help with the glare of the sun, I do not know as I have not experienced sitting in the back of my car. It seems fine.
B004RCXCXY|5|Used BrakeBuddy Vantage for the first time going cross country. We did 5000 plus miles and it worked perfectly. Very easy to set up. Very happy with this purchase.
B004TOB6EW|5|Works perfect, I recommend.
B00BLAG3D6|5|Easy install. Very bright. Great lights.
B00NANLIVY|4|Bought this for my husband.  He and my father were able to install it and it seems as if they really didn't have much problem doing so.  2010 Wrangler
B0068OZ25K|2|Still can't get to program to my truck. I've tried several times, then the ignition won't work for a while, safety measure.
B00FGSN0Q2|1|Do not buy these caps they will cross thread. In 30 years of maintaining my own car I have never seen valve stem cap cross thread. They are made of plastic and are very prone to this. I was so angry I threw them in the trash and put my chrome caps back on.
B0041TU09C|5|Fit perfect on my 2012 Dodge Ram 1500
B000PWWPCY|1|Does NOT fit the 4th generation Lexus GS350.  Amazon, Autozone, Advanced Auto Parts, Denso's website, everyone is wrong.<br /><br />Does fit my wife's Toyota Sienna though.
B00XV4ELAC|5|Worked exactly as I expected, works flawlessly. Would buy again, especially at the price.
B005JWEWL2|2|Didn't last me longer than a few months. It slipped off
B0046IXXLA|5|Works great
B00DTE9XMK|3|This product could use more pictures. Rather than being white, the entire thing is about 3 shades darker closer to dark gray with 4 patterns instead of just one, which to some may be a bonus, but for me wasn't necessary. The quality of the fabric is good, but thick so breathing is always hot, but not suffocating. Overall it's what I expected and served me well enough.
B008RU3FRA|2|There was no point in getting this one day early I plugged it in now my scooter won't crank putting the stock one back in vary dissapointed
B001O074JU|1|Purchased May 17th, 2015, for a Ford F150 2004 XLT 5.4L/330 Cu. In. V8 with 201,830 miles.  Installed June 27th.  Failed August 8th.  I would not recommend this product.  Meticulously followed all procedures.  Issues in mid-July started with slight knocking, misfires, without check engine light or ODBII Codes present.  Culminated in excessive knocking, misfires with ODBII Codes of P0303, P0316, and P0171. Luckily, I saved the 8 original Motorcraft COPs. Reinstalled those and will try to get $$$.$$ back from Amazon/Accel.  Some parts you should just not try and save $$$ on getting the non-OEM brands.  COPs are one of those parts.
B000XVZ8F8|5|Good item
B00HG2UEBA|4|you will need your own hitch pin because it does not come with one. I will give this a four stars because of the mostly good reviews I have read.
B002UM8XFA|5|It met my expectations. It replaced one I had previously. It's more compact than a clipboard. It fits beter in my briefcase, and holds my forms.
B006R7AW6M|5|easy to place it
B003F01VT6|5|perfect
B000SXCLIS|5|good
B006D9W5FA|5|Great Price..works great!
B00V901JQ4|4|Received the sunshades and they are made from a pretty lightweight cloth material with a silver finish on one side. I measured each panel to be 34&#34;W X 32&#34;H. Don't know how durable they will be, but I got them as an easy in & out for our 2011 Honda Odyssey. See attached picture showing them installed. There is not a lot held by the visor but OK for my needs.
B00JJ6DN1O|5|looks wonderful and its so easy to apply
B0031HQ0RQ|5|Works great and was easy to install.
B00LULNQD6|5|looks good and works well for the price
B00029WVIS|5|These are the best add on convex mirrors. The vision is clear and wide.
B00K8VQE7Y|5|Finally!!!  An Avengers product that gives Hawkeye and Black Widow equal billing with the rest of the team!!!  This reflective accordion style sunshade looks great and keeps the hot Florida sun from baking my dashboard.  Now, when I get off from work I can drive immediately, rather than waiting for my steering wheel to cool down.  The sunshade is flexible, but sturdy enough to stay put by flipping the sun visors down.  It's a great fit for my mid-size sedan.
B00AMPHDJY|1|I bought this liner after I had one in my 2011 Sienna and was extremely happy with it, however - this is not the same product and not the item you  see on the photo! The &#34;new&#34; design is substantially shorter and does not reach the second row (not even close). Even after buying all-weather mats to cover the 2nd to 3rd row space this liner leaves 2-3 inches of exposed carpet. Called weathertech to inquire about buying the &#34;old&#34; design (the one in the photo) and was told it is no longer offered... Returned to amazon and in search of a Cargo Liner for my 2015 Sienna - any suggestions?
B00LEUQVXA|5|Great product ! Fast shipping !
B012FQNZCG|5|My husband just bought a light bar and use this to put it together... he said it was great and it made installation a lot easier... the wiring harness was high quality and he is glad he bought it...
B004J7B900|5|Arrived on time and works ok.
B00VT3GI4Y|2|Got a rhinestone on the end cap. So if you're into fairy motorcycles, go for it.
B00M28UW6A|5|Just like the oem ones i removed,but with black housing. They are a perfect fit and make it look more aggressive. And a huge improvement over my yellowed and pitted oem ones.
B00BCRMA9Y|2|Very low quality. You get what you pay for. 3 days and the string wheel cover has come apart. The seat covers are not that bad of you put them on loose. If you pull the straps to tighten them up, they rip right out.
B00BULZ9IQ|5|Fits perfect on my 2008 MDX. All parts needed to install are included. Easy to install as long as you measure 10 times and cut once. for 2007-2009 owners I would recommend using the 2012 directions though which directs you make the cut closest to windshield first and then cut the smaller sections. The 2008 directions wants you to remove the whole drip molding and then cut which is a problem if you don't have the windshield tool.
B00ONH6FBY|5|Installed in the old rough use 88 caravan se (It goes pretty much anywhere- especially with snow chains) It's so quiet I thought it had failed to engage until the van started right up...something it seldom does. :P
B007LICNYU|5|GR8 item THX
B000BFR6TM|5|It fit just fine and makes it look like we got a new AC unit.
B00BU5Z3LA|5|Fit was perfect, Quality is great.. Super satisfied. Perfect for the few AutoX events I attend each year
B0042AGJOK|5|Really cool helmet accessory, holds nicely.
B001C5RM0S|5|Made in America! Nice unit.
B00BD9RT8S|5|Package in perfect condition. All parts fit perfect love this product!
B00WNFQNBK|5|Very good. Highly recommend
B00KQ2HQ6I|5|Great price and now I can actually tell which button I'm pressing. Easy install
B00JGJG6EU|5|Good quality and great price.
B000GU24HG|5|Perfect fit for Suzuki GS750.
B008QXZ5MQ|5|You can't beat OEM!<br /><br />Most folks overlook this filter in doing their maintenance, as they don't think it's needed but think again!  Our VW's like other German made auto's, are very finicky in that little things will make big problems!  I skipped my cabin filter change and pretty much went double the life of it.  I noticed that my A/C was blowing lukewarm and the air speed wasn't like it used to be.  On a whim, I removed the old filter and I found the culprit.  The filter when new weighs close to nothing, where as mine had considerable weight despite looking the same.  This is because the filter was doing it's job in cleaning out the pollen and other crap we find in the air here in the North East.  After the change, the AC blows frigid cold...<br /><br />I never plan on skipping this filter change again!
B0006IX87S|5|Simple and effective
B0028OO33Q|5|Awesome part works great
B000C5EAP4|4|Unlike the old Motorad cap it replaced, this one's seal fits tightly and closer to the car's body. Seems good.
B000R308RA|1|Won't fit a 01 dodge ram corretly due to spare tire lowering crank.
B004HCS4PK|5|A bit high priced. It came with a buffing cloth. What I really liked about it was the ease of use. I have used liquid waxes and Turtle wax Ice. I spent most of my effort just trying to get the wax off my car. This product went on with ease and came off almost as easily as the old waxes of my youth. I used it in direct sunlight as it states it can be used. My car is black and it was a very warm day. The wax went on and it came off with moderate effort. The results were very satisfactory. I plan to make it my on hand choice.
B004ME4NDA|4|light, sturdy. product is as describe and I would buy it again.
B00HEB2XEO|5|Easy install!<br />wayyy better than the original part which is plastic.<br />This fits my left(driver side) 2005 Lincoln Aviator.
B008IAHBWY|1|The delivery was good but this decal is 100 percent crap. The first time I layed it out very slowly following the instructions very carefully but it got so many folds and kinks in it that I had to try and fix it but had no luck. My opinion. Get a professional to put a decal on your jeep becuase odds are you get this and your going to mess it up and get angry like I did
B00TBHXC4E|4|This product provides light cleaning and decent protection to any vinyl surface. It does not dry so you must wipe. The longer you buff it the more effective it becomes. I did the dash of my mother's car. The spray mechanism worked well and it has been repelling dust. It does not have the polishing effect some cleaners of this type do. The finish is matte not shiny or glossy. If you use too much it will streak. Less is more and it seems that the buffing makes the difference. Formulated without alcohol, it provides protection against damaging UV rays. Thus far I am pleased with this product and its performance..
B008VS69AS|4|I purchased this liner because it was the only one I could find that covered both the second and third rows when down, yet also did not get in the way or have to be removed if I had all three three rows up.  The fit is excellent, it even comes with instructions signed by who made the cuts and who sewed it together.  The only thing I'd improve is that third row and cargo areas are one piece.  When the third row is up there is slack from the length required for the flat orientation.  No big deal but doesn't look like the clean fit that the second row does.  It should be three pieces. Second row, third row, then cargo.  Otherwise I'm pleased with their fit and I highly recommend for anyone looking to protect the full carpeted cargo area of the Durango.
B000ENOPO0|4|Spilled all over the inside of the bag.
B003NYHMQ0|4|Easy set up, fast delivery
B006FXUMO0|5|great item and fast shipping
B00159Q0E0|5|Heavy duty. Fits great and looks great!<br /> It comes completely disassembled. No tools included but hardware is. Directions are not the best but if you know what your doing it's pretty easy. I'm a bigger guy and the step holds me fine.
B00753S8CC|5|Looks really great :)
B00LTX81B2|5|They're funnels...and they work well!
B00265FXTA|4|excellent bulb and color matches perfectly with my other factory bulb from BMW.  The only thing is BMW makes changing your own bulbs near impossible.  Damn, German over-engineering.
B001G4Z5J0|5|wish i had got this item  a long time ago  gives me more room for  my truck  100%  love it
B004RH978S|5|Worked good for a 2008 dodge charger 2.7l v6.
B00XXNIMOC|4|Bright and perfect for many applications, wish the wires were a bit thicker (not a huge deal i just removed the exiting and replaced with my own...
B008Y9KDJM|5|Awesome and good price!!
B00IP6A09W|4|Well I'm about 80% happy. They look kick ass on my my truck when it's not raining. I've had these on my truck for a couple weeks and, well there's been moisture in my corners pretty much the whole time. They adjusted easily, they are a little brighter than stock. I will be ordering different corners cause it kills the front end of my truck
B000EQTX5I|5|worked great
B007SB5PGS|1|Shouldn't it say Aussie Mum? Aussies don't use the word mom.
B000GKAZMW|5|very satisfied, its in my prius and now I see everything, vibrates a little but not so much that I have taken the time to try and fix it. telling everybody about it.
B008032ST0|4|this product was good great shipping!
B00VSMG4IQ|5|Work perfect for my BMW X3.  You can read almost all fault codes for Gear box, electronic devices, heating units, coolant temp, etc...
B00GMM9AUG|4|Color : Blue<br /><br />I love the glasses. They came in mail mail prompt and the price was reasonable. However, the blue glasses are harder to see at night so it might be better to try a different color like yellow. The good thing is that the glasses are changeable. I just wished they gave your direction on how to do it so you will not accidentally break the lenses.
B00K7GW7ZI|5|The package arrived as expected and the item was in great shape!
B007ZXXSBS|4|Worked great in our 2001 Nissan Xterra V6 and just in time, as the old belt was so loose that the tensioner did not have to be released to pull it off.
B0036GDXBI|5|Good quality!
B001LHVOVK|5|I've used it several time, its paid for itself many times
B004QQ721Y|4|Good price..
B00MQD4I0M|4|Delivered over a week late, but aside from that all is good
B00A8OP7PG|5|Fit perfectly on my 250, looks great and made from nice aluminum. It's the punisher....enough said.
B01015ELFS|4|Looks sharp so far so good !
B007XRBH00|5|When I purchased this part for my car, I was expecting an after market seal. When I opened the box, I was very happy to see I received a genuine part.
B00KTJ0A0C|1|Could not get them to pair to my 2001 suburban
B00P2W80MQ|5|Circle Cool Black PVC Leather Carbon Fiber Style Steering Wheel Cover Wrap w/ Needle & Thread 14.45&#34; Diameter 4&#34; Grip Circumference 47026<br />I ordered this for my 2008 Mazda CX7 GT<br />Perfect fit. Great quality material and craftsmanship. Awesome looking!<br />Shipping time was very fast, I was so surprised.<br />The only problem I had was unraveling the wound up tight silk cord. Stitching was not a problem at all. My tip to you is, get good lighting and wheel positioning during the stitching process. Check and keep the stitching tight after every inch or two.  Take a break halfway through the process because your hand would hurt after awhile. Be patient and it pays off after the install. If you stitched the right way, it sure looks like a custom job.<br />Highly recommended for steering wheel 14.5 inches diameter, 4 inch grip circumference.
B0009JKI72|5|good wipers
B005GNUOTS|5|love it
B00DSS9MD2|5|these liftgate works great on my 2006 Saturn Vue, great price quick delivery and easy to installed
B0088LL7UA|5|Just what I wanted. Well built, Flexible as per fitting different  brands and a firm hold on the phone !
B004A6HRFG|5|A synthetic oil change is 75 bucks. A new Prius, 25,000.
B001AIQ58M|5|Exactly as promised.  Bought as a replacement in a 89 Jeep Wrangler.  Good quality, pleased!
B006RYVULG|5|Price and Quality was the reason why I purchased these;  I got these for my XC90 and they came in better packaging than the sylvania brand.  When u install these you can keep the clear container over the bulb while you screw it in.  The oils in your fingers can make these lights burn out so if you remove the cover use rubber gloves or a t-shirt to keep the bulb clean.<br />After I installed these all my lights went out except these and then two weeks later my turn signal/light stick in the car literally broke off.  So when my mechanic replaced the stick all the lights went on.<br />My manual actually said that I had different lights so I originally ordered sylvania at the high price.  Then when I took the lights out they didn't match the manual - way to go Volvo.  I know these are from china and the price is cheap but they are actually brighter than the original sylvania xenon lights.
B00009K762|4|Works well.
B00C6EXIPC|5|Great size and long lasting.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Pro: 1) Turns three hands needed to a true one-person job.<br />  2) All pressure goes to forcing grease into where it is needed.<br />  3) Allows you to focus on the excretion of fresh grease, not the leakage at the coupler.<br />  4) Less clean-up.<br />Con: Size in length and lever, I have NO issues with it, but if your have a tough time with the standard size length this maybe an issue. This coupler will add about another 1.5&#34; to the ridged section before your flex hose. Also the clearance for the lever may interfere in tight spots.
B00COOBRMK|5|This is my second purchase of this item. I bought one for a 2012 Dodge Charger then needed a new one for a 2015 Charger. Looks great on both, fits good on both, and adds character.
B0109H6BN8|4|Nice kit. But didn't come with any gasket sealer like it shows in the pic ect
B007P74EFS|5|1
B000KQ2EJ4|5|excellent product and easy to install.  Good value<br />Denis
B001UOCSG4|5|This is a wonderful product.  You need to use clay bar and polish to correct your paint prior to applying this.  Note that I said polish. NOT wax. There are a few good videos on YouTube that show how to apply this paint coating.  Watch them.
B00PZ00OTW|5|Super easy to install. Did not need to lift car. You do need an 18mm and 19mm deep socket, extender for your socket wrench (long version) and a socket wrench that is big enough to put some torque down. An air compressor is not needed. You can do this all with a socket wrench. The hitch seems a little low but I have not scraped on anything yet. Seems very well constructed and is pretty heavy. Nice finish and packaging was great! Watch the video on how to install and you can put this on within 30min.  UPDATE: I was driving kinda fast on a very bumpy/wavy road.  The car was bouncing up and down. Suspension was awesome. Hitch did NOT drag or anything.  So far it is great!

B00GWFOSRS|5|Bought three! One for my grandson, one for son-in-law, and one for me. Nice to know to know when you need  to buy new tires (yellow portion). Red Portion your driving dangerously!
B00ZS9RSD0|5|THIS IS GREAT  KEEP THEM COMING
B008EFTSTC|5|My only complaint is that the Zombie Hunting Permit that I was sent was for 2014-2015...so it's only good for a few more months. I was hoping to get a 2015-2016 permit. Maybe I'll at least get a discount on renewal.<br /><br />Other than that, the decals are GREAT!!!
B00B6CTQHE|5|Love it! Loveit! Love it!
B00LNE9BR0|5|Got it installed for over a year now! OEM parts is great!
B00C7X5LFM|5|These work great!  Perfect replacement for 2014 CX-5.
B00BWAH6EK|3|I still get the light out error when I first turn on my truck, to clear it I have to turn the lights on for a few sec's then back off. No flicker, but didn't eliminate the light error completely.
B00GUF74HQ|1|Don't damage the nut, will result in unusable product.  If you damage the nut, that has fine thread and is inserted into the tailgate) you will have to buy a whole hardware kit from the company for $9 (includes S&H).  Not a bad price, but when I only need a $1 part, I would rather not deal with them.<br /><br />I would not buy this product again.
B00KTHQR0Q|1|No way to get it programed evn toook to dealer.  Had to buy a dodge key fob and it programed first time.
B00EN9LQNO|1|Poor quality. The spot welds broke that held the recoil spring after about the 15th pull start. I would rate it less than half a star if I could
B00F2ZKHFQ|5|Very easy install and a must for newer vehicles when switching to LED, unless you like your blinker going Hyper
B00FLVV6O2|5|Worked great and easy to put in .. I had no problems
B006T3Q4RU|3|Looks good, have to be careful not to damage lower mounting tabs
B001F89Q9M|2|Very thin material.  Cheap looking and doubt they will last more than one riding season.  Extremely disappointed!
B0031G18S8|5|Thank you
B00D5ZT6NO|5|excellent product for the price.  Used it on a very large Pergola which had rotten spots.  Cleaned, filled and checked after hardening.  Worked very well.
B0041U61HG|4|Awesome just wish the Bull Symbol was larger
B00HVVVEYM|5|Perfect for a trip to Florida.  We drove over 1200 miles in some serious rain storms.  Everything stayed dry!  Perfect fit on my 60&#34; hitch cargo carrier.
B000C5CEKC|1|Says that it would fit my car but when I lock it someone can still open it. Disappointed.
B00MXF4N8U|5|after using both bottles my check engine light went off and car is running better! Saved me a lot of money, now I don't need a new catalytic converter.
B00I9XH1NO|5|works as advertised .Saved a ton of money
B0031I8DO8|1|Does not match or fit truck - even though site listing says it does!
B00384SKC0|5|Works perfect!
B00I5A28RK|1|If I could give it negative stars I would. The item that was sent to me is not what is pictured. This is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! The decal is much smaller and the lettering is cheap, block letters. I was really excited to get this decal because it is supposed to be in the font pictured, but in reality it looks cheap and plain.
B002N5JCFE|5|Perfect
B00JVHLS3G|1|Don't waste your money buying this crap. It will look worst than the one you're replacing in a couple months.
B00Q3SF4LS|5|COMFY!
B004VSCJFQ|5|super strong but smells great! one wafer lasts a long time
B003THPJBG|5|needs to label which is left and right side
B00EYNF0WW|5|Great gift
B0055QOKC8|5|Worked exactly as advertised. Used it to ride to Sturgis from west coast immediately after installation. Perfect.
B00EUZZK5G|5|Love the Tonno Pro Tri-Fold Truck cover.  We ordered it and it arrived in 3 days.  Very easy to install and it looks and fits great!  Great price and I recommend this product.
B00KQHACMI|5|everything was as they said, all great here
B00REJX5BQ|5|Great product for the price. Easy install. Really like the look on my 2015 RAM. Fast Delivery
B0009V1WSE|5|Easy to use and Master Lock tough. This was a good purchase.
B001GBJOZE|5|This is maybe the best thing ever invented for hooking up trailer wiring. I don't know how it could be any better than this.
B00OU5LOT2|5|This item is the best
B0052DVSTM|4|cheap flimsy plastic but there no other choice when you have XD rims
B00GBVHPNW|5|gloves met and exceeded expectation . stitching isnt bad ..gloves work great for light riding .
B004W985DY|5|Ordered the Spyder Auto Honda Black Altezza Tailights (non LED) for 94 Honda Accord EX.  About a 30 min install using a 8mm socket.  Please DO NOT LISTEN to those that said they discarded the weather stripping that is included.  If you notice how it is placed on the Original lights, it is easy to place the weather stripping on the new Spyder lights.  You don't need any kind of silicone sealant.  We'll see how they hold long(er) term.
B000WK27A4|5|Arrived early and exactly as listed
B009S9RW9G|5|Easy to put on!  Fast shipping via USPS
B001ZTBN92|4|Delivery was quick and the battery is performing well.  Price was right.  Would have given five stars but I will know in a year if it deserves five stars.
B00UIB9EC6|3|the hat is not white,  it is very light pink.  and no im not color blind.
B008VJZ76Y|3|Got this for a 2006 Suzuki Boulevard. As stated in other reviews, the holes are too small for the bolts to go through. They must be drilled or filed with a rat tail to get the bolts through. Even then they will not line up because the feet are not bent at the proper angle requiring a lot of vice work to get the angle correct. Only 3 stars because it is an unnecessarily difficult installation but it looks good and works well when installed.
B005LXO0X4|2|It is not of good quality and the chrome caps peeled the first day.
B000A8OLYI|5|good
B00KXE43R4|1|You get what you pay for.  It's still clings to the car window, but the air bubbles that keep appearing around it won't go away.
B000ARPVQ6|5|OEM quality
B000EDQQCY|5|i love it...as expected
B00265FXTA|5|2012 JEEP CHEROKEE OVERLAND.  MY DRIVER SIDE LOW/HIGH BEAM BURNT OUT. AFTER READING ALL THE POST ABOUT THE COLORS NOT MATCHING AND SO FORTH.... SO I PURCHASED (2) AND WAS GOING TO REPLACE BOTH SIDES. NO NEED!!  A PERFECT COLOR MATCH ON THE OEM ORIGINAL PASSENGER SIDE BULB JUST BY REPLACING THE BURNT OUT DRIVERS SIDE!. WHILE I UNDERSTAND EACH PERSONS SITUATION IS DIFFERENT SOME SAY THE LIGHT WAS A &#34;YELLOWISH&#34; COLOR???  NOT MINE. 4300K* BRIGHT WHITE. PERFECT MATCH. I READ SOME POST ABOUT IF THE BULB COST LESS IT MUST BE A KNOCK-OFF FAKE. NOT SO IN MY CASE. SYLVANIA D1S 66144  34WATT ALL THE WAY. AMAZON SENT ME EXACTLY WHAT WAS ADVERTISED. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. BUY THIS ONE WITH CONFIDENCE.
B008ZDYLC2|5|Very cool scanner. Much more info than my last one. Still learning how to use it.
B00HAPH9G6|5|They arrived  in a timely fashion.Excellent (best I've seen) packaging. Haven't been on the truck long enough for a  REAL opinion but I could tell a BIG difference.DUH! Seriously,knowing the things I know,carbon steel is HARD.Think bayonets. Also, the seals are 75% synthetic/25 rubber and they use a synthetic  lubricant.Anyone who knows anything about lubrication KNOWS synthetic is far su- perior to petroleum. I've used Amsoil (the first and BEST) synthetics for years.Oil,transmission,rear end. I'd use their greas if these *($*#@ idiot engineers would stop designing all of these sealed parts. I could have greased the bearings and Not replace them for another90,000.Probably never given proper maintainance. Happy so far!
B001GRWDA6|5|Thank goodness I found these, so rain doesn't come in car, and I can leave the windows open so the heat doesn't blow them out. They came quickly and was so easy to install....better than the ones with tape. They just snapped in, and I left the windows closed for 12 hours (overnight), and works like a dream! A DEFINITE BUY and bargain!
B00BAZBYTU|1|Didn't even fit piece of junk and I make sure to put in my make  model car and it said it fit  and toss in trash at same day $5.00 not worth the hassle returning it
B00UEMH5L6|5|Installed in minutes! Looks great, gets tons of compliments.
B00VGEEE9C|1|Unless you are a very small person these glasses are goo small for an adult - but perfect for kids.
B012YMDPHG|5|Nice product. I used this on my dad's car and it scanned what was wrong! It was an O2 sensor problem just like he knew. Very reliable scanner as far as I know of now. Hopefully this won't break on me or mis-scan because I'll be relying on this for now! Used it as soon as it came home. 10/10 Quality for the price! Simple use and no guide required. You can youtube if you don't know how to do it but it is a very simple process and easy to use.
B000C16XPI|5|2002 Trans am, worked great.  Still going strong
B00OU67Z80|5|My husband is extremely pleased with this new light.  The clear, LED lights shine very far. It's easy to grip and he likes the rugged casing.<br />We're confident it will last longer than any spotlight he's used in the past.
B00CKTXJV6|5|Good quality. Fast shipping.
B000CO84CA|5|Very good filters
B0013FWDTW|3|It came into an AC Delco bag inside of another smaller plastic bag with a tag &#34;Made in Taiwan&#34; and it is not like OE I have or the one of the picture. Looks like the cheaper one. I hope it works properly
B00IPS4APU|5|stopped the cracks and hide most of the damage
B004YLKK5Q|5|Looks awesome!
B00080QHMM|5|EXCELLENT...
B004CZ24VW|5|Perfect fit on the 2012 BMW 528i RWD.  It also came with velcro pads to keep mats in place (duplicates of the ones the car already came with) as well as 2 plastic hanger looking things that I'm not sure what they're for.  All original BMW equipment.
B0051MYLS4|5|I use this to scrub deep into wheels where it is hard to reach and to also clean off my brake calipers. Works great! Though if it were even smaller that would be even better. It is about 1-2 inches thick and 8-10 inches long.
B004HCM9H4|5|Best and easiest wax to use!
B001PWFPE8|5|Awesome
B000TV59EC|5|Perfect, exactly what I expected. Thank you.
B00ONGZR8M|5|Part fit well
B004YEIOGK|4|Tasmania is missing.  Otherwise very good.
B0001EW4EK|5|Product as promised
B00BAZBTX6|5|Light look great!! Not bad for the price they are as bright as they describe! I recommend these lights!!!
B0002Z9R5M|5|This was a good fit for my factory wiper body which I wanted to keep.  (They look better than the after market wipers.)  The silicone protection gives a clean, streak free wipe when it's needed. They were also at a good price.
B0062CZB68|3|Not the best quality as you would expect from a stainless steel unit. the bends were not very precise and one side seemed to want to extend further out from the fascia than the other side. Needed to be tweaked a bit
B010PDSLH0|3|It works and installed easily. Probably not great quality. We'll see. It's always replaceable.
B0006IX80K|5|They are guaranteed never to break. I've only had them for a week so I don't know if that's true, however, I know that they feel and look better than those flimsy ones I had on before which were only 1 year old. I am confident that after inspecting them and feeling them that the &#34;unbreakable&#34; is accurate. I bought three of them.
B000FOHOXW|5|good price
B001CE4HY8|5|We are full time and these have helped with stabilizing the slide out and making the coach more solid all the way around.
B00JX000XA|5|Worked great for my 2002 jeep wrangler
B001O07P9E|4|It's a standard ball mount, but unlike my older draw-tite mount this was made in china. Besides that it is a perfectly good hitch, I just plan to get a Curt one because my friend received his and his was made in USA and the price is the same so I'm planning on buying that instead.
B0031HSL7I|5|2007 Tahoe back lift gate quit working normally. This and it's accompanying part SG330077 fixed it!
B0068EOKWG|1|Way to expensive for something you will only notice not worth it
B00C5RBRA8|5|Perfect
B00TXENKTM|5|really like it going to make into picture
B00DRYPL5K|5|Awesome, replaced stock ones for an 06' Silverado and they handle well.
B003NGBFX4|1|Having a hell of a time getting this on. Geesh
B002P8KPL4|5|Arrived on time and the mechanic had no problem at all putting it on.
B00VFV0XNW|2|was not one piece. came rolled and layers were not flat with each other, had creases, and was not recoverable. price and time of sending back of sending back not worth it..
B0041CDPQO|5|For those of us with motorcycles that don't have built-in electronics to charge various devices, this is a must have!<br /><br />Installation: Obviously to connect this to your battery tender cable, this just needs to be plugged in. Keep in mind the placement on your bike though. I wanted the charger to be located in my windshield bag, so it was necessary to strip the seat and the tank off my bike to run this along the top frame bar. It was an easy install, but just be sure to put some time into considering where you would like to have it located when it's all said and done.<br /><br />Use: Works exactly as you would expect, and provides consistent power to get devices going on long trips. This is truly a must have for any avid motorcyclist!
B00KQWA33G|5|Fell into place. If you need them. Buy these
B00QRHDIPY|4|Good
B001BNFV0Y|5|Prompt shipping, smooth transaction. Was a gift. Pleased with purchase! Thank you!
B0000AY13P|5|excellent item
B00496N9G8|5|👍🏼👍🏼
B00BD6S7W8|5|Can't beat the value here and prolly not the quality either
B00O83TSTO|3|Socket notches did not match up with the lites on the truck
B00913FW0K|5|solid product
B000CQOIVO|5|excellent item
B001OZS9E4|5|Works great on my fj
B000GARO80|5|It does what it is designed for. I use it to charged my inverter batteries for incase of a brownout
B000CLZKMA|4|parts are on & car working great :)
B00LNGSTU8|3|I hate the zippers
B00PXC5PNC|3|Nice fuel door and pretty easy to install, only problem is all the Allen heads started rusting almost immediately. It it were not for that I'd give 5 stars for sure
B004GDDDSS|4|nice fit perfect
B00AFRIVNQ|5|Excellent product, it works perfectly.
B000C9I7Z4|5|It's an OEM O2 sensor. Plugs in, works exactly as it should. It even came with anti-seize on the threads, ready to screw in and plug.
B00GBVHPNW|4|It fits well and feel durable and I like the look of them. The knuckle protection is very nice and has a palm pad on it. Nice incase you go down. It didn't get 5 stars because I don't know if I have to break in the gloves or if it is just rubbing weirdly sometimes on my hands. It is comfortable for the most part. Would buy again if I lose these or ruin them.
B009IFIGKE|5|After running into the garage wall, I needed to find a replacement for my wife's side view mirror.  This fit perfectly for her '05 Escalade and was easy to install myself.
B00931HSQ6|1|it did not stick on anything.
B0013FW1OY|4|Fit my Buick rear light (T10 type bulb} socket perfectly.  Snip, strip,2 wire nuts, and done.  Would have given it 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.
B001ABL2BE|5|I have an 08 sierra 1500 5.3L, leveled with bigger tires and an mbrp cat back exhaust system. before I was getting 17.5 mpg average. half in town and half rural highway of 55 mph. I got a cold air intake system from another company, and it actually dropped my mpg to 16.5. I put my stock air system back in and ordered this afe pro dry cause I don't want to do the oiling thing anymore. reset my avg mpg meter before work the next morning, when I got to work my avg mpg was 19.2. really. on a leveled truck with bigger tires. I don't hot rod my truck either. drive it and let her shift around 2000 rpm, which gives plenty of acceleration.
B00E5NO07W|5|I loved it! It looks great on my car window, easy to place! I recommend it!
B00HJ6O4A0|2|The material is not nice to sit on.
B00DSMEL2A|3|Back in the mid 1980's this stuff worked quick.. would strip the muck off a part right down to the metal.  It seems to take much longer now days.  Guess they had to change the formula.  3 days soaking some parts now and still have to use a wire brush to finish the job.  I think the formula is missing the chlorinated solvents that use to be in it.
B003YFFF0S|5|LOVE THE LEATHER SHIRT AND FEEL!!!  THANK YOU!!!
B00HY073LS|5|Really like them they fit perfectly. Would recommend this and a price you can't beat.
B000TYQAVU|5|fit perfect on my car
B00AIFZ4DU|5|Great wire! It worked great for the amps I used. It was the perfect size. It also made a great speaker wire for my woofers. Super flexible too!
B00486JKWQ|5|perfect
B000O51VJ0|5|I don't usually write product reviews but after using the Little Red Campfire I decided I need to write one. It worked beyond my expectations. With all of the drought and subsequent campfire restrictions in California this year I was afraid we wouldn't have a campfire on our camping trip. It turns out we could still have a real campfire but on pack out day we didn't want to light a campfire in the morning that we'd soon have to put out. We used the Little Red Campfire instead. I had purchased the optional disposable propane cylinder adapter Camco #58033 and attached a standard 1 lb propane bottle. I thought that the campfire would use up the little propane bottle in about 10 minutes but was pleasantly surprised that it lasted a little over 30 minutes with the flames on the campfire turned up to create about 1 inch high flames. It took the chill off in the morning, provided a cheery fire while we cooked breakfast and then cooled off and could be packed up in about 5 minutes so we could break camp without having to put out a regular fire. I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a great product.
B00A82A2ZS|5|Always purchase from  this seller.  Products are always great! Thank you
B00ZUZ6YDC|5|Nice little tool to have in the car just in case.Its one of those things you hope you never need to use but feel safer having it within reach.This is especially good to have now because you see so many news stories where people have rescued children and pets from locked cars.This would certainly be a huge help in a situation such as that...The Hammer is small so it doesn't take up much space.Can be stored easily and the case makes it safe to store.The cutting blade is secured in a way there is no risk of cutting yourself.Other brands usually sell for quiet a bit more so this is a very good deal.This product was purchased at a promotional price to test and review.Good product for the price..
B00498DSM6|4|as described.
B004NL1NC6|5|five star all the way!!
B00B505GSU|4|Why isn't something like this provided with a new vehicle? I wish it was a little better quality, but it does what I needed it to do.
B00GIYE6UC|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00D2QL0DU|3|Using this item as a Syphon/pump worked as expected. I think it was wishful thinking on the part of the manufacturer to think that this could be used as a bike pump. After correctly installing the adapter, the platic piece that grabs the valve stem literally just fell apart. Zero chance of putting it back together correctly.
B00KMBPGYM|5|Works as advertised. You may have to adjust the contact prongs as others have mentioned to ensure proper function.
B005MZXCSU|5|Love this! it's on my car
B0030VDLK2|5|Perfect fit
B001RIBAUS|4|Reads well.
B00JV9GQEU|4|Fast shipping and it did fit but it made use of the stock fan not possible.  I had to install a slim electric fan with it because it is about an inch thicker.
B003G0U3BM|5|Best purchase ever. It fits perfect in my Prius. You can put anything in the back and the car will never get damaged. I have another in my Murano and once. coming from Costco I got  laundry detergent spilled over it. Since the edges are higher, it contained all. The only I needed to do was pull it out, wash it with a hose and let it dry. When It was ready I just put it back. And the material are o good that it will last a lifetime.
B000CPAELI|5|constructed very well nice quality
B00GXY52PU|3|The idea is great. I wish the cord was a couple of feet longer.
B008KSIOHU|5|When Daddy's happy, I'm happy.
B00IJGAMXW|5|10 minute install. Works much better than simple strut swap. Recommend to anyone.
B007772I54|5|Great
B000CMF4J8|5|Got the wrench for 20&#34; factory wheels on a 2015 Ford Edge with exposed short acorn style lug bolts. The 13/16&#34; socket fits perfectly, and breaking the lug bolts loose is easy with the extension. Got this because the one that came with the vehicle jack looks flimsy and short.
B0002SR88C|4|Good price..
B00LSYLFT2|1|Kit is very well put together, sandpaper is the best I've used. Unfortunately after all of the difficult work, taping, sanding with all grades, prepping for spray - I realized the liquid which needs to be blended to harden the clearcoat, was no longer a liquid, it had hardened in its container. So clearly there is a short shelf life as the seal wasn't broken.<br /><br />Tried on 3 different attempts and waited a few weeks for a response from the seller - crickets......<br /><br />Had I been able to finish the job with useable product I'm sure it would have been quite good but I never had that opportunity. Now looking for a quality UV sealant.
B00JXPFQI4|5|I purchased this for my 2013 Kia.  I have a Kayak and wanted to be able to load it myself onto the roof.  I won't lie...I had a man I know help me with the installation just because he understands it a little better and it is a lot simpler with two people. But these are great.  Because they clip into your windows...you will notice a little wind noise when driving.  I purchased Rhino Rack Kayak Saddles to go on these.  It all worked perfectly.  I haven't removed them yet..&#62;I'm trying to decide on a way to do a MARKING so that the next time I install them I don't have to get out the tape measure and figure it out again.
B006NZTZLQ|5|I bought this primarily to use with Harry's Lap Timer software to provide vehicle performance data to overlay on my track videos.  Works great for that, especially since I can leave it plugged in all the time and it won't drain the car battery and it's data update speed is much faster than other scan tools.<br /><br />It also works well as an OBDII scan tool.  I have some other stand-alone OBD scanners but those are now obsolete since I can use this plus my phone and scan any vehicle without messing with cables or bringing other tools along.<br /><br />It seems a little expensive compared to the cheap junk that's out there but when you consider the performance, the battery-saving feature, and the included software for Android and Windows, it's actually a super value.
B00KTI0D96|3|I was satisfied with how quick they arrived, but unfortunatly one of the remotes failed on several attempts to program it. I will be seeking how I can have it replaced with another one.
B00FY19Y84|5|Perfect!
B00MC6H0AI|5|Very bright! I tried them as daytime running lights but didn't like the color so I now use them as backup lights. 2006 Sierra
B00IOLET8G|1|Poor quality and did not work. Gave me about 8 codes that went away as soon as I replaced it with the AIP branded MAF for about the same price. I wouldn't take the risk for this one.
B002696FA2|4|Used in my 05 Jeep grand Cherokee 5.7 L. Apply EXACTLY as instructed on the bottle. Had a small internal leak (seal im guessing) lower Driver side of aluminum radiator. this sealed it up and it runs cooler. just don't spill it, it leaves a sparkly residue everywhere that the rain has yet to wash away.
B007RVR2QK|5|Great quality great price and delivered on time!!
B0000AY1W7|5|Repels water very well!!
B00OS9G4F4|5|Love this sticker

B00E8HGCEY|5|good buy, works well with my 2005 Road King Custom, helps me keep the maintenance up and wear and tear on my back down.....
B00F4HZW98|5|very good
B0009IQZH0|5|Really nice towels! Love how big they are
B00BY9XKWQ|5|Very easy to install and look great!
B00A7XY07O|1|Had a bad weld and leaked coolant. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Don't go cheap
