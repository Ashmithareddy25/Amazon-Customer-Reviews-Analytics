0399230033|5.0|The story's in the pictures: a mischievious gorilla borrows the zoo keeper's keys and as the zookeeper is completing his rounds, the gorilla  lets the animals out.  The gorilla, with all of the animals following him,  ends up in the zookeeper's bedroom.<br />The pictures are terrific, with a lot  going on in the background. There's a little mouse toting the gorilla's  banana, each animal's cage has a toy, and, of course, the zookeeper's  wife's surprise and familiarity with the animals following him home.<br />My  daughter's definitely picked up some rather complex animal names (e.g.,  giraffe, armadillo) and picked up on the gorilla's shenanigans pretty  quickly.<br />Very fun book.
0064400557|5.0|While we all know \\"Charlotte's Web\\" to be the all-time best selling children's paperback, it is quite enjoyable to reread as an adult.  Most great children's books also seem to appeal to adults.  In fact, I  believe we all still have a place inside of us filled with child-like  wonder, a love for life, and the need to discover something new each day.<br /><br />E.B. White appeals to the playful, mischievous side of our natures.  He  also takes the side of the children and farm animals, making the story  irresistible to children.  Fern, the little farm girl in the story, knows  all the animals and even tells her mother what they say.  Every animal has  a unique and interesting personality.  You may know some of these  personalities in real life: the encourager, the pessimist, the optimist,  and even the depressed.<br /><br />The setting is a beautiful farm situated near  the woods.  One day a litter of piglets brings happiness and anger to  Fern's life.  When she realizes her father's intention to kill the runt  pig, she is horrified.  After physically trying to take the ax away from  her father, she finally convinces him to allow her to raise the pig.<br /><br />Fern affectionately calls him Wilbur and soon he is quite spoiled.  He  is not exactly overjoyed when he sold to Fern's uncle, Mr. Homer L.  Zuckerman.  While living in his new home, he sees Fern less.  Lonely and  tearful, he turns to the other animals for friendship.<br /><br />One day he meets  a goose, she encourages him to break free and nurture his playful side.  After being out of the pen for just a short time, everyone on the farm is  rushing about trying to get him back into the pen.  The illustrations on  these pages are quite amusing.<br /><br />Since Wilbur is too young to know the  difference, he chooses to go back to the pen, even though the goose  encourages him to run for the woods.<br /><br />On his return, the other animals are  rather mean to him.  Even the old sheep tells him he will be dead by  Christmas.  Fortunately, he has already made his acquaintance with a  delicate voiced spider named Charlotte.  She vows to save him from his  terrible fate.<br /><br />What happens next is nothing short of a miracle.  You will  see what a good friend even a spider can be.  This is a story about love,  friendship and how to enjoy the simple things in life.  The end of the  story also shows how Wilbur repays Charlotte's friendship.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews already made his acquaintance with a  delicate voiced spider named Charlotte.

B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana's guitar playing on this album is quite unique. The mix of Santana with other  great vocalists and artists make this a must have CD.  \\"Smooth\\"  is probably the best track.
B000003TBP|5.0|This album is most definately the best &quot;music milkshake&quot; album ever.  That guy could take every single category of music and blend them  together perfectly.  &quot;New Pollution&quot; is a very good example of  that.  My personal faves are &quot;Jackass&quot; &quot;Novocane&quot; and  &quot;Devil's Haircut.&quot;
B00000DFMM|5.0|What a great album!  One of the few 80s techno recordings to really stand  the test of time, this remains wonderfully melodic, infectious pop music,  but with an undercurrent of Euro-sophistication that lends itself to  multiple listenings over time.  The female vocalists are simply fantastic!   Highly recommended.  One caution:  Several versions of this recording  exist, with different tracks, etc.  This is an expanded version, and thus  is the right one to get.

0393317552|5.0|One of my favorite books,learned more in this book then what i learned in  all my years in high school.
0385474547|5.0|This book is truly remarkable. Achebe writes with a simplicity and clarity  not found in many popular novels. He describes a life, while different on  the surface to western culture, contains many things for which all people  live: success, power, and community.<br />The thing I found to be so  interesting in this book, is that for the firat half there is not  &quot;time period&quot; to which many books adhere. This part of the novel  could take place last week or 450 years ago. It tells of a man's struggle  to not be like his father. He wants to have a prominent place in society,  and have things that will provide for his family. This is what the  &quot;rat race&quot; is all about.<br />Aside from Okonkwo's desire to  acheive, there are many other things that pertain to many lives today. The  youthful rebellion of Nyowe, the many meetings of council members, and  trials that hope to determine the outcomes of crimes and domestic disputes  without bias. The people of the Umuofia also have their own religion based  on faith. These, I believe, are the things that the missionaries and the  colonist government do not see, because they only see the surface  differences between themselves and the people of Umuofia.<br />And it is  because these people are not &quot;brutal savages&quot; that the colonists  are able to manipulate their way into the lives of the villagers. The  villagers respect the practicing of religion of one's  &quot;fatherland&quot;. This is a view that not only shows their tolerance,  but their open mindedness as well.<br />This is a great book that everyone  should read! It not only expands one's outlook, but is entertaining,  accessible, suspenseful, and surprising as well. Whether Achebe wrote in  this style in order to make the reader able to see everything he wanted to  say, or to show us who the real &quot;savages&quot; were, I don't know, but  I cannot help but feel a stranger to civilized world after reading it.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird contains criticism of the prejudice and moral laziness that allowed Southern society to have a double standard of  justice. The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white  Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The  story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere,  even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel  goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a  deliberate impulse to hurt others.<br />Another theme of the novel is the  transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story  Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood.  She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are  done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival  of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives  Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow  horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not  everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is  necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to  compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about  how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's  authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on  reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods  while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and  she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.<br />Related to  the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that  innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than  adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice  done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the  complexities of the situationto the point of being blinded to the central  issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure  to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike  undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a  simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice  does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the  learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the  proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly  or not, allied with the machinery of injustice.
6303979882|5.0|Think about that the last time you saw a really, really, good movie. After the movie is over you say to yourself &quot;Oh that was the best movie in  the world&quot;. That's what you think- for about two days! This is a movie  you will always love forever, I guarantee it. It's about four girls-  Samantha Albertson, Teeny Trucell, Chrissy Dewitt, and Roberta Martin- who  make a pact when they were twelve to get together if one of them ever  needed the others. Any girl ages 10 and up can relate to it. The acting was  very good and looked realistic. You will fall in love with the characters  and they're all very realistic. This is one movie that will touch your  heart forever. Buy today!
B00004U8JU|2.0|Why can Spielberg can create such visually stunning films yet cannot find a script worthy of a TV movie of the week. This film is a prime example of  how actors without quality dialog are reduced to stage props.

6305903182|5.0|Scream 3... I'm speechless. So far it was way better than the other two. I enjoy that there isn't half as much blood as the other two. The twists and  turns down this road are very unsepecting. And if you are a scream fan,  you'll love this movie. But I advise you watch the first two before Scream  3 or you'll won't know anything that's going on!
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie.  The acting is great and so are the  action sequences.  The movie was way ahead of its time.  The movie had a  perfect mix of special effects and stunts.  Even today when I watch this  movie its hard to believe that it was made in 1991!  What a great movie.   Great acting by Arnold.
0060977493|1.0|Being a big fan of Indian and Asian writings, I approached this book with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. However soon I found my interest waning.  For Arundhati begins well but starts floundering by page 5. I started  getting the feeling that the author suddenly discovered that she was onto a  big book and wanted to make it arty as possible. So the story suddenly goes  to the backseat. And in come gross and showy phrases. As someone said  earlier this became style over substance. A simple story about twins in  Kerala suddenly became complicated, complex and confusing. It is in parts  an autobiography. In others just jumble of images and words. Sure there are  signs of talent here and there. But, nothing warrants the hype. In fact  some of the scenes inserted seem specifiaclly designed to show the critics  that this is art and not plain story telling. For this false pretense I am  tempted to give this one star...
B000002J0B|5.0|If you think of Led Zeppelin as heavy metal band, then you've only heard Whole Lotta Love and Black Dog. On this album, as with each of their  albums, they went far, far outside the realm of whatever heavy metal  encompasses.<br />From the majestic opening of The Song Remains The Same to  the '50's doo-wop fade-out of The Ocean, this is possibly Led Zep's most  consistent album. With one-man orchestra John Paul Jones prominent on The  Rain Song and No Quarter, Jimmy Page in brillant acoustic form on Over The  Hills And Far Away and pulling out a killer riff in Dancing Days, John  Bonham dominating The Crunge and D'yer Mak'er (pronounced Jamaica, for  those who don't know), and Robert Plant superb throughout, each member of  the band is at their peak, at a time before the excesses of subsequent  tours began to take their toll.<br />The perfect album to listen to pool-side  on a sunny day. Just crank it up and enjoy the magic.
0684833395|5.0|Whenever the men think they have found the perfect solution to a problem,  an illogical predicament--a catch--defeats them. The men can be grounded if  they are insane, but if they recognize the insanity of their missions, they  are sane--and must fly more missions. When Yossarian and his friends begin  asking clever questions to disrupt boring educational sessions, Colonel  Korn decides that only those who never ask questions may ask questions.  When they want to discuss a problem with Major Major, they are allowed into  his office only when he is out. Even when Yossarian is offered an  apparently harmless deal that would allow him to go home as a hero, there  is a catch. He must betray his friends by praising the officers who caused  many of them to die. Life is reduced to one frustrating paradox after  another.
B00004T9UH|5.0|This cd is the greatest. eminem is so funny and even though some of his  songs are a bit depressing he is still the best. this one is good for all  of u teens whose mom wont let u buy somethin with explicit lyrics. this way  u can listen to someone u luv and have ur mom approve of it since there are  NO explicit lyrics.
B00003XACV|5.0|If you've seen the movie you know that the music was very well used in the  film and perfectly sets the mood in a lot of scenes. Because of that, I had  already known all the songs by heart before I even bought the cd. The first  song &quot;Dead Already&quot; is used to introduce the film and its  characters. It's what you heard while Lester was describing his daily  shower ritual, &quot;the happiest part of his day.&quot; &quot;Arose&quot;  is a beautiful dreamy song that plays while Lester is dreaming of all these  roses falling on him. Strangley enough, the only song that sounds happy,  &quot;Lunch W/ The King,&quot; was used while Caroline was cheating on her  husband. A lot of the songs, I guess, you could call minimalist, their  desperate feel perfectly brings out the characters' needs.<br />Sadly, the  songs on this record are very short. Only a few are over two minutes  because in the movie they were just used to accent individual scenes, and  the entire songs were played in the movie, so they're not cut-down  versions. Still, i think it merits 5 stars.
B00000IQBL|4.0|As a former Marine and Vietnam veteran, I have to disagree with Mr. Brennan's portrayal of the second half of this film. The war scenes were  marginal at best and failed to capture the \\"realism\\" of  war...Platoon was much better in that respect. Primarily because Oliver  Stone was a veteran,himself.  However the boot camp scenes in FMJ were dead on  accurate. R.Lee Ermey played the Drill Instructor to perfection,as he should  have, having been the very same in real life.  I had several D.I.'s like  this in boot camp and I can assure you, it WAS this way during the Vietnam war. I can laugh at the  movie now, but while in boot camp it was no laughing matter, we were there  to learn to fight and go to war, other skills were learned, but they were  secondary.  We had to be tough and they made sure we were. The boot camp  portion was almost like a documentary to me! Having said all that, the movie  was like two parts to me.The first half and the second half. With one being dead on and the other only so so and completely based on a Hollywood perception of what the war was like. For those who were not there, trust me...It was much different than this version. Overall, because of R. Lee Ermey's performance and Vincent D'Onofrio I give it 4 stars.
B000001ESN|4.0|Rush said goodbye to the sci-fi tales, the ten-minute epics and the  complex arrangements for a more commercial, radio friendly sound, with  successful results.  A change of decade bought a change of approach in  their music, with lyrics that the man in the street can relate to, the  right to choose (&quot;Free Will&quot;), the communication barrier  (&quot;Entre Nous&quot;) and the environment (&quot;Natural Science&quot;).   Opener &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; was a hit on this side of the Atlantic,  and unbelievably can still be heard on radio today (albeit not very often)  Had I reviewed this without hearing &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, I would  probably have given it 5 stars.  &quot;Pictures&quot; is in every aspect  better than &quot;Waves&quot; and is probably the best rock album ever made  (check my review), but this record still stands out on its own.  Worth  purchasing.
B00000JWVO|4.0|I never considered Cats a great piece of theatre. However, it is pure fun to watch. Often mindless perhaps, but visually stunning. The dancing is  incredible, the costumes are wonderful, most of the music is very good, and  the cast chosen for this video is simply amazing.<br />Sorry, but I am happy  they took out the very boring &quot;Growltiger's Last Stand&quot;. I nearly  dozed off when I watched that part in the theatre. To each his own, but for  me, this number is unnecessary.<br />I will never get over the changed music  to &quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer&quot;, though. The original version  on the OLC CD had stunning music. The new version is forgettable.  But oh,  well... the other things in the video make up for it.<br />Concerning the  video, I have noticed some clumsy, abrupt editing, but I suppose it's not  too distracting.<br />Finally, the cast-- there was not a single person I  wasn't impressed with. Still, my favorites were Elaine Paige, John Mills,  John Partridge and Michael Gruber. Their characterizations were unique and  wonderful.<br />Perhaps Cats has been running for too long for some to take it  seriously. However, now that it's closing on Broadway, this video should be  a must in the upbringing of every child.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has major tallent!! At first I just bought this CD because of the  song &quot;Here With Me&quot; is from my favorite WB show, Roswell, but in  an instant I fell in love with ALL the songs!! Dido makes the perfect good  night music, I used to listen to &quot;Here With Me&quot; before I went to  bed, and it was so peaceful, and has moving lyrics. It's hard for me to  pick a favorite now, because they are all so good! And- just to let you  know- this review is coming from a NSYNC Britney Spears diehard fan, so  that makes Dido the perfect CD for ANYONE!!! Sarah M. or cranberry fans  would love this one, too! So, if you are even hesitating about buying it-  STOP! Rush to the CD store and pick this one up! And you will NOT regret  it!!!
B00000BKI4|5.0|Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs is truly one of the great works of the 90's alternative era, that is if you want to throw it into that category. Along with the Flaming Lip's Soft Bulletin, this album represents a refreshing new direction that &quot;modern&quot; music should strive for - beautiful and challenging. It truly is a remarkable album filled with breathtaking music and visual lyrics, a bit eccentric and quirky yes, but who cares cuz it definitely works. Why can't all albums have this type of creative and challenging spirit to them? Quite a charming little record indeed. Can't wait for their next record!
0380713802|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  A good read.  A make you feel good book about  life.  This is guy is a great read and now I am a big fan and hungry for  his next book.

B00003CWPQ|1.0|Eye's Wide Shut has to be the poorest movie I have ever seen.<br />Although  I like both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in other movies, this movie seems  to have highlighted their weaknesses making them both look quite amateur.<br />The movie was very slow, both figuratively and literally.  It was over  two hours of pull my nails out fun.  The speaking in the movie was done  with \\"dramatic pauses\\" between almost every word.  Then when there were no  words, there was background music ... well a piano ... well, the one chord,  played over and over again.<br />Let us not leave out the color blue beaming  through the windows, every window taking your attention away from the  horrific plot.  Another technique of the movie that was overused.  It seems  that there was an attempt to make every scene dramatic, but instead most  every scene becomes irritating.<br />The plot was hazy at best.  Haziness  induced by characters introduced with seemingly value added interaction,  then *POOF* they're gone, never to be heard from again; leaving me with an  empty feeling about this movie.<br />Of course the ending ... without giving  it away, lets just say that it leaves you
0515125024|5.0|Jack Reacher is back and even better than in The Killing Floor. This book  has it all - great plots, super characters, nonstop action and an all  around hero in the form of Jack Reacher. This book is one terrific read and  even better than the Killing Floor! Although not necessary, it might be  helpful to read The Killing Floor first to get a history on Jack Reacher.  In any case, go get this book - you won't be sorry.
0446525537|5.0|I have never read any Nicholas Sparks books until &quot;a Walk to Remember&quot;.  I have never been touched so deeply by a story until now.   Even though you can figure out where the story is going, the characters are  developed so brilliantly you get involved in the story.  The character of  Jamie reminds me of my sister-in-law which made this even more emotional  reading for me.  Can't wait to read the rest of his books - now I know to  have kleenex handy!
B00000BKDW|5.0|This album is a representation of what Iron Maiden can really do. Every  song from the first track to the last is extremely detailed with full  impact lyrics and vocals by Bruce Dickinson, amazing guitar riffs by Adrian  Smith and Dave Murray with Steve Harris backing them up with killer bass  riffs, and to top it all off, Nicko McBrain pounding on those drums like  there's no tomorrow! My personal favorite song on the album is 'Powerslave'  because of its Egyptian sound and rip-snorting solos right in the middle of  it all. If you liked this album, then you would especially like their  latest album,'Brave New World' which is a similar to this album in relation  to the guitar solos and excellent vocals.    'Powerslave' by Iron Maiden is  probably the best album they have ever produced and still has an impact  upon its listeners even after over 15 years. Buy this album now!!
0515123447|5.0|This book is a definite keeper!  What a great read- well developed  characters, realistic timelines and strategies! If you like Stephen  Hunter's books, you will LOVE this book.
B00004TWZG|5.0|I rented the American release of The Professional a few years ago and I loved it. But the international version is so much better because it has  scenes which explains why Leon is a professional and fills in many details  left out in the American release. I just dont understand why the American  release was cut the way it was but the International Version is definitely  the better of the two.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time, but I have some gripes about the cheap packaging:<br />When is this classic among classic albums  going to be released in stereo?  And when are we going to get some decent  liner notes, instead of a badly done (spread across several pages of the  modest booklet) recreation of the back of the original LP cover.  And what  about some bonus tracks?  I think The Beatles deserve the royal treatment,  don't you?  THEIR CDs HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE THE MID 80s!   What's  going on here?  This is the greatest band that ever happened!<br />I mean,  what are reissue CDs all about?  You can get original LPs on CD by The  Ventures from Japan with the mono and stereo version on the same disc!   Capitol itself did it with The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds just recently.  Why  won't Capitol do it with The Beatles?<br />You know, if all us fans hadn't  complained 15 years ago when George Martin released the first four (this  was #3) Beatles British LPs on CD using the mono versions, he would've just  kept using the mono mixes up to the white album!  But no, we fought back  and starting with &quot;Help!&quot; he used the superior stereo  mixes.<br />But hey, at least the sound is clear in mono - and at least  Capitol isn't as bad as abkco, a company which owns and manufactures the  Rolling Stones' CDs (1960s only), in their case the CDs sound worse than  the vinyl!  I still say the Beatles deserve the best of the best!   Until  that day, sit back and listen to the great tunes.  There'll never be  anything to top it.
B000002U84|4.0|Ever since I first heard &quot;Is there something I should know?&quot; I   have been a fan of these guys.  This to me is one of their best. I  originally had a copy recorded on tape, then I decided to buy it on CD.  I  was very disappointed to hear that they redid all but 2 of the songs and  cut out a lot of parts.  Especially  on &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; they took  out half the song.  I also really enjoyed the longer intro on &quot;Hungry  Like the Wolf&quot; but that too was taken out.  Which is really a shame.   Overall it is still a great CD, there really is not a bad song on the whole  thing.  My favorites are &quot;My Own Way&quot; and &quot;Save a  Prayer&quot;.  I rate it 4 stars only because of all the re-editing.
B00004TWZG|4.0|Jean Reno plays Leon, a hitman. Coldly efficient, cunning and extremely deadly. The movie begins with Leon performing a hit, killing without  remorse and then going home. Leon leads a simple life, although he gets  $5000/head, he leaves this money in the trust of his friend and employer  Tony(Danny Aiello). He seems to live on two quarts of milk a day, sleeps  sitting up, stays in a small flat, and exercises rigorously. His only  companion is his plant, which he cares for meticulously. He has fallen into  a comfortable routine and is at peace with himself.<br />  That all changes  one day, when crooked DEA agents led by the supremely evil Stansfield(Gary  Oldman in a waaay over the top performance) storm his next door neighbor's  apartment in search of drugs. They slaughter everyone who lives there, save  the tiny, 12 year old Mathilda(Natalie Portman in a heart rending  performance). She slips by the DEA agents and goes to Leon for help.  Against his better judgement, Leon takes her in  and this is where the real  movie begins. The relationship between the cold, remorseless killer and the  little girl who has aged beyond her years. Leon teaches her the  &quot;Cleaning&quot; business and Mathilda shows Leon how to live again.  Early in the film Mathilda asks Leon &quot;Is life always this hard, or is  it just when you're a kid?&quot; and Leon coldly replies, &quot;Always like  this.&quot; We get the sense that Leon knows what he is talking about, that  his life has taken so many wrong turns, that now he cares for nothing.<br />   Jean Reno is a revelation. I had previously only seen him in Ronin, and  while I thought he was acceptable in that movie, his performance here goes  leagues beyond what he did in that film. His Leon is portrayed as a calm,  ruthless but also nervous and emotionally insecure assassin. In Natalie  Portman, I am reminded of a very young Milla Jovovich, but perhaps that is  because of foreknowledge of director Luc Bessons fondness for Ms. Jovovich.  Natalie Portman gives an assured performance that is remarkable for one so  young. Everything else I've seen her in, it appears her talents are wasted.  (It is actually making me look forward to the next Star Wars movie). Gary  Oldman's characterisation of Stansfield is so out of this world that it  seems very out of place in this picture. Danny Aiello gives strong, stable  support(as always).<br />  This is Luc Besson's strongest work out of the ones  that I have seen (Fifth Element and the Messenger). I think his use of  color, his compositions and stylization are great, but that sometimes he  does not take the time or takes to get the elements and the performance  just right. Hopefully he will continue to mature as a director.<br />But these  are minor quibbles and do not affect the overall impact of the film. I  highly recommend this movie.<br />  ****/*****<br />  cheers, James
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt is my favorite band, and Tragic Kingdom is my all time favorite  CD! T.K. has to be one of the most best and memorable albums of the 90's  definetly!

Just a Girl: Probably my favorite song and the best one  in the album!. Happy Now and Different People: These are really good songs  to sing along to and they still play those live!. Sunday Morning: Love the  video, Don't Speak: This song made ND explode out of nowhere. Best power  ballad on earth. End it on This: This song grows on you fast. Tragic  Kingdom: Really good live, and love the Disneyland opener (Please remain  seated please) Anyways, if you don't already have this CD (im sure you do)  THEN GET IT!

0792839234|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater, shortly after it's release in 1979. The tag line for the film was, &quot;If this one doesn't scare you, you're  already dead&quot;. I walked out of the theater saying &quot;What a  stinker! Except for the very scary, and totally unexpected, ending, and the  terrific score, that was a terrible flick!&quot; Talk about your low  budgets, the acting is not very good, the dialogue is stilted, the  storyline is hokey and the copious amounts of mustard and red-colored  water, that bears absolutely no resemblence to blood, are hilarious. But  years later, I realized what a cult classic was, because this movie really  stuck in my mind and I realized what a truly great film it really was. I  absolutely had to have it on video and I've probably watched it a dozen  times. There are about three scenes, including the ending, that are truly  scary. The contrast of these scenes with the low-budget hokiness of the  rest of the film is what really makes this movie great. The bad acting and  dialogue only add to the overall effect. Angus Scrimm, as the tall man, has  very few lines, but his creepy &quot;BOYYY!&quot; is unforgettable. Also  unforgettable is the theme music that runs throughout the movie. Buy this  video, settle back with a few friends and a bowl of popcorn, and enjoy!
0316777722|1.0|Let the Sedaris fans lap it up, but for me, this book has no edge  whatsoever.  What's the difference between a performance monologuist such  as Sedaris or Spalding Gray and a stand-up comedian?  The latter at least  has punchlines, but the former just drones on and on.  This is cutesy,  soft, overly-pleasant stuff - the same people who watch &quot;Mystery&quot;  on PBS will love it - perfect for readers who do not want to be disturbed  or think too much.
0375703764|4.0|When I saw this book, I was pretty nervous about reading it. Flipping  through it revealed footnotes that began in an orderly way at the bottom of  the page but soon crept up the sides and took up residence in the middle of  the main text. Some words were blue (actually just one word), and it looked  like far too much of an effort to get through.<br />I eventually convinced  myself to read it, and I haven't regretted it. Rather than make it  difficult to read, the layout and unusual style of the book serve to send  the reader down the same paths as the characters. You're drawn inevitably  through the sometimes scattered plot and, unlike the characters, you  probably won't get lost.<br />One print media reviewer wrote, &quot;I didn't  finish this book; it finished me.&quot; That's pretty apt. Don't fall into  the trap of thinking, &quot;Well, I'll just follow this one little footnote  to the back of the book and then go to bed.&quot; You may find that you've  taken a turn that will keep you up at night.<br />If you want something  different, definitely read this book.
0312117337|5.0|These cards are beautiful.  For the most part the card meanings are  insightful and useful.  However there are a few things that I don't like  about them.  First of all, the artist included an additional non-standard  card called &quot;the master&quot; with a picture of &quot;Osho&quot; (some  guru guy, now deceased, who started a commune in India.)  I'm sorry, but if  this guy were &quot;the master&quot; he wouldn't feel the need to make such  claims as &quot;I'm the beginning of a new spiritual awareness&quot; and  such.  Also, there are some silly aspects of the zenlike belief system such  as &quot;society wants to enslave you&quot; (so I should do what, quit my  job, give all my money to some guru, and join a commune?) that come out in  various cards.  I do not agree with some of the sayings of  &quot;Osho,&quot; but in general these are extremely beautiful cards which  offer an insightful new perspective.  However, if you use this deck I would  ignore &quot;the master&quot; card and disregard some of the cultlike  beliefs expressed in the book.
0783229321|5.0|If you like this movie, then it is a must have dvd!
0767817478|3.0|Godzilla is not as good as it could have, and really SHOULD have been.  Truth be told, this is more of a remake of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS  than the original GODZILLA from 1954/56.  That having been said, this is  still and entertaining movie in the recent summer movie tradition.  The  plot may be easy to pick apart, but the movie still comes across like a  roller coaster ride.  The effects in GODZILLA are quite impressive in  spots, but there are a few shots that don't look as convicing.  The DVD  picture and sound quality are fantastic, and there are some nice extras as  well, so at least the DVD package exceeds expectations.  The main gripe for  many fans is that this is just NOT Godzilla.  This monster, compared to the  unstoppable Japanese version, is a wimp.  It doesn't LOOK like Godzilla,  and it doesn't ACT like Godzilla.  However, if you watch this movie with  realistic expectations you just might enjoy it.
6305897786|1.0|It's hard to believe the man who made &quot;Chinatown&quot; made &quot;9th Gate.&quot; The former had a riveting plot overlain with incredible levels  of meaning -- personal, political, societal. It's one of my top 10 movies  ever.<br />Technically &quot;Gate&quot; was well-made, but the plot was all  surface. None of the moral questions raised about the hero were answered;  nor were any of the plot elements. The ending felt like the answer to the  question &quot;What's the quickest way to get this over with?&quot;<br />Could  have been a good role for Depp if he'd been given a character with any  dep(p)th. By the end, he seemed to be playing for gags, which was probably  the only hope of saving his reputation.<br />A waste of rental money and,  worse, a waste of two hours.
0451167716|4.0|This story has remained a fascinating read for more than thirty years...that's a lot of staying power.  It misses being a legitimate  American classic only because of the idiotic gynecological subplot Puzo  inserted into the text to guarantee some prurient readership if the main  story struck out.  The rest it is a great accomplishment.
6303481272|5.0|Ninja Scroll is the most complete anime I've ever seen. First, it has superior animation. Second, its completely serious tone. No silly, giggling  girls who ruin scene after scene. Third, an actual storyline. Ninja Scroll  has the depth of plot and emotion that is pretty much non-existant in  Japanese anime.  I higly recommend this movie to everyone.
B00000J2KX|1.0|As with all the other current titles on dvd from the &quot;kubrick collection&quot;, the video transfer is mediocre and the audio transfer is  among the worst for all dvds.  A poor send up of a great movie.  Can't wait  until they put in the effort to remaster or get a qualified engineer to do  the hd transfer correctly.  Definitely wait for a better version.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Below is my original review from many years ago.  I have now bought this movie 3 times and it keeps getting better.  Originally purchased on DVD, then DVD Widescreen, then Blu-Ray WS.  Completely restored and looks awesome.  A few indoor darker scenes appear grainy, but overall it's a must have.<br /><br />Point blank... the best western ever!  Oh... you aren't a big fan of westerns?  Well that's okay.  Lonesome Dove holds it's own against any  drama, action adventure or comedy.  It's everything wrapped into one.  The  only negative thing about this movie happens to be the very thing that  makes it so good... it's 6 hour length.  That is why the DVD version is a  must.  You don't have to mess around with 3 or 4 video tapes.  This is one  of the few \\"westerns\\" that the ladies truly enjoy. Lonesome Dove  is not all gunfights and saloon brawls, but it's not at all boring either.  It is filled with witty dialogue and humor.  It's perfect for lazy rainy  days.  The actors chosen were perfect for their parts.  Trust me on this  one.  I'm not some nerd who loves splattering my movie reviews all over the  internet.  In fact this is the only movie review I've ever done.  Get it!
6305358567|4.0|Doesn't every girl dream of being a princess or a queen, well here's your queen, Elizabeth Tudor. Two years old when her mother Anne Boleyn was beheaded on her father's orders, in mortal danger for the next 23 years, she inherited her father's (King Henry VIII) intelligence and will. She was taken under the wing of Henry's last wife Catherine Parr and well educated. Cate Blanchett (see her in a modern setting in Pushing Tin) brings the young Elizabeth vibrantly alive as she become Queen of England, Geoffrey Rush (Shine) plays her intelligence advisor Walsingham, Richard Attenborough (The Great Escape) plays her loyal Secretary of State William Cecil, Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) is her love interest Sir Robert Dudley and Christopher Eccleston (A Price Above Rubies) is Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk who sorely underestimates young Elizabeth. Shot in Durham and York Minister Cathedrals, and Warkworth, Raby, Alnwick, Chillingham, Bolton and Haddon Hall Castles; filled with wonderful costumes and music; you begin to get to know a young woman whose incredible 45 year long reign is regarded as a golden age. R rating with some (gratuitous, I think) sex and historical violence.
B00003ETJQ|2.0|Great film, lousy DVD (compression artifacts galore). Wait for a decent  edition.
0783230893|5.0|If you haven't seen Fried Green Tomatoes, don't wait, here it is. One of the best films of the 90's, it's one of those films where everything seems  to come together seamlessly. Featuring wonderful, underrated performances,  particularily by Mary-Louise Parker (Grand Canyon), Mary Stuart Masterson  (Some Kind of Wonderful), Jessica Tandy (nominated for an Oscar for this  performance) and also noteworthy supporting performances by Gailard Sartain  as Ed Couch, Stan Shaw as Big George, Richard Riehle as Reverend Scroggins,  Nancy Moore Atchison as the youngest Idgie, Raynor Scheine as Curtis Smoote  and Chris O&quot;Donnell, in one of his first film performances, shines as  Buddy Threadgoode. The film, based on the novel by Fanny Flagg (aka the  actress Patricia Neal-remember her in Hud?) interweaves tales which  illuminate the hopes, dreams, struggles, heartbreak and loves of several  women; the stages of understanding women go through in consciousness  raising; and four stages of a womans life: childhood, adolescence,  adulthood and old age. Although it's definitely a chick flick, men are, or  should be, interested in what makes women tick and here's a good start.  Directed by Jon Avnet (Up Close &amp; Personal), music by Thomas Newman,  cinema photography by Geoffrey Simpson (Little Women) and co-written by  Fanny Flagg and Carol Sobieski (Oscar nomination for best adaped  screenplay).
B000001F5F|5.0|My favorite U2. Live sound enhanced by post production echo. Short album  because released as a last minute Christmas stocking stuffer in 84.  Electric Co. edited because of legal rights to the song, &quot;Send in the  Clowns&quot;.
B00003CXFU|4.0|Director Steve Soderbergh (Out of Sight) and screen writer Susannah Grant (Ever After) have fashioned another, much better version of Civil Action.  Julia Roberts, in one of her freshest performances, is Erin Brockovich, a  single mother with three kids, out of work, with little education or  experience. She gets a job as gofer in a law firm headed by Ed Masry  wonderfully played by Albert Finney (Millers Crossing). Based on a true  story with a real life Erin Brockovich, it's a tale of David versus  Goliath. Watching the essentially conservative Julia Roberts playing  against herself with short skirts, push-up bras and stiletto heels and then  watching her character playing against the long suffering Ed Masry is very  entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (Any Given Sunday) gives a nice, complex  performance as Erin's helpful neighbor; Marge Helgenberger (K.C. of ABC's  China Beach) plays Donna Jensen, a touching victim who becomes a plaintiff.  Good, if you'll pardon my pun, uplifting fun.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book after I bought my Krupps La Glaciere Ice Cream maker.   So far I've made the Fresh Georgia Peach Ice Cream and the Vanilla Oreo Ice  Cream.  Both are good.  If you like Ben and Jerry's ice cream, I would  reccommend this book.
6304233639|2.0|The movie has great special effects. I guess this is where all the money  went while making the film. I say this because its pretty obvious that no  money was spent on hiring competent writers. The subplots in the movie are  pretty stupid, the characters look confused on screen, and the movie  borrows from so many other science fiction stories that one wonders why the  producers weren't sued. Oh yeah, Randy Quaid's character was pretty  useless, except until the end. Even then, it was kinda obvious what was  going to happen. Come on people, when you attack a ship that is several  miles across, don't you think convential weapons may not be able to bring  it down. How stupid do they think their audience is.
B000000OA6|5.0|Throughout the history of the band Queen, every album always carried a  sense of humor throughout, and this one is no exception. &quot;I'm Going  Slightly Mad&quot; and &quot;Delilah&quot;(meow) give us the requisite  humor that every Queen fan was prepared for.  The title cut is, I believe,  one of the best they ever did if not the best.  &quot;These are the  Days...&quot;is a poignant number from a band who never denied the  realities of life.  &quot;Headlong&quot; is just basically an uplifting  little number that I really don't understand lyrically, but I do enjoy.     And &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; is a chilling finale to a partnership  that lasted for more than 20 years.  What a way for the show to end!   Thanks, guys, for more than 2 decades of great music!
B000001U3K|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest deals in rock and roll.  I have no idea  why this album is so inexpensive, but believe me, you'll be glad you got  such a deal.  Of course &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; is worth the  price of the album all by itself, but every song on here is a winner.   &quot;Vicious&quot;, &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;, and &quot;I'm So  Free&quot; are particularly great.  If there's one thing Lou Reed can do,  it's write songs you'll remember.

0385493622|4.0|This book is not only an account of the incredible journey to prove  Fermat's last theorem, that made generations of mathematicians devote their  lives. It is also an interesting story about the evolution of mathematics.  At various moments Singh stops talking about the theorem and tells us  episodes in history of mathematics and how that affected peoples' lives.  That is what makes the book so interesting.

B00004W5UA|5.0|It is unfortunate that I cannot make this review too detailed and risk giving away the plot. It has some wild cinematography, which may or may not  have been needed, but whatever visuals it might have had are completely  overcome by the message of the movie itself. It is bizzare. It is  compelling. It has some twists that will blow your mind.

6304211740|5.0|I disagree with many of the people who did not like this movie. I think  that it is the best movie version I have seen yet. William Hurt makes an  excellent Rochester and Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane is exactly as I always  pictured her. The scenery and the costumes are also very beautiful. I have  also seen the Timothy Dalton version (as many people mentioned) and though  it is good, I dont think it quite compares to this one. The chemistry  between Gainsbourg's Jane and Hurt's Rochester is tangible. Anna Paquin as  young Jane was the perfect choice, now there is a talented young actress  (see &quot;The Piano&quot; she won an oscar for her role in that)  The one  thing I do agree upon however, is that Elle McPherson as Blanche Ingram was  a poor choice indeed. She looked like a sickly wax doll and her blonde hair  looked fake! fake! fake! But that was just about the only thing I did not  like about this movie. See it, you wont be disappointed.
0156711427|5.0|I first read this book about 20 years ago and it blew me.  At the risk of  sounding culture-vulturish, I would say that it is not only a novel, it is  music with its leitmotifs, it is architectural in its structure and it is a  book with a profoundly (sorry about this overused word)humanistic point of  view.<br />I disagree, strongly with other reviewers who have reviewed this  book as a political manifesto.  Forster does not condemn the English in  India, but rather by allowing us to be flies on the wall to their behaviour  and attitudes he allows us to observe them.  The condemnation is ours.  I  don't feel that Forster wrote this novel in order to conform to today's  political correctness and to point out &quot;Gee, weren't the English  nasty&quot; or &quot;Aren't White Anglo-Saxons dreadful&quot;.  <br />The  English in India are a convenient metaphor for his themes of inclusion and  exclusion, acceptance and rejection, love that comes from knowledge and  acceptance or hate that arises through fear and ignorance.<br />Don't read  this book with a mindset of &quot;What is going to happen at the  trial&quot; or Whodunit.  Within the first few pages of the book, the  central question around which this novel revolves is posited - &quot;Can an  Englishman and an Indian become friends?&quot; and by extension can any two  people break down the barriers and come together in friendship.  Read the  book with this question in mind.
B000002GQG|5.0|The opening cut of this first of several concept albums released by the Moody Blues in rapid fire succession tells it all, a provocative,  thoughtful, and intellectually fascinating exploration of altered states of  consciousness, and a particular focus on the eastern idea of being. This  exploration is a quite self-conscious attempt to use the experimental  fusion between mainstream rock music and eastern forms started by the  Beatles, and no one carried off the exploration with more panache and style  than the Moody Blues, who, to their great distress, quickly became a kind  of cult force in popular culture, making them pop icons overnight.<br />This  is an intriguing album, and a valuable introduction for the uninitiated to  the wild range of talents and interests of the various members of the band,  and is a showcase for their musical virtuosity. From the opening mysterious  number introducing the concept to the quick transition to &quot;Ride My  Seesaw&quot;, this is a fast-paced tour of the wide range of the field of  psychedelic exploration. &quot;&quot;Legend Of A Mind&quot; is an ironic  look at Timothy Leary and his public advocacy of LSD, laughing at the idea  while at the same time exploring it in earnest (He'll take you on a trip  across the bay.... and bring you back the same day...).  \\"House of Four  Doors\\" is an introduction to \\"Zen' proper, and to the uniquely eastern  ideas of altered states of consciousness and being. \\"Legend Of A Mind\\" is a  further exposition of Leary and the popular search for consciousness.<br />The  rest of the album focuses increasingly on aspects of the eastern way of  perceiving and interpreting reality, and they conduct this exploration  within the margins of popular music quite provocatively and very  entertainingly. This part of the album is my favorite, especially the  evocative \\"Voices In The Sky\\", although I also really like \\"Visions of  Paradise\\", \\"Om\\", and \\"The Word\\" as well. This is classic Moody Blues  material, and they mine this genre in a way uniquely their own. I would  start with this album, and work my way deliciously through \\"On The  Threshold Of A Dream\\", \\"To Our Childrens' Childrens' Children\\", and finally  to \\"A Question Of Balance\\", which comprises the real close of this phase of  their concept album series. All of them are thoughtful, artistically well  expressed, and a timeless celebration of what it means to be human. I  highly recommend all their albums. Enjoy!, and they mine this genre in a way uniquely their own.

6304056958|5.0|Some women are classy. Some women are sassy. And some women are brassy. You see them all here. One of George Cukor's finest, most polished films,  &quot;The Women&quot; runs rampant with malicious gossip, simpering  ingenues, a delectably delightful comedy. Norma Shearer plays  sophisticated, classy socialite Mary Haines, with all the essentials a  woman needs: a husband, child, white picket fence, large luxurious house...  and a brassy gossip for a best friend, Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell, in  one of the meatiest roles of her career). Recently, Sylvia has come up with  gossip of particular interest: Mary's hubby Stephen has been seen with a  sassy young ingenue, Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford at her most Joan  Crawford). While Mary is brushing her way through the rumors, gossip,  (whatever you call it) Crystal uses every ounce of allure in her 16-inch  waistline to lure the wealthy Stephen away. Can Mary's grace and principles  outshine Crystal's ... er, Crystal's... especially with Sylvia chattering a  mile a minute in the background? And although George Cukor may be known as  being &quot;a woman's director&quot;, men should want to see the film too,  for in the cast of 135, all are women... that's right. Not a single man in  sight. Well, with two hours of women, comedy, women, style, and women, how  can you go wrong with this one? Trust me: you can't.
0671867369|5.0|No one has been more prolific or entertaining in his efforts to bring the gritty, unit-level personal experiences of the Allied drive from Normandy  into Germany to the public's attention than Stephen Ambrose. In his series  of books including &quot;D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World  War Two&quot;, &quot;The Victors&quot;, &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;, and  the present book, &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot;, he has masterfully employed  a little-known treasure trove of personal interviews with thousands of  Allied soldiers to marshal an absolutely absorbing, captivating, and  insightful treatise on the nature of combat as experienced by the men and  women in the forefront of action as it transpired all along the front.<br />In this volume he concentrates on the exploits of a company of soldiers  from their indoctrination into combat with the assault on the beaches in  Normandy, following them as they fight their way, along with two million  other Allied soldiers, into the heartland of Germany itself.  In a book  memorable for its unusual focus (for Ambrose) on a small group of men we  come to know and admire for their all too human traits and character  foibles, the spellbinding story of men in combat is made more vivid, vital,  and personal than is possible in any other way. By concentrating on the  ordinary men of E-Company as they move through a panorama of death and  destruction, their personal stories, private adventures, and shared horrors  in the midst of carnage, chaos, and confusion become a fascinating and  compelling tale. By filling the pages with men we comes to know better than  in his other books, we watch with amazement as they moved into free fire  zones where anything that moves dies, and in the process Ambrose paints an  indelible portrait of the unbelievable madness of war.<br />This is a story  that should be told again and again, so we never forget what it took to  take back Europe from the beasts who first stole it so savagely, of the men  who died on the beaches, who fell for freedom in the surrounding  countryside, all to prepare for those like this company of ordinary men who  relentlessly pushed deeper and deeper into the interior of France, finally  pushing the battered and beaten Germans all the way back to Berlin. This  was the single greatest adventure of the 20th century, an epic struggle in  which millions of Brits, Canadians, Australians, Frenchmen, and Americans  took back by force of arms the liberty and freedom that had been wrested  away from the mainland so cruelly four years before. This, then, is the  story of how that crusade to liberate Europe unfolded through the personal  experiences of a small group of American soldiers.<br />Mr. Ambrose has  become a virtual cottage industry in the World War Two section of your  local bookstore, while he has also published works such as his recent best  seller on explorers Lewis and Clark. Meanwhile, he has become phenomenally  successful because many of his books have captured the public's imagination  by being so readable, entertaining, and informative. While popular success  doesn't always equate to critical worthiness, in his case it consistently  seems to. This is a wonderfully worthwhile, eminently researched,  exhaustively documented, and superbly narrated book on the most historic  struggle in the long and painful struggle to finally liberate Europe.

B000002540|4.0|For years, I have wondered why live albums had so much success. Generally  the sound is awful, our favorite artist or band NEVER plays the song we  like the most and, last but not least, we often discover that the cherished  one (s) doesn't know how to sing. So why spend 10 $ for BOC's ON YOUR FEET  OR ON YOUR KNEES ?<br />I can only say that, after having carefully listened  to their first three albums, I had to know how Blue &Ouml;yster Cult performed  in concert. Were they able to keep the band's homogeneity alive outside of  the studio ? Undoubtedly yes ! Of course, you must be in good psychological  shape to play the twelve songs in a row ; it's loud hard rock with a good  deal of tortured guitar solos. So play, as I did, ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR  KNEES after a 10 hours working day, your accumulated aggressivity will  vanish between HOT RAILS TO HELL and ME 262 and your dear one will thank  Blue &Ouml;yster Cult for the rest of the evening !<br />Amidst the three, until  then, unreleased songs, BUCK'S BOOGIE, in my opinion, is the weakest, BOC's  versions of MASERATI GT and BORN TO BE WILD being far superior. Let's also  notice that the concert tempo of THE SUBHUMAN is a little slower than the  one adopted during the studio session.<br />A CD for the band's aficionados.
B000002GQE|5.0|This album was my introduction to the wonder of the Moody Blues, who at  that point were just establishing themselves as an innovative and highly  experimental form of pop rock that explored a number of intriguing area of  the genre. The album was intended as a kind of popular introduction to the  band, who had formed shortly before and had several songs to audition with  but not a full stable of songs. So, when lead singer Justin Hayward was  approached by a member of the Polygram label with the idea of a  rock-orchestral fusion album, he jumped at the chance, understanding what a  break it would be for the band. Of course, the album was an instant  success, and led to the release of &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; and later  the smash hit  \\"Nights in White Satin\\" as singles. The rest, as they say,  was history, for they turned this opportunity into a string of fabulously  successful albums and three decades of very popular public touring.  Strictly speaking, then, this album is a mixed bag, an attempt to fuse  popular rock with classical music, and in a number of places, this works  amazingly well. At other points in the album, the segue is less well  accomplished, and it is less pleasing. But overall it is a wonderful album,  and one that has a firm place in pop music history as the first step into  the limelight by one of the most enduring bands in the history of rock and  roll. Enjoy!
B000002GQH|5.0|The opening cut of this second of the several concept albums released by the Moody Blues in rapid fire succession tells it all, a provocative,  thoughtful, and intellectually fascinating exploration of what it means to  be an individual human being in a world gone wildly out of control. As in  their previous albums, the Moody Blues use a rock style fusing mainstream  rock music and eastern musical forms, and with a singular virtuosity that  is spellbinding to listen to. No one carried such musical explorations with  more panache and style than the Moody Blues, who, to their great distress,  quickly became a kind of cult force in popular culture, making them pop  icons overnight.<br />This is an intriguing album, and a valuable  introduction for the uninitiated to the wild range of talents and interests  of the various members of the band, and is a showcase for their musical  virtuosity. From the opening mysterious number introducing the now-familiar  concept of individual personalities trapped and constrained by the  overwhelming influence of a world of mindless bureaucracy, impersonality,  and inhumane machines, the thoughtful monologue moving from the hesitant  uncertainty of a solitary soul confronted by technological domination to a  segue to embrace of other kindred humans in \\"Lovely To See You\\". The mood  of thoughtful exploration of the issue is established, and we are n for  another wondrous mind ride that the Moodies were so singularly famous for.  The rest of the album focuses increasingly on aspects of this tension with  an individual's needs and rights and ways of being life-affirming in the  age of the machine.<br />This is classic stuff, with the lyrics, melodies,  and extremely artful arrangements supporting the search for identity. My  favorites here are \\"Never Comes The Day\\", which enjoyed some FM airtime,  and \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", a dreamy etching of much more romantic  and adventurously human times of King Arthur and Lady Guinevere.  I also  love the absolutely spectacular instrumental work composing the last half  of the album, beginning with \\"The Dream\\" and culminating with \\"Have You  Heard\\" part two. This is classic Moody Blues material, and they mine this  genre in a way uniquely their own. I would start with &quot;In Search Of  The Lost Chord&quot;, and work my way deliciously through \\"On The Threshold  Of A Dream\\", \\"To Our Childrens' Childrens' Children\\", and finally to \\"A  Question Of Balance\\", which comprises the real close of this phase of their  concept album series. All of them are thoughtful, artistically well  expressed, and a timeless celebration of what it means to be human. I  highly recommend all their albums.

B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx is probably one of the most under-rated male artists out  there. Sure he has had his major hits such as Right Here Waiting,Now and  Forever,and Hold Onto the Nights(which are all on this CD.) But it's sad  that you really don't hear much about him anymore. I would rate him up  there with the greats like Billy Joel,Sting,and even Elton John. Marx is a  great song-writer and can play the piano and guitar beautiful which are  displayed on many of the tracks on this album. The out-standing tracks on  here in my opinion are Hold onto the Nights,Don't Mean Nothing,and Right  Here Waiting. Right Here Waiting is Marx's signture song which I'm sure  everyone has heard one time or another. It is also probably the best ballad  on the eighties. So,if you are a big music fan and enjoy soft-rock,you have  not lived until you hear this. Definately not a waste of your money,so buy  it and enjoy!
B000002GQJ|5.0|As with their earlier concept albums, the opening cut of this final of the  several such concept albums released by the Moody Blues in rapid fire  succession tells it all, a provocative, thoughtful, and intellectually  fascinating exploration of a range of problems of rescuing the environment  in a world wildly out of control. As in their previous albums, the Moody  Blues use a rock style fusing mainstream rock music and eastern musical  forms, and with a singular virtuosity that is spellbinding to listen to. No  one carried such musical explorations with more panache and style than the  Moody Blues, who, to their great distress, quickly became a kind of cult  force in popular culture, making them pop icons overnight.<br />This is an  intriguing album, and a valuable introduction for the uninitiated to the  wild range of talents and interests of the various members of the band, and  is a showcase for their musical virtuosity. From the opening mysterious  number introducing the now-familiar concept of individuals feeling helpless  and impotent in the face of the mindless corporate and technological forces  polluting the environment and despoiling the earth.  It builds on the  earlier albums in the sense it follows the countercultural ideas as well as  the precepts of outspoken critics of mainstream society like Lewis Mumford  and others decrying the destructive tendencies of science and technology.  The mood of thoughtful exploration of the issue is established, and we are  in for another wondrous mind ride that the Moodies were so singularly  famous for. The rest of the album focuses increasingly on aspects of this  tension with an individual's needs and rights and ways of being  life-affirming in the age of the machine.<br />This is classic stuff, with  the lyrics, melodies, and extremely artful arrangements supporting the  search for identity. My favorites here are \\"Question\\", which was a huge  popular hit for them, \\"It's Up to You\\", and \\"And The Tide Rushes In\\". As  always, they mine the range of modern rock with more panache and virtuosity  than anyone else.  This is classic Moody Blues material, and they mine this  genre in a way uniquely their own. I would start with &quot;In Search Of  The Lost Chord&quot;, and work my way deliciously through \\"On The Threshold  Of A Dream\\", \\"To Our Childrens' Childrens' Children\\", and finally to this  album, \\"A Question Of Balance\\", which comprises the real close of this  phase of their concept album series.

B00000JGEN|5.0|Yes, this movie follows all the cliches of 80's action films. But, how many of those 80's action were as fun and funny as The Running Man? This is  one of my favorite Arnie movies, after the Terminator films. If you have  read the Stephen King book but have not seen this movie and are planning  too, I have one suggestion:forget the book. The movie has a higher  entertainment value. When Arnie gets his revenge on the host of the show,  you will feel like laughing and standing up and cheering. Jesse Ventura's  appearance is absolutely hilarious and has an extremely high 'I don't blame  for being angry one bit' factor. When you see the movie you will understand  what I mean. Maria Conchita Alonso's character is also extremely likable.  And Arnie is surprisingly fantastic.
B00000G3HZ|1.0|Here is yet another pretentious, boring, and self-important Lawrence Kasdan film. Not touching by any means and often makes the viewer feel bad  once seen. Is it really that bad? Yes it is.

B000002MQ9|4.0|This is music for the soul-satisfying moments that find my feasting eyes  reading by candlelight in my dark &amp; breezy room.  The airy chanting  rhythms, haunting cello &amp; violin beckon Lisa Gerrard's and Brendan  Perry's ominous voices forth to perfect low haunting pitch ~~ A likely  background music to the whispered conversation of dark frocked figures  (hypnotically conjured entities of my own pure imagination) perched along  these walls. This blissfully dark music is not for the light-hearted.  Yet  it is eternally alluring to this old soul of mine ~
B00004TWZG|5.0|i, too, saw &amp; fell in love with the american version. i bought it vhs  &amp; dvd and now, i own the director's cut. oh yes! much much better!!  fuller, much more rounded out. the subject material that was cut is more  risqu, yes, but worth it. natalie portman gives an incredible performance,  as does Mr. Reno, and Mr. Oldman is spectacular as always. you just can't  take your eyes away when oldman is onscreen. this film takes an american  action formula and pumps it up with euro emotion, daring, and bravado. the  extra footage may dance dangerously close to taboo (here in america) but  you have to credit director luc besson in going for it. particularly  enjoyable is the dinner scene where mathilda professes her &quot;love&quot;  for leon and gets drunk. let's see MORE european/director's cuts of these  great films!
6305907145|4.0|Here I be - oncemore reviewing a Jane Austen adaptation that is not quite true to the novel from which it is contrived.  And here oncemore do I  sanction one and give unto it my blessing.  (Sometimes I shock myself.)  Yet I cannot deny that I found this movie charming.  I must say that  Frances O'Connor gives a more openly formidable spirit in Fanny than the  subtle and silent brick wall of a spirit in the Fanny of the novel.  So,  here's the scoop:<br />Fanny, the oldest daughter in a near-impoverish family  of many children, goes to live with her mother's sister, Lady Bertram's,  family on a large estate.  Another aunt, Mrs. Norris, secures Fanny's  position in the family as a sort of servant to wait upon her aunt and act  as a sort of &quot;savage&quot; companion to Lady Bertram's daughters,  Maria and Julia.  Alone in her attic room with no fire, Fanny writes  incessantly clever little stories and letters to her family - and over the  years of her childhood and blooming womanhood develops a close friendship  with the Bertram's second son, Edmund.  Everything is quaint and peaceful  until a brother &amp; sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, move into the  parsonage on the estate.  As the Bertram sisters, one of whom is engaged  and set to marry another man, flirt with and swoon over Henry, Edmund  determines to woo Mary, who welcomes it notwithstanding the fact that that  he is only the 2nd son and would not inherit the estate.  In the meantime,  Henry sets his sights intently on Fanny - who is by now in love with  Edmund.<br />So sets things into motion.  The movie differs from the book,  however, in not only several blatant characteristics in Fanny, but also  distinct differences in Edmund's feelings toward his little cousin.  The  source of the Bertram's wealth - only vaguely referenced in the novel -  provide in this movie a much darker view of humanity than I think Austen  would have even conceived. But forgiving all that, I'll happily admit I  shall - as with all the Jane Austen movie adaptations - watch this charmer  several times again!all the Jane Austen movie adaptations - watch this charmer  several times again!
B00004TWZF|5.0|i have been waiting for this picture on dvd for a long long time! and to finally get it, with additional footage, no less! this was the first besson  picture i ever saw. i was immediately taken with his style &amp; feel for  subject. the american version was good, only, unbeknownst to me at the  time, it felt somewhat incomplete-- now i know why. this director's cut  fills in so many gaps, answers so many unspoken questions. it rounds out  the romance between jacques &amp; joanna as well as gives more depth to the  friendship/competition between jacques &amp; enzo. the &quot;drinking in  the diving bell&quot; scene is a riot, mimicking the drinkng in the pool  scene. in my opinion the film needs those extra &quot;director's&quot;  minutes to evove from a good picture with potential to an awesome picture,  period. i am so much happier seeing this movie with those formerly  &quot;lost&quot; european additions. Mr. Reno is worth his weight in gold,  a great job by Mr. Barr, and Ms. Arquette provides a nice american  counterpoint to these euro stars. interesting to see arquette &amp; griffin  dunne together again (from &quot;after hours-- m. scorcese&quot;). a great  &quot;new&quot; ending... you'll see when you compare it to the version  american
B00004T9UF|3.0|I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but this cd is definitely not the  best!  I do LOVE eminem ...  But the CD is funny.  So if you want a  good laugh and you don't take entertainment seriously, you may like this.  !*EVER* glad I didn't spend money on this.<br />What's interesting is that  young Mr. Mathers seems to possess quite a gift for rhyme and delivery  which he unfortunately squanders in subject matters that are reminescent of  a third-grader who just learned his first dirty word.  The music is catchy,  his delivery and enunciation are clear, and some of his phrasing is funny  and sometimes actually clever (such as in &quot;Who Knew&quot; where he  chastises parents for not having kept a closer eye on their children who  learned to spew expletives left and right, presumably from an album such as  his).  But all these positives are so quickly erased by his choice of  subject matters and his insistence on using as many vulgarities as he can  within the 3-minute time span alloted for each song.<br />The whole thing is  offensive, [and] not primarily because of the choice of vulgar words and the  subject matters ...<br />...<br />PARENTS, TAKE NOTE:  You *NEED* to listen to this!  This is not an  album whose worst offense is a bit of innuendo.  This is hard-core  vulgarity at its worst.  Should your 12 year-old really be listening to  this?  Pop this in yourself and just listen to track 1 &quot;PSA  2000&quot;.  Your ears will bleed.  I'm all for freedom of speech, but this  is definitely not an album for kids.
B00002SWEM|1.0|OK .....caveat emptor .....but I did place some reliance on the number of  stars in your rating for this CD. Your rating was 5 stars, I gave it one  because there was no provision for a zero.
6300214753|5.0|John Huges has some of the best films about teenagers and families.The reason I love this movie is because I always skiped school when I was a  teenager.I had a friend just like Ferris,Tom Murphy.We all looked up to  him,and I was Cameron in away,I had a car,but was poor.This movie's not  only a comedy,but has some serious issues with Cameron,played by Spin Citys  Alan Ruck.I love it when Matthew Broderick looks at the camera and talks to  us during the movie. The greatest part is the parade,when Ferris sings to  the Beatles,&quot;Twist and Shout.&quot;One thing I always love about John  Hughes films is the music.Its always way out there.You might hear punk rock  or Wayne Newton.&quot;Ferris Bueller's day off&quot;is one movie everyone  in the family can enjoy.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is so REAL!. Realness oozes from every song. Some of the songs  are so great, that their really GREAT. This is a masterpiece. It's the  greatest thing since the discovery of penicillin. This is the best album of  all time, not just of all time, but of really ALL TIME. I'd take this album  to a deserted island. I'd trade my pancreas for this album. Other songs are  sad, but these songs are really SAD. If you want some music that'll make  you feel really GOOD too, get this album. It changed you life. I mean  really CHANGED my life. It brought peace and harmony to Western  Civilization. It saved children in Ethiopia from starvation. They weren't  just hungry, they were really HUNGRY before they heard this album. All that  they're saying is \\"Give Peace A Chance.\\" Give peace a really big CHANCE.
6303159966|2.0|Having read the book, which is a classic and truly terrifying, my expectations for this film were high.  The idea of a family pet becoming a  salivating monster is still a scary thought, but unfortunately the film  fails to deliver.  The 'cute' scenes involving the young boy and his father  really have no business in a horror film.  And the characters who die are  all so obnoxious you couldn't care less about them anyway.  In fact, Cujo,  far from being frightening, comes across as the only sympathetic character  in the entire mess.  Added to that are the facts that the scenes in the  stranded car drag on and become tedious, and that the 'surprise ending' is  pointless and idiotic, and you're left with something which isn't worth the  bother.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I know everything about this style of music and about this band and about  this album. I own all their albums, and all the albums of this style of  music, and all the albums ever made. Heck, I own albums that weren't ever  made. So when I tell you that this album is good, I'm not talking like some  new twit on the block. I've been listening this band before you were ever  born, before they ever recorded their first album, before they even thought  of recording their first album. I saw these guys in concert so many times,  and no one else has ever seen them that many times, so when I say \\"great.\\"  I mean \\"great\\" like a profession and not some casual listener like you out  there. Hey, I know. You don't know nothin.' You're stupid, and stupid  people like you should listen to me.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|My Dog Skip is based on the book by Willie Morris of the same name.  It is the story of a small town boy who is given a dog, Skip.  In short time,  Skip becomes Willie's best friend and partner in crime.  Skip also is by  Willie's side throught all the changes and challenges that come a young  boy's way.  This is a wonderful movie, and retains the southern small town  essence that made the book much loved.  Supported by brillant, understated  performances by Diane Lane, Luke Wilson and standout Kevin Bacon,  Frankie  Muniz is a natural and likeable child actor who is more than up to the  challange.  This is a classic in the sense of Old Yeller and Lassie.  It is  a movie you will pull out and watch again and again.
B00004THAY|5.0|This album means a lot to me since my grandmother died of cancer of the  bowels. She went to doctor about a year ago, and the doctor said that she  only had about six months to live. The songs remind me of the time that my  husband walked out and left me with three kids, two dogs, and no car. I  mean, how could anyone do such a terrible thing? Sure I got married when I  was 17 because I was pregnant with my oldest son, Teevon, but I was in love  just like these love songs.
B000001EEN|4.0|This CD documents a 1973 show that Pete Townshend organized to get Clapton  out of his post-Derek two-year heroin rut.  The band is Clapton, Townshend,  Ron Wood, Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Rick Greche and Jimmy Karstein.   <br />After this show, Clapton got his act together, recorded &quot;461 Ocean  Boulevard&quot; and has been on the ascent ever since.<br />As a document of  brilliant British blues rock it has few peers, and the live sound gives a  great sense of what it must have been like to be in the Rainbow that night.
B00000I8BX|5.0|I love the album, it's not too heavy and it's not too soft. I got into the  FF gang when I got DEMANUFACTURE in 96' and I was so amazed!! I recomend  this to anyone who claims they are a metalhead. FF was doing this before  KoRn and they still ROCK!!!!
0060254920|5.0|This book is such a classic.  Great illustrations that bring me back to the silly and whimsical days when we were kids.<br />My wife and I continue to  pass it on the younger generations.

B00000DHRZ|2.0|Yes,this is MTV commercial punk-rok for teenagers and BSB fan there are  Three good song:Have you ever,the kids aren't alright and americana but all  the other songs especially pretty fly are only commercial songs write to  make money. I was a great offspring fan and now i respect them but if you  want to heard good punk songs don't buy americana but buy Smash, ignition  snd self titled offspring album. Thanks.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I loved their first record and this one's even better. Anyone can listen  to the LB because they got somethin' for everyone, anything from soft rock  to rap and heavy metal they got it. THIS QUINTET IS ROCKIN' THE CHARTS!!!!!

0792156684|1.0|The greatest.  It combines the horrible tragedy of the Titanic with a timeless love story.  It makes me cry everytime.  The only problem was  during a scene with Jack and Rose taking a walk on the deck, there was a  little speck or a sort of flicker in the corner of the picture.   Considering this, Titanic is definately the worst movie ever.
6300268993|5.0|Who would have guessed that when 3 super villians were thrown into the Phantom Zone in Superman I, that they would be Superman's worst enemy in  the next Superman installment? I found this movie to be very exciting as  Superman took on all three super criminals and took a chance at a  relationship with Lois. This movie, I felt, had a lot more action adventure  than Superman I and thought the way that Luthor, the 3 villians and the  love interest with Lois was fitted into the movie, was brilliant. I was not  bored one bit with this thriller.
6305137293|5.0|I dont care what any critic says about this movie, this is by far the one of the best sequals ever made. The thing that makes this movie great is  that it dosnt let you down like most other movie sequals do. This movie  continues right where the first one ended sending jamie lee to the hospital  after her encounter with michael. Michael ends up stalking her in the  hospital, and a shocking secret is reavealed about the connection between  jamie lee and michael. Even though this one has alot more gore and lacks  the suspense of the first one, it still remains one of my favorite horror  movie sequals of all time. Definatly check it out!
B000021XR5|5.0|The cd starts off with &quot;Down&quot;, a power chord detuned driven  song.  Then it follows up with other harder songs such as &quot;Heaven and  Hot Rods&quot; and &quot;Pruno&quot;.  But as the cd progresses you reach  songs like &quot;Sour Girl&quot; and the finale &quot;Atlanta&quot;.   &quot;Atlanta&quot; is a beautiful song with a hint of mexican background  with a orchestra and great acoustic guitar.  This cd has what the hardcore  STP fans want and what the people who loved Tiny Music liked.  And if your  not an STP fan then this is something you should definately look into if  you like rock.  Scott Weiland has a great voice and Robert and Dean DeLeo  meld together great guitar with smooth baselines.  This is a definate buy.
078322804X|5.0|A really great film for any fan of slap stick comedy or great car chases. I loved this movie mainly because of the great action sequences and car  chases. I have to say i wasnt much for all the musical numbers in there but  it dosnt ruin the movie in any way. The movie is about the misadventures of  jake and elwood blues as they try to earn 5000 dollars in time to pay the  rent on the church they grew up in. Great cast featuring john belushi, dan  aykroyd, carrie fisher, john candy, aretha franklin, cab calloway, ray  charles, and more. Definatly worth a look.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I recently had a chance to catch an Alanis concert, in Israel, and it was  simply amazing! The raw intensity of this beautiful young woman on stage  along with some of the world's top musicians was simply marvelous. I was in  the front row (\\"the front crow - with popcorn..\\") and right in the middle,  so I was able to catch every single precious moment of the best concert in  my life. From all the jumping and singing and yelling, I actually  dislocated my shoulder and had enormous pain for three weeks, but it was  worth it. Now to the point - this album! I have to admit that it took some  time for Junky to grow on me. Naturally, once I listened to it, I started  comparing it to the previous Alanis album, Jagged Little Pill. Jagged was  and still is probably my favorite album ever, it also was the first CD I  ever bought, at the age of 13. It's one of the only albums I can honestly  say I love entirely. There's not a single song in this album, which I skip,  they are all genius. Especially Perfect, Hand in My Pocket, Forgiven, Mary  Jane, Your House, Head Over Feat, and... well, practically all of them. It's  no wonder Pill sold over 28 million (!) copies. Such success is hard to  repeat, and I don't think the success, or lack of, and the many fans who  probably didn't like Junky, were what Alanis thought about when writing it.  It's way too personal. One thing I learned from listening to the remarkable  opening track - Front Row - was that this is not another Pill. It took some  listens, especially late night ones, with earphones, until I completely  fell in love with this beautiful work of art. Where Pill screams, Junky  whispers. Where Pill kicks, junky caresses. It's simply the more mature,  more at-peace side of Alanis. The first track is brilliant I think. `Baba'  is also a powerful number, dealing with the ever-anxious western desire to  suckle on eastern wisdom and the eager try to buy redemption. `Thank You'  is about seeing all the things in your life that you believed damaged you,  and coming to terms with it, and even being able to be grateful of the  glass's full half. I was just trying to list my favorites, but that would  be too long... well, one of the best tracks is the beautiful ballad: That I  Would Be Good. It's simply amazing, and got me close to tears on more than  one occasion. That ability Alanis has, of revealing herself completely,  managed to strike a nerve always. I think of all the songs in the album,  the one that truly shows her musical range, when it comes to her vocality,  is the almost unspoken-of, Your Congratulations. Alanis makes the high  notes along with the piano in a remarkable way, proving she's more than a  rock/grunge girl, but a true and mature musician, as this entire album  proves.
6305546789|5.0|This is by far the best horror/slasher flick ever made. This was jamie lee curtis first movie and by far her best. Also donald pleasence is great in  it. The movie's plot is a 6 year old child who murdered his sister, now  full grown escapes from the mental institution hes been in since and now  returns to the town of his first murder to continue his killing spree. This  movie is also cool because instead of like normal blood and guts horror  movies this one substitutes gore for suspense. A definite must see for any  horror fan!
1572701056|1.0|I bought the tape with delight, but found that I can not listen to it.  Whatever producers do to reduce the hissing of the 's' sounds, these  producers did *not* do. <br />Just the first few minutes of the first side  were extremely distracting and irritating. I couldn't imagine the actress -  whose voice is really lovely! - talking about the 'ssea' and Lyme  Regissssss by the second half of the book.<br />I am sorry to have to say it,  but there it is.
0783225784|5.0|This has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen. Mainly because i am a huge john belushi fan. This movie is set around the zoo delta frat house.  The movie follows many of the members and new pledges of delta as they  throw toga parties, take road trips, and try to keep away from dean wormer  who is determined to kick them out of faber. This is the ultimate college  movie. I definatly recommend that everyone see this film!
B00003CWN2|1.0|Hillary Swank definetly puts in a stunning performance as a sexually confused girl trying to masquerade as a boy.  The raw emotion that drips  from her character you could almost grab in your hand.  However, if you  want entertainment, this movie is not for you. The graphic (and I mean  graphic) violence only serves to illustrate the hatefulness and intolerance  of society for people having a sexual identity crisis. The rest is just  backdrop.
0780619609|5.0|I have been a fan of Ninja Turtles ever since the craze began in the late  80's.  I remember when the first film came out, I thought that one was good  and I still do.  However, I have always liked The Secret of the Ooze a  little bit more.  It is a very funny, well acted movie (gotta love David  Warner), with one of the coolest villains ever.  To quote Vanilla Ice,  &quot;Go ninja! go ninja! Go!&quot;
6304493681|5.0|This movie is one of the best anime movies out there.  Great animation, great story, great music and sound.  Warning: the story takes though to  understand. definately worth the money in my opinion. Its like a blade  runner with more action, nothing like the matrix in movie style, except for  the cyberpunk atmosphere.
6305858764|3.0|The movie centers around Tom Ripley, who is squeaking a living and then is  hired by shipping Magnate Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and bring back his  decadent son Dickie (who is played well by Jude Law).  <br />With $1000 in his  pocket and con-artist mentality, Tom goes to 1950's Italy and finds Dickie  and his girlfriend Marge (played fetchingly by Paltrow).  He worms his way  into their life by emulating their blue-blood mannerisms and history, but  he is easily found out, and when Dickie finds out this fraud, becomes bored  with his needy tendancies and wants nothing more to do with him, Ripley  kills him in a rage, based mostly on his insecurities and Dickie's  rejection of him sexually.  <br />Now the game begins where Ripley begins to  assume Greenleaf's identity, using his name to gain influence with and use  other blue bloods like Meredith (played with real human dignity by Cate  Blanchett, who Ripley uses then dumps).  However, the police are closing in  and the others in Dickie's circle of friends (like Freddie and Marge  herself) are beginning to suspect that Ripley has done something sinister  and is leading them around as well.<br />The acting is all first rate here,  from Jude Law playing Dickie who is shallow, yet likeable and has magnetic  charisma, to Matt Damon who starts off as this fresh, All American kid but  his dark side slowly takes over his personality and demeanor.  The  secondary characters played by Paltrow, Blanchett and Philip Seymour  Hoffman do an excellent job playing the people in the upper echelons of  society.  <br />However, this movie is also boring and ponderous.  It seems to  take forever to get things started.  This movie could have been 10 minutes  shorter and would have tightened up everything.  <br />Overall this movie is a  good movie rental but for my personal tastes, it is not worth buying.   However, if you are a Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow or Jude Law fan, this  movie may just be for you.  This is movie that is slow, but has solid  acting and beautiful scenery....Rating: C+
B000002KHH|5.0|The first Black Sabbath album is a classic that first dared to send people  into a fright at the sound of crashing thunder, church bells, and Ozzy  Osbourne's banshee wail. It was probably the first definitive heavy metal  album, at least until this second album came out. Practically every song on  this now classic masterpiece screams with heavy metal superiority. From  Tony Iommi's demonic riffs, to Geezer Butler's pounding bass, to Bill  Ward's thundering drums that sound like a giant demigod stomping his way  through your speakers, to Ozzy's vocals. There isn't a song on this album  that hasn't been covered by practically every heavy metal band to come out  since this album was released. The classic &quot;Paranoid,&quot; to the  brutal &quot;Ironman,&quot; to the epic &quot;Warpigs,&quot; to the almost  humorous &quot;Fairies Wear Boots,&quot; to the bluesy &quot;Planet  Caravan,&quot; (and excellent example of Sabbath's blues roots), this album  pounds its way into the listeners ears. These songs are timeless and  unforgettable! Truly a masterpiece, and an album for the ages!
6305892946|2.0|Wes Craven did the same with the Nightmare on Elm Street Series.<br />The  first one is always great, with a sinister plot, or a creepy bad guy or an  interesting plot, but then Craven starts seeing greenbacks and the now  series loses it's edge and becomes a cash franchise, rather than a good  pieces of celluloid.  It's the same with Scream.  The first one was  excellent in it's way of satirizing other scary movies (including Nightmare  on Elm street) by devising a set of &quot;rules&quot; that one must follow  to survive a horror movie.<br />However the second fell into the generic  slasher movie flick and this one was even worse.  <br />Sydney Prescott is now  in hiding, working as a phone counselor for distressed people.  She's  leading a sheltered, protective life (An alarm detector on a 4 foot high  fence?  Give me a BREAK!) and is in a location no one knows about.   <br />Meanwhile, Stab 3 is in production and the first character to die  (Cotton Weary from Scream 2) is killed in real life by another copy cat.   Holy deja vu Batman!  He begins killing other characters in the order of  their deaths in the movie and ultimately, after the second death, the  production is shut down.<br />The killer wants Sydney to come out of hiding  and face him/her for past misdeeds which includes Sydney's promiscious  mother.<br />The movie is composed of people and their acting doubles  sarcastically making fun of each other and this ranting gets old very  quickly.  The problem is, there is no other dialog to replace this.   Obviously Kevin Williamson has run out of creative things to do or say.   The killer becomes the typical omnipotent character who is everywhere and  knows everything.  He begins killing the cast members for no reason (other  than having another Craven gimmick) with them having no chance.  So this is  just another typical movie right?  Yeah, but Craven/Williamson should know  better by now.  It is pretty sad for them to end (yeah right) this trilogy  this way, with the main character who becomes not a person, but a  runner/screamer/scared face person, the others becoming meat for the  grinder and secondary comic relief having no chemistry with the secondary  female (and their married in real life!).<br />All in all, don't waste your  money on this junk...Rating: D+
B00003XACV|5.0|This score initially brings back the experience of watching the movie,  which is a good thing, but on subsequent listenings, I found it became a  piece in its own right.  Great for late night listening, or background  music for stimulating conversation.
6305905401|2.0|The story is very interesting and was good enough to lay a strong  foundation for a solid movie, but it begins to crumble by the half way  point of the movie.<br />The movie stars Johnny Depp, who plays Dean Corso, a  combination of Private Investigate/Appraiser for the Literary world.  He  finds people rare books, appraises collections and is a collector (for  profitable resale only) as well.  However, he has the reputation for being  the &quot;used car salesman&quot; among literary circles.<br />However, his  slimy ways impress Boris Balkan (played with chilling delight by Frank  Langella), a billionaire publisher who has just purchased a book called  &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; from a Gentleman named Tefler.  Problem is the  book belonged to his wife and she wants it back, but I'll explain a little  later.<br />Balkan knows that there are 3 copies of the &quot;The Ninth  Gate&quot; still available and Corso is to track the other two and get them  (at any cost).  Why is this book so valuable?  Because, supposidly it was  co-authored by the Devil himself and shows the way to bring him back to the  &quot;real world&quot; through this gate.  <br />So the adventures take him to  Spain, Portugal and France where he meets the other two owners and is  tracked by this mysterious woman, who acts as his guardian angel.  However,  Ms. Tefler with her henchman is also trying to snatch the book at every  opportunity.<br />This was a very good premise in the hands of a very good  director (Roman Polanski of Chinatown fame), so what happened?<br />1. The  story becomes boring and generic at the half way point.  Nothing  spectacular or sinister ever really happens.<br />2. The contents of the book  are never explored.  Of all those pages of text, the pictures are the only  things of any value?<br />3. Johnny Depp was fairly wooden as the lead, and  Emmaunelle Seigner (who plays the Guardian) is too stoic for her role  description.<br />4. The ending is a sham.  It betrays the whole first half  and makes little sense.<br />5. Frank Langella, who is by far the most  sinsister character in the movie disappears and only is heard once every 20  minutes or so on the telephone.<br />This and the other Devil apolcaypse  movies have failed in it's story telling and delivery as well (End of Days  and Stigmata).  At least this one didn't have Gabriel Byrnes in  it...Rating: C-
0316777722|5.0|I can't imagine anyone being less than fully entertained by this book.  It  has its sophomoric moments, but one thing that has developed in Sedaris'  writing since his early days is generosity.  He is generous and forgiving  while still being ascerbic and witty.  I found the sensibility in books  like &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; a little bitter.  With  the earlier books, I got tired of reading about dysfunctional monsters and  horrible people page after page.  With &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot;  Sedaris has become human.  He's still biting as ever, but he somehow  manages to forgive at the same time.
6300208591|5.0|Fellini's masterpiece brilliantly showcases Roman decadence. Top rate performances from Marcelo Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee. Humorous, haunting  and almost surreal only Fellini or Bunuel could create for the screen.  Can't wait to own the DVD version. Catch that unforgettable song  &quot;Arrivederci, Roma&quot; in the club scene.
B000002U82|5.0|Me sitting in my hostel room, looking out on green fields, with  &quot;Brain Damage&quot; in the background; Singing along with  &quot;Money&quot; while driving on I-65; A musical fragment from &quot;Us  and them&quot; popping up in my mind, and making my day...<br />DSOTM is a  scripture. It needs to be read and reread by the faithful. The time spent  on this would be rewarded manifold.<br />Comparing this to other albums is  pointless. It floats above, alone in its grandeur. <br />The Pink Floyd group  members are individuals with their strengths and failings... However, in  the fortunate year 1972, under an auspicious sign, something magical was  created...
6301025083|5.0|Fantastic Federico Fellini feature film. I can't wait to have this on DVD. The viewer just glides through beautiful images only Fellini could create.  The Wagnerian music compliments Nino Rotta's magical score. Watch La Dolce  Vita first if you've never watched a Fellini film before because this film  is stricly and essentially Fellini!
B00004TDW7|5.0|For those of you who are new to Elliott Smith's hauntingly beautiful  collection of albums, it's not to late! This album is probably Elliott's  most listener friendly and accessible record. This album will hook you with  gorgeous melodies and bitter-sweet lyrics. Elliott is certainly a musical  gem. This critically acclaimed album undoubtably recieves high marks from  me!
0385484518|5.0|If you don't feel moved or touched in some way when you read this book,  then you simply don't exist: you're not there.  <br /> Author Mitch Albom came  back from years without knowing anything about or even remembering his  mentor from college, Morrie Schwartz, when he found out about him through a  TV program that featured him as he was going through a terminal illness  that was bound to terminate his life.  <br /> It was this way how Albom, set  to meet with him once again, and ended up sitting by his side with a  recorder turned on every single tuesday, discussing about life and how to  live it (or die after it). <br /> This reading, beside tears, promises to give  you A LOT to think about, with regards to the way you lead your life, the  way you think, the way you feel about things and people... It is one of  those books, that can change your life... if you allow it.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|I am a huge fan of World War II movies and damn near have everything ever made, from the Sands of Iwo Jima to Saving Private Ryan, and while I  enjoyed U571, it seemed to hollywood to be considered a great movie. While  the interactions and chain of command descions by the crew was top notch,  it lacked the intensity and in-depth characterization that the great WWII  movies possess. We could all feel for Patton as he stormed through Italy,  we all wanted Prv. Ryan to come home safely, and in this movie, I was shown  more explosions and action than actual in-depth character appeal, which is  the real strength of a WWII movie, to humanize war.<br />If you are looking  for a seriously good World War II movie based on submarines, look no  further than DAS BOOT, directed by Wolfgang Petersen. The level of  intensity is insane as I was stuck to the edge of my seat for the majority  of the movie and its best factor is that it humanizes an entire crew. We  feel that we are there with them, through their pain and triumph.<br />Nice  try Hollywood but i'm not buying this one as great!
0812931017|5.0|Great book.  Loosing My Virginity is a colorful, vivid, and entertaining look into the adventurous, daredevil life of Richard Branson.  The book  starts out like a rollercoaster ride with an exotic feel to it as Mr.  Branson tells of departing Marrakech in a hot air balloon and nearly  crashing hours later on one of his around the world journeys.  The rest of  the book reads much the same way, with tales of the wild antics and bold,  risky ventures that helped make Richard Branson one of the most successful  entrepreneurs ever with a worldwide travel-entertainment-retail  conglomerate worth $2 billion today.  His life story focuses mostly on how  he became successful and built thriving business after business, but there  are plenty of amusing tales about his personal life, as well.  His entire  being is based on recreation and entertaining, and this book is no  exception.  The hardcover edition also has 120 photos, various  illustrations, the agreed statement read in open court at the end of the  British Airways libel case, the article &quot;A King Size Disaster&quot; by  Bernard Levin, an appendix of cartoons related to British Airways, a speech  made by Richard Branson to The Institute of Directors, and a chronological  history of the Virgin group of companies.

0671034065|4.0|My favorite of Linda Howard's books is DREAM MAN, and Mr. Perfect is not as good, but I loved the characters in the book.  First of all, in the  first 170 pages, I felt I was listening to an episode of SEX AND THE CITY.   I loved the repartee between the 4 female characters, especially the use of  &quot;gild&quot; and &quot;geld&quot;.  I would recommend this book to  anyone who loves romantic mysteries and some good laughs.
B00000DFTH|4.0|Let's start by saying that this is a far better set in terms of  performance, recording, and mixing quality than the Black Sabbath: Live At  Last disc that had been released some years ago. Geezer's bass is upfront  like it should be (it is he that inspired me to pick up the bass at age  12), Iommi scuttles up and down the fretboard with his usual incisive  elegance, and Bill Ward's drums thunder like the drums of Moria. Ozzy  cannot sing at all anymore, and indulges in purposeless profanity, but that  is the way he has always done things. I have personally seen Black Sabbath  ten times, and this disc is representative of the power of those shows. The  inclusion of two recent and somewhat less-good tunes is only an excuse to  buy the thing. If you're not a Sabbath fan, this may not be for you. If you  ARE, then it is a must-have, at least for the excellent renditions of  &quot;Into The Void&quot; and &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;. The bulk  of the disc is drawn from the Sabs' heyday (1970-76), bearing one tune from  the &quot;Technical Ecstacy&quot; album, and while that tune could easily  have been replaced by a better one from &quot;Sabotage&quot;, at least  there is nothing included from the embarrassing release &quot;Never Say  Die&quot;. And even Ozzy at his worst is better than Dio or Ian Gillan, who  are far superior singers, but Ozzy's voice is part of the Sabbath sound,  and cannot be removed from the mix without deleterious results. Majestic,  powerful, and at last well-recorded. I give it two Ozzy peace signs and a  purple-fringed yellow shirt for the effort;-)
B00003CX6P|2.0|Have you ever watched a movie and got upset because you thought it was about to end, then were pleasantly surprised that it didn't end?  Well.....  you won't see that here.  Unfortunately when you think the movie is ending,  you are hoping that it does..... but it doesn't.  It's like a bad energizer  bunny and keeps going and going.  Beautiful scenery doesn't even help this  movie move along as there is minimal action and hardly any suspense to keep  you on the edge of your seat.  It takes too long to get into the  &quot;meat&quot; of the movie and too long to fininsh it.
B000003TAL|4.0|This is the first Sonic Youth cd I bought, and I'm not disappointed.  Though, it takes repeated listening to fully enjoy, this cd is awesome. It  holds true to its name sake, cause the album flows like a day dream. I  havent heard much other Sonic Youth albums, but I will be checking them out  soon. This is a trippy record with punkish riffs that flow in and out of  each other. Very Cool! Highly recommended.
B000003TAW|5.0|Trying to categorize Weezer is hard. Are they alternative or what? It's  strange because they are the kind of music that teens and Criminal Justice  professors and parents seem to all like (I know this to be true, because my  CRJ professor back in 1995 was rooting for them to take the MTV music  awards for best new artist). I have to say, this album was fantastic. What  drew me to Weezer first was the song &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; which  simply rocks, containing angst, emotion and nice rhythm and lyrics. After  seeing the Buddy Holly video, I realized these guys have sense of humor.  What I want to point out, is that they use a lot of choruses and mix up  harmonies and such in much the way that the Beach Boys did. Now this is  something you don't see a lot of, but adding that to the music and guitar  riffs gives it an energized life of it's own and well, you are kind of  taken for a ride on a lot of these songs. This is something that was  missing in Pinkerton (the band's next album, but I hear they will go back a  little to this stuff). Still, sometimes you might find yourself singing to  it or wanting to join in. Again, there is that anthem sense. You don't find  it much. Rivers Cuomo has a great voice and the other guys do an  exceptional job backing him up. I really can't find a weak spot in the  album. I guess that be an attribute to Ric Ocasek. Just get the album!  You'll love it.
B000003TBP|5.0|this is easily the best beck album to date and according to me one of the best in the 90's.in every song he does something totally different.all  songs are good especially &quot;hotwax&quot;,&quot;devils  haircut&quot;,&quot;lord only knows&quot;and &quot;the new  pollution&quot;.he's also an artists that doesn't sell out like other  musicians.

0671034065|5.0|Linda Howard has  always been a very special writer to me - managing to  balance both romance and mystery.  The only other writers I know who do as  well are Nora Roberts and Mary Balogh - different, but excellent.<br />This  has got to be one of Linda Howard's best books - with her customary fast,  funny wit - and chills combined.<br />And hot!   Wow is this hot! Sam should  live next door to me - PLEASE!  This guy is...well just about perfect.  Not  only does he apparently fulfill most of their criteria - he does a good job  with mine!  Didn't even get a glimpse or hint of the killer (although I did  guess the page before his identity is revealed). No red herrings - no  leading you on a chase in the totally wrong direction, and no blatant  violence or psychobabble thank you. Linda Howard ranks right up there with  fictions best authors.  Long may you write!
1567406831|4.0|When you pair David Paymer and Nathan Lane as Felix and Oscar in the Odd  Couple, you are in for a comic tour de force that over stretches its  material.  With a supporting cast which includes Dan Castellaneta and  Yeardley Smith (both from The Simpsons) and Linda Purl, the cast is almost  perfect. This production is a little too visual in a few of its jokes.  However, on the whole, it unscrupulously grabs the audio listener by his  ears and shakes him with laughter.
B000002LQR|5.0|I've never listened to this CD before, but the guy who sings says cuss  words.
0792845668|4.0|Bill &amp; Ted II, BOGUS JOURNEY has the wacky duo meeting themselves in a  dangerous heavy-metal form. Good and Evil. Hell and Music. Special Effects  make the rating for 4-stars. IMHO, it is not as good as the first.
0671042858|4.0|Let me start by stating that I am not a died-in-the wool Stephen King fan,  and definitely not a horror fan.  However, the reviews on this book  correctly led me to conclude that it is not a usual King book, and I  definitely liked it.<br />Nine-year-old Trisha strays off the Appalachian  Trail as she lags behind her arguing mother and brother, and then becomes  hopelessly lost when she tries to take a &quot;shortcut&quot; back to the  trail.  The suspense and tension in this book are those inherent in a story  about a young, but determined child, armed with a very small amount of  survivor knowledge.  For emotional support, she increasingly imagines that  her favorite pitcher, Red Sox's Tom Gordon, accompanies her on her trek and  provides her with guidance and support.<br />This is a wrenching story, as you  keep hoping that this poor child will be found, will escape the woods  unharmed, and so forth.  I found myself saying &quot;NO!&quot; out loud  when she made bad decisions, and encouraging her as she plunged  ahead.<br />This is a suspenseful and inspiring story.
B00004TJKB|5.0|Have you ever had one of the days that you wished break the pattern?  What  if you had to relive it over and over without worrying about tomorrow. This  film, GROUNDHOG DAY stepped out as an original masterpiece. Every now and  again, I see some tv series (Xena's episode was great) immitating this  film's genre. Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, an annoying arrogant reporter  who doesn't want to be the WeatherMan onsite at a Groundhog Day Festival.  Andie MacDowell (Rita) and  Chris Elliott ( Larry the cameraman) do the  shoot and look to leave. Only Murray never leaves. He awakes the next day  in the same day, being the only one who knows that time is repeating and  repeating. Wonderful film!
0767857240|5.0|These movies are really good!  It's a very odd combo though!  Hook, an adventure/comedy with Robin Williams and Drama with Susan Sarandon!  Why  these particular two!
0671042858|1.0|I was really disappointed!!! I'm a 13 year old girl who has read many  Stephen King books and I think he is an excellent writer. This book didn't  even compare on my scale to other books such as Salems Lot. It was genuinly  not scary at all to me. I was so bored with the book by page 100 but I  thought it might get etter so I stuck with it. I was wrong.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I picked this C.D around July 99 and it is one of my favorites. Sorry, no  other bands compare to them, they have a distinct sound and look. Best  songs are Wait and Bleed, Sic, Purity, Liberate, No Life, and Spit it out.  IT;s a must get!!!!!!
B00004XPPE|5.0|A fault in a multi-million dollar nuclear bomber spirals the crew and the world into this tense and exiting cold war thriller. You may have heard the storyline before (Dr. Strangelove) but this film is deeper, darker and deadly serious!<br />Henry Fonda provides a superb performance in this powerful drama which keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very last image on the screen. The tension unfolds minute by minute following the ill-fated crew from the beginning of their routine flight to their terror-filled battle through Soviet airspace towards their target - Moscow! Will they succeed, will they be recalled, will they be shot down? Superb acting and skillful writing combine to produce one of the best (anti) cold war films of our time. <br />Special effects are minimal (compared to todays epics) and the sets are confined mostly to the NORAD Air Force control bunker and the bomber cockpit but never has a film been so effective in its powerful portrayal of tension, suspense, and fear as the President of the United States, the US Air Force and the Russians struggle to try to stop the rogue bomber from starting a nuclear holocaust. <br />Striking black and white photography enhances the film rather than detracts from the experience.<br />Don't miss it!
0425163407|4.0|Don't let the image of a saw blade fool you. This book is not primarily  about dismemberment, altough it does play into what's really going on. Our  Hero, Dr. Kay Scarpetta is called to a landfill where a torseau has been  found. There is concern that this body could be related to Crimes that took  place in Dublin as well as some in the US. However, Dr. Kay is not  convinced due to too many differences forensically speaking. Once again the  book covers in great detail such things as autopsies, and crime scene  study. We also encounter all of our favorites from the Body Farm. (Lucy,  Wesley, and Marino). It becomes more evident through the story that the  welts/pustules found on the torseau may have a lot more to do with the  deceased's death than first meets the eye. The killer in this book also  makes personal contact with Dr. Kay via email, even sending pictures, which  leads to a helpful virtual reality experiment with Lucy. There is the scare  of an epidemic and the disease possibly hitting close to home. Dr. Kay also  get's to resolve some unfinished business in London and with Benton. This  was my second Patricia Cornwell book and I was not disappointed!

0671015206|4.0|Stanley and Danko, after interviewing dozens of people who have accumulated millions of dollars of wealth (some never having had an annual  salary over $75,0000), show readers the steps to true financial  independence and wealth-building.  These are primarily living &quot;below  one's means,&quot; developing thrifty savings habits, and instilling  similar habits in one's children.<br />Sadly, most people mistake high income  for wealth -- the authors illustrate how frequently those making high  incomes amass remarkably little wealth in savings and investments, while  many making far less can be worth many times their annual salary (and  therefore are less susceptible to financial hardship)!  The difference is  the way the two groups spend and save their money.<br />Though short on actual  steps to correcting poor financial habits, the book does a great job of  illustrating the general path to wealth accumulation.  Truly, this book  should be recommended reading for everyone.
0872860175|5.0|When I first read this book in high school, I found it both disturbing and  profane. Now I still do, but it's in a much better way....<br />Ginsberg came  of age in a time of both terror and hypocrasy. During the Presidency of  Eisenhower, we were edging toward hot war with the Soviets and on our own  people. Kids were just finding psychoactives for the first time-- they were  just learning to bend their minds and change their souls. Americans were  just hearing of Louis-Ferdinand Celine and Andre Gide and Oswald Spengler  and all of the other literary people who can be heard in the words of  Ginsberg....<br />And he processed them (though some of them now would seem  more high culture than him) and came up with the knowing, tortured voice of  a generation. A voice that is not so different from the voice of my  generation-- one of trouble, angst, unhesistancy, and spiritual malaise.  Whereas he saw his generation starving, hysterical, naked in a mental  institution, we do not even have the clothes to care so much....<br />However  old you are, read this book. It will make you think. Read Gregory Corso  too.... he was wonderful but has been forgotten....
B00004T37H|5.0|As someone who has seen a plenty of videos, I can safely say that this is one of the greatest of all time. It completely blows any diseny production  ever created out of the water as well as most other videos I have seen. The  plot is enthralling in that it is not clear cut good and evil: it is human  (even though it's an animation). The artwork is very well done and the  dubbing altogether excellent. Subtitles, in my personal opinion, would have  only detracted from the nearly flawless beauty of this film. It is truely a  great epic in an era of short attention spans and quick fixes. A story  among muddles of pointless words.
B000002U8G|2.0|Short and not-sweat.... A good song followed by &quot;The Beatles&quot;,  contiuning with possibly the WORST song I have ever heard or has been  recorded and ending with a good song.  From all the prior reviews that  praised this album, I bought it and was totally disappointed.

B000044U4B|5.0|First, I must say that &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is one of the best  heavy metal albums ever released.  The songs are incredible, the song  writing is untouchable, and the lead guitar work is masterful. <br />The  standard issue Elektra Records version of Ride the Lightning WAS remastered  by Elektra technicians back in 1995.  However, after being remastered, the  album seemed a lot less heavy and there seemed to be a  &quot;jagginess&quot; so to speak in the overall sound.  But this isn't  really noticable until you hear the near-perfect remaster by DCC.<br />The  difference between this and the standard issue CD is the overall sound of  the music.  The music now sounds like it was recorded especially for CD  (which cannot be said for the Elektra version).  The sound seems more  polished and eliminates most of the &quot;jagginess&quot; in the sound, and  the dynamics are accentuated perfectly.  For example, the intro solo in  Fade To Black now really blends together and sounds like it should - Kirk's  guitar work dynamically interlacing with the acoustic guitar (in the  standard CD, the intro solo seemed detached somewhat).   These things may  not mean much to most people, but to me it makes listening to the album  more enjoyable.  Highly recommended if you have the money.
B000002AE3|4.0|Simon Phillips appears on &quot;Tambu&quot;, replacing the long-time drummer Jeff Porcaro (deceased, natural causes), and seems to fit the Toto  mold just fine; he also manages to stretch the skins on those drums a bit  differently, to make his mark with Toto on this CD.<br />I was very pleased  with this CD, enjoying the skillful and slick packaging (made to look like  a cheap dime thriller/novel, a la Indiana Jones) as well as the music  inside. Toto's sharp licks on keys and guitar are the best in the industry  - take a look at any of the other pop stars out there, and you'll see  members of Toto listed among the musicians in their liner notes.<br />Favorite  songs include:<br />I Will Remember / Slipped Away / If You Belong to Me /  Time is the Enemy / Drag Him to the Roof / Dave's Gone Skiing / The Turning  Point<br />Good stuff from great guys.<br />Peace Out.

Es sin lugar a dudas una obra que quedar en la memoria  de todo aquel que tenga la suerte de leerla; ya que con sus macabros  personajes, logra mostrar una tenebrosa &quot;realidad&quot;, que a la vez  es capaz de hacernos reir, y disfrutar.
B0000026CM|4.0|Joseph Williams is at his best on this CD, the featured lead singer on  this album, sharing leads with Steve Lukather and David Paich.<br />It seems  to be so long between recordings that I often wondered if Toto was still  alive &amp; kicking. Then I found the single, Pamela!! I immediately bought  the CD when it became available, and was thrilled to have purchased one of  Toto's sharpest (and slickest) albums.<br />Favorite songs include:<br />Pamela /  You Got Me / Anna / Stop Loving You / Stay Away (featuring Linda Ronstadt)  / Straight for the Heart / These Chains<br />GOOD GOOD GOOD!!!<br />Peace Out.
B00000J2L7|5.0|An irony here is that if Peter Sellers died from the massive heart attack that he recieved in April 1964, this would have been his penultimate film.  'Being There' (1979) turned out to be his penultimate film and in both  instances here, Sellers was nominated for an Oscar which he failed to get.  That aside, Sellers is at his best here and the use of black and dry comedy  gives us an occasional glimpse as to what Sellers would have been like as a  serious actor in the Guinness mould. The scene where Group Captain Mandrake  finds that his American counterpart is a madman for example. The film  itself is excellent, picking away at the difference between evil paranoia  and justified concern, concerning communism. The style of direction is pure  Kubrick, the camera shots and acting style for example, particually in the  War Room scenes. And if none of this attracts you, it is worth watching  just to see Major Kong go through his check list on the plane he his flying  to bomb Moscow. It had me in stiches.
B0000026VZ|4.0|Toto's history as premier studio musicians lives on in this representation  of their hits, as well as some not-so-well-known songs. Although never  having had the opportunity to see Toto live, when they were still touring  (I missed a golden opportunity when they came to Arizona and played at ASU  my sophomore year), I don't know how they compared on stage to their  stellar studio work.<br />Of all the vocalists that have sung for Toto, after  Bobby Kimball left the group, I think I prefer Joseph Williams the best;  not counting vocalists in Toto, that is. Steve Lukather's voice is  exceptionally suited for Toto's style of music, as is David Paich's. I  don't particularly care for Jean-Michel Byron's voice. This is the only  album on which he is featured (Thank God!). I've also seen the VHS-format  video of Past to Present, which I think also demonstrates Toto's lack of  out-front personae - their videos aren't all that special, when you look at  the top videos of the decades in which their music was on the  charts.<br />Past to Present I think includes most of their gems, popular on  the charts songs as well as tunes that never quite made it into the top 40.  A good CD to have if you don't ever buy any of their other CDs.<br />Peace Out
B000002UB3|4.0|In spite of the fact that the Beatles were on the verge of breaking up,  musical, business differences, they end up producing one of their best  albums. There are a few bleepers in there ('Maxwell's Silver Hammer', 'I  Want You'), but there are also plenty of classics like 'Something', 'You  Never Give me Your Money', 'Here Comes the Sun', 'The End', and 'She Came  in through the Bathroom Window'. The sound production is excellent and  George Martin and Paul McCartney produced a cohesive album out of what  could have been a mess. George Harrison's guitar playing is also at it's  finest and it is a frustrating foresight of what the Beatles could have  sounded like in the 1970s. But then that is a whole different story and  debate

0783235607|1.0|The only admittance I can muster for this video is that it was probably influential in its day. However, all the praise heaped on Psycho is  basically garnered from that and has very little to go on, in reality.  Nowadays, this movie looks incredibly homemade and, at times boring,  especially during the parts where it is obvious Hitchcock is trying to  build &quot;tension.&quot; Plus, it's in black-and-white, which makes a  movie look old right away. When Hitchcock tries to bring in the  &quot;psychological&quot; element to the movie, it looks even worse,  because it is dreadfully apparent that he has no idea what he's talking  about. Thankfully, someone decided to remake this movie, but that wasn't  very astonishing either, since everyone already knows from this movie what  the story will be. Save your money and go to the theater to see any horror  movie you want--it's guaranteed to be more believable than this one.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I happen to LOVE sci-fi and was very excited when I heard about this movie coming out. I loved the trailers and told all my friends about it. But when  I saw it it was a BIG let down for me. The main reason is because  repeatedly throughout the movie things happen that are not only improbable  but impossible. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but every good  writer/director should know that fiction must have some kind of  feasibility. This had none. I could make a long list of things that made no  sense. But my two biggest complaints are these: ONE; why didn't the aliens  just move their hovering 14 mile space ship a little bit higher up in the  atmosphere? At a certain altitude planes cannot fly for lack of air. Since  the aliens obviously did not need air to fly, they could just move a little  higher and the humans would be helpless, END OF STORY. I guess these were  horribly dumb aliens...amazing they managed to develop the technology for  interstellar travel! Number TWO: YOU CANNOT give an alien computer a  computer virus! Anyone who knows anything about computers should know that  a virus is like a computer program, if the machine does not speak the same  language the virus won't work. It would be like trying to destroy your CD  player by putting in a virus infected CD-ROM, it just wouldn't work.  Furthermore, computer viruses of a few years ago cannot damage my computer  because of my anti-virus software. I am sure aliens who are many thousands  of years more advanced would have anti-virus programs!

6305657939|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It has an excellent plot and is extremely well done.  Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo work tremendously well  together and you can feel the chemistry as they banter back and forth with  each other on screen.  Several of my friends have watched this movie, per  my recommendation, and they loved it.  Would definitely recommend seeing  it!  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
6304681496|1.0|Amazon, of course, is trying to sell you this movie so its review claims the movie is &quot;ironic&quot; in an attempt to justify the ankle-deep  plot and paper-thin characters.  Mmmm.... yeah.  I normally think Maltin is  too family values, but I agree with him on this one.  Maybe this movie  appeals to younger viewers who are more interested in seeing things  &quot;blown up real gud&quot;, but a relentless string of explosions and  crashes do not, in and of themselves, make a film exciting.  I just wanted  it to be over.  If you're looking for a film of this genre, The Rock isn't  a real brain twister either, but it's quite a bit more satisfying than Con  Air.  Better yet, try The Professional which has gunplay, explosions AND a  good story and good characters.  Imagine that.
B00000IQW5|5.0|First time I saw this movie I was pulled to it in a very mystical way. Some may call it soft compared to the strength of some of Spielberg's work.  However, I prefer to view it as another example of the well rounded  capabilities of the creative genius. No, it's not the epic tragedy of  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; or &quot;Amistad&quot;, rather it's as the  Beatles put it ... &quot;a silly little love song ...?&quot; All part of  the human tragedies  both epic and personal.<br />Life and death have many  facets and in this movie Spielberg  demonstrates again the breadth of his  story telling ability. Obviously, I'm quite a fan of Spielberg's -- the  irony of it all was I loved the movie from the first time I saw it, a long  time ago. I didn't find out it was Spielberg's until some time later when I  thought-- &quot;should have figured.&quot; It always was and always will be  one of my favorites.<br />Having experienced events similar to this movie  almost two years ago, the movie now has a more personal meaning. Within  days after my loss, the movie was aired on cable. It movie moved me again  in a deeper way. On August 17, 2000 I ran across the movie (quite by  accident.) I was looking for &quot;I Claudius&quot; at a reasonable price.  Now available on DVD, I ordered the  series. Then I remembered my other  favorites --&quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;ET&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, and  &quot;Always&quot; and decided to replace my aging VHS copies, where  possible, with DVD. In a rush I opted for overnight delivery. Later,  realizing how stupid I was, <br />I knew that an order placed late in the day  was not likely to arrive &quot;next day&quot;. That meant the order was not  likely to leave Amazon until Friday. BOY was I really stupid, paying those  overnight charges for an order not likely to arrive  until Monday August  21. Checking the status of my order, my suspicions were confirmed. Oh well  live and learn. Well it's now Monday and the order hasn't arrived. Checkingthe order status I thought -- &quot;I'm not paying those high shipping  charges now!&quot; Following up on the shipping costs I became aware Amazon  had reduced the charges which made me feel better. I scrolled back up to  see when I was to expect the order. There it was --  the arrival date had  been delayed again to tomorrow August 22, 2000 -- two years to the day when  Michael died in the car accident.<br />So, all you jaded critics take care.  This &quot;silly little love movie&quot; has meaning to those singular  hearts that hurt. Steven Spielberg is not too big to tell the small tales  for us too. Tales that in some mystical way touch the heart.
B00003CWPR|1.0|The was the worst excuse for a movie I have seen in quite a while.  It was hard to keep up with and had no point whatsoever.  I actually fell asleep  in the middle and woke up for the last 30 minutes.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is a fine, but sketchy overview of the history of  Philosophy and the evolution of Western Thought.  Although I found it to be  a rather engaging read, I do have a few gripes:<br />1. Gaarder continued to  perpetuate the &quot;all roads lead to Greece&quot; myth, forgetting the  fact that all platonic and neo-platonic philosophy actually originated in  Ancient Egypt thousands of years earlier.<br />2. Gaarder glossed over  Nietzsche, the second greatest philosopher of the 19th century, while he  devoted an entire chapter to Kierkegaard (certainly a great philosopher,  but by no means Nietzsche's superior)<br />3.  Gaarder pointed out Ecosophy,  Neo-Thomism, and &quot;New Age&quot; pseudo-philosophy, but he completely  ignored Deconstructionism (Foucault vs. Derrida), Neolinguistics (Chomsky,  Korzybski), and, most importantly of all, Integral Philosophy and  Transpersonal Theory (dominated by the two greatest living philosophers,  Jurgen Habermas and Ken Wilber).  This is a grevious oversight, since these  are the philosophies that will be remembered when the Treehuggers,  Aquarians, and Aquinians are dust in the trashbasket of  civilization.<br />Aside from those gripes, however, a worthy read.  And  contrary to what the other reviewers said, I found it a rather quick and  easy read as well.  (Of course, I'm used to the cacaphony of wierdness that  assaults the reader at the end of the book, as I'm a great fan of the work  of R.A. Wilson and Pete Carroll.)
B00003Q43A|5.0|I'll be reviewing both the movie and DVD here:<br />MOVIE: &quot;Independence  Day&quot; can only be summarized in one word: WOW. This movie is a must see  movie for any red-blooded american. You'll find everything in this movie:  action, comedy, horror, suspense, drama, romance.....all complete with a  star-studded cast. I mean, Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey  Fierstein....what's not to love? If you haven't seen this movie, what are  you doing on the computer?! Rent it! See it! Buy it! Whatever!<br />DVD: First  of all, let me tell you one thing. If you hear about a movie made by 20th  Century Fox, and you like it, I have 4 words for you: GET IT ON DVD. Trust  me, Fox KNOWS how to do this DVD thing. They don't bother with unskippable  previews, they wouldn't even think about combining a great movie with a  shrimpy DVD that might have only a trailer and not even that, they KNOW how  to make DVDs. (Buena Vista, you should be taking notes.) And the DVD for  this movie is another DVD by Fox that's nothing short of exquisite. In case  you don't know, this DVD comes with TWO discs. And as soon as you pop in  the first disc, you know you made a great buy when the menu starts, which  is one of the best menus you'll ever see. You have a choice between the  original theatrical version and the special edition release with 9 minutes  of cut footage. And once you make your pick, you see the awesome,  THX-mastered picture quality and awesome sound. And once the movie is done,  put in the second disc and marvel at the after-movie extras. You can see  one of 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes, see the alternate ending for the  movie, and see how ID4 fever overtook the nation in 1996 with its HUGE  array of theatrical teasers, theatrical trailers, and TV spots. You can  also see full-screen storyboards, concept drawings and behind-the-scenes  photos, and there's also extra stuff for your DVD-ROM drive.<br />So, to  summarize, wether or not you've seen this terrific film, see it on DVD and  get ready for a mind-boggling experience.
0380973464|5.0|... This book is easily Stephenson's best.  Based on previous works, many people assume it's going to be about SF-ish things, but this isn't.  It's partly historical fiction, partly a  glimpse into modern hacker culture, and partly a treatise on cryptography.  The depths to which Stephenson explores this last part is astounding.  He  does a wonderful job of describing cryptography in terms a layperson could  understand and, around it, he builds a story that's both engaging and  entertaining. His characters come alive and are not mere placeholders that  serve to move the plot along.  Stephenson has really done his homework on  this one and it shows.  Anyone who has any interest in hacking, in World  War II, in cryptography or in action-adventures would love this book.   Highly recommended.
0679746048|4.0|I saw the movie version of &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; when it came out  last winter in spite of the mostly negative reviews it received. I loved  it, mainly because it highlighted how women can support each other through  the toughest of circumstances. I then bought and read the book. The  differences between the two are startling: the setting and most of the  characters are the same, but the tone is quite different. <br /> The book is  mesmerizing from its first paragraph. Susanna Kaysen uses deceptively  simple language to describe her experiences and the people she knew during  her 18 months stay at McLean's mental hospital. We slowly come to  understand the lack of humanity showed to these girls, and the confused  world they came from. Ms Kaysen's spare, poetic prose is interspersed with  copies of actual hospital records written at the time she was a patient.  The records appear as confused as the patients they detail. They seem to  detail Susanna's social interactions and levels of ease with others, as if  this alone depicts signs of strong mental health. Some of them appear  incomplete and neglected. One is left to wonder what exactly the  professionals at this hospital were looking for: mental health or  acceptable female behavior? <br />The book is brief, and leaves the reader  with more questions than answers. How have we changed in the way we view  certain types of female behavior? How have we changed in the way we view  those suffering from mental illnesses? Do patients need to be cured or does  the world need to be cured? <br />This is a remarkable book. It manages to  raise awareness without giving in to self-pity. I would recommend it to  anyone.
0380804557|5.0|This is an excellent modern &quot;folktale&quot;.  Gaiman includes all the  techniques of folklore without ever being self-conscious or drawing our  attention to the device.  The opening, in which we are engaged with the man  we think will be the hero, turns out to be a false start, the true hero  having been born of the union described in the opening.  Helpers and  hinderers abound as he goes about his quest.  The story has the internal  logic necessary for fairy tales and is carried off superbly.  I personally  would have ended it right before the epilogue, by I do not dispute the  author's right to end it as he has.
B00004U8H4|1.0|When I first viewed this movie, I sat in horror, not by the idiotic acts of gore on the screen, but at the concept of paying money to watch such  garbage.  This is by far the most incompetently directed, poorly acted,  idiotically written movie in recent memory.  Granted there have been bad  movies, but this is the worst that's recieved so much noteriety.  <br />     The actors compromise their performances, and you can tell why, they think  that by being in such an &quot;edgy and suspenseful movie that looks  thought provoking&quot; will get them an Oscar Nomination.  They are  dreaming.  The acting of the supporting cast and Witherspoon is so  horrible, it loses all potential for comedy.  Bale's performance is  mediocre, his 'intensity' in the most inappropriate places makes the film  tense when it could be comical (The incident in the washroom is the prime  example of a comedic opportunity squandered).  <br />    The narration  (provided by the idiotic screenplay) points to us the obvious, like when he  peels away the face mask, we can get the message on our own, we don't have  to be led by the hand when dealing with such a cliche. &quot;Yeah, yeah,  the mask symbolizes the true self from the one we all see; he peels it away  to reveal his true self to the audience.&quot;  We are not stupid, at least  credit us with that much, and try to at least be a little more creative in  conveying the message to us.          Harmon slaps us in the face with  that, she is assuming we are too stupid to comprehend this; she assumes  that no sophisticated people will be in the audience, only the violence  numbed horror loving teenagers that will think the movie is  &quot;cool&quot; because the guy uses a chainsaw.  It tries to kill two  birds with one jack hammer, it tries to be thought provoking and even  &quot;artsy&quot; by throwing in gratuitous nudity during his monologue.   This was done to compensate for the lack of talent on the camera, behind  the camera and at the typewriter.  This film is pathetic.
0316777722|2.0|As someone who experienced big belly laughs with Naked and Barrel Fever, I  anxiously awaited the release of MTPOD.  <br />Outrageously insane insights  and POV.  Interesting characters.  The problem with MTPOD...the stories are  simply not that funny.  A handful of laughs, one or two chuckles.  <br />My  recommendation...reread Naked.
B00000JQFL|4.0|EWF released some excellent albums in the 70's, but their real fortay was  as a live band.  Much of the group had jazz backgrounds and in concert they  got to show off their improvisational skills.  Gratitude captures these  skills beautifully.  The live versions of &quot;Yearnin' Learnin'&quot;,  &quot;Devotion&quot; and &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; (which they wrote and was  recorded by jazz legend Ramsey Lewis) are funky and jazzy.  The standout  live track is &quot;Reasons&quot; where Phillip Bailey treats us to a vocal  tour-de-force.  The original album was 3 sides live and one side new studio  material and these songs are vintage EWF as well.  The best of the bunch  are the two hits, the bouncy &quot;Singasong&quot; and the ballad  &quot;Can't Hide Love&quot;.  On this album you get the best of both EWF's  worlds and is a bargain as its a double album on a single disk.
6304779356|4.0|In a genre not know for quality (Blade, Bram Stokers Dracula), The Lost Boys actually manages to stand out as one of the better Vampyre flicks.        In his campy vamp time capsule of Eighties chic, Schumacher uses a cast  jam-packed with Bop bigshots along with       gory comic book goofiness to  tell his story of hip nightstalkers in the fictional &quot;murder capital  of the world&quot;       Santa Carla (real-life Santa Cruz). For these  wayward cool kids of the night, it's all mesh tops and mousse, long hair  and       leather jackets (plus one dangling earring). But equally as  interesting is looking at these actors in terms of their career        tracks: Watch then-unknown Jason Patric debut his with then-cool Kiefer  Sutherland; watch Jami Gertz in her brief stint as a screen siren; watch  the two       Coreys at the 14-minute mark; and who knew Dianne Wiest was  in this thing? Unlike more complicated takes in the       vampyre canon,  Lost Boys maintains a fairly blue-collar attitude toward the mythology:  It's just holy water, blood       sucking, and stakes through the heart.  Highly recommended Vampyre entertainment.
B00003CWNR|3.0|The trailors, the Oscars, and any other advertising will not tell you that abortion is a primary issue in the movie.  That is not to condemn or praise  it being in the film, but people should be aware of that fact.  It is a  Hollywood-liberal flick.  So Homer will only fulfill his destiny once he  sets aside his pro-life, pro-adoption feelings and starts performing  abortions.  It is indeed a propaganda piece, and Irving himself would  concurr.  If you are pro-life, I would not let this deter you from watching  the film.  It has many good qualities.  I just the movie companies should  actually be upfront about it.<br />Abortion aside, it is not quite as good as  the amount of Oscar nominations would make you think.  Michael Kane gives  an ok performance, but an Oscar win is a joke.  Toby MacGuire does a fine  job and is very likeable.  It is an engaging film with many fine qualities,  I just don't see it being excellent enough to merit four stars.  3 and a  half is posibility though.
B000002C1V|3.0|Well, this is not a Pink Floyd album.  One song (Not Now John) stands out  among the rest which for the most part sound the same.  No offence to  Waters, but it seems he got a little lazy in writing this album, not  putting any attention into the music as he did in Animals and The Wall.   Although lyrically brilliant, musically poor and not worth buying.  I want  you to note this is a die hard Floyd fan.  Looking for good Floyd, try Dark  Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.
B00003CX6P|4.0|As I was watching the film, I was constantly reminded of the old Luther quote: &quot;the sinner is frightened by the rustling of the leaves.&quot;  This film is about the piling on of lies and the consequences thereof.  It  is interesting from that moralistic point of view.  I would consider it a  modern-day morality play.  No matter what Ripley gets away with (lies,  etc), he is constantly haunted by his conscience.  Superb acting, a  top-notch cast.  Jude Law's big break.  We shall be seeing a lot of him in  the future.  Gweneth Paltrow does well in a supporting role.  Her elegance  and charisma doesn't overwhelm the other players.
6302491940|5.0|This movie was first referred to me a few years ago, and since then I haven't been able to stop watching.  This is a comedy in every sense, with  tons of little subtleties added along the way that will keep you laughing  each and every time.  The theme song is all too fitting, and the car chase  is a one-of-a-kind with an ending that seems to come out of nowhere.<br />And  just in case you don't like comedies, action, car chases, romance or those  fantastic Mini Coopers, you will still love the scenery.
0800179501|5.0|This is definetly a work of art.  This kills Citizen Kane!   The story of the struggle between good (Daniel San and Mr. Miagi) vs. evil (the Kobra  Kai Dojo) is a classic epic.

0553577123|5.0|&quot;Who would care about the unbosomings of a thirteen year old girl?&quot;  Anne Frank wrote in one of the first entries of her diary.  Answer: millions.  I'm sure that if Anne knew how many people her writing  would effect, she'd be overwhelmed.  Anne's family wasn't really what they  called &quot;orthodox jews&quot;. They mostly went to their synagouge for  special occaisons. Of course, Hitler didn't consider things like that, and  Anne's sister got a summons to go to a death camp.  The family decided to  go into hiding.  And this is the point where Anne's diary truly becomes a  masterpeice.  If you look at the entries before and the entries after they  move into the Annex, you'll see the change in Anne.  Before, mostly all she  wrote about was school and parties and boyfriends, etc, etc.  After she,  her family, the van Daans, and Dussel are sequestered in the Annex, her  writing becomes more profound.  Anne did indeed have a knowledge beyond her  years.  I especially love her last entry.  It was almost as if she knew  what was going to happen and she was forgiving the people who were going to  do it to her.  Some of the things that she wrote will really put you into a  trance, making you think &quot;Is that really the way it is?&quot;  It's  not just &quot;the unbosomings of a thirteen year old girl&quot;, it's a  story of a girl caught in the middle of a complex and bloody war.  The bit  about the woman who went to the dentist and came home to find that her  whole family was gone was heartwrenching.  Imgaine!  This is one of the  most profound, thought-provoking books I've ever read.
B0000025D0|5.0|Years before Nirvana exploded, Springsteen wrote Darkness on the Edge of Town.  Years before Pearl Jam extolled Neil Young as the father of grundge,  Springsteen perfected the musical form.  This album lays out the format of  grundge in a desperate fury. <br /> It all started with a lawsuit and an  injunction that kept Springsteen from recording for three years.  While  Born To Run used a uniquely American garage-band sound to propel itself, it  also held true to the thematic played out rock opera of the period.  Born  To Run was Springsteen a bit confined to the time of the record.  Three  years later the walls of mainstream rock had collapsed with punk coming to  the forefront.  Springsteen takes advantage as the songs get shorter,  darker, and more driving. <br /> The injunction got to Bruce.  Three years off  had scarred him.  So much so that he wanted to explode, as he says in  &quot;The Promised Land&quot;.  He sings of an America that has betrayed  him and hurt him throughout the album.  From lovers who hate for just being  born in Racing In the Street to a man who has fallen from society's graces  and blames his father in Adam Raised a Cain, Springsteen uses the grundge  theme of reaching for the most private thoughts and grabbing at the most  public issues.   <br /> Every song is so strong and so heart-rendering that  Springsteen bares a bruising rhythm to keep from breaking down.  The  grittiness of his lyrics tell of men who've lost everything and the music  brings dignity to these characters.  Everything that Pearl Jam and Nirvana  were told that they had created, Springsteen had brought to life in 1978.   In his darkest time, he wrote an album that so perfectly described what he  was feeling, that it became ahead of ITS time and ahead of OUR time. <br /> As  the fading notes to Darkness play out, there is an undeniable hope in all  the characters Springsteen has presented and in every listener.  It's  undeniable.  Even though the man is still in the darkness, he's content  with what he has.  The perfect thought for the restlessness grundge would  dredge up in the nineties.
B00004TH6O|4.0|i really thought they didn't make records like this anymore. i read the 4 star review of this in q magazine and gave it a try on impulse. boy, it  took me back. hearing r for the first time is like hearing your first black  sabbath lp. or your first dose of gong or hawkwind. the musicianship is  outstanding and accomplished, but there's an irreverence and a spontanaeity  about the whole thing too. you can just picture this motley collection of  long-haired, pot-smoking guys, sitting around coming up with the stuff.  there's something very seventies underground alternative rock about it, yet  something really today about it too. it's odd, but instant. and cheap too.  try it.
B000001FS3|5.0|With what U2 did in the nineties, sometimes it's easy to distance yourself  from the band.  Pop almost completely turned me off to everything U2 had  ever done.  But one day about two months ago, I popped the Joshua Tree back  into my CD player and listened spellbound.  The songs have so much power,  so much emotion that it's hard to see how U2 ever rerouted themselves so  far from this.  While they seem a parody of music today, in 1987, they  still believed in the magic of rock and roll.  Their jadedness was  delivered to the world outside, not to their trade.  They believed that  their music could save their souls and their listeners.  It was a powerful  notion, braced with naivity and lust, doomed to die pitifully as U2 moved  into the 90s.   <br /> This album is a time capsule, a tribute to the power  music can really have.  Every song moves me.  Where the Streets Have No  Name is the perfect U2 song.  Pumping energy, an electrified mist, a dry  desert morning, U2 created so many images with this album, some terrifying,  some tender, all filled with hope.  What a moment in time, a moment I hope  with all my heart- and U2 is the only band I have hope in my heart for-  that they can recapture someday.  Until then (and even if they do), The  Joshua Tree will not leave my CD player for long.
B00003CWL5|2.0|I found this movie condescending and predictable. The notion that middle-aged folks in the suburbs can't see how unhappy they are has been  re-hashed by Hollywood so many times this movie hardly registers as  original.

The only character who deserves any sympathy is Lester's daughter,  who thanks to years of neglect is so starved for attention of any kind she  becomes involved with the drug-dealing death-obessesed boy next door.  <br />What saves the vanilla screenplay is the fantastic acting and directing.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning turn out terrific performances. The  supporting cast is top-notch.

B0000025BL|5.0|I have over 400 albums, not cd's, but records. I started collecting when i  was in high school. Of all of thoes 400, this is One of my all time  favorites. I have to agree with all the others who have written that only  Meat loaf could Pull off the lyrics of this album with such emotion. He  brings the song's to life. i have the picture album, and on the back of the  cover it warns that there will be surface noise if played. Well i play it  anyway, because i like this album so much that i can live with the surface  noise. as has been said by many others. If you don't like this album, then  you just don't get it, and never will. but that's your loss, not mine. This  album will remain one of my favorites for all time.

0800116917|2.0|CS Lewis remarked that a negative review is a tricky business; there is always someone for whom the panned item really does work.  For example, the great Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh considers this film a masterpiece. This film doesn't work for me, but I recognize many people are tres fond of it; I intend no disrespect to their enthusiasm. Peter O'Toole is impeccable and inspiring as a shunned individualist emerging from shadows to show his peers, and the world, his hidden greatness. The supporting cast are magnificent: Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif. The film is also a compelling vignette of the life of TE Lawrence set amid spectacular  scenery. ACTING/CINEMATOGRAPHY: 5 stars.<br /><br />But there are several monotonous scenes - eg, the desert crossings - that should have been edited because the opportunity cost was (much-needed) character development of the film's brilliant actors. The lack of both imaginative dialogue and engaging storyline compounds this difficulty; there is neither one memorable spoken line nor any humor. I find it hard to believe the conversations of the stellar TE Lawrence were so pedestrian - Chaim Weizmann described Lawrence thus: \\"His personality was complex and difficult. He was profoundly shy; his manner was whimsical, and it was difficult to get him to talk seriously. He was much given to the Oxford type of sardonic humour. But when one did manage to get him into a serious vein he was frank and friendly, and his opinions, especially regarding the affairs of the Near East, were really worth having.\\" EDITING/SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: 1 star.<br /><br />Just as the movie's filming ran far overtime (from five months to two years), the film itself feels protracted at over two and a half hours. One yearns to see this wonderful group of actors actually engage in memorable thespian pyrotechnics, which never are delivered. The film's tepid, jive ending also just doesn't jibe: The elite political power players bid a peremptory farewell to Lawrence of Arabia. The reality was more sinister and film-worthy: Lawrence's enlightened efforts to free Arabia from predatory European colonialism methodically were back-stabbed by the British Empire at the Versailles Conference and the League of Nations. The consequent British drawing-up of national borders with little geopolitical or ethnic relevance has been exacerbating Mideast turmoil ever since. Just as TE Lawrence's great idea of freeing the Arabs from European colonialism failed, this film fails to liberate its powerful cast and fascinating subject from a banal storyline. Perhaps my difficulty with this film is that, achieving so much, I cannot help feeling it could have done more.<br /><br />Sir Winston Churchill famously described TE Lawrence as \\"one of the greatest beings of our time\\". But the journalist Lowell Thomas, a familiar of Lawrence during the desert campaigns, remarked of this film, \\"They only got two things right: the camels and the sand\\". Those two remarks taken together are my view of this film: strong matter, weak form.<br /><br />A film commended but with huge reservations.o Lawrence of Arabia.

B00000J7J4|5.0|This is the ultimate musical adventure skillfully lead by the one and only  Carlos Santana.<br />The variety and talent involved in this project is made  coherent and held together by the musical glue created by Santana's searing  guitar licks.
0553573403|5.0|If you haven't read this yet you are so lucky - you have such a treat  ahead of you.  I have to admit that science-fantasy has been disappointing  me of late.  It's too contrived or too shallow or badly written.  But this  series,  is just wonderful.<br />I read an interview with George RR Martin  who said that he wanted it to read like the War of the Roses (real history)  but with the drama of no one knowing the outcome. He wanted you to feel  that anything was possible - any  character could die at any time. And he  has written a masterpiece.  It's gripping,  and chilling and so wonderfully  thought out,  with a hundred clever ideas and great characters all of whom  have parts you love and parts you hate.  I took it to the sun,  but could  only feel the cold of the world Martin has created,  with the ominous  'Winter is coming' as it's theme.<br />This is a lush,  rich fantasy,  in a  fully realised world,  that you will love and keep forever.<br />Buy it now!  In fact,  buy the sequel at the same time,  otherwise you will have to  endure a dreadful wait in between books.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Based on a true story, Erin Brockovich recounts the challenges of Erin and a law firm in bringing a multi-billion dollar company to justice.  A major  sub-plot of the story is the challenging life of Erin herself, who has 3  kids, no husband and difficulties finding work.<br />This movie features great  perfomances, is well-directed and very well scripted.  But what makes this  a blockbuster and not just another great drama is Julia Roberts. <br />Julia  is undeniably the most successful female actress in the history of motion  pictures and this movie shows why.  Whether in court with a neck brace on,  meeting with chromium victims, or fighting with her coworkers, Julia exudes  charisma.  When she's angry, we feel her anger; when she smiles, we smile  with her; and oh when those eyes get teary...  The role of Erin gives Julia  ample opportunity to do all this.
1568493207|4.0|I have only dabbled in reading a little &quot;postmodern&quot; literature, simply because I think most of it is over my head, and although I didn't  get everything there was meant to get (not by a long shot), I feel as  though I gained access to an interesting story about how ridiculous (or  not) many conspiracy theories can be.<br />There are sooooooooo many questions  I have, and sooooooo many references I didn't even know where really fact,  but in that way, I kind of understand Oedipa's thoughts and feelings  throughout the novel. I think that if I were more knowledgable, I wouldn't  have been able to read this the way I did. And like all the puns in Joyce's  &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; I don't think it's as important to know  everything that the author puts forth, I just think if you get the initial  joke, it's enough. Maybe I'm wrong, but I read this for the story and not  for the history lesson.<br />It took me a bit to get used to Pynchon's writing  style, but after a few pages, I liked getting lost in the non-punctuated  tangents he went off in in his sentences. The laughs were genuine, and the  story almost surreal, as if the heat of San Narciso gets into the brain. I  enjoyed this book, and feel as though several rereads will help to bring  more into the light.
B000002JK4|5.0|I just got this CD and heard the whole thing for the first time. It is  truly amazing. Robert Plant WOWs us yet again with his ability to sing such  deep emotional songs.  These songs have meaning.  Something you don't find  a lot of today.<br />Big Log is a great example of Plant's depth within this  album.  It is truly a mesmerizing song.  I recommend you sit back in a dark  room, close your eyes and just listen to the words.  It almost sounds  spiritual. But Hey, don't take my word for it.  Buy it for yourself.
B00003CX6P|5.0|I have not thoroughly read Patricia Highsmith's highly acclaimed novel,  but I can guarantee that even though this movie was an engrossing dive into  the machinations of an unintended criminal mind, it does not compare to the  impact of detail a book can create. This fact aside, I thought everyone in  this movie (with the exception of minor roles) was excellent, especially  Jude Law, even though he was only present for the first hour of the film.  The performances are well-crafted and aimed to discern themselves from  genuine and amiable personalities. Of course everyone in the tale is  despicable! If they were all decent human beings, it wouldn't be  interesting.<br />First off, we have Matt Damon in the title role, a young  gay man looking for his slot in life with a penchant for deception. You  find out soon enough that the name Tom Ripley is simply one of his many  aliases he uses to snake his way into beneficial situations. He assumes  many identities, becoming a doppleganger of sorts in a simplistic  environment where every move he makes, every word he says and every  appearance he manifests is utterly and undeniably credible and influential.  Men like this are frightening, and Ripley is a force to be reckoned with,  an impulsive and unrepentant being deriding our subsequently modern  society. Despite his unabashed approach to establishing valuable  connections, he is surprisingly withdrawn and extremely discontent with his  own image. His dynamic leaps into other people's existences are his escape  from that which he despises the most: himself.<br />The site of this story is  stationed mainly in fictional Mongibello, Italy, circa 1958. Minghella  recreates the most remote parts of Italy and transforms them into a rustic  and breathtaking environment, reminiscent of a time when it was more of a  paradise than a tourist attraction. Verdant blossoms and ivy-swabbed houses  and buildings create a dated and sophisticated look for the lavish set of  &quot;Ripley&quot;, making it enjoyable to watch not only for its character  depth but also for the lush and picturesque scenery.<br />It all begins at an  outdoor party with our faithful fraud playing a piano, his back to the  camera, wearing a chic college sweater. Perusing and schmoozing among the  crowd is Herbert Greenleaf, a stoic and shady presence made of money and  power. He strikes up a conversation with the young man and notices his  sweater has a Princeton logo emblazoned on the front. This is the key that  unlocks the first of many doors for Ripley, a key that will send him to  Italy in search of Dickie Greenleaf, Herbert's obstinate and impetuous son.  In return for Tom's subjugation of Dickie are a $1000 prize and most  certainly a seat in Herbert's prestigious social circle. Tom readily agrees  and packs his bags, carefully studying Dickie's musical interests among  other things in the weeks before his departure. Upon arrival in Mongibello,  Tom puts on civil and amicable airs, introducing himself to Dickie and his  girlfriend Marge Sherwood, an aspiring novelist. The two of them are  enchanted by Tom's subtlety and good graces, inviting him to stay in their  luxurious domicile overlooking the deep blue ripple of the Mediterranean.  Tom watches them closely, acquiring Dickie's mannerisms and love for  adventure, accompanying him on many spontaneous outings. It becomes quite  clear in the time that they spend together that Tom is more than genial  towards Dickie, and the moment he tries to advance upon him romantically,  Dickie reciprocates with harsh rejection and stinging insults. Here comes  the plot twist, and from this point on, Tom is caught between his  established identity as an unassuming and demure individual and the  delicious taste of Dickie's enviable lifestyle.<br />In rating the  performances, Jude and Matt were my prime picks for most intriguing  performances, not only for their natural talent but also for the unwavering  commitment to the perfectionof their characters. Jude is a formidable  presence on screen, playing the idyllic high-nosed snob in an iconoclast  society. Dickie is a man who lives for the moment, finding his ecstasy in  fleeting moments of inspiration, whether it be with instruments or lovers.  He's not a man of many redeeming qualities, but then again no one in this  film is except for maybe Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. This is a  complete %180 from the female empowering roles she's had in the past, the  most notable being her Oscar-winning turn as the poetically inspired,  theatrically driven free spirit Viola de Lessups in &quot;Shakespeare In  Love&quot;. She's unbelievably gullible as Marge, a bit pitiful in her  infinite kindness towards strangers and grudgingly accepting of Dickie's  flighty nature. I almost don't think the role was worthy of her time or  talent, but nonetheless, she did a good job. It's just a little hard for me  to believe that it took Marge that long to figure out Tom Ripley's twisted  game.<br />Who I really thought was outstanding was Philip Seymour Hoffman,  playing Dickie's pompous and uncouth acquaintance Freddie Miles. Philip has  played the role of the snot-nosed prep before, the first one I can think of  being George Willis Jr., the spoiled son of a wealthy businessman, a solid  member of the wealthiest clique attending a prestigious prep school. Of  course, Freddie is worse by far, caring nothing of what he says or does and  how it affects those around him. He is a boil on the butt of humanity,  purposely belittling others to define his own importance. You watch him,  you listen to him, and you immediately begin to detest him. Philip couldn't  have played it better! Cate Blanchett was mediocre as Meredith Logue, a  fellow spoiled rich kid from old money. Her character was merely a plot  device, someone who showed up just when things were working out for Tom.  She was a rubber band that snapped him into action when he least expected  it, forcing him to improvise. It was interesting to watch Tom fumble about  and think fast, but there are so many other actresses who could've played  the part equally or better.<br />My only qualm with this film is the length  that it takes to reach its climax. Clocking in at nearly 2.5 hours, you  wonder if all the him-hawing about is actually necessary. This film is  metaphorical in its essence, including the scene where Ripley is riding a  motorbike through a busy alley and is unnerved by guilty conscience as  Dickie's face appears in every reflection of glass and mirror he crosses.  It all ends with a lingering camera angle of Ripley sitting upon a bed, his  image reflected infinitely in the mirrored opening over before the doors  finaly close on him for the last time. Darkly poetic and allegorical,  Minghella lends that feathery touch to film that Highsmith's richly  textured prose was meant to convey. All in all, this is an enthralling  story with strong performances and exceptional cinematography.

0060196122|1.0|I really, really, really (I could add infinite &quot;realys&quot;) dont  see what the big deal is with Mr Coelho. I am close to finish this second  book of his , after reading the terribly disapointing &quot;the  Alchemist&quot; and a I stronlgy beleive that this is a very mediocre book,  with very poor ideas that simply are not developed to the optimum. And this  doesn't do justice to his characters. I was hoping that Coehlo could add to  the list of talented Latin writters such as Borges  and Garcia Marces.  Unfortunatly looks like even Alliente does it better than him.<br />His  funtametalistic attitude becomes ennoying here, although is coverd better  than in &quot;the Alchemist&quot; and his obsession with destiny still  makes his work as animaginative and predictable as ever.<br />Krima
B00004TJTS|5.0|I didn't watch the movie in the theater because I figured that it's one of those children movies and I probably won't enjoy it.  After reading about  three reviews on Amazon.com and the good reviews from the viewers (dog  lovers) out there, I had to give it a try.<br />My wife and myself watched the  movie with our two dogs sitting next to us.  We love our dogs but I wanted  to watch the movie not because of the story of a boy and his dog (I could  have watched &quot;Ben&quot;) but because I wanted to see this touching  story and the relationship one has with their pets, that's what I was  interested in.<br />After we were done watching, we were both in tears.  I  looked at my two dogs and it reminded me of how much these pets are a part  of our lives.  The storyline of a kid who is bullied and how his dog helps  him through his young life and eventually gains friends to the last 15  minutes which will nearly shatter your heart.  An emotional roller coaster  this movie turned out to be.<br />Ok...as for the DVD, the audio is mostly  dialogue but the rear speakers are used pretty well.  Especially during  the baseball game.  The video is clear and the colors are good.  As for  the special features, you get two feature-length audio commentaries.  One  with Frankie Muniz and animal trainer Mathilde DeCagney and the other with  director Jay Russell.  It was cool to see the deleted scenes and part of me  wishes they left it in and I wish the director elaborated why he removed  them from the movie.  And of course, the ever loveable trailer and scene  selections which I don't count as special features (all DVD's should have  those).<br />All in all, &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; is a wonderful movie.  I  recommend this movie to all dog lovers.  Those who dislike canines or any  pets would probably not watch this movie anyway... Highly recommended for  the dog loving fans out there and remember to have the tissue box nearby.
B00004Y635|5.0|When I first was going to see it, I thought, not another .... sequel, you know? I was blown away! It wasn't better than the original, but it was defenetly better than the second. It has the three survivors of the first  two, &quot;Dewey Riley&quot;, that clumsy Deputy whose sister died in the  first Scream. &quot;Gale Weathers,&quot; that pesky reporter in the first  two, and a jourilist for Total Entertainment in the third, and &quot;Sidney  Presscott,&quot; living in total isolation after she was stalked. Changed  her name and still, after all that, the killer has found her. I truly loved  this movie. And if you liked the first two, you'll love the third. But if  you've never seen the first two, you'll be lost.
6300214028|4.0|I understand that W Beattie thought that noone liked his film.  I sure  did.  The careful development of the story and characters more than  warranted its length.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes in the smoky  rooms, but also the touching scenes of their working quietly together in  Russia, as well as, of course, the epic revolutionary scenes.  I would have  liked a little more of the Eugene O'Neill characterization and I do wish  the movie did explain what happened to Louise Bryant.  I understand she  moved to Paris, but I don't know when.
B000002UA0|5.0|I still own all the post-Syd Floyd albums on LP, but this is the only one  that I bought on CD (Along with Madcap Laughs and Barrett).  While I still  basically like most of the 70's stuff, to me it sounds rather dated and I  just never really want to listen to it anymore.  The Syd stuff, however, is  very special.  It is extremely 60's psychedelic, but at the same time it's  timeless.  &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;Scarecrow&quot; are fantastic, but so  is most of this album.  Granted, if you are looking for the grandiose,  slick Prog Rock of 70's Floyd (not that there's anything wrong with it),  you won't really appreciate this, at least on the first listening.  Do try  to keep an open mind and take it own it's own terms.  While I think some  people can go overboard with the cheesy hyperbole about Syd's genius,  he  certainly was a unique talent whose career was cut short by  insanity.<br />There's also a couple of albums, such as &quot;Relics&quot;,  which have some of the singles they made in this period (Arnold Lane, etc),  and there's one song which is really wierd but fantastic, called  &quot;Scream thy Last Scream&quot;, which I think is only found on  bootlegs.
0767903854|5.0|For most Americans - and probably for most Europeans, too - Australia is a big, roughly circular blank spot on the map.  For us, it's an  easy-to-defend territory in Risk, and the source of many a bad Down Under  joke - a country that's gone to another planet, but occasionally sends back  bands and boomerangs.<br />Bill Bryson doesn't see Australia like that.   Strange to say - *very* strange, if you've read his other travel books -  Bryson actually seems to like, even love, Australia.  He certainly relishes  traveling through it and revels in the odd little facts he unearths.  This  makes for a touching travel book rather different than his previous works.  <br />In a Sunburned Country is actually extremely different than, for  example, A Walk in the Woods.  The primary focus of Walk was the humor and  the experiences, not the Applachian Trail, and certainly not America or  Americans.  In Sunburned, Bryson has produced a much more straightforward  travelogue more concerned with little museums and cheap hotels than with  the inside of his own head.  It's still funny, of course, and it's still  got a lot of Bryson in it - his reactions to the museums (he loved every  one of 'em), his reactions to the hotels (if you're going to Darwin, better  check out this book first), and his inexplicable ability to find danger and  injury in places where other people are fine (the dogs in the park, petrol  in the outback).<br />This is by no means an in-depth exploration of  Australia; in fact, it could be subtitled &quot;Australia: Only the Good  Parts.&quot;  Bryson just gives hints about the darker side of modern  Australians (a man in a train who says that all Aborogines should be  hanged), then hastily retreats to another museum.  It's as though he's  reluctant to let his fantasy of Perfect Australia be tainted.  <br />However,  it's engrossing both as armchair travel and as humor, and that, as we all  know, is a perfect combination.  And if the government of Australia owesBryson a hearty thank-you for this book, so what?  <br />(One last note: he's  done a book and a half with Stephen Katz, who is in his own way delightful.   But if Bryson has any sense at all, he'll take Alan Sherwin along on his  next book trip.  Bryson is always better with a companion, a foil, and  Sherwin is perfect  for that.  In addition, Sherwin doesn't appear to hold  a grudge, which is essential for someone who is traveling with Bryson.  In  Sunburned, many of the funniest and best bits involve Sherwin, even though  he's in less than a fifth of book.)
0312853238|5.0|This book came highly recommended by several friends so after searching  high and low for all four in the series, I dove into the first one head  first.  I was not disappointed.  And the ending was completely unexpected.   What's interesting with this novel, it would appeal to a non sci-fi fan as  much as to a die hard sci-fi fan.  The basis of the story is a study in  human psychology more than anything else. Am looking forward to the  remainder of the series.
6304068549|4.0|This is even better than the first! I love some of the lines No. 5 said like, &quot;Oh, Human Porcupines!&quot;. Ha,Ha,Ha!  I also love the parts  were No. 5 gets the badguys. When I first saw this when I was 6 or so, I  found it very hard to watch the scene were Johnny 5 gets smashed up. It was  so dramatic and I still find it difficult to watch. But besides that,  &quot;Short Curcuit 2&quot; is a great funny '80s flick to check out! Rent  or buy it today!
0780631684|1.0|I guess this movie script has a lot of holes.  I couldn't understand the pattern of death.  Because every person was dead one by one, as soon as one  person dead.  This is the pattern (or destiny, right?  But why?  I don't  understand last 5 mins in Paris!   So destiny can wait 6 months?   I was  so disappointed about this ending.  First 30 mins was really good this  movie.
0553274503|5.0|How many books can make this claim? 1) They are thought provoking. 2) They  are exceedingly clever. 3) They are exceptionally well-written.  &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; surpasses all criteria and is truely  astonishing!<br />  The story is full of symbolism and ironies. Some are  obvious while others are well hidden in the richly plotted text. This work  can be read on many levels and can be enjoyed by all.<br />  Keyes transition  from the dim-witted Charlie to the super genious who must write  &quot;down&quot; to a level where his work can be understood. This  transition is as smoothe as silk and completely convincing. Pay attention  to Keyes use of sentence structure as a tool for Charlie intellectual  growth it is very clever.  The concept and the execution of Keyes'  central idea is nothing short of remarkable. Do not kid yourself - this was  not an easy book to write. Keyes was able to pull us into Charlies life and  make us understand his struggles as a mentally challenged young man. More  amazing is his ability to show us the emotional struggles of a man who  becomes a genious.<br />  The story begs the question. Is better to have and  lose, or to never obtain and wonder. All readers will draw their own  conclusions. However, I hope I have not left any questions about my  conclusion on the quality of this masterpiece.
0312853254|3.0|Once again, I would not put this novel in the sci-fi genre.  It's an  interesting study in human behavior intermixed with religious beliefs.  The  sci-fi aspect seems almost like an afterthought. I found this second one  much too slow, with too much religion  embedded into the story in fact.   But my interest is still piqued  enough to read the remainder of the  series.
B000002I57|5.0|I went to the store to buy new speakers and this was one of the CD's I brought. The sound of Bag's Vibes and Trane's horn set the mark for  quaility jazz. They trade solos so smoothy that they seem like the same  thoughts just different instruments. Coltran's playing here is different  Than his other stuff like African Brass or A love Supreme. It is straight  foward and very smooth. Of course Milt's playing is top notch as well.  Stairway to the Stars and Bags and Trane steal the show. This is a  tremendous CD. It is in the Top five of the Fifty Jazz CD's I own
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This was one of the first &quot;real&quot; horror movie i saw. The result of that was a bunch of nightmares and stuff. Now im cured. Hmmmm Anyway.  This film is one of my favorite and Carpenter is the greatest director  ever. Thats a fact.
6302610702|5.0|The Godfather is simply a must watch epic for all.  It simply places itself one level higher than other movies. It has been written with  perfection by Mario Puzo, deserving the credit it has been given.   A  masterpiece portraying the life of Don Corleone(Marlon Brando) and his  powerful family.  An important part is played by Micheal, his youngest son,  who rises in the family business at the end of the movie..   An incredible  piece with kingly performances by Pacino, Brando, Caan and Robert Duvall.   My favourite quote is: Michael: Sonny, its not personal, its just business.  The intense acting by Pacino and Brando will keep you on the edge of your  seat. A great depiction of the mafia in New York. Defintely one of my  favourite movies.
B000000WJZ|5.0|As the drums of &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; start pounding, you know you're in  for a wild ride, and the Pumpkins will be your tour guides.  While not as  much of a psychadelic venture as &quot;Gish,&quot; this is more of a  musical adventure.  You'll end up at the true heart of music, and you'll  never want to leave again.<br />There's too much to be said about this album.   Billy Corgan and his genius songwriting make this album more appreciated  than it needs to be.  This is a band that will forever make it's mark in  history.  Not a single day goes by without me listening to &quot;Cherub  Rock&quot; or &quot;Today&quot; or any other song on Siamese Dream.  They  are all masterpieces.  The majority of the songs are radio-friendly, but  who cares?  They're all wonderful songs that should be a part of any avid  music fan's collection.<br />With that said, you need to realize that if you  do not click &quot;buy now&quot; within the next 5 minutes, you've just  lost whatever 5 minutes you could have spent listening to the beginning of  this record.  This is the best album of the '90s, and in my opinion, the  best album of all time.  Nothing in my collection has topped it.  The  Smashing Pumpkins were always one step ahead of the rest of my music, and  their music always deserves a special place in my heart.  <br />With melodic  rock songs like &quot;Today&quot; or mellow yet uplifting songs like  &quot;Mayonaise,&quot; this album is something you should not pass up on  buying.  It is a triumph in music and anything else closely related to  music.  So go ahead, click &quot;Buy Now.&quot;  I promise you won't regret  it.
0060977493|2.0|I am not about to recite what everyone else did about condensing the plot,  but this was hard to get into..I put it down several times,but made myself  finally read it since the comments on the cover were so strong. I made  myself finish it and find it a most disjointed piece of literature. Roy  obsesses with her personal language and capitalized words thrown in  everywhere. I do not suggest reading this to learn about the subculture of  India...a place where I lived and hoped to re-visit in print and instead  found an self-possessed auther writing for her own audience of one. How  this book received any award is beyond my imagination! Do not waste your  time reading it!
B00000K19E|4.0|This movie was truly great. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The visual effects were unparalleled and the action was breathtaking. The  idea behind the scenario was very good but I would like to stress a little  thing : the idea of &quot;false perceptions&quot; is not unheard of ; in  fact the authors merely adapted a French philosophical book intitled  &quot;Mditations Mtaphysiques&quot; (Metaphysical Meditations for not  French-speaking people)written by Ren Descartes.
B00003Q438|5.0|One word can really describe this movie finally being coded to DVD, AWSOME. I remember being in High School when this movie was released in  1989. I saw it then and was stunned by such a movie of high calibur. Now it  being released to DVD format with restored footage, this clearly explains  many questions we might have had when we saw it the first time around.  After you watch the making of this movie, you come to realize that the  actors were very underpaid to do this type of difficult movie.  <br />If you  have not seen this movie of true underwater adventure, then you do not know  what you are missing. No other underwater movie tops what this movie  created. It is hard to believe that many of the ideas in this movie were  very plausible. For example the florocarbon oxygenated water that they use  in the movie, you breathe in, instead of air is the actual stuff in the  scene with the rat. <br />This movie shows and points out that we are possibly  being observed by aliens. But why do they not contact us? Why do they just  sit back and observe? Because all they have to do is view our history as a  violent world (wars, genocide, etc) to make them wary of contact. In  reality there are areas of the ocean to this day that we cannot penetrate  and see. Who knows what might be down there. This movie will show you one  possible encounter. This DVD is also jam packed with so much content you  will literally spend hours pouring over storyboards, and information. This  is how DVD's should be made and how others should be molded.
B000000WA4|5.0|You buy this thinking you're buying just another alternative rock album.   You put the first disc, &quot;Dawn To Dusk,&quot; into your CD player.  As  the soft piano tune goes through your headphones, you can't help but wonder  what it's doing there.  Does it belong?  Yes.  The opening self-titled  piano track is the perfect opening for an album, and truly gives you the  sense that you're about to travel through a dream-world that only geniuses  like the Pumpkins could create.<br />This was the first Pumpkins album that I  bought, but needless to say, I never got into that alternative rock trend.   The Pumpkins are the only alt. rock band I listen to, even though they  aren't even quite alt. rock.  They are a step above all music.<br />This  double-disc album will be forever imprinted into my mind.  Much of it is  less radio-friendly than Siamese Dream, but it's not often you come along  such lovely melodies (&quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby&quot;) or sheer anger  encased in madness (&quot;X.Y.U.&quot;).  The best songs aren't the  singles, and that's why this album shines.  If the best songs were the  songs you had already heard, then what a bore an album could be.  This  two-cd set has enough songs to last you for the next hundred years.  I love  each and every one of them, for they are all masterpieces in their own  right.<br />I do not believe that this album should have been shorter.  If it  were shorter, it'd be less stunning and we'd all pass it off as  &quot;another Pumpkins album.&quot;  The fact that it's a double-disc will  make it listenable for years to come.  Don't pass this double-CD up.  This  is what got me into the Pumpkins, and I'm never getting out.
B0000025T6|5.0|I'm writing this review in the hopes that it will actually get posted.  My  last few reviews have mysteriously disappeared. So, here goes...<br />This is  my favorite Springsteen release of all time.  Certainly it can be  contrasted to &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot;  However, there is a  certain auroa about this album that goes miles beyond any later attempts to  recapture it.  As we all can admit, there are just certain things about a  time in one's life, about a &quot;time&quot; in history...that given moment  when things are going as never before.....later attempts to recapture that  experience fall slightly short.  That's the case with &quot;Tom  Joad&quot;---it can't, by definition, rise (or sink?) to this level.<br />This  is man at his rawest.  The most down and out.  Perfect, as I always say,  for driving endless miles through the night...either the mojave desert or  the great plains, take your pick.  Can a song about Charlie Starkwheather  (driving with a sawed off .410) be played at any time other than 1am-4am?  Maybe.<br />This album is it.  Perfect lonely down and out music.  The type  that makes you want to open up a liter of ol' grandad and throw the cap  away.<br />Worth noting, this album is INCREDIBLY well followed by either: (a)  any Tom Waits' asylum release (preferably &quot;Nighthawks at the  Diner&quot; ; (b) &quot;The Boatman's call&quot; or &quot;Murder  Ballads&quot; by Nick Cave; and (c) &quot;Live at Folsom Prison&quot; by  Johnny Cash.<br />Then, either turn the lights out and drink.  Go to a smoky,  lonely bar. (Try &quot;Red's, on St. Charles--near Lafayette--in New  Orleans) Or, get in your car...with a few semiautomatic weapons for  safety---and drive, drive, drive.
0767849493|2.0|For me, this movie started out with the right amount of irreverant anti-religeous zeal, but then became perverted into just another gory chop  'em up &quot;road trip.&quot;  If it had stuck with the satirical humor it  could have worked better.  For me, it stopped being funny when the violence  became explicit.  The monster from the toilet was funny, and that type of  violemce (implied but not seen) made for a better film.  It is too bad that  it deteriorated into a &quot;I can make this more graphic than the last  movie made&quot; type movie.  It lost points with me.
B00002E224|1.0|This movie is the cure for insomnia.  It's so boring !
B000000W6F|5.0|The debut of the Smashing Pumpkins.  In my opinion, the greatest debut  ever.  This album is a psychadelic venture into the world of alternative  rock, but it's slightly softer and a step above the usual alt. rock.  SP  showcase more of their harder tracks (&quot;Bury Me,&quot;  &quot;Siva&quot;) and a few of their softest tracks of all time  (&quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; &quot;Window Paine&quot;).  It all ends up as a  stunning album with wonderful songs.<br />I love this album to the fullest.   Only a few things keep it from being my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album  (that title is left to Siamese Dream).  Although by now I've gotten used to  it and rather like it, the redundant &quot;She knows&quot; in  &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; ruined the song at first listen for me.  The  constant yelling of the word &quot;flower&quot; in &quot;Snail&quot; also  kinda ruined that song.  I still love this album, though.  It's an amazing  debut that no one should pass up.
0783226845|5.0|There has already been 33 reviews written of this movie.  What more do I  hope to (or can I possibly)add?  Well, I don't know, but here goes my two  cents...<br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Al Pacino at one  of his very best moments.  Playing a role unlike any other of his career.  Chris O'Donnell at a perfect stage--before he his head became too big to  fit through doorways (as the result of such travesties as Batman or The  Bachelor).<br />This is a very moving movie.  One that never fails to endear  itself further to me.  I've seen it more times than I care to remember, but  just yesterday, happened to catch it again on TNT. The channel surfing  stopped there, and I watched what (little) remained.<br />I wager you will  love this movie as well.  One can't help but love it as they watch an  aging, blind Pacino come from despair to....well, I won't give away too  much for those of you who haven't seen it.<br />But, a few scenes to look for  that are, by themselves, worthy of the price of this beauty:  (a) the  tango; (b) the test-drive; and (c) the speech.  Hopefully that is cryptic  and vague enough to not give anything away.  However, those in the know,  know very well what I speak/write of.<br />Get it.  Enjoy it a million times  over.
B000002B35|5.0|About a year from now, I bought 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder-Live'. I  thought that was a totally awsome album. But once i got 'PULSE' on 8-21-00,  I was totally shocked about how much cooler and better PULSE is! I own the  PULSE video, but the album has more songs than the video...suprisingly. The  vocals are more clear than DSOT. This album includes some great songs from  Floyd's latest album, 'The Division Bell', a complete performance of 'Dark  Side Of The Moon', a VERY classic song...'Astronomy Domine', and the best  songs from 'The Wall'...&quot;Hey You&quot;,&quot;Another Brick In The  Wall-pt.2&quot;,&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, and &quot;Run Like  Hell&quot;.<br />So...for those who only have 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder', or  Do Not have 'DSOT' nor 'PULSE'......PULSE should be the choice. I'm sure if  u get PULSE, you will be pleased.<br />Also...if you ever get PULSE, try to  get the brick slipcase edition. It contains a small book of photos from the  live show. If this review kinda made you think whether to get PULSE or not,  just E-Mail me at MattKitt@aol, or just MattKitt.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Great album, especially liked the cut &quot; here with me...&quot; but just one question: why did she have to sing on eminem's new album, and on a  song called &quot; stan&quot; of all things? she runs a risk of damaging  her reputation. the guy is a loser, she doesn't need him, to get people to  buy her records...
B00000099Y|5.0|...this album stands out above so many others. ive been listening to it  constantly for over two years and i still havent grown tired of it. they  are the most intellectual band there is, and one of the most talented. it  is a godly piece of work. get it. thats really all i have to say.
0140042520|4.0|A man who named and best described a generation of which he was a key  member, this is another high point in his outstanding literary career.   Written during the hieght of his loyalty and love for buddha, it set in the  years directly before his masterpiece was published. A great book lacking a  little substance, tales of drinking and yabyum in berkley with his new hero  Japhy Ryder.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Here with me, is the song generally heard on the radio but chances are you  heard Dido on the introduction to the WB's Roswell and her editted version  of Thank you on the movie Sliding Doors.  She has a sound that almost echos  in a haunting sort of way that encourages you to pay attention to every  sound she makes.  A great CD for those who enjoy Sarah and Tori.
B00003CXFU|5.0|I loved this movie.  Not only for the meanings behind it, but also for the  great cast.  Julia Roberts did it again!  She is a phenomenal actress.  I  have seen every movie she has been in.  She just keeps getting better.  I  have seen this movie 4 times and I love it more and more every time I see  it!<br />This is the movie to buy this summer!  It's great!  But don't just  take my word for it..it is well worth every penny you are about to spend!!!
B00004RHZU|5.0|P!nk has an awesome voice which can hit high and low notes. All of the  songs are great, with varied beats- upbeat, silly, and serious. Some of the  best songs are &quot;Hell Wit Ya&quot;, &quot;Most Girls&quot;, &quot;You  Make Me Sick&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Let you Know&quot;. I got this CD  because of &quot;There U Go&quot;. But I was pleasantly surprised by the  different degress of songs P!nk has on this CD. If you like CD's with good  mixes of music and good songwriting, get this one. (And, P!nk co-writes  about 6-7 songs on here, and they're good too, not like Britney's  &quot;Dear Diary&quot;!)
0684869713|3.0|As a junior in high school, a decade and a half ago, I read The Fountainhead nearly seven times.  And although I wouldn't say that I was an  Ayn Rand fanatic, I did read quite a bit of her work.  At this point in my  life The Fountainhead wouldn't have quite the same meaning that it did to  me at age seventeen.  However, I think that I still could appreciate  aspects of the novel, which is certainly a modern classic, though some  might say (and some might be really offended by this term), a cult classic.   What comes to mind for me looking back is the strength of the protagonists  and the really powerful way in which the author portrayed each character.   For me as I read the book, the characters really came to life.  Although I  may not have understood it completely or caught nuances that might be  apparent to me now, the characters were very well developed.  Thinking back  on the novel, what must have resonated strongly for me was the bravery, the  belligerence, and the independent spirit embodied by Howard Roark and  Dominique Francon.  To my adolescent thinking these were really admirable  and essential qualities, and even now I appreciate aspects of the integrity  of their characters.  Also I think that there is something in the novel  that hooks into an environmental ethic.  Though certainly the rape scene  embodies an opposite spirit. If I were to recommend any of her work, it  might be The Early Ayn Rand, because the stories seem to come from a less  extreme and polar place than the later works that I have read, and they  reveal an intelligent, articulate, tenacious, and developing author and  artist.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This CD has the perfect title for what it is. Britney basically recorded this collection of songs with the express purpose of extending her  popularity from &quot;....Baby One More Time&quot; Ok, now that I got that  out of my system. That does NOT make this a bad CD. Although there is not a  lot of originality here, it is a pleasure to listen to. The songs are  usually upbeat and danceable. And there IS one surprize. She takes a  classic Rolling Stones song, Satisfaction, and puts her own signature style  on it. It's doesn't compare to the original but who cares. It good to see  her try something different. Yes Keith Richards is probably rolling over in  his grave (yes, I know, he's not dead, but he looks like he is) but it's  actually a passable version.<br />Overall this is a good piece of work. You  may hate the style, you may hate this obsession lately with young teen age  girls (Mandy, Christine, etc) coming out of nowhere and doing the exact  same thing, but this CD is fun, interesting, and down-right popular.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Radical London playwrights Sam Mendes and Alan Ball, have contructed a missle into the heart of the American suburban multiplex. It's aim, with  the aid of treasonists, Steven Spielberg and Paul Allen, is to put a stake  through the heart of the American Family and the love between fathers and  daughters, and mothers and fathers.<br />I hated this movie. One day there  will be a return to Truth, Justice, and the American Way. It will be more  intelligent than the drivel of these Oxford types, and the public will have  lines around the block for months, making billions domestically.<br />Its too  bad that the auspices of this film aren't revealed to be what they are: men  without love and men without families. They hide behind capable actors and  flashy production design. <br />But if you LOOK CLOSER, they are cowards. They  would never come at you face to face. They hide; and the great filmmakers  of the next generation are watching and will prevail!
6304030959|5.0|&quot;Jumanji&quot; is one show that Robin Williams doesn't steal from the other characters. He carries his own weight, but so do  the rest of the  cast. Not a weak character in this bunch.<br />The writing is creative,  imaginative and compelling. The effects range from great (stampede, vines)  to weak (spiders, monkey faces), but they don't get in the way of an  engaging, fast-paced, even provocative movie.<br />The psychology may seem pop  Freudian to some, but it serves the overall illusion created by the movie.  I suspect that on a psychological level, &quot;Jumanji&quot; functions to  let kids deal with the anger and estrangement they feel with their fathers  (a la Bruno Bettelheim's &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;).<br />Carl, the  African American shoe designer/police officer, provides some of the  funniest material; unfortunately it smacks of an earlier cinema tradition  in which the black faces were always the victims of gags that exploited  their supposed fears or ignorance.<br />Over all, though, my daughter (7) and  son (4) find it compelling and exciting -- and my wife and I find ourselves  watching it again with them every time they put it in.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This CD is fantastic! Fiona has a great voice and she puts so much feeling  into all the songs. She wrote them all. I feel like I know exactly where  she is coming from when I listen to it. You should buy this CD-you will  love it!
B000001ELP|4.0|While this album has gotten mixed review from the public, this album is  solid.  &quot;I&quot; is the ultimate motivation song, &quot;The Oath&quot;  has a terrific riff to it, &quot;Under the Rose&quot; is a powerful song,  and &quot;Dark Light&quot; proved to me that Kiss should actually allow Ace  Frehley to add more material in their albums.  What ruined the album was  &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which was not really a Kiss song.  More like a Styx  song.  Otherwise, this album is really good and very motivating.  One of my  first albums, it holds a special place in my heart.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I saw this 4 times in the theater. Its such a cool sci fi flick. Aliens is my #1 movie of all time and nothing can compete with it...but this one  comes pretty damn close.<br />Put everything in the movie aside for a second  and just notice the visuals. Not necessarily the special effects, but the  visuals. I just remember how the desert scenes had all the highlights blown  out, it was so blaring and bright in the theater....with a yellow tinge.   And then cyan later...it was like some kind of film experiment it seemed  like.  Its so incredible.  Ive never seen anything like it before.<br />The  crash scene in the beginning is increible too. Very intense and realistic.   I felt like i was crashing with them. Theres subtle things to it. I  remember the camera going from the girl's eye to the crash, and back  again....and the sound drops out....and hits you again...and drops out.   Very very intense.
B000002B2T|4.0|I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY SUPRISING AND VERY GOOD SOLO EFFORT FROM THE  DIFFERENT BAND MEMBERS OF PEARL JAM,AND ALICE IN CHAINS.I FOUND IT BETTER  THAN CANTRELLS SOLO WORK,AND I ALSO LEARNED OF HOW MUCH INFLUENCE STALEY  HAS ON AIC.IT IS A MUST FOR ANY FAN OF ALICE IN CHAINS ESPECIALLY STALEY  WHO TO ME IS THE BEST SINGER OF THE LAST DECADE.
B000001FI7|5.0|More like a memory than music.  Listening to &quot;Sour Times&quot; or  &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot; makes you feel like you're somewhere else,  somewhere deep in your mind.  The music is so hypnotic and beautiful that  you actually feel it.  It makes you want to be able to climb inside it and  envelop yourself.<br />I listen to everything from classical to jazz to techno  to indie and this is my favorite CD.  It hasn't seen its case in years, its  been either in my home stereo or in my car since I first bought it after  hearing &quot;Sour Times&quot; at a high school theatre party.<br />And for  those of you who like it loud, I've blown the speakers in a few sets of  headphones and two speakers in my car before while listening to this.  You  find yourself unable to  keep from turning it up, trying to search the  music by listening to it.<br />This CD is the only one I've ever heard that  is actually worth what anyone charges for it.  For someone looking for a  good party disc, this shines among others.  I've received many compliments  while playing it at gatherings.  And every track on the disc is amazing,  one of the few releases from anyone who can accomplish that.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|The IRON has been reunited with the MAIDEN!  This is the album that should  have been recorded after &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;. The return of Bruce  Dickinson and Adrian Smith (while keeping on Jan Gers) have given Maiden  their old sound back, plus one.  Not only is the sound better, but the  songwriting is better too.  Smith/Dickinson songs have always been some of  Maiden's best (of course Steve Harris is the heart and soul of the group),  and they come through on this album in a big way!  The energy emitting from  this CD is unbelievable, like its a group of fresh 20-somethings instead of  the old geezers they are now (JOKE!) Without a doubt, this is one of  Maiden's best ever!!!
B00000DG1R|4.0|Its very important that music from the 80s bring out memories and this  certainly does.  The last track, Come Undone, can have such an effect on my  memory, it takes me back to times I miss.  If you're the same as me then  this CD has the two or three Duran Duran songs you're really looking for,  and without having to buy more than one disc, with the US single version  (the version you used to hear on MTV) of Ordinary World and Come Undone.  Drive around and listen to this one, its a keeper, and a good buy for an  80s/early 90s music fan.
0767903854|4.0|I bought &quot;Bill Bryson's Down Under&quot; in an English bookstore in  Paris, and it took me awhile to figure out that &quot;In a Sunburned  Country&quot; is the American title.  (Why'd they do that?) If the measure  of success of this genre is the reader's motivation to chuck it all and  head off for the most remote regions of the destination being described,  the book did it for me.  Since reading it, I started searching the Internet  for bike trips into the Outback. I found it less preachy, more informative  and more consistent throughout than Bryson's &quot;A Walk in the  Woods,&quot; which relieved me of a lifelong desire to hike the Appalachian  Trail.
B000002V07|4.0|Music that can create images in your mind of being somewhere else are very  important to me and this is one of those discs.  It can actually make you  FEEL something, its melodic guitar and Hope's beautiful voice combine folk  music with a sort of hypnotic poem.  It can serve so many purposes and can  fit so many types of music.  Whether you're enjoying a romantic dinner or  you're fading to sleep, this CD can take you to a calm soothing where your  thoughts drift together and your mind becomes at ease.
0066620694|5.0|It provides eye-opening, research-based insights to the problems of  managing innovation. Many are insights that although are counter-intuitive  (e.g., good management and listening too closely to customers are a root  cause of many problems in  innovation), nevertheless are compelling when we  carefully examine the histories of firms like IBM. Professor Christensen  drives to understand root causes and extract fundamental principles based  on thorough examination of the failures of many large, established  companies to take new technologies from the lab to market. A must read for  anyone within large or small firms involved in bringing innovative  technologies to market. One of my favorite courses and professors in grad  school.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator, played by Russel Crowe reveal in spectacular way the live of a  Roman General (Elius Maximus Decimus Meridius), that lives just at the end  of the time of the last Stoic Emperor (Marcus Aurelius). <br />This movie is  specialy detailed in the real way of combat, the social clases, the  politics, the power and defeat of the Roman Empire. For the people who  watch this movie with special attention and are really intrested in some  historical facts (even if the argument is not completely true) will find  the most grat movie ever made of the Roman Empire. <br />The roles played, the  action scenes, the combination between both of them makes this movie one of  the jewels of the 7th. art
B00004WIBW|3.0|The idea of chopping people's heads off and seeing them rolling around the  floor with their eyes wide open in shock must have seemed so good to  director Tim Burton that he decided that once wasn't enough, he had to do  it to many people throughout the movie.  The only thing he didn't do was to  have the headless horseman tossing a coin and saying, &quot;Heads I win --  ha, ha!&quot;  Indeed, the movie could have used a bit of light humor; not  that it wasn't funny, but it was too much &quot;heavy funny,&quot; if you  know what I mean.  As for the plot, there was certainly a lot more here  than in A NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  Still, it could have been better if  our hero were not a forensic detective but rather one of those nineteenth  century &quot;doctors of philosophy,&quot; who came to Sleepy Hollow to get  to the bottom of the mythical legend.  There's a lot of gore for people who  enjoy orange paint.  So why, you might very well ask, do I give this movie  as many as three stars?  I'm very cheap on stars, as you might know from  reading any of my other reviews.  Well, there's one thing in this movie  that blew my mind and makes it almost a collector's item.  There's a  ten-second scene where the headless horseman comes out of a hollow in a  twisted tree.  It is an utterly fantastic work of animation--the snarled  branches of the tree move and disgorge a horseman who at first looks like  those branches and then transmogrifies into the headless horseman.  The  sequence undoubtedly owes its initial inspiration from the wonderful  anthropomorphic forest in SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  But it's as  good a piece of fantasy drawing as anything in print.  I wouldn't be  surprised if Tim Burton could come up with a ten-second clip of the  sequence that could be accessed and studied by students of art and all  those who, like me, enjoy far-out Frazetta-type fantasy art.  This  wonderful sequence, which is indeed repeated in the movie from a slightly  different point of view (thus making it a second version of an almost  perfect art work), earns a third star from me (big deal!).  Bottom line:  the art work is excellent throughout the movie, and it makes this VHS (and  the DVD which is sure to follow) an item for your movie library that you  will want to look at again from time to time.
0783116934|5.0|I have always been a fan of true crime drama. Many leave much to be desired in the areas of writing and acting. &quot;Citizen X&quot; is not  one of those movies. Superb acting and writing brings this unbelievably  reprehensible tale to life. In my opinion this movie blows away  &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; No fictional movie can ever match this  true story!  As the cover says, &quot;52 murders in 8 years.&quot;<br />During  the 8 years, Stephen Rea chases Citizen X, a prolific serial killer that  stalks young victim in Russia. This is relatively a current event, as the  story ends in 1990, a time when Communist Russia did not want to  acknowledge a serial killer existed their country. This enabling denial  permitted some of the most heinous murders in the world.<br />Donald  Southerland, Max Von Sydow and Citizen X give outstanding performances. I  recommend this movie highly. This refers to the DVD, which is Full-Screen  (Originally produced for HBO).
0385495315|5.0|Singh has achieved an awesome feat: to write a book about a  heavy weight  technical topic that is almost impossible to put down.  He portrays the  evolution of codes as a struggle between those wanting to ensure privacy of  communication (the cryptographer) versus those who want to pry (the  cryptanalysts).  The ever more complex enciphering and encoding is  demonstrated in a very lucid way.  Great book, money well spent.
0441003257|4.0|This collaboration seems to bring out the best in both authors. It is  continuously funny, in an effective way, and is particularly effective in  taking on pseudoscience, which is an inherently comical field whose  practitioners are painfully humorless. It's the end of the world, and not  many of the characters are aware of what's happening or getting ready to  happen any moment.  Immortal radio comic genius Jack Benny used to  have a  running joke about how awful his film THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT was.  Here's a sort of variant of the theme of Benny's film, updated to the  1990s.  It's far from awful! In fact this is my favorite Terry Pratchett  novel.
0880794968|4.0|I have always had a standard Rider-Waite Deck, which I have never used. When I only just looked through the cards, every message always came as a  shock to me (both the darker and lighter cards), because te deck was made  to do just that: instantly be clear as meaning. I like the images very well  of the standard Rider-Waite, but the colours felt like someone banging with  a stick at my head, so I had to turn myself away to much  subtler-harder-to-read-decks. But sometimes I kept picking them up,  thinking 'if they would exist of subtler, more beautiful colours'... and  here they are. Finally I can pick it up and read it serenely without being  mentally attacked. And yes there are some little detail changes, also again  they help me ease-up, because it are the bang-on-the-head details that are  made softer. Finally a Raider deck where I can look at the cake, and not  made my nose rubbed into it.
0684874350|5.0|I read this just to see what all the fuss was about; I am generally not a  fan of directly autobiographical material. This book absorbed me very  quickly and would not let me go until I finished... and now I can't wait to  get the sequal. McCourt tells his life beautifully, using a  child's-point-of-view style of narrative that his honest, cute, and  humorous. He brings all the characters around him to life and gives them  enough personality to make you feel like you know then; and perhaps you do  in the carnation of a friend or relative of your own. Insightful of his own  past, without letting a trace of his future voice enter, McCourt has  entered into the literary world a memoir to be heralded and studied by all.
B000002GBB|5.0|Another great effort from one of rock's most underrated acts. Some may  find the lyrics to a couple of the songs to be a little corny(I'm OK, Lords  of the Ring), but the music is absolutely gorgeous throughout. One thing  that's always puzzled me about Styx is how little notice Dennis DeYoung has  gotten for his keyboard playing. I'm not a keyboard player, so I can't  really speak as to the difficulty of his parts; all I know is, his  arrangements were beautiful and his solos rocked, and to be perfectly  honest, I've never heard anyone who sounds anything like him. Some of you  keyboardists out there are probably sneering and thinking &quot;Keith  Emerson&quot;(of ELP); but I would say that while he may have been an  amazing player and a great showman, most of his music is just flat out  boring. Anyway, Dennis is in top form on this album. The synth solo on  &quot;Sing for the Day&quot; is so joyous it practically brings tears to my  eyes. Lest I forget, let me add that the guitars of Tommy Shaw and James  Young are also great as usual. The bottom line is this: Pieces of Eight is  one of the best albums by a unique band at the height of their powers. No  one else has sounded like this before or since.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I'm sitting here writing review for books and listening to this CD, and I  really can't resist writing a review for this, as well.  I'm really gonna  rack up my number of keyboard strikes today!<br />This CD is really excellent.   I'm not really a Carly Simon fan, but this CD is convincing me to become  one.  It's only problem is I can't force myself to do homework because the  temptation of listening to this CD is too great!  It's got, &quot;You're So  Vain,&quot; &quot;That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be,&quot;  &quot;Haven't Got Time for the Pain,&quot; and seven others.  Terrific.   Pure class all the way.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed has out done themselves this time. If you like rock you should get  this CD. It has some hard stuff and not so hard stuff. It doesn't have to  get a parental to be a good rock CD, and Creed went by that. the words to  the songs talk about piece. if you are a parent, get this CD for your kid.  MY PARENTS LIKE THIS CD.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck had always been associated with great American Classics. Of Mice and Men is one of these classics it is set in 1930's California on a  small ranch. George who with his best friend Lenny lives the lives of  itinerant workers. Lenny is the loveable retarded giant who because he is  so strong and he can't control his strength when he gets scared he gets  into trouble and it's up to George to get him out of it. It is an excellent  story dealing with the issues of loyalty friendship abandonment and  despair. The book has an excellent array of characters each with their own  story to tell form Slim the man with the most respect on the ranch to  Curley the sneaky angry little man who`s married to a real piece of  Jailbait. A truly magnificent story with excellent dialog character  description and settings.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I am a 28 year old singer and it's a breath of fresh air to hear the  originality of the songs and the deep meaning and sharp whit of the lyrics  of &quot;CAN'T TAKE ME HOME&quot;.  Listening to these songs makes you want  to get up and dance.  The lyrics are a new point of view and are great to  get you thinking!  You simply have to get this CD if you are a true fan of  vocal talent and songwriting!!!! You go, PINK!!
B00003CWNR|5.0|&quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This is the only movie that has ever brought tears  to my eyes while watching it. There are some parts that really tugged at my  heart, but there are also parts that brought a smile to my face. Many  movies adapted from books are just not very good. But this movie, adapted  from a book, is excellent. There are a lot of good messages in it, despite  it's controversial subject matter. It's not just about abortion. There are  so many other elements in this movie. Any person could benefeit from  watching this movie or reading the book. It's a definite  &quot;must-see.&quot;
158234082X|5.0|Three-foot-long worms in swordfish, a careless kitchen crew tossing perhaps open mussles into the pot, blood and lord-knows what else spurting  in the kitchen ... these and other tales about which most of us suspected  but never really knew, abound in Kitchen Confidential. It is a modern-day  Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell's witty intrusion into the  muck-laden three-star kitchens of his era.<br />The book is a funny,  multi-dimensional, personal journey of a talented chef through cuisine's  netherworld. Although some reviewers disliked the frenetic style, it was  resonant with the frenetic pace of restaurant kitchens. Kitchen  Confidential is not only a fast-paced page-turner, but, indeed, it was one  of the few books that I was sorry to see end. Bourdain is a marvelous  writer ... conversational and witty.<br />Amazon tells us that Bourdain has  two novels in the pipeline ... I can't wait until they are formally  published.  I also hope that he gives us a Kitchen Confidential redux ... a  more extended view from the culinary peaks, to complement this book's story  of his climb.
B00003CXGG|4.0|With Jet Li's second US film, Romeo Must Die, US viewers get to see a bit more of why this guy is so famous in Asia.  Following a jailed HK police  officer named Han (Li) on his quest to learn the truth about his brother's  death.  Upon arrival he meets up with Trish (Aaliyah), the love interest.  The film is truly a mixed bag.  the way it is shot and filmed is truly  slick, with a smooth new-style camera and hip visuals.  the opening scenes  are especially well done.  one cannot fault any of the acting, and while  most of the actors play their usual roles, they do it very well, so it's a  safe bet. the music and sound is also well done, with a good mix of  rap/hip-hop and a few moments of techno (the Crystal Method make their  movie debut) and some good original scores.  no problems here. the movie  begins to fall apart with some of its more Matrix-esque fight scenes.   while the X-ray effect is cool, the digital jumps and moves look awful.   the SFX are truly cruddy and jagged, lacking the smooth effects of the  matrix or wire work.  i mean, this is Jet Li, not Keanu Reeves.  while  Keanu did a good job with his kung-fu bits in the matrix, jet li is the  wire work master.  he does not need bad CGI to make him look good.  and  especially not CGI that breaks all the laws of physics. all in all, a fun  ride.  the story is nothing new, though it is well told.  Jet and Aaliyah  are great together, and there are even some moments of great humor through  the movie's dark story.  Russell Wong does a good job as Kai, though he is  a little under used in the movie.  i must say that it will win no awards,  but was a good action flick.  there are several truly cool moments, and for  the most part, one can just turn off their worries and enjoy some decent  fights and acting. but i must say it.  the title is really bad.  it does  not fit the movie at all.
B000021XS0|5.0|YES THATS HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. ITS BEEN OUT FOR OVER HALF A YEAR AND I  STILL HAVENT TIRED OF IT.  THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE FROM START TO FINISH.  PERFECT SONG WRITING, VOCAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND INSTRUMENT PLAYING.  NO WORDS  CAN DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM, BUT I COULD SAY IT IS AN INTENSE AND EMOTIONAL  ALBUM. GREAT ALBUM TO SING ALONG TO.  THIS ALBUM WILL ALWAYS BRING BACK  MEMORIES OF A ROAD TRIP I TOOK WITH THREE OTHER FRIENDS TO SEE DREAM  THEATER IN ORLANDO FLORIDA. WE SANG THE WHOLE ALBUM ON THE WAY THERE. IT  WAS A BLAST! EVEN ROCK FANS WHO ARENT THE BIGGEST TECHNICAL ROCK MUSIC FANS  WOULD ENJOY THIS ALBUM, BUT THIS IS STILL THEIR MOST TECHNICAL ALBUM YET.  BACK TO TRUE FORM AND BEYOND. BEST DREAM THEATER ALBUM YET! CHECK THEM OUT  ON TOUR ITS ALSO THE BEST SHOW OF OUR LIFETIME.
B000002LND|4.0|This is the Madonna as I remembered her from the days when I was really  young. This cd brings me back to the days in which my favorite aunt, a  major Madonna fan, would constantly play the songs that made Madonna who  she is today, and most of those songs are on this cd. <br />This cd is a bit  of Madonna-history, a must have for anyone who is a fan of the queen of  pop.<br />And it's also an excelent start of your collection.
0784011796|5.0|As the opening title scroles down with the number of pi going to infinity,  to say the least, it was awesome!  <br />This is one of those movies that you  get goose bumps watching, not all that scary (like if someone were to scare  you kind of scary) but a different kind of scary.  Like when Max keeps  taking his pills the same way, I can not explain it all that good but it  was scary in its own way.  The goose bumps came from not knowing what a lot  of the movie meant, I have watched it a few times and it never gets old,  you cant figure out why the pattern in pi and the stock market both equal  the same 216 digit number and that is suposedly the true name of god...  well I strongly suggest that you buy or rent this movie it is a very well  made independent film...
0140386335|5.0|The book that thaught me more about my youth then any psychiatrist could ever have taught me. It's perfect, the characters, the story the setting,  everything breathes life. The book, I first read it when I was younger,  captured my imagination, and evolved it. Whenever I read this book, I have  made it a tradition to read it each year at least once, I feel young again,  it makes me long back to the days of my youth.<br />This book is perfect for  children, although not too small, and people who want to feel a fraction of  what childhood should have been.
B00000HYXB|5.0|While Nightfall may not be Guardian's most consistently thrashy metal, it  is perhaps their best ever released.  It combines epic composition, more  harmony, and more variation.  It quite possibly is one of the best albums  that I own.  They are truly the masters of epic lyrics and epic  songwriting.  Here's the rundown.The War of Wrath:  Battle noises,  narrations.  Utterly enjoyable.(9/10)Into the Storm:  BAM!  This track hits  you without warning.  Frantic and blister guitar riffs and  keyboards!(9/10)Lammoth:  Spooky wailing.  Might have to read the book to  understand its purpose.(7/10)Nightfall:  Possibly the best sing-along  chorus on the whole album.(8/10)The Minstrel:  I really dig medieval  fluting!(8/10)The Curse of Feanor:  Some of the best lyrical content on  here.  Maybe not one of the most memorable songs.(7.5/10)Captured:  Cool  narrations.(7/10)Blood Tears:  I don't know what instrument opens this song  up, but it's damn cool!  Great opener and a great song!(8.5/10)Mirror  Mirror:  Another great chorus.  Is that surprising when talking about Blind  Guardian?  I think not.(8/10)Face the Truth:  More  narration.(7/10)Noldor(Dead Winter Reigns):  Best song on here.  Without a  doubt.  The opening is beautiful, very soulful.  Another great chorus!   (10/10)Battle of Sudden Flame:  Another narration.(7.5/10)Time Stands  Still(At the Iron Hill):  The opening sounds like it could be used as music  for a Squaresoft RPG.  Then it blasts into more frantic guitars.  A very  catchy and fun chorus(with flutes!)(9/10)The Dark Elf:  Monestary-esque  chanting!(7.5/10)Thorn:  A heavy track.  Not as frantic as others, but  pretty good.  (8/10)The Eldar:  Piano galore.  Hansi shows his great vocal  harmony on this one.  But, I think I prefer him with some  distortion.(7.5/10)Nom the Wise:  Another narration.(7/10)When Sorrow Sang:   The return of franticness!  More great chorus!(8.5/10)Out on the Water:   Nice, gentle vocals on this one.(8/10)The Steadfast:  Another narration,  instrumental(7/10)A Dark Passage:  A fitting end song.  More fantastic  guitar and keyboards.  Is anyone impressed yet?  I am.(8.5/10)Final  Chapter(Thus Ends...):  Well, you knew it was coming.  The end.  Ending  narration.(8/10)What a majestic, epic offering from Blind Guardian.  We  need more!
0441172717|5.0|This book introduced me to a whole new universe. It's quite starnge that  it was this book that introduced me to the sci-fi genre, I originally  intended on buying a different book, but eventually ended up with Dune. I  loved every word of it, the scene is intense and captures your attention.  It might not be the easiest of books, but it is one of the best books. It  has multiple layers, each time I've read it, I've come across a new layer,  each layer has it's own truth. The characters are interesting and even  though they act like demi-gods they remain human beings with their own  problems they must solve in the bigger hole of their lives. An excelent  book, you can clearly feel the level of inteligence behind it, as can you  can almost sense the universe in which it occurs.<br />A must read for all.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Independence Day era una de las películas mas solicitadas en DVD. Ahora que fue lanzada en este formato puedo decir ampliamente que la espera valio  la pena. Este set de dos discos cuenta con el material para entretenerte  por un buen rato (de hecho hasta cuenta con opciones escondidas). El video  y sonido son excelentes y una caracteristica que estoy seguro va a  complacer bastante a aquellos que hablamos español es que cuenta con  subtitulos en español hasta en los documentales!  Algo raro en un disco  region 1.<br />Sin lugar a dudas ID4 es una película que merece estar en tu  colección de DVD's aún y cuando no seas fan de la misma.
B00000K19E|4.0|Laurence Fishburne's superb performance and the dazzling, artful special effects make this movie an entertaining experience. But as has been  mentioned in previous reviews, this film seems to be a dash of Philip K.  Dick, William Burroughs with some Gibson Tehno-Gnosis thrown into a blender  and voila, The Matrix. Still, as entertaining as the special effects are in  this fun movie, I'll still trade watching Donald O'Connor walk up walls in   &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; anyday over the wall-walking in The Matrix.  Plus, Mr.O'Connor managed his wall walking without benefit of special  effects!
1572522089|5.0|..... Or, to say the least, one of the greatest, doubtlessly. Akira Kurosawa, perhaps best known for his big, daring Samurai epics, once again  provides the audience with a piece that is both rich in human content  whilst technologically empowering with mind numbingly beautiful camera  work, a masterful score and amazing, consequence-showing battle scenes.  Once instance is in which an entire battle (very one-sided, as well) takes  place with no sound effects, rather Toru Takemitsu's ingenius score. <br />The  film itself is the Feudal Japan equivalent of King Lear, with small  subplots and a reverse. The lord distributes his land among his three sons  rather than his three daughters, as is the case with King Lear.<br />I will  not divulge information about the plot, it's very complex and very... um...  see it for yourself. My only regret is that the film's amazing score is not  currently in print.
B00004W5UA|3.0|Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helen Bonham Carter work hard in this film to pull off the next-to-the-impossible: putting Chuck Palahniuk's biting,  scathing satire on film. But at times the actors look emotionally and  physically exhausted, (understandably), and that, along with some of the  sly attempts at humor in the film make the experience less than what it  could be. This is an excellent attempt; but with apologies for sounding too  cliche', this really is one instance where the book is better  than the  movie.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I have listened to every soundtrack album and this one is by far the most  superior.  Ted Neely is superb as are his supporting cast.  If you loved  the movie, buy this soundtrack version.  The London recordings just don't  have the correct lyrical phrasing.  Judas is also a strength of the album  with such power and vigor. I am addicted to this CD! I love Ted Neely!!!!
B00004TWZF|1.0|In the 1980's, I had seen the &quot;original&quot; American cut of this film, and I immediately fell in love with it. This film is one of my all  time favorites. It captured my soul with its deep rich colors, flowing  score, incredible characters and passionate story line. Everything seemed  to work together in perfect harmony.<br />I was elated to hear that it was  finally being released on DVD. When I finally got a chance to watch the  Director's Cut, I was very disappointed. The colors didn't seem as  brilliant. Conti's score was replaced by Eric Serra's, which completely  altered the movie's overall feel. There also appeared to be several clumsy  voice-overs in the beginning of this version. The extra 49 minutes of  additional footage doesn't contribute greatly to the base story line, and  was appropriately cut from the American version.<br />I'm sorry, but this is  not the version of the film that I fell in love with, and it is not one  I'll watch again. I can only hope that the &quot;original&quot; American  version will make it to DVD.
0792844890|5.0|This movie is a very funny spoof of the Star Wars movies.Alon gthey way mel brooks spoofs other movies like &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Indy Jones  movies(most notable is the Temple of Doom).The movie has a all star cast  and some lesser known stars. Spaceballs was Bill Pullmans second entry on  the Internet Movie Database.It also co-star Mel Brooks, Dick Van Patten and  John Candy(R.I.P). <br />As for the DVD itself,MGM did a wonderful job, they  gave the viewers both pan/scan and widescreen.The DVD also have a  commentary from Mel Brooks. I wished that MGM had a did a great job with  this DVD as the James Bond Sets. I hope they go back and add more comments  from the actors and maybe some more stuff left on the cutting room floor.  If you like Mel Brooks,John Candy or Bill Pullman(ID4, Spy Games) then you  will enjoy this movie!Get it on DVD because VHS tapes are going the way of  the dinosaur!That's what I did ! i love my DVD movies more than my VHS!Do  yourself a favor and go out there now and buy this move!If you cannot do  that , then go the library where's it always free (unless you have fines to  pay!)
0399230033|5.0|Probably best suited for 3-6 year-olds, it is a book of excellent illustrations, but few words. The beauty of the book is it provokes  conversation between parents and children as to what is happening on each  page. Your young children will probably never tire of this book.
6305311463|5.0|First the Movie, if you go into this movie looking for something deep and meaningful or looking for reality based drama will be dissapointed.   Period.  If your looking a fun fast-paced ride, you will love it.   <br />Second the DVD, As a fan of DVD extras I luved the DVD, tons of fun.  I  like the extended version, which fleshed out the characters more.  It looks  and sounds good.
B00000BKDY|5.0|I think that this is the finest work Iron Maiden ever created.  The  songwriting, playing, complexity and sophisication of this album is  unparalleled from anything they have done.  From the first track  &quot;Caught Somewhere In Time&quot; to the last &quot;Alexander The  Great&quot; the quality of the album is incredible.  The band moves in more  of a progressive metal direction adding synthesizers very effectively as  texture without diminishing their guitar, bass and vocal attack.  The  dueling guitars from Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are wonderful, as is the  rest of the playing from the band.  The band shows tremendous maturity with  this release.  This album is a masterpiece.
B00003CXFG|1.0|Just off the top of my head, here is a list of impossible or very stupid  things that happen in this mindless rip-off of the Alien series: 1 - a  trinary star system with multiple planets in seemingly stable orbits (at  least they were stable enough for life to develop). 2 - a starship flying  through the emptiness of space on autopilot, happens to end up a stone's  throw away from not one, but TWO large planets.  To top that off, not even  a single beep from the computer to warn the human crew about this dangerous  course. 3 - in one of those great examples of Hollywood's &quot;what can we  do to establish that this is a 'SCI-FI' movie without bothering to do any  tedious research, or actually having to come up with a culture for these  people to live in?&quot; thinking, one of the planets has a ring near its  north pole.  I would be grateful if the writer would explain to me how  something like this happens. 4 - how exactly did these creatures manage to  wipe out every trace of life on the planet, working on a ten-hour day once  every twenty years?  And what have they been living on since then? 5 - how  did a creature that's deathly afraid of the light manage to become a top  player on this world in the first place? ........  Please don't bother  telling me these are minor plot holes.  They aren't.  I won't even go into  the minor plot holes right now.  The physics of the planetary system  basically ARE the premise of the story, so it would have been nice if  somebody had stopped to think about them.  Maybe about fifty years ago this  kind of story would have been accepted as SF, but we know a lot more these  days.  You can't just make things up and say &quot;hey, it's sci-fi.&quot;   This is not a science fiction movie.  It's a horror movie, and a pretty  dumb one too. It uses every one of the standard superpredator movie shots,  included heavy-handed misuse of the Creature POV &quot;isn't it cool how  the creature visualizes differently from a human&quot; shot.All the usual  people die for all the usual reasons, no surprises and no emotional  involvement.
0767803434|5.0|I walked into the movie theatre expecting one of two things: Either a bore fest or a gore fest. I can now say I was more than than happy with the  result. While bordom is nonexistant, the presence of blood is alive and  kicking. Personally I believe that the movie does not contain more than a  few segments of actual &quot;gore&quot;. Each of these instances is easily  anticipated, kept rather minimal, and does not last for more than a few  seconds.     The story line is both simple and complexly woven at the same  time. After watching this action phenomenon you can rack you mind of your  own family dedication.     With wonderful acting (Harrison Ford, Gary  Oldman, Glen Close, and Liesel Matthews), astounding special affects, and  suspense thick enough to cut with a knife this film can easily become a  personal favorite.     My advice: A must see. Bring the family, but leave  the any small children at home. Remember, you may want to check this film  out first. There are scenes which can be debated over violence matters.
B000001GQT|5.0|Karajan was an unsurpassed Straussian; luckily for us, he made many  recordings of Strauss's music.  This 1974 Also sprach Zarathustra is (I  think) his 2nd of three - one from 1959 on Decca Legends and another from  the 1980's, on DG's Karajan Gold series.  This one is a masterful reading  of this large tone poem.  Karajan understands everything about this complex  work.  He benefits from the Berlin Philharmonic's superb, rich, refined  tone.  The famous introduction is superbly played, with sharp, firm timpani  strokes, the divided strings in the second section are gorgeous and the  playing throughout is exemplary.  Michel Schwalbé contributes an excellent,  if occasionally raw-toned, violin solo in the waltz section.<br />The two  other tone poems are equally good.  Till Eulenspiegel is witty, lively,  exciting and endearing, and Don Juan's thrilling main theme is given  lift-off by the superb Berlin strings.  Salome's dance is superb, too.  The  sound is good, though violins at the top of the range can sometimes develop  a shrill edge.  The playing time is extremely generous (over 79 minutes)  and the price tag is moderate.  A real bargain.
0140185232|5.0|I particularly related to Sophie in the book and her loss of a child. It  must have been hard for her to have that loss acknowledged at that time  after the war, when so many had lost sons and loved ones. This book is  really helpful for understanding the impact of trauma on a life and how  different personalities have different ways of reacting to trauma.  This is  a non-judgemental book. You judge or not, for yourself.
B0000256KE|5.0|&quot;There's a new sensation&quot; croons Bryan Ferry as the singer and  chamberlain of ROXY MUSIC, and this album is, indeed, &quot;a fabulous  creation.&quot;  This is one of my favourite albums.  The fast songs, DO  THE STRAND and EDITIONS OF YOU, have a great beat and are easy to dance to.   Ferry evokes siren songs of intense longing with BEAUTY QUEEN and GREY  LAGOONS. The remaining songs are of life and death, neither of which is to  be taken seriously.  A strength of Ferry's delivery is that he appears to  be adamant about the truth of which he speaks -- no matter how ludicrous.   He betrays not even a wink, which only makes it more compelling and  entertaining..  The band supporting all of this super-serious nonsense are  clever in their own right.  The saxophone and oboe of Andrew Mackay are  everywhere.  One time humourous another seductive.  It is Mackey who stands  out on a second listening.  Then, a little farther back, is the guitar of  Phil Manzanera, the link between Ferry and Eno.  It is Eno who is  subliminally hiding in the shadows.  The kind of instrumentation you don't  notice till it has departed.  Altogether, Glam Rock at its best.  Go ahead,  take Amanda for a spin.  She's the kind of girl who only leaves you  guessing, but don't ask why.
0449002632|1.0|For somebody that has read James A. Michener's great Novels, say  &quot;Texas&quot; or &quot;Alaska&quot;, Rutherfurd's stile of telling the  story about London is familiar. The fates of families are interwoven with  the course of history. However, compared to Michener, Rutherfurd is a weak  narrator. The characters are flat and the familiy resemblances ridiculous.  Over the course of 2000 years, all male members of one family have a white  streak of hair on their forehead, while members of one other family speak  always the truth, or are red-headed, etc. The whole story is packed with  cliches. The course of the story often is so unbelievable as to be funny.  As for historic accuracy, important events are touched, but never explained  in any detail or accuracy. Any 150 page schoolbook about English history  provides the reader with more information. I read the first 400 pages or so  and then gave up. It's just too boring. If you like this way of writing  about history, then go for one of Michener's books. He does the same thing,  but much better.
B00004T37H|5.0|For all those viewers out there, this is an excellent movie.  It is filled to the rim with beautifully animated characters, a broad and intriguing plot, and many mythical and legendary creatures and items from fuedal Japan  that would make any Miyazaki fan flip their lid.        I, for one, have  been an anime fan for a while now, and this is a supurb example of the  beauty of Japanese animation.  The battle scenes took my breath away, and  the mystery of who the true &quot;bad guy&quot; was brought me to the edge  of my seat.  Please take my advice and consider this movie to be one of the  classics!
0345403959|5.0|My sister first introduced me to the Belgariad when I was 7. I had often  laughed at her for sitting for weeks on end, burried in those books... I  finaly found out why. Finding myself instantainiously  gripped by the  story, and all the wonderful characters, such as; (Bel)Garion, Polgara,  Belgarath... and so on and so on... I ended up not beeing able to go  anywhere without my precious books... which is the main reason why I have  had to replace them each about 4 times...I simply read them to  pieces...<br />One day, shopping with my parents, I suddently saw this book. I  spent the rest of the day hopping around it, hoping my parents would buy  it...and at last they did.<br />Now, I have made it my life goal to buy the  whole series, as I havent read the Malloreon yet. I am looking forward to  once again be gripped by the tale... to once again let the thoughts flow...  to immagine beeing that little boy in Sendaria...suddently dragged off to  the end of the world and back...in search of a stone... <br />I can't  wait.<br />A word of warning though, Once you have read one book, YOU HAVE TO  READ THEM ALL! RESISTENCE IS FUTILE! Kind regards      Yago

Anyways I nearly blew a brain vesal when I found out this was coming out.  Arnold is the King, and I can't wait to hear him try and do a commentary.  <br />This disk is packed which extra's. no all they need to do is bring out  special editions of total recall, predator, running man and the rest of his  ass kicking movies.<br />That's it, I'm going now to go buy this film.  <br />Peace OUt  GO SUNS!
0060196122|1.0|I really, really, really (I could add infinite &quot;realys&quot;) dont  see what the big deal is with Mr Coelho. I am close to finish this second  book of his , after reading the terribly disapointing &quot;the  Alchemist&quot; and a I stronlgy beleive that this is a very mediocre book,  with very poor ideas that simply are not developed to the optimum. And this  doesn't do justice to his characters. I was hoping that Coehlo could add to  the list of talented Latin writters such as Borges  and Garcia Marces.  Unfortunatly looks like even Alliente does it better than him.<br />His  funtametalistic attitude becomes ennoying here, although is coverd better  than in &quot;the Alchemist&quot; and his obsession with destiny still  makes his work as animaginative and predictable as ever.<br />Krima
B000002OZY|5.0|I would give this record five hundred stars if I could, but only five are  possible. It is by far the best production made by The Who, and one of the  finest rock albums ever.<br />By using the figure of a young kid who suffers a  lot of penures and becomes deaf, dumb, and blind, The Who go to the deepest  level to study the human quest for higher knowledge, more or less in the  spirit of Nietzsche's &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;.<br />Every feature  in this album is valuable: the music, the words, the spiritual content, the  cover, the inside illustrations, etc.<br />If you don't know it you have been  missing a lot of musical joy.
B00004TL21|5.0|Whether you like the Deftones or not, you have to give them credit for trying something new and different. When &quot;Around The Far&quot; came  out a few years back, rock music was about Jewel and The Wallflowers. And  if they released that album today, they would be as popular as KoRn.  Instead, the Deftones make a softer more complex album that could have  alienated their audience of Adidas wearing dreadlocked guys filled with  hormones and rage. Most of them aren't gonna understand the Radiohead  influence on &quot;White Pony&quot;. They also could've fallen flat because  the mainstream isn't gonna appreciate the quirkiness of  &quot;Teenager&quot; or why &quot;there's some weird chick screaming in  Knife Party&quot;. Simply said, give them credit for making &quot;White  Pony&quot; instead of keeping things obvious. The result? &quot;White  Pony&quot; is a near flawless album. Both Chino's voice and lyrics are his  best yet. The lyrics on &quot;White Pony&quot; can be funny (&quot;Street  Carp&quot;), poetic (uh, well, most of the songs showcase that), and  secretive (who knows what Chino was talking about on &quot;Knife  Party&quot;). In the opener, &quot;Feiticeira&quot;, Chino sings about  being abducted. With it's somewhat heavy guitar riff, you'd expect to hear  him whine (like Papa Roach), act like a moron (like Limp Bizkit), attempt  to be &quot;deep&quot; (like Creed), or something meaningless like every  other rock band out there. But no, this is Chino Moreno, the only (yes,  only) singer-songwriter who will be remembered during the pathetic  (c)rap/metal era. Both &quot;Digital Bath&quot; and &quot;RX Queen&quot;  have a slight futuristic feel to them, yet come off seductive, too.  &quot;Change (In The House Of Flies)&quot; is beautiful, poetic, catchy,  and mesmerizing. It's the best Rock single this year, too. As great as it  is though, it (or any other song) is no match for &quot;Knife Party&quot;.  It does have a heavy vibe to it, but it's not really mosh-pit material.  Chino's voice is powerful, yet gentle. When Rodleen's voice kicks in the  song dives into another dimension, or so it seems. One can't forget  &quot;Passenger&quot; which features Maynard James Keenan either. It sounds  exactly like a Tool song, it's dark, lush, powerful, and has a Prog-Rock  vibe. Unfortunately, the Deftones also decided to through in a couple of  heavy songs just to show they haven't sold out or anything (not that I'd  accuse them of doing so, mind you). &quot;Korea&quot; is complete filler  and &quot;Elite&quot; is boring. Both songs sound forced, they sound heavy  just for the sake of being heavy. Despite those two songs, this is an  amazing album that should be heard by modern Rock fans everywhere. As  Rolling Stone said, this is a classic Alternative album.
B000002OX7|4.0|The Who definitely gained much maturity in making &quot;Tommy&quot; (their  best work by far), and they show it in this record, however you will miss  the great genius and insight that characterizes that opera-rock.<br />The  record can be regarded as &quot;good&quot; because it includes some  everlasting classics like &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;, &quot;Behind blue  eyes&quot;, and &quot;Won't get fooled again&quot;, besides  &quot;Bargain&quot; and &quot;Going mobile&quot;, but the other songs do  not share the same high quality.<br />Won't regret to buy it, but there are  better Who productions.
B000005RXH|4.0|This album sheds some light on Supertramp's early musical endeavours.  Their sound is still raw and bold. Hodgson is still experimenting with his  vocal abilities and so is the rest of the band. This album, along with  Supertramp(another early album), are essential to any Supertramp fan who  likes to know more about how the group had developed its unique sound.  Definitely not for a beginner though. If you've never heard Supertramp,  you'd better start with Even In The Quietest Moments or Crime Of The  Century.
6305265666|5.0|This is a major chick flick - the true (non-magical, no fairies or glass slippers) story of Cinderalla (no, it's not a true story, the narrator just  claims it's true when telling the story to some other people in the  movie)<br />It's a chick flick, it has romance, it has no nudity, practically  no violence, people talk kind of funny and the star is Drew Barrymore. It's  both realistic and plausible (like i said, no fairies or magic pumpkins or  such things) And yet, for reasons i can't explain, this movie is actually  good. It's not boring, not sappy, not hard to understand and Drew Barrymore  actually does a good job. i'm not sure what to say. i feel like i'm selling  out guy-dom here, but it really is a good movie
0385493622|5.0|The history of the solution to the theorem is a history not only of  mathematics, but of politics, art, and literature--the small book is an  epic that spans from the ancient Egyptians, across deserts and oceans--it's  characters are painters, musicians, revolutionaries and poets--<br />It may be  that what some artists (da Vinci, Dante, James Joyce, Charles Wright, Jorie  Graham) and some physicists have suspected all along is true--there is a  nexus--a unified field where mathematics, art, poetry, science, geology,  astronomy not only *meet* but *become* one another.<br />If its true, and  various experiments, theorems, books, and poems are the clues to that  place, then I guess this theorem is one clue--this book is another--
079073124X|3.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  I watch just about every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that comes out.  I've even bought his Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. With  truly Olympian fortitude, I even sat through &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;  with my kid.  I'm a fan.  There, I've said it.<br />That's why it grieves me  to pan this movie.  This flick asks you to suspend disbelief just a little  too much.  Well, A LOT too much, truth be told.<br />Arnold plays a U.S.  Marshall, who works alone.  His job description is more that of a special  operations soldier, who seems to leave very few laws unbroken.  <br />At the  very beginning of the movie, for instance, Arnold whooshes into the house  of a mobster in the Witness Protection Program who is about to have his  tongue cut off by bad guys. Arnold is alone, dressed in black, and  well-armed.  He kills two bad guys in self-defense, and executes another on  the front lawn. Prior to arriving here, he has stopped by the morgue and  stolen two corpses.<br />What else does he do?  He hides the heroine, played  by Vanessa Williams, in New York City, and as he's leaving, casually hands  her pistol and says, &quot;All you have to do is pull the trigger.&quot;   Yeah, right!  NO COP would EVER do this!  I don't know how many laws he  broke there, but it had to be at least a few.<br />Throughout the movie, he  shoots first and asks questions later, if he asks them at all.  He is  mistaken for &quot;mole,&quot; and has hordes of federal agents pursuing  him.  He never questions whether they are all genuinely corrupt, or if are  following orders, believing him to be a bona fide suspect; he happily blows  them all away.  And at the end of the movie...well, I'll let you see that  and judge the believability of it for yourself.<br />This movie does have some  funny lines, and the scene in the zoo with the marauding alligators is  great.  How much you enjoy this movie will depend largely on how easy it is  for you to overlook the fact that a federal agent commits felony after  felony after felony, apparently oblivious to the law.
B000002IHU|5.0|This isn't my favorite Ratt album, but it still kicks tho.  Plus, it has  my favorite hard-rockin Ratt tune on it, &quot;You're in Love&quot;.  By  the time that Detonator came out, they had achieved full musical maturity.
6303985467|5.0|After a game of drag-racing across a bridge, a car containing three women plunges into deep water and sinks, only one of its occupants apparently  surviving.  From then on the survivor finds herself cut off from the rest  of the world.  The scenes in which she is ignored by everybody around her  are marvellously eerie.  Imagine not knowing you've died, walking around as  a ghost and being unable to understand why nobody can see or hear you.  An  all-time classic, this is living proof that imagination and style are more  important in films than money and special effects.  The scenery is  wonderfully sinister and the abandoned funfair provides a powerful image.   Also noteworthy is Harvey's dark-suited ghoul, who, with his menacingly  calm intent and glinting-eyed smile, dominates his every scene and is a far  more nightmarish figure than the likes of Freddy and Jason.  The  soundtrack, consisting of organ music, is suitably atmospheric, and the  whole thing has a very artistic feel to it, very surreal.  Images from this  film really do haunt you.
B000002J03|5.0|Ever hear someone describe an album as &quot;seamless&quot; (the Beatle's  Abbey Road is a usual candidate)?  Do you know what that means? I didn't  either, until I heard this.<br />The songs flow into each other as though by a  perverse kind of logic; slow gears, fast gears, up, down, you hardly notice  the track changes unless you're watching the counter on your stereo. Only  the bookends, the thrashing &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and the smooth  &quot;Bring it on home&quot; (which makes not completely invalid a freind's  contention that Zep, and not the Stones, are the masters of blues) remove  themselves from the continuum sufficiently to &quot;stand out&quot; in any  way.<br />I have many freinds of varied, often clashing musical tastes, but  the one band we all agree on is Led Zeppelin. Zep was a chameleon, refusing  to be any other than what they wanted at that particular millisecond. II  doesn't have my favorite Zeppelin song. That honor belongs to the beautiful  &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (I believe it to be the perfect Zeppelin song, if  not the perfect rock song) from IV, but II gets the extra half-star because  of it's cohesive groove.
B000000W5P|4.0|It's not gonna be easy to replace &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; in my heart, but this here comes close.  It just goes to show you that you shouldn't  make a &quot;dinosaur&quot; mad.  Sure, this was probably inspired by the  demons of disco and the accusations of punk, but what makes this album  truly work is that it doesn't really acknowledge it. The album subjugates  that horrible white man's mutilation of funk known as disco to the Stones  steaming sound (you can't really dance to &quot;Miss You&quot;, at least,  not like John Travolta), and while it's energy-level is a rejoinder to the  angry young toughs who said the Stones were finished, at no point do the  Stones try to be the Sex Pistols. &quot;Shattered&quot; is not a punk song,  but it's good nonetheless. The high point is &quot;Respectable&quot;, an  old-school blues-rip in the Chuck Berry tradition that says &quot;Hey, this  is all just playing guitars to a fast drum beat, boys&quot;.<br />The only  song I would do without is &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot;, just because it's  obviously demonstrating how much time they'd spent in Studio 54 and away  from the blues-gospel games they were playing at the beginning of the  decade (that, and it's just really annoying). But as an album that captures  the thrill of decadence as well as it's down side, this one has few rivals.
0887308589|5.0|Sittine in my cubicle, I have been watching the world with the curiousity  to deliver my due to the organization. And like many many people I find  similar charecters as Scott described in this shockingly realistic work.  Most horrifying experience for me is finding some charecters in me at  times. For sceptics this may look like a over sinical work but, to me this  looks like an inspirational work describing how we should not be.
B000002KIE|4.0|I'm new to this concept of &quot;Punk&quot;.  I've liked (and still like) Green Day, but recognize that for all their energy they're somewhat empty.  I've listened to the Ramones, and while I admire the sharp simplicity of  their tunes, only rarely do I find songwriting abilities to match them (and  anyway that sparseness wasn't their idea--it was the Velvet Underground's,  who seem to me to be the spiritual forefathers of punk more than the Who or  the Stones).  I've heard the Clash, and they were on to something, but I'm  not sure what.<br />But Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, this  has a fair argument of being the definitive Punk Album. The guitars can cut  steel, the tempo never lets up, the lyrics are incendiary and Rotten's  delivery of them stops just short of being annoying. I even like the two  leadoff songs that Vicious was in on.  Best moments include the two famous  songs (&quot;Anarchy&quot;, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;), the monotone  Rotten brings out at the end of &quot;Problems&quot;, and the almost-goofy  &quot;EMI&quot;.<br />Punk seemd to wallow and die in the makeup-laden 80's,  only to go underground and then explode in the blistering rock of Nirvana's  magnum opus &quot;Nevermind&quot; (I think I just figured out why I liked  them and not any of the other grunge acts) and the occasional Beastie Boys  riff.  But we who would have our rock hard and DJ-free would do well to  have this bad boy in our CD collection, an everlasting excuse to shout from  the tabletops or throw a beer bottle through the window.
B000000OU0|5.0|This is a good album (my second Eagles album), but I do not like it as  much as the bestselling &quot;Their greatest hits&quot;, each and every  song that is featured on both of those albums, the version that is on the  greatest hits album seems better and slightly more alive, to me. But there  are other good songs on here: Hotel California, Get over it, New York  Minute, Learn to be Still and Wasted Time are all really good songs that  make this a good purchase. Love will keep us alive and I can't tell you why  are the only two songs that I don't really enjoy listening to, on this  Album... but that is not to say that some of my friends don't enjoy them..  I recommend this Album, but not as much as I recommend &quot;their greatest  hits&quot;.
B00002Z88D|4.0|First, an admission of shame. I was the perfect demographic to be a Metallica fan back in the &quot;Black Album&quot; days, but I wasn't.  I  saw long hair, and said to myself &quot;hair band&quot;.  Yes, I equated  Metallica with Poison. I was a kid, and sick of MTV. Please forgive  me.<br />After developing an interest in classic rock, I started sniffing  around to see what bands from our era have had the legs to survive, grow,  and move.  Three bands came to mind: R.E.M. (which I also got over an  origonal dislike of), the Beastie Boys (ain't nobody like 'em. Period.),  and finally, Metallica.<br />And so, in the cheating manner of all new fans,  I grabbed the greatest hits collection. Cut me some slack, it has two new  songs and the Symphony Orchestra angle is quite a hook for someone who digs  classical as much as I do. It really does work. The orchestra lifts and  sustains the band, never overpowers them except once during the  up-tempo-switch on &quot;One&quot;, which is a minor cavil and doesn't ruin  the song even remotely. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is made epic,  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; downright apocalyptic. Overall, a fascinating  experiment, one which sadly, very few so-called rock bands today have the  chops to even attempt.<br />And just to make sure I have a foot in all camps,  I think I'll aquire &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot;, &quot;ReLoad&quot;, and  &quot;And Justice For All...&quot;. Then we'll see which Metallica is my  Metallica.
6305307261|1.0|I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but this movie was just plain old boring. For gods sake, King Tut's dead and rotting corpse has more life in  it than this movie does. I fell asleep one night while trying to watch this  movie (hey my cable was out)and would you belive miracle upon miracle this  movie was still on when i got up the next day. I have had root canals that  have taken less time, and at least I got a ballon when i left the doctors  office.<br />         Now don't get me wrong, I love horror films, but come  on, this is ridiculous. I was praying for some kind of action in this  movie, but lo and behold did i get any no. WINNIE The POOH's GREAT  ADVENTURE had more action in it than this movie did. During the month that  it actually took me to watch this film ( hey you try watching this movie in  one sitting)I dont think i've ever contempleted throwing my dvd player out  the window so many times.<br />         Granted, the movie does have a  beautiful visual appeal, but to be very honest I would much rather rent or  buy a Hammer Horror film (ie. Horror Of Dracula or Dracula Has Risen From  The Grave ) if that was all i was interested in. Lucily for me I dont have  to drive to a stake through a vampires heart, all I have to do get rid of  Nosferatu is click my dvd player off.
B000002UA0|4.0|Give up your Sgt. Pepper's fetish.<br />Let go of your Door's debut LP.<br />The Byrds? Poseurs. The Stones &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot;? Not on par by a  long shot. The Who? Mere songbirds.<br />THIS is psychedelia.<br />It doesn't  make sense. It's not supposed to make sense. What does &quot;Take Up Thy  Stethoscope and Walk&quot; mean? Does it matter? No. Has there ever been a  song as willfully silly as &quot;Bike&quot; that didn't appear on a Monty  Python collection? Probably not. It's more than acid and flowers, it's the  embracing of the non-linear, the surreal.<br />As others have pointed out, the  soul of this album is the intrumental &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;,  but that only emphasizes my point, starting with as hard a rock riff as  Floyd ever crushed out, leading us through the stars only to bring us back  to the beginning, only we don't hear it the same way.  Take from it what  you will...
0385486804|4.0|After having had this book for some time, I finally set out to make it  part of my summer 2000 reading schedule. I am drawn to books of the  northern wilderness, which was the initial attraction to this one. I'll  state up front that I have not read anything else by Krakauer, so I cannot  draw any comparisons as other reviewers have done.<br />Krakauer tells the  tale effectively. He uses an intelligent vocabulary balanced with a  conversational writing style. He easily held my attention as the facts  unfolded throughout, employing logic and drawing inferences to fill in many  questions that remain. He obviously did his research on the central  character, Christopher McCandless, and must have invested countless  quantities of money and time to gather accurate information. With so many  of the facts of this distressing story remaining obscured probably forever,  his assumptions and extrapolations about Chris' actual fate are posed as  theories rather than as irreproachable conclusions. I appreciate this  aspect of Krakauer's account. <br />Hats off also to the McCandless family,  since Krakauer relied upon them not only for information about their son,  tragically lost, but also for their courage in allowing many private family  issues to be exposed in support of telling the story as thoroughly as  possible. Chris' father, mother, and sister are true heroes in my eyes.   <br />I have some degree of understanding of Chris and his northerly  wanderlust, and also an appreciation for the not-so-uncommon desire to  conquer the wilderness. What concerns me, however, is the apparent  arrogance of the central character. According to the author's account,  Chris seemed to possess an intermittent wariness about his closest  acquaintances, along with outright rejection of others who cared for him  much more than he cared for them. He treated some important people who  crossed his path as disposable. But probably Chris's most crucial  deficiency was the flippant and over-confident approach towards the actual  work of survival in the wilderness. He even seemed a bit contemptuous  toward relevant learning despite his quality education and intelligence. He  especially needed important knowlege about survival in the wilds of the  north. However, he apparently rebuffed all attempts from others to assist  him in his quest. I have spent considerable time in the extreme north of  B.C. (an area not entirely dissimilar to Alaska): it is ridiculous,  misguided, and presumptuous to embark on such an adventure with the dearth  of equipment, supplies, and knowledge as did Chris. I would want to know  everything possible about how to survive such a life and death endeavor.  Indeed, I feel a strange combination of sadness and anger as I reflect on  Chris's unfortunate departure. Was his death ultimately caused by youthful  innocence or arrogant ignorance? It is a question I cannot answer and I  commend Krakauer for his deft ability to stimulate thought in the reader  rather than provide tidy little assumptive answers.<br />My only complaint:  the personal reflective chapter towards the end of the book. I understand  why Krakauer included it (personal connections with the need for adventure,  context, struggles with nature, etc.), but for me it was irrelevant and it  de-railed the flow of the story.<br />Perhaps we can learn from Christopher  McCandless' experience, not in any attempt to qualify him as a martyr or to  label him a fool. I have thought about how my appreciation for the north  has changed, how families need to be close, the requirement to really  listen to and understand people, and countless other themes which have been  tweaked by Jon Krakauer's writing about Chris' misadventure. I recommend  this book highly.
B000002I25|3.0|(actually, 3-1/2 stars) I dig the Doors overall aesthetic, but sometimes I wonder about their execution (And whether organs should ever be a solo  instrument). They had a habit of throwing in brilliant stuff with  throwaways, but that doesn't make this debut opus any less listenable.<br />My  faves are the Oedipal madness of &quot;The End&quot; and their cover of  &quot;Alabama Song/Whiskey Bar&quot;. In fact, it was when I discovered  that that cover was a Doors song that I decided to by this album.  I was  not disappointed.  The full song sounds like a circus gone mad, and the  refrain &quot;Oh, don't ask why,&quot; sets a strange premonition over the  rest of the band's career.  They're best songs were meant to be  experienced, not analyzed, and the rest (like &quot;Back Door Man&quot;  which feels like a retread), hey, that's the way creativity works,  man...don't ask, just freak freely...
6303159966|5.0|If I had read the book first I would have probably known what I was in for when I sat down to watch this movie.  I have a deeply rooted fear of  confined spaces and possibly an even bigger fear of being eaten.  So  basically, this movie scared me to no end!  Now I have to admit much of the  story (and acting) moved along fairly slowly, until the mother and son were  stuck in the middle of nowhere, in a station wagon, with a large, rabid  Saint Bernard attempting to get inside!  It was this portion of the movie  that got my skin crawling!  When Cujo starts attacking the car and you just  get this feeling that nobody is getting out of there alive, that's good  Horror entertainment!  Strangely enough I never felt that Cujo should die  or that he was a &quot;monster&quot;.  I just kept thinking that all of us  are victims of circumstance, and not one of us has control over the events  in our lives.  That concept alone is terrifying!  The acting of the mother  and son were perfect and I'd really like to know how they got the dog who  played Cujo to act so mean!  To me, a claustraphobe, this was one nightmare  of a movie.  If I had been younger I would have probably developed a  serious fear of dogs to boot.  But dogs are great, as long as you make sure  they've had their shots!  You don't want your dog going Cujo on you, now  do you!  One of the scariest movies I've ever seen!
0790733897|1.0|Bullitt is an insanely boring movie. Boring, boring, boring.<br />I remembered watching parts of it -- including the famous car chase -- when I  was a kid, and not liking it, and now that I'm older, with a better  appreciation of classic cinema, I thought I would give it another  try.<br />Big mistake. This film brings new meaning to the word dull. If you  enjoy watching long stretches of bland actors doing absolutely nothing of  interest, then this movie is for you. If interesting to you is watching  five minutes of Steve McQueen driving home from the hospital, parallel  parking, locking his car, walking across the street, buying some vegetables  and TV dinners, walking down the sidewalk, climbing up the stairs to his  apartment, etc ad infinitum... then don't let me stand in your way. But if  you have a pulse, and expect one from your movies, don't touch this one  with a ten-foot pole.<br />The only people I can see enjoying this are those  who find the circa-1968 San Francisco locations inherently interesting --  and they are really only put to good use during that car chase -- or those  who buy into the Steve McQueen mystique. Well, I don't. McQueen has the  charisma of a sack of doorknobs. If his personality is best displayed here  in this, his most famous role, then I have zero desire to ever see another  one of his leading roles. He hasn't seemed quite so spectacularly  irritating in ensemble films (The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape), but  as a star he's a dud.<br />And about that car chase: BORING!  I can't even  imagine it being of interest to 1968 audiences, when such extended car  chases were still novelties, and for audiences of today -- they have more  exciting chases on Touched by an Angel. Best car chase ever? Ridiculous.  It's as dull as the rest of this interminable film. If you want to see a  real car chase, watch Ronin.<br />Bullitt is a relic. Its rep is built on the  cult of McQueen. It is utterly lacking in appeal.
B000001BZT|3.0|Steve Earle is essentially a roots-rocker, and Copperhead Road is recorded  in Memphis with special guests The Pogues and Telluride. So what is the  result of this concoction of styles and genres? Well, sort of an  Irish-country-rock-folk-album. Sounds confusing, and it is. Compositions  such as `Copperhead Road' and Back To The Wall' suffer from \\"too many cooks  spoiling the chocolate mousse.\\" You would think that with all these  outstanding musicians hanging around the recording studio, the overall  result would be rousing and eclectic - not so. `Snake Oil' is a monotonous  boggie, and the result of the shuffle `Johnny Come Lately' is  humdrum.<br />All is not so drab. For my money, Steve Earle is a first-rate  lyricist and balladeer. The mid-tempo `Waiting on You' is compassionate and  sensitive. `Once You Love' is poignant, and the duet with the delightful  Maria McKee is just about as sentimental and moving as rock gets. Earle  deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of roots-rock, but this time, he  bites off more than a mouthful.<br />Technical Note: Copperhead Road is a DDD  recording. The sound quality raises the hair on the back of my neck.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Not much things to say but many things to feel<br />As you hit the bottom of the sea you finally realize that the only sincerely sound is the  heartbeat<br />See you at Amorgos...<br />Ps: The director's cut dvd version is  simply the only way to enjoy the movie
B00000HYXB|4.0|until I listened to it a few times. This is a very tight, beautiful  effort...Sadly, it is the Queen-like choruses that keep this CD from being  perfect.
0783227434|5.0|OK, here it is.  For those of you looking for a superb quality version of Army Of Darkness on DVD, buy the Universal Pictures version.  It only  includes Bios of Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Raimi, Production  Notes, and the Theatrical Trailer as bonus material, but the sound and  picture quality of the film are 100 times better than the horrible Anchor  Bay version (either the director's cut or theatrical). Take it from someone  who owns every version available, the Universal DVD is the one you want if  good quality is your thing (I know it's mine).  The only good thing on the  Anchor Bay version are the extras: audio commentary (on director's cut  version which has added scenes that look even worse than the regular film  transfer.  That's right, even the normal parts look bad on this DVD  compared to Universal), a short making of featurette (on the Anchor Bay  theatrical DVD) hosted by Bruce Campbell, and a film/storyboard feature on  the Director's Cut that's interesting.  People upset that the trailer isn't  on the Director's Cut should know that's because when it was a 2 Disc Set  the trailer was put on the Theatrical Disc (which is still available as a  single now).  When I heard a special edition of Army Of Darkness was coming  out I assumed it would be released by Universal Pictures.  Their  Collector's Edition DVD's are very impressive.  I'll even tell you that  when I bought the Anchor Bay version I took it back because I thought it  was defective (it appeared as if their were blemishes on the disc, in fact  every copy I've seen had these blemishes on them) only to find out that  they were all like that.  Anyone defending Anchor Bay should know that  Elite Entertainment released the Special Edition of the first Evil Dead  movie and it looks great.  So if the first film can look that good there's  no excuse why 'Army couldn't recieve the same wonderful treatment,  regardless that it's a bigger movie with more locations, which means more  work creating a decent transfer.  Let me add that Evil Dead 2 is being  rereleased by Anchor Bay as a Special Edition, so lets just hope and pray  they do a better job with Part 2 than they did with Part 3.  Oh, and  Universal, if you're listening, I'm sure I speak for every Army Of Darkness  fan when I say we'd love if you'd release your own Collector's Edition DVD  of this great movie and show the little guy (Anchor Bay) how real Special  Edition's are made.  (&quot;Give Me Some Sugar Baby!&quot;)        5 Stars  for The Universal Pictures DVD        1 Star for The Anchor Bay Versions  (because of the extras)
B00003CWPR|5.0|&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an astoundingly good film, perhaps the victim of too much hype, too much negative criticism, and perhaps the main  stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. With &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;,  Stanley Kubrick has created an atmospheric, haunting, and distubing piece  that stays with the viewer long after the credits roll. The main gripe with  the film, which is completely unfounded, seems to be that the film is  boring, and takes way too long to develop certain scenes, but guess what,  this is Stanley Kubrick, not James Cameron. Kubrick films his scenes in a  way that is meticulous and time-consuming; the end result is a very  precise, dramatic, and realistic scene in which the viewer feels a part of  every word of dialogue. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; also may be victimized  by the new direction Tom Cruise is taking in his career. For those that saw  this film in the theater simply because Cruise starred in it, I know you  were disappointed, because &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; or &quot;Top  Gun&quot;, this movie ain't. Cruise has branched out into more dramatic  roles recently, such as in this film and in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, and many  American moviegoers can't seem to handle it. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;  forces the viewer to think, and raises several questions: Is Cruise's  descent into the sexual underworld really a dream? Is he imagining  everything? Are thoughts and fantasies actually more dangerous than real  physical encounters? &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is not standard Saturday  Blockbuster night entertainment, but for those of you who prefer substance  over style, and are fans of Kubrick's other works, then &quot;Eyes Wide  Shut&quot; is for you.
B00003CWTH|1.0|I have a hard time figuring out the recent appointment to sainthood of Paul Thomas Anderson by seemingly everyone in Hollywood. The guy is just  not that talented. First, he brought us a completely overrated stinker of a  movie starring a former rapper-turned-serious actor, Mark Wahlberg, in  &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, and now comes &quot;Magnolia&quot;, a totally  ridiculous piece of garbage that uses sheer length to hide the fact that  the movie plain sucks. Audiences and critics alike see that the film lasts  over 3 hours and think, &quot;Oh wow, a 3 hour movie, that's gotta be good.  There has to be a lot in it for it to last 3 hours!&quot; Well, guess what,  there's not. I've never seen a movie last so long in which absolutely  nothing happens. The performances are so over-the-top its almost comedic,  especially the Julianne Moore character, and of course, the Tom Cruise  character, who blasts the audience with so much profanity, it's not even  cool. PT Anderson treats the audience like they're stupid, and I'm  offended! The ending is perhaps the most ridiculous part of the entire  film, as it throws so much blatant symbolism in the audience's face, it's  sickening. Hey, PT, don't treat your audiences like they're 3 years old. We  could figure out a little more subtle symbolism! Avoid this movie at all  costs...a laughable, childish waste of 3 hours of your time.
0805017305|5.0|I first read this book as a teenager (many years ago). In those days all I  knew about Indians was what saw on TV and Indians were  shown as  bloodthirsty, fightening savages. After reading this book I realised how  wrong that portrayal was.  I then began to look at the way Aborigines had  been portrayed in Australia . It proved to be very similar to the way  Indians had been portrayed and it was equally as wrong. I cannot point my  finger and say look at the bad things the Americans did. I carry the shame  that my own ancestors almost completely wiped out the Tasmanian Aborigines.  And in other places of the world similar things happened (and are still  happening).  So much of history needs to be rewritten and this book has at  least done that.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is the most expensive album I own. The vinyl LP, the cassette, the US CD, and the UK CD: that's about a hundred bucks. What the heck -  it's worth it. Paul and John are still pretty good pals and fairly  democrat. Paul does five lullabies, and John does five \\"out of his mind on  lysergic acid\\" rockers. Every post-sixty-six band has attempted to rival  his floating-in-outerspace `She Said She Said,' and the trippy  effects-filled `Tomorrow Never Knows.' None have succeeded. Paul is as cute  and cuddly as one of those little furbie toys. For mushy melodies, he's  number one, numero uno, the King of Puppy Love Pop: `For No One' is an  inspiration for suicide. George adds a creative fringe to Revolver with  three Indian Transcendental Maharishi sitar Yogi Bear ragas. `Love You Too'  isn't a Beatles' song, or even a composition from planet Earth: it sounds  like something from Nirvana (no, not the band). I've never ranked George as  Beatle number three. Without his exploration, the Beatles might still be  holding your hand.<br />For straight-up guitar music, Revolver is a letdown.  Paul and George (Martin) emphasize pianos, strings and brass (no joke)  pretty heavy. Stellar moments and atypical Beatles' nuances? Many. The  violins on `Eleanor Rigby' are majestic. The vocal harmonies on `Here There  And Everywhere' are as glamorous as that of the Beach Boys (oh no, did I  misspeak?). Also check the finger-snapping in the background. `I Want To  Tell You' includes a \\"dissonant\\" piano line: perhaps trivial, but  indicative of the Beatles evolving, revolving and recreating themselves.  Darn, did I mention Ringo? `Yellow Submarine' mars an otherwise flawless  disc. Sorry sad Ringo. In summary, Revolver is one of the Top-10 most  influential recordings in the history of popular music. Not too shabby. I  rate Revolver just one step behind Life In The Foodchain by Tonio  K.<br />Technical Note: 1966 and Capital Records is experimenting with   fidelity on vinyl. There answer to mono means putting the vocals in one  track, and the instrumentals on the other. At its worst, the vocals jump  from mono to one of two stereo channels, then back again. Listening in  close quarters (say an automobile) can be annoying. Revolver with  headphones is obscene. I'm not surprised that three decades after Revolver,  low-fi bands duplicate this technique.
B000002GQH|5.0|After listening DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED and IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD, my  interest in their Third album increased much more. What could they give to  us, after 2 extraordinary albums?? But the answer was more brilliant music,  without repeating themselves, bringing so much originality and mysticism.  With this album, we see the Moodys closer to the melodic side of the music,  and this really bring us through a wonderful dream. As someone in our  dreams talked to us and guide us through a variety of experiences. Since  the first sung track, when they welcome us, telling us: &quot;Lovely to see  you again my friend...&quot;, we travel through a unique experience that  after a good walking, asked to us if we are sitting confortably and finally  reached the top with Have You Heard &amp; The Voyage.  My fave tracks here  are &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot;, &quot;Never Come The Day&quot;, &quot;Lazy  Day&quot;, &quot;Are You Sitting Confortably&quot;, &quot;Have You  Heard&quot; and &quot;The Voyage&quot;.  With this album, they showed again  how a band MUST be, where all the members compose good songs and sang, and  where no one is the leader of the band, and all members have the same  importance within the band. And finally they created the previous step to  another brilliant album which would be &quot;TOU OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S  CHILDREN&quot;.
0671034065|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  The storyline was, at best, weak,  and the characters flat.  Buying this book in hardcover is a waste of  money.
B000002GQG|5.0|After listening to DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED, I got so impressed with Moody  Blues music that I had an enormous interest in listening their second  album. Normally many groups, after a great and succesful first album -in  this case it was the first with Justin &amp; John-, they try continue to  follow the style they began and repeat themselves. But, in this album, we  see it didn't happen. This album IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD was as great  and extraordinary as their predecesor. It captured the Eastern sounds and  it showed how a band must experiment with the music and their sounds  without being something extremely complicated. Sincerely when I heard first  time this album, I was in ectasy. I couldn't believe such a peaceful and  wonderful music I was discovering, it was like a hidden treasure for me.  From the beginning with the funny laugh of Graeme till the last song, the  relaxed tarck called Om, we feel like we were travelling to Eastern places.  It really continue with the conceptual albums, and the idea for House Of  Four Doors -which included Part 1, Legend Of A Mind &amp; Part. 2- is  simply brilliant. My fave tracks here are: Never Comes The Day, House Of  Four Doors, Voices In The Sky and Legend Of A Mind.  This album showed why  the Moody Blues have been considered as one of the best Classic Rock bands  in the world, and their first 7 albums are considered as real gems of  music.
B00003CWPR|1.0|Stanley Kubrick had a vision with &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.  Unfortunately, he did not live to see it through editing, where it may have  been salvaged.  If you have seen the trailer that has dramatic piano music  playing, that same music plays throughout the entire movie every time there  is a &quot;dramatic&quot; moment. Just in case you were asleep from the  dragging plot or from sitting for hours, this music drowns out and wakes  the most accomplished snorers.  <br />Nicole Kidman speaks in a long, drawn  out, monotone voice for no apparent reason, except possibly the few drags  she takes off a joint.  Somehow it doesn't seem likely that that little bit  of marijuana can do that to a person over the course of an entire 24 hours  (which is how long the movie feels while you are watching it).<br />As for  plot, I cannot say it was worth the time it took to get to the point.  I  advise against purchasing this movie, though some fans may want to see  Kubrick's final work.  Though this movie doesn't do him justice as a  producer, even an avid Kubrick fan will realize that the movie had  potential, but that his final touches weren't there to make it happen.
B000002GQE|5.0|This was the album that showed me who were The Moody Blues, and after  listening to this, my life was never the same. What an extraordinary  concept!!!  This album is really one of the most importants in music  history. The symphonic parts are really delicious and each song represents  exactly its part of the day. In my personal opinion, it would have been  marvellous, if there would have been a film like &quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot; or &quot;Fantasy&quot; with this album. It would have been  absolutely fabulous!! My fave tracks here are: Another Morning -it reminds  as we were having breakfast with our family when we were kids-, Tuesday  Afternoon, Evening Time (To Get Away), Sunset and mainly, Nights In White  Satin, which is the best closing to this album and to any day in our lives.   It's been nearly 33 years since the releasing of this album and now, in  the new millenium, we still remind it, and it will be in a important place  among the best albums in Music history.
6303203345|2.0|The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because the sound was pretty good, especially considering this is one of the first  movies rushed out for DVD when the format was still very young.<br />My  memories of this movie were that it was fast-paced, well-acted, with  kick-ass action sequences.  Unfortunately, it's not.  The acting is  incredibly stiff, very little is left for the audience to figure out (in  the first minute you know everything you need to know about Arnold's  character), the &quot;villains&quot; are laughable, and there really isn't  that much action other than ducking and hiding.  I really never believe him  as anything but Arnold sleep-walking through the part.<br />People seem to not  like more recent action movies (as a whole), claiming that they're not as  good as they used to be.  This movie is a prime example of one that was  never as good as it used to be.  Perhaps there was some energy or attitude  around the time it was made, but viewed after seeing such films as  Face/Off, The Fifth Element, or Tomorrow Never Dies, it just stinks from  beginning to end.  Not that the films mentioned are even the best of the  genre, but it goes to show that even today's mediocre fare is much better  than yesterday's top choices.<br />But I'm not sure that's so true.  Other  actions flicks of the same period DO hold up.  Movies like the original  Terminator and Batman, not to mention oodles of Bond films, still hold up.   So I think this was one movie that just capitalized on the rising power of  Arnold, threw in a few tricks and stylistic choices that were in fashion,  and left it at that.  Sure, there are a few good one-liners (&quot;I could  snap your neck like a chicken!&quot;), but they're peppered into a whole  steaming heap of horrible ones.  Too many one-liners ruin any effect the  good ones may have had otherwise.<br />The only interesting things about this  movie is that the game show is only a few programming changes away fromWho  Wants To Be A Millionare (the US version), down to the stampeding claim of  being a new style of game show, and the top draw ever.  Richard Dawson even  has a shiny shirt (and Reeg has those shiny ties).  But aside from that and  the laughable late-80's fashion (I guess it was retro in 2017?), there's  not much to recommend this movie.  If you have good memories of it, keep  them that way.
B000002KNI|5.0|I remember listening to this concert when it was simulcast live on a local  radio station.  I was eleven at the time but I was already familiar enough  with Simon's solo material and his work with Garfunkel that I made it a  point to tune in.   Even then I knew that it would be a landmark in music  history.  I was right.  As soon as the concert started, I was simply  mesmerized.    <br />That concert, captured so brilliantly and dynamically on  this recording, began my relationship with the music of Paul Simon.   I  bought and subsequently wore out the vinyl 2 LP set in the early 80's.   This CD version was one of my first purchases after buying a CD player in  the nineties.  I have since purchased all of their original albums along  with a few solo efforts (most notably Simon's masterpiece Graceland).      <br />Through the last 20 years, the music on this CD has deepened in its  importance to me.  Songs I had never really heard before, like the memorial  to our ancestor's struggles in &quot;American Tune&quot;, or the hauntingly  beautiful &quot;April Come She Will&quot;, have become important reminders  to me that music can do more than just entertain.  Music such as this has  the power to move you.  Whether you're already a fan of Simon and Garfunkel  or not, I encourage you to purchase this CD.  A finer collection of truly  American music is hard to find.
0800185218|3.0|An interesting film about a group of British soldiers that had been captured during the Pacific Campaign in World War Two. The British commanded by Colonel Bogey, played by Alec Guiness ( An amazing performance I might add) try to defy the rule of the Japaneese commodant who commands the prison camp. The Japaneese order the prisoners to construct a bridge over the river Kwai to provide troop transport for the Imperial Japaneese Army. Bogy refuses, and a large fued ignites. All in all, a wonderful film, but it does not hold for as long as intended.
B000000WCX|5.0|Maybe Bowie's most underrated album, and everyone knows that this genius  is always under noticed.  The man that has brought us such creations as  Ziggy Stardust, The White Duke and Aladdin Sane comes to life as an alien  creature with a knack for the electronic on &quot;Earthling&quot;.  To say  that the sounds are out of this world is putting it mildly.  It's a blend  of big electronic dance, fused with a big rock crunch and not to mention  some brilliant songwritings.  Basically, it's typical Bowie cleverness with  a new big sound that just didn't translate well into the states.  <br />The  album flows from big drum machine programs to synth booms all over.  Every  song is uniquely great, but the standouts of the already completely perfect  album are &quot;Little Wonder&quot;, &quot;I'm Afraid Of Americans&quot;,  &quot;The Battle For Britain&quot;, and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;.   These are my personal favorites of the genius set, but you should choose  your own.  &quot;Little Wonder&quot; is a terrific trip through synth beats  with lovingly odd words in admiration of something/someone Bowie has been  enchanted with.  &quot;The Battle For Britain&quot; has a very interesting  drumbeat that hits in the beginning and flows throughout with near cadet  beat.  &quot;I'm Afraid Of Americans&quot; is cutting edge and simple.   It's slower techno beat with extraterrestrial keyboard hits and a drilling  sound.  Smart messages are conveyed in that track as well as the others,  but they could get lost easily in this set which is so dancealbe and fun.   <br />This set is Bowie being very cleaver and putting new ideals to work.  He  uses this big electronic dance sound (which he did help to invent) to get  some social commentary across.  Bets everything is love in the club, don't  you think?  The man is great and slowly getting you to think with.   Hopefully, this is a chance for people to see yet another side of David's  mind in motion.  No wonder David is afraid of American mentality, with the  fact that they couldn't open their mind to this new experience.
0802130208|5.0|This book is a combination of slapstick and the driest humor imaginable.   It's a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; for the well read and over-educated.
B000021Y77|4.0|This is one of the freshest films to appear in years.<br />It hit the UK about the same time as Sixth Sense and Blair Witch so that was a great  month and now it's out on DVD.<br />Okay basic Story Lola has 20 minutes to  get the money to save her slightly dim boyfriend Manni.<br />Since 20 minutes  doesn't sound a lot to fill in 90 minutes you'd be forgiven for thinking it  might be a bit slow.<br />Not a bit of it the pace it keeps up is breathless  (not unlike Lola) and the film oozes class and style from every  shot.<br />Amongst the best touches are the snapshot life histories of people  Lola bumps (sometimes literally) into. In 20 seconds you see the rest of  that persons life elivating the extras into charactors<br />The main problem I  have with this is the English dubbing while fine for Lola and Manni it  doesn't really work too well on some of the minor charactors, for  preference watch it in German with English subtitles if you need them (I do   need them as my German is lousy)<br />Don't be fooled if you see the same  adverts as I did by the way I saw a review claiming the film has three  different endings this does not mean that you are getting anything new from  the cinema release it mearly means some wideboy in marketing is chancing  his arm.<br />Also on the DVD is the video for the song I believe (not my  favourite from the soundtrack but still worth a listen), cast profiles and  a directors commentry (the commentrys a bit weak but what the hell he made  a great movie we'll let him off)
B000003S0B|3.0|As soon as Peace: A Begining closes, Side A of King Crimson's second album consists of a track-to-track mirroring of In the Court of the Crimson  King's first three songs. Pictures of a City sounds like 21st Century  Schizoid Man, Cadence and Cascade like I Talk to the Wind and the title  track like Epitaph. These songs are not exactly inferior to their  predecessors, but I expected more. Side B is better. Cat Food is a quirky  song about a mad woman feeding her family poisoned cat food, Crimson's  strangest to date and Devil's Triangle is the first of many long, winding,  instrumental build-ups the band would orchestrate. It's bookended by parts  two and three of the lovely, but needless Peace trilogy.
B00004TLMC|5.0|This was a breath-taking cinematic masterpeice.  It was intruiging and seductive. The last sentence is unforgettable.
B000003S09|5.0|This album is very conceptual, a surrealist's collection of dreamlike descriptions and dramatic story telling which flare about in jazzy,  classical infused arrangements. The lyrics are short and poignant,  especially in its phrasing and symbolize various subjects such as the  innocence of childhood and the turmoil of living in powerful social  structures in a fanciful format with musical arrangements which balance  from serene to startling for about forty minutes the best psychedelic music  of the 60s.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against The Machine is a very talented band, possibly the most on the current metal circuit. The Battle Of Los Angeles is their most poppy  effort, but also yet most satisfying. I must argue with the reviewers who  say this is their best record, because I think Evil Empire was a superb  album. I think this one deals less with Mexican problems and more with  America's, as the other two didn't. Zack is a great rapper/singer/screamer,  and his presence is unmistakeable. He writes the most meaningful lyrics in  music, I believe, and his songwriting talent is great. Tom's guitar is  wonderful, and I feel he is one of the best guitarists of all time. He  makes noises I have never heard out of anyone else, DJ-esque noises, bluesy  ramblings, metal chugs, and then to top that off, he matches both  guitarists in Pearl Jam with a line that sounds straight out of their book.  This is definitely his best work, especially on the first single,  &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, where he displays his talent for the public.  Brad is one of the best drummers I have ever heard, and you can hear at  least one of his amazing hip hop drum surges and solos in every song. He is  very energetic and skillful. Let's not forget about Tim. He is one of the  only bassists in music now that you can hear, and sometimes even bursts  into a solo of his own. &quot;Calm Like A Bomb&quot; prbably displays this  best in the introduction to the song. Overall this is a great record, my  favorite songs are &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Calm Like A  Bomb&quot;, &quot;Mic Check&quot;, &quot;Born Of A Broken Man&quot;, and  &quot;Voice Of The Voiceless.&quot; FREE MUMIA
B00000JJM2|5.0|This is definitely the ultimate cd. It is my best purchase to date. The  combination of music is immaculate. My favourites are &quot;Some Kinda  Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Cry to Me&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot;.  This music  rocks the soul. You just gotta to sing and dance when its playing.  For  those of you in love, looking for love or just love the great music of the  80's this is the cd for you. I have an eight year old niece that just loves  this collection. I have the words to each song printed and boy you should  hear us sing. So just sit back and allow the music to flow.
B000000993|5.0|Tool are definitely a very creepy band, as you may tell from the liner notes on this one. Twisted and sick at first glance, Tool may seem uninteresting, but after a while, you may get into the music and see  exactly what the message is they're trying to get across. There is a lot of  bass in this one, and that is basically what drives the songs, as well as  Maynard James Keenan's wailing vocals. The guitar work isn't really very  well noticed, but still comes into play occasionally during the huge, epic  choruses. Danny is an excellent drummer, who really can go as fast or slow  as he wants and this almost controls the whole band. Henry Rollins guests  on the song &quot;Bottom&quot; which is one of the standouts on Undertow.  This is a record you could fall asleep to (that's a good thing) and also  headbang to. It is stunningly beautiful and very dark and ugly at the same  time. In the liner notes, there is a picture of an obese woman lying naked  under a normal sized naked guy. I think the point of this is not to be  really weird and sick, but to have a shock affect on the people who look at  it, kind of like an &quot;she's not ugly because she's fat&quot; attitude.  I think it is kind of like the whole interracial relationships idea. They  can do what they want, and it is not wrong to love someone that's  overweight. I don't love obese people inparticualar, and I'm not overweight  at all, this is just my perspective. Anyway, I think the songs  &quot;Sober&quot;, &quot;Prison Sex&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot;, and  &quot;Swamp Song&quot; are the best. ...
B000009EUM|5.0|When I finally decided to buy Scoundrel Days on CD several years ago when  my LP was showing definite signs of wear, to my dismay, I couldn't find it  anywhere. I finally did find it on CD. What an album! No other band (my  favorite) has or ever will have such a melodic and lyrical sound as they  have. \\"The Swing Of Things\\" is sheer poetry in motion. \\"I've Been Losing  Myself\\" really rocks. \\"Soft Rains Of April\\" is nostalgically haunting to  me. No fluff here this music is serious stuff. I love this album.
014028009X|4.0|This book made me laugh at loud several times. Even though I'm well past  the age of the main character, I could certainly identify with many of her  predicaments.  Every woman has been through some of these situations at  some time in her life.  I really enjoyed it as a good summer read.
0792839749|2.0|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD but NO WIDESCREEN and no bang for your buck.<br />Why issue a classic widescreen epic on DVD if you are not going to  present it in its original aspect ratio? This DVD is presented in Full  Frame.<br />The Laser Disc was in Widescreen. I made the mistake of waiting  for it to come out on DVD. VHS will do for now. Thank you very much.<br />Another stone cold waste of DVD. Count Zborowski must be as disapointed  about this DVD as he was when he lost the original Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang  in 1922.
B0000062S0|1.0|A few years after its release, Walking Into Clarksdale is collecting dust  in my collection.  I pulled it out the other day hoping it had ripened with  age, but sadly it was rotten.  It's my opinion that the quality of this  recording was compromised to keep Mr. Plant on board -- he didn't want to  make a traditional Jimmy Page produced guitar orchestra record.  So what we  are left with is sparse arrangements that only hint at the drama possible.  There's good stuff here, but it feels rushed to press and lacks the solid  production signature we expect from Jimmy Page, even when shackled with  hack David Coverdale. 2001 may bring a new Page/Plant CD -- hopefully this  one will return Jimmy to the wheel where he belongs.  Oh, and by the way,  Plant's singing has never been more nasal and whining.
076790382X|5.0|I started reading this book on an airplane and started laughing so hard I was crying!  The person I was traveling with was mortified until I had him  read a couple pages and he too was in stitches. After that, the people  around us were close to calling a flight attendant to have us restrained.  Unlike Bryson's other books, this is actually a collection of articles he  wrote for a British newspaper.  It has been perfect bedtime reading as each  chapter is short and complete sending me off to dreamland with a big smile  on my face.

B00004THAY|2.0|Clapton as usual runs through the same old pentatonic blues scale guitar riffs that he's been playing for years.  And with very little imagination or even the attempt of trying something new on this album.  I think Clapton  is good, not great and he's certainly not God!  I know he was one of the  early pioneers of rock guitar but does anyone really think he stacks up  equally to his peer group of Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck?  I  guess if you already love this stuff and accept that nothing new will come  of it then you'll buy this anyway.  On the other hand, if you want to avoid  the latest slick packaging work from the record companies to snatch [more money] out of your pocket then steer clear.
B0000009SM|5.0|This is the first Zappa album I ever owned.      In 9th grade I bought it  used for like 3 dollars.      I listened and liked it but somewhere in  college I returned to it and since then it has been one of my favorite all  time albums.      I could just throw it in the player and it just never  seems to sound tired.      Each time you listen you hear something new.  Inca Roads has to be the most complicated rich song he has ever written.  And how can I not mention Evelyn a Modified dog... you know the rest..  viewed the quivering fringe of a special doily... C'mon where else can yu  get lyrics like this?    I reccommend this to people who are just being  introduced to Frank for the first time.     Rest in Peace, Frank.
B000000H5J|5.0|Oh god where do I begin with how great this cd is?  Its the type of cd  that makes you put your fist in the air and yell, and then at parts where  the songs get extremely good, not just very good, it inspires you to hit  the wall with your fist, all the while screaming the lyrics.  Top picks on  this cd would be Pisschrist, Zero Signal and the title track.  Out of these  I feel that Pisschrist is the best, especially the last minute or so.   Again, a great cd that makes you put your fist in the air and yell.
B000002L9B|5.0|This 1986 release is not only a soundtrack to my favorite Prince movie,  but stands as the most cohesive work he ever produced with The Revolution.  The addition of guitarist Mico Weaver and horn players Eric Leeds and  Atlanta Bliss is a touch of pure brilliance that lends the album a jazzy  sophistication.  The opening triumvirate of &quot;Christopher Tracy's  Parade&quot;, &quot;New Position&quot; and &quot;I Wonder U&quot; will hook  even casual fans, but the treasures only begin there! The slow, almost  somber title track is one of Prince's most effortless ballads, in which he  wonders if he'll 'die young, like heroes die', and sports a lovely piano  solo courtesy of Lisa Coleman.  One of my personal favorites has always  been the funky jazz of &quot;Girls And Boys&quot; with the most insistently  catchy sax line ever put on a pop record, it'll have you pressing rewind  several times! The remainder of &quot;Cherry Moon...&quot; is an  adventurous grab bag of brittle, jittery funk (the classic &quot;Kiss&quot;  comes to mind), light pop (&quot;Life Can Be So Nice&quot;,  &quot;Mountains&quot;,) cabaret (&quot;Do U Lie?&quot;) classical  (&quot;Venus De Milo&quot;), bottom-heavy soul  (&quot;Anotherloverholeinyohead&quot;) and spare, acoustic balladry (the  almost unbearably lovely &quot;Sometimes It Snows In April&quot;) that is  unabashedly eclectic, but works as a suite of songs versus a collection of  singles strung together.  There's not a bad song to be found here, and it  will probably have you longing for the days when Prince was this diplomatic  with his band members and let everyone join the fun.  The joy of their  collaboration is evident on this joyous album.  A Classic.

0060930349|4.0|Johnson's long-awaited US history volume is more like his earlier &quot;A  History of the English People&quot; than the ultra-comprehensive  &quot;Modern Times,&quot; in the sense that he offers insights and thematic  overviews rather than creating the most complete and richly detailed  portrait. (To do the latter would have required twice as many pages, and  this is NOT a short volume.)<br />Among the many treats are refreshing views  of many of the Founding Fathers (Washington especially), as well as  underappreciated players (e.g. Henry Clay, Jesse Jones) and the  historically overrated (Woodrow Wilson and FDR, to name two).  Probably  most surprising is his praise for Warren Harding, but his argument is  well-buttressed and worth reviewing. Johnson also treats Coolidge kindly,  but rips into Hoover from the right (i.e. the Great Engineer was the real  &quot;father&quot; of the New Deal).  He also lauds Truman, Eisenhower and  Reagan generally, and credits Margaret Thatcher with stiffening Bush Sr.'s  backbone on Iraq in 1990, leading to the Gulf War. <br />There are some  factual mistakes that disappoint (e.g. completely missing the fact and  significance of Reagan's primary challenge to Ford in 1976). The existence  of these has led some critics to dismiss the book entirely.  This is both  unfair and wrong.<br />Johnson is always a cracking read, but his handling of  the Civil War years and the latter half of the 19th century was somewhat  thin.  One could have wished for more use of incisive statistics (but those  Johnson does use are telling). He notes that America is the first major  nation whose entire history and origins are known and written down for all  to review, and Johnson's review has been comprehensive and objective, with  surprises for conservatives and liberals alike.  Don't miss it.
1577311523|5.0|An eloquent presentation of profound concepts that resonate mightily  within me.  Things I have known (possibly always) but keep forgetting to  remember.  This can be a very helpful book.
B00003CXFU|3.0|Knowing this movie is based on a true story, we know not to expect any amazing plot twists or exciting special effects.  Because of that, we are  left with a story than we know the ending to, so this movie must be judged  on how well it tells the story.  I think it does a pretty good job.  Julia  Roberts and Finney do a good job in leading the talented cast.  The  characters are all believable.  The movie is entertaining, but for a long  movie it offers very few emotional peaks and valleys.  I found myself  interested in what was happening and eager to find out how Julia &amp; Co.  would win in the end.  And when the movie did end, I realized I had seen  nothing exceptional or new, just the retelling of a good story.
630241380X|5.0|I certainly agree with the other glowing reviews of this movie but I would like to say that it is not simply the best western ever produced, it is, in  my opinion, the best movie ever produced. I have seen it approximately 10  times and it is just as good each time as it was the first time. Rober  Duval's acting is as good as it gets. Tommy Lee Jones is at his finest. The  music is superb. The cimematography is excellent. The story is masterfully  crafted and is based largely on real life characters. Charles Goodnight was  the real life model for Woodrow Call and Oliver Loving, Goodnight's  partner, was the model for Augustus McCrae. Duval, in playing McCrae,  brings to life the character of the gallant old ranger and lover of all  women with a degree of perfection of art that is unsurpassed in the history  of movie making.
B00003CX6P|2.0|There are a lot of things to like about this movie, but unfortunately they are all superficial.  First, the scenery is beautiful.  1950's Italy looks  like an incredible place to live and provides a compelling backdrop for the  actions of the characters.  Second, all of the actors give great  performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow steals the show with her sympathetic  performance.  Blanchette and Hoffman are good and so is Damon as the evil  Ripley.  Law turns in a great performance as the victim of Damon's schemes.  Then what is wrong about this movie?  First, homosexuality is a big theme  in this movie, which might turn some people off.  Second, this is not a  typical thriller so don't expect the typical good guy vs. bad guy ending.  While the ending makes sense, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  My  advice is to know what to expect before you watch this movie.  If you enjoy  these kind of artsy movies then this is for you.
B00004TWZF|4.0|First off, allow me to say that The Big Blue is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I've seen it more times than I can count, and since I nearly  wore out my VHS copy, I'm incredibly grateful that it's being released on  DVD.<br />I'm also incredibly grateful that, with the Director's Cut, we get  to see the original ending for the movie, which is much more ambiguous and  thus much more &quot;real&quot; than the tidy American version.  My  complaint is that 3 hours seems a bit much for this movie.  Do we really  need to see Jacques and Enzo on the oil rig?  Do we really need so much of  deaf Uncle Louie?  Director's cuts can be wonderful things (take  Bladerunner, for example).  They can also be testaments to the egos of the  directors, who seem to feel that if they shot it, it's worth going on  screen.  Sometimes a little editing can go a long way.
B000001FN8|4.0|Probabley their last decent effoert of original recording before the group  set off into oblvion with disgraaceful music that tarnished their  reputation as ledgends of hard rock. All nine of these songs i love and  still listen to especally songs like `Passion Rules The Game`,`Media  Overkill`,`Rhytem Of Love` are The Scorpions best songs i have heard since  1984`s `LOVE AT FIRST STING` Along with the front cover design which i  found very interesting is a well packaged set of good rocking tunes that i  never get tired of listeing to. The Scorpions is a rock group that can  definatley deliver the goods and maybe one day soon they will do so again.

1570429596|3.0|I SELECT THIS TITLE BASICALLY BECAUSE THE JUNIOR IN COLLEGE IS USUALLY  PLANNING... IT'S A GOOD BOOK IN THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE INSIGHT TO THOSE THAT  &quot;ARE IN COLLEGE&quot;, ARE LOOKING TOWARDS THEIR FUTURE AND A  FUNDAMENTAL AVENUE ON HOW TO PLAN THEIR FINANCES BEFORE THAT DAY ARRIVES.  IT'S THE AUTHORS OPINION AS TO WHETHER COLLEGE IS NEEDED. I BELIEVE HE  FEELS IT'S BEST BUT TRIES TO GET THROUGH TO THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE  EDUCATION THAT THEY CAN ALSO SUCCEED-IT'S NOT THE END. I CAN SEE HOW SOME  MAY MISCONTRUE THE AUTHOR'S CONCEPT OF DEMPHASIZING EDUCATION. BASICALLY,  INVEST WHAT YOU CAN. ROLL IT OVER TO EITHER BETTER FUNDS OR ACQUIRE A GOOD  DEAL ON A REAL ESTATE. ROLL THAT OVER INTO A BETTER DEAL. YOU CAN USE HIS  METHOD TO GAIN &quot;THE SPOILS OF LIFE&quot; AND NOT PAY OUTRIGHT. OR YOU  CAN JUST BUY THAT CAR OUTRIGHT AND WAIT THAT MUCH LONGER TO BEGIN YOUR  INVESTING DAYS. HE'S RIGHT. THE BOOK WAS OK. NOT GREAT.
B000002UKS|3.0|There are some great songs and some awful songs on here.  On this album,  Dave Grohl decided screaming sounded good, and decided to put it  prominently throughout the album, which ruins &quot;Wind Up&quot;,  &quot;Enough Space&quot;, and &quot;New Way Home&quot;.  There's a lot of  filler, but songs such as &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;Hey Johnny  Park!&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot;, and  &quot;Everlong&quot; are great.  But I don't know if that's enough to  recommend the album.
0486274268|5.0|Are you tired of drawing animals that seem flat and lifeless?  Then this  book is definately for you.  Ken Hultgren does more than merely teach you  to draw, he teaches you how to draw with the illusion of movement, and how  to put life into the image.
B000002TYK|4.0|The album starts off with &quot;This is a Call&quot; - a song that has a  rocking electric guitar and some amazing drums.  That's pretty much the  album's style.  No thought, no slickness, just ROCK.  &quot;I'll Stick  Around&quot;, the single &quot;Big Me&quot; (which is the only one of its  kind on the album&quot;, &quot;Good Grief&quot;, &quot;Floaty&quot;, and  &quot;X-Static&quot; are excellent.  There are definitely imperfections on  this album- some of the songs are obviously filler, others are just  downright bad - but the good songs that are on here are true gems.
B000001F45|1.0|If you're looking for the album which makes &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot;  sound palatable, here it is. Dead weight trying to pass itself as heavy  music, obstreperous and with but one redeeming quality - the silence when  it's finally over, assuming it isn't still ringing in your ears and your  ears aren't demanding why you violated their Eighth Amendment rights.
B000020617|4.0|This is an interesting album.  The direction of the band has changed  slightly, and with it the album is more well-rounded than the others.   &quot;Breakout&quot;, &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;, &quot;Gimme Stitches&quot;,  &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Aurora&quot;, and &quot;Headwires&quot; are  generally good songs.  New drummer Taylor has filled Dave Grohl's shoes  amazingly well.  In short, with better songs towardthe end, this album  could have been absolutely great.  Instead, it will have to settle for  being pretty good.
0060930349|5.0|I enjoyed this book as reading a novel. If you don't know much about  American history, this book offers a very good chance to learn.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This album continues down the path of its predecessor, My Own Prison.   While some of the songs sound similar, who really cares?  This album rocks,  make no doubts about that.  &quot;Are You Ready?&quot;, &quot;What  If&quot;, &quot;Say I&quot;, &quot;Wrong Way&quot;, &quot;Never Die&quot;,  &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;, and &quot;Inside Us All&quot; are the best  tracks on here, and that's leaving out the monster hit &quot;Higher&quot;.   Any grunge/hard rock fan will gobble this stuff up.  Plus, there is not a  trace of bad language on this album either.  You should definitely put this  in your CD collection.
0375707972|2.0|I read this book as part of a short class on the second generation of  people after the Holocaust.  It was thought provoking, but, in many ways,  flat.  The narrator is, as my professor said, &quot;a collection of  ideas,&quot; and never evolves into a real person.  Some of this is  intentional on the author's part, however, it becomes inconsistant with  what he is able to determine about Hanna (he doesn't have that much  insight!).  Hanna is the most well drawn character in the book, and,  despite her past, has some integrity (she admits to her what she has done  and denies what she has not).  Her illiteracty explains how SHE became  involved to the extent she did, but is by no means an explanation for all  participants.  It made me think about what I would have done in her  postion, and the most real part of the book is when Hanna turns to the  judge and says, &quot;...what would you have done?&quot;--and truly wants  an answer.
0790731002|4.0|This is the second best Batman film after the grrreat Batman &amp; Robin. Joel Schumacher's direction is sharp, and the screenplay is well-written.  Val Kilmer has the charisma and humor that Michael Keaton needed yet still  isn't as good. Slightly better than George Clooney. Tommy Lee Jones is a  great Two-Face and could have been the only villain. Jim Carrey is  entertaining as the Riddler and could also have been the only villain but  would have needed to play his character differently. However, one thing  that I enjoyed about these villains was they had a sort of rivalry. Who  REALLY runs the show? After all, after the Riddler's invention of &quot;the  Box&quot; at the big party it appeared the Riddler was Batman's chief  villain. But then it seemed as if Two-Face was jealous and crashed the  party though he should have &quot;pre-sold the movie rights&quot; as Carrey  put it. However, in my opinion Two-Face should have been the only villain  because Carrey would still probably have played the Riddler in the same  goofy way. Nicole Kidman is okay as Dr. Chase Meridian. Chris O' Donnell is  annoying as Robin. The action scenes are entertaining, especially the  opening, and I love all the new vehicles, especially the redesigned  Batmobile and the Bat Boat. The VERY special effects are incredible by John  Dykstra, and when I first watched this on DVD, the sound blew me away!  Guess that's why it got an Oscar nomination for it. The photography is  interesting and well-done. A great film.
078324228X|5.0|I got to tell you Denzel surely pulled this one off. His acting performance was beyond great. Sometimes you have to wonder if you can act a  certain roll someone else is doing and there is no doubt in my mind that no  one could have pulled this off like Denzel. The movie was great and to  believe that it is a true story made it so much better. I have to commend  Hurricane for staying true with himself and never giving up. It was nothing  but a blessing that those people and that young man came into his life. I  really and truly enjoyed this movie. It was even a tear jerker. A must  watch.
630575067X|5.0|I love Star Wars movies. George Lucas caused a revolution in special effects by his movie in 1977, and after 20 years he did it again. I agree  that Episode I has some failures. In my idea this movie misses some  characters like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. However, I admire it and  despite its failures it's a great movie. I recommand it to everyone who  love special effects.
B00003CX6P|3.0|Don't get me wrong I got the story, but the one ? I have is why. Why is this man making it his life to be someone else. The story just went on and  on. From one lover to the next. I was surprised that he never got caught.  Got close, but no luck, because I really wanted him to get caught, because  he thought he was good. Matt Damon did a good job of acting and so did  Gwenth Palthrow (excuse the spelling). The set was boring and the town was  dull. But if you like crazy movies that make you say Huh!  Then you will  enjoy this movie.
B0000024RQ|5.0|Before Dylan went electric and went for more studio produced material there was a beautiful innocence to Dylan's music. &quot;The Freewheelin'  Bob Dylan&quot; is an amazing effort for a second album and a classic.  <br />The album opens with the classic 60's peace song &quot;Blowin' In The  Wind&quot; which is still relevant as it was during the Vietnam war.  &quot;Girl From The North Country&quot; is my personal favorite on the  album, it's beautiful and gives us a break from the two heavy songs that  sandwich it. &quot;Masters Of War&quot; is a haunting powerful song that  everyone should hear that speaks the truth of War. The song can still be  applied to recent events like Kosovo and the Middle-East. &quot;Down The  Highway&quot; is classic folk. &quot;Bob Dylan's Blues&quot; show Dylan  playing around with his vocals and see his great songwritting skills.  &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot; is another classic on this album  that has a great message which is similar to Ginsberg's poem  &quot;Howl&quot;. &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot; has an  easing light feel with lyrics on a relationship gone bad. &quot;Bob Dylan's  Dream&quot; was the first of a series of songs that would appear later on  other albums. &quot;Oxford Town&quot; is a catchy sing-along Woody Guthrie  type song. &quot;Talking World War 3 Blues&quot; is a satirical song about  fear of another war. &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot; has more depth musically  to it than the past songs and is a highlight of the album. &quot;Honey,  Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot; is another great love song and Dylan  uses his range of vocals on it. The album ends trimpumphinly with &quot;I  Shall Be Free&quot;.<br />Bob Dylan is one of the greatest songwriters of our  time and this album is essential.
B00003CWN3|4.0|The story was good, but the people and the trailer park atmosphere really got on my nerves. I got the story from the beginning and was wondering  about the rest, but it pulled through. I hate that it had such a tragic  ending and that was heartbreaking. There were a few violent scenes so this  isn't a movie for kids. But all in all the movie was pretty good.
0767811038|1.0|This movie is probably the dumbest one of all time, well perhaps Rambo III and Godzilla are even worse .... And this outer-space trash from the  director of two science-fiction cult classics called &quot;Robocop&quot;  and &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Verhoeven should be ashamed of having  directed this nonsense. And to say one or two words about the  &quot;cast&quot; I can only add to my embarassment that this movie contains  no acting at all. The only good scenes throughout the movie are the ones`  when these awful &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;-teenagers are torn apart by the  bugs, Hurray ....! Even the climax doesn`t work ..... Everyone who calls  this movie a masterpiece deserves to be eaten by an alien-bug.
B00000IN5G|5.0|This CD is phenomenol. You can get a lot of metal that offers a lot of noise that doesn't follow any beat. CoB are one band that actually does  death metal well without clean vocals that really bring down the  aggression, and without annoying, pboxious guitar masterbation. Congrats
0792844890|1.0|I saw this when it came out in theaters and I wasn't the only person not laughing. How Mel Brooks is able or was ever able to get any films financed  is beyond me. Who thought it would be a good idea to release a Star Wars  spoof in the mid-late 80's when no one cared about Star Wars anymore. It  only goes to show how comedically out of touch Mel Brooks is, when he  thinks that Star Wars is still the cutting edge of pop culture 10 years  after the movie left theaters. Loaded with unfunny line after unfunny line.  This is the kind of stuff your grandpa would tell you and think it's funny.  Well, I guess it makes sense seeing as how old and crusty Mel Brooks is.  All these jewish references in the movie don't do anything for me. It looks  like Mel Brooks has confused a Sci-fi spoof with Yiddish theater. I guess  you have to be jewish to find this guys &quot;humor&quot; funny. If 2nd  grade level fart and booger jokes really crack you up then you'll love this  movie.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Play is by far the best Moby CD to date, and could quite possibly be the best electronic CD ever. Moby succeeds in creating a harmonious blend of  spiritual overtones set against beats that could best be described as deep,  laid back, and moving. This has been my essential evening mix for the past  six months, and is a collection of songs that will never grow old. It is  warming that a keystone in the arch of the electronic music focuses on his  Christian roots and religious spirituality. A COMPILATION WHO'S WORTH FAR  SURPASSES ITS MEAGER PRICE TAG
6304708491|5.0|The Beatles used to churlishly dismiss this second film of theirs as reducing them to &quot;bit players&quot; , the big hams.  Pay no attention  to those silly boys!  They were too ripped on pot while making  &quot;Help!&quot; to know what was going on.  This film is director Richard  Lester's favorite, and it's easy to see why.  Despite the Beatles'  protests, it's a visual and aural treat, crammed with gags, puns, sly  absurdist humor, spoofs of film, literature, music, and mores, and, of  course, stunning Beatletunes.  What more can anyone want?  Entertaining fun  AND a classic piece of British filmmaking.  BTW, keep an eye open for the  eerie harbingers of the Beatles' future lives/careers.  Indian influences,  mystical Stonehenge, tigers, bagpipes, psychedelia, the cameo appearance of  the 1969 Beatles, a gun pulled on John (but uselessly, since it's British),  thugs invading Beatle homes -- all this and more.  Kali is the goddess of  change, death, rebirth, and so it is fitting that after this movie, which  even takes the mickey out of the Great Goddess, nothing would ever be the  same for the Lads.
0425170349|4.0|In Rainbow Six we see John Clark and other old friends like Chavez  assembled into a super elite counter terrorism force.  In several exciting  scenes we see them take out terrorists in a variety of locales, my favorite  of which is an amusement park.  We also get to read about super high tech  military gadgets such as a device that can pinpoint anyones location  through detecting their heartbeat.  The climax to the novel is humorous and  gratifying.
6304708521|5.0|Thoroughly mindblowingly brilliant, as in almost all things the Fab Four did.  Five stars if only for the performance of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;  (&quot;No You're Not!&quot; Said Little Nicola) and the off-kilter  eccentricities of the Men of the Century (Liverpool edition).  Play LOUD  and take with lots and lots of tea.  And biscuits.<br />It'll all make  perfect sense, if you are ready and willing.  Otherwise, better not to  worry about it.<br />God bless the Beatles and all those who sail with them.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I was very disappointed in this film. The enigma codes were in reality recovered by the British sailors in surface ships and I am not aware of any  heroic American mission to recover them. For a start the construction of  American heroes on this theme seemed wrong. Then the plot began to drag as  all the old submarine war movie cliches were rerun - the tension between CO  and XO, the destroyer-submarine combat, the depth charges, the leaking  pipes and the frightened faces of cocooned men hundreds of feet below the  surface. The representation of the technology also wrankled me. The rate at  which charges are dropped by destroyers would make the close succession of  explosions near the sub impossible. Moreover, the closeness of those  explosions at 200m depth would definitely have imploded the hull.  Generally, a load of garbage.

B00003CWTI|5.0|This was my favorite movie of 1999.  I can understand why many did not like it, but for me it was a treat from beginning to end.  It's true that  it feels almost like stream of consciousness with no editing (in length  anyway), but that is part of it appeal.  It is an outpouring of emotion and  energy.  The performances (especially by Hoffman, Moore and Cruise) are  exceptional.  The music is astoundingly good.  I CANNOT wait for the DVD!
B000003TA4|1.0|i firmly beleive that the only reason peopel like this band is because  they were the first to do it. because it is talentless, it really is. the  guy knew 3 chords, sang like a dying chicken, and wrote stupid, pity lyrics  about being dumb and having no friends. if a band like this came out now,  no one would care, if anything they'd laugh at it.
B000001GXE|5.0|I'm beginning to think that Schubert symphonies (like Beethoven's,  Mozart's, Brahms's, and Haydn's) are pieces that you can't have too many  versions of.  In any case, this unusual pairing of the third and the  &quot;Unfinished&quot; are played bracingly by Kleiber and the Vienna  Philharmonic.  Also, as far as I can tell the talented Carlos Kleiber  didn't release nearly as many recordings as the average &quot;name&quot;  conducter, so it's well to snap up what you can find by him.
0767800478|1.0|My wife, my mother and I sat down to watch this and barely made it through a half hour before we all agreed to turn it off.  We had expected to like  it after it did so well at the box office but the characters are so weak  and the plot and dialog are so predictable it was torturous.  If you want a  romantic comedy pick When Harry Met Sally or Shakespeare in Love.  Even  Sleepless in Seattle, which is essentially enjoyable fluff, is way better  than this movie.  I would watch Sleepless again but I couldn't even watch  all of It Could Happen To You once.
0881030201|5.0|This is a heart wrenching story, timeless in its relevance. Many of my  female friends said they cried when they read it, and so did I.  Accidentally, the book was introduced to me by my boyfriend, and so did he  cry reading it too? Not so it seems for man. Nevertheless, the story of  Charlie Gordon is a stirring and thought-provoking one. <br />Regardless of  race, culture and worlds we live in, we can't not empathaize with the  simpleton, Charlie's desire to be smart and loved. After tasting these,  would we have his courage and dignity to carry on, knowing that all too  soon, nature must revert to itself? Must Read, compassionate telling.
B00003CWPR|5.0|I wont bother to mention my thoughts about the film, except to say its my second favorite kubrick film.  Im not even sure why I'm writing this  because i doubt if it will even be read, there being almost 400 posts about  the film.  The only thing that pissed me off about the film was the way  they hyped it.  I remember seeing Entertainment Tonight, and all of those  other hollow shows and seeing how they hyped it.  They called it &quot;tom  and nicole's intimate new film&quot; and i dont even remember seeing a  mention of stanley kubrick in all the hype.  I guess they were trying to  sell it to all those national enquirer readers who were just hoping to see  the couple naked.  And when the movie wasnt actually just a shallow  revealment of the two, plenty of people got disapointed.  but one thing i  agree on with just about everyone else is that nicole is a pretty bad  actress. i think kubrick had to just throw in those nude shots of her to  make up for her lack of skill.  I've always been a hater of her work, i  can't remember any role that she played that wasnt almost laughable.  I  remember one line of her's in days of thunder when she had to say &quot;let  me out of the car&quot; in a british accent, what actually came out was  &quot;let me out of the carww..&quot; (the bristish kind of drop the R and  replace it with a W when they say car, but she used both, good watch it for  yourself).  But i do think this film is her best work, and that says  something.  But tom did a good job i think, even though it wasnt really  that hard of a role to play.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This was without a doubt one of the best movies ever!  I have watched it so many times, and it's a phenomenal movie!  The plot is the best, and the  fight scenes and special effects are amazing!  All I can say is that I  can't wait for the sequel!
6304698798|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. Definitely a Classic. I envy those who didn't see it yet, they get to experience watching it for the first time.  The story is about three outlaws seeking a buried treasure. The characters  are very interesting and the dialogue is very very sharp, not to mention  the very enjoyable Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot;  But the real prize is  the musical score by Ennio Morricone. Basically everything in this movie is  perfect. I strongly recommend it for everyone. As for the DVD it has seven  previously deleted scenes and few facts about the movie.
B000002U9W|3.0|Ladies and gentlemen, I do not dispute that AHM contains lavish  orchestrations, gentle vocals, or even the birth (perhaps . . . ) of  &quot;prog rock&quot;.  What I DO dispute, however, are the gushing  statements in which this is deemed &quot;Essential Floyd&quot;.  There are  those who will disagree with me (endlessly bickering . . . . YAWN!), but I  feel AHM is not fully realized nor brilliantly constructed - I respect it  as a monumental EFFORT, but one which was not on target.  In short, AHM  puts me to sleep when I am not tired.<br />I recommend &quot;Piper at the  Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;The  Final Cut&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot; before AHM (DSOTM and &quot;The  Wall&quot; are given), in that order.  True, AHM represents a pivotal  moment for a pivotal band, but I'd like to make clear to the uninitiated  that there are better albums to hear before subjecting yourself to this.   Pertinent in Floyd's development?  Yes, that's why completists rave about  this album.  Great album?  Uhhhh, no.

0792106989|5.0|I completely agree with reviewers below who suggest multiple viewings of this film to see the many layers of storytelling and character.<br />Like any  great film this one has you asking new questions each time and each  character is so perfectly drawn you wish you could visit that town in  happier times.<br />My suggestion is that you try to see one of the first  &quot;memory westerns&quot; by John Ford called &quot;Young Mr.  Lincoln&quot; which tells a simple story from Abe Lincoln's days as a  lawyer. It shares a similarity in that both deal with a young lawyer's  attempts to settle a rowdy town but stylistically they are identical.<br />Of  all of John Ford's westerns I found these two to be the most humane. Truly  the kind they don't make anymore.
0805210393|5.0|This novel starts at the arrival of an engineer called K at a village.  Despite his assertion, no one can confirm his contract with the Castle.  Then, K decides the direct negotiation with it, although he doesn't know  where the Castle is. This absurd beginning of the story suggests the  atmosphere of this novel. Every trial to go to the Castle fails though it  is visible from the village. Every effort is felt meaningless to access  here, because no one knows the way to it. No people except a woman help him  with interest. The woman becomes his lover, but soon leaves him. At last he  succeeds to meet the attorney of the Castle, but there is little hope. His  trial to contact the Castle continues without any disappointment...<br />The  above is a rough sketch of this novel. We notice that the important is not  the story, but the process of his behavior. He feels little emotion against  his lover at the village. He has little pleasure even when the attorney of  the Castle says to research the existence of his contract. He feels as if  it is natural when his lover betrays him. His aim is to keep the contract  with the Castle and only that. Making no human relations with village  people, he is going to perform his obligation to the Castle with the strict  will, although it doesn't give him any assurance of the existence of the  contract.<br />The theme of this novel is his highly rational and little  emotional behavior in this absurd situation that symbolizes our society.  His psychology is only the adaptation to it. The story ends abruptly  without any conclusion like our lives. We have no lessons from this novel,  but only experience the lonely soul in the absurd world.<br />We must admit  that this experience is suitable for some situation. This novel will bring  the supreme sympathy to those who is replaced on the same environment.
0140509194|5.0|This  book is fun for children and adults because of the appearance of characters from classic nursery rhyme characters and storybook classics.  Each page features a familiar character amidst the beautiful  illustrations.. Sequencing is a major  feature of this simple volume, which  arrives, full circle back to the opening character, Tom Thumb, having plum  pie with the entire round of characters. This book is described as gentle,   however, Baby Bear has dire need of some gun safety classes, and it is  possible that some children may be disturbed by the close calls that Baby  Bunting has that result from Baby Bear's lack of control over his hunting  rifle.  I know I was!  The incidences inside provide a teachable moment  about guns. Beautiful pictures; enchanting text. Possibly lots of questions  and conversations.
0783110928|4.0|I have seen GIA several times on HBO and I feel that it's a great portrail of GIA Corongie.  the sex scenes are a plus even though they weren't all  shown on the HBO version.  This movie had alot of twists and turns first  she was doing good then bad then good then even worse.  I say this movie  could probably been cut just about in half. It's a simple movie with a sad  ending, I give it 4 stars for the great work by Angelia Golie the staring  chachter.  It's hard to tell if that's absolutley accurate they probably  left out alot from the origional story.<br />Off the record, on the QT, and  very HUSH HUSH
B00000IAU3|5.0|I only bought &quot;No Angel&quot; two days ago and already the CD has  been played a thousand times. Everytime I listen to it, something new grabs  my attention. This girl has amazing presence. I first heard her when I saw  Sliding Doors (which incidently has a great soundtrack) and I loved that  powerful and yet simultaneously sweet voice on that track - and when I  heard &quot;here with me&quot; on Roswell, I had to buy it. Every song adds  something great to this album. I love the haunting vocals on Hunter and the  sweet but depressing lament of My Lovers gone (which sounds very celtic in  style - very nice) I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to  admire powerful vocal talent - this girl is going to go far.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I first saw this production on Masterpiece Theatre years ago, and I have loved it ever since.  I am an Austen junkie, having read this novel over  forty times (I teach it again and again, so I have an excuse).  While it's  easy to quibble with any film adaptation, this strikes me as particularly  sensitive to Austen's intent.  Virtually all the dialogue is straight from  the novel, the filmmakers made up very little, and most of the characters  seem right on target.  The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is portrayed  masterfully, wonderfully.  Dear Elizabeth Garvie (who plays Elizabeth  Bennet) - if you read this - I'm in love with you!  The other sisters are  all perfect, just perfect.  <br />My only complaint is that Mr. Darcy here is  too stiff and unlikeable, though this is tricky since that is just how he  is supposed to seem to the Bennet family (while readers are supposed to  know he secretly admires Elizabeth and so must not be a total jerk).  In  this version, Darcy hardly seems to deserve Elizabeth, even in the late  scenes where we are supposed to rejoice over the match.<br />As another  reviewer noted at this site, this version is more theatre-like, the A&amp;E  version with Colin Firth more movie-like. This production cost much less  than the A&amp;E version, I bet, so the cinematography, music, and sets are  not what we expect from the movies.  On the other hand, the theatrical  style works perfectly for Austen.  The more modest sets and costumes strike  me as more nearly true to the world that Austen was out to portray, the  world she moved in.  The balls and drawing rooms in in the A&amp;E version  are on too grand and rich a scale for the gentry Austen portrays. <br />I  rejoice that two such fine productions of P&amp;P exist (the Greer Garson,  Lauren Olivier version doesn't count - too silly and too far from Austen's  novel - though Garson is sublimely beautiful).  If anyone were going to see  just one, however, this is the one I recommend.
B00000J7S8|5.0|When I first heard this CD ,I had a very limited knowledge and  appreciation of Diana Krall.The exposure was limited to a couple of tracks  on her tribute to the Nat King Cole trio,and her version of Danny Boy with  the Chieftains,on the 1999 offering,Tears of Stone,but even then something  attracted my interest...it was well placed.Diana's interpretations of these  standards,showcases her rich and husky voice,and seems to marry her jazz  vocalist roots with a more mainstream appeal.Lets face it when you have it  ,you have it,talent will always stand out. From the opening track,Lets Face  the Music and Dance with its bosanova rythms through to the mischievious Do  It Again,this is a delight.To see such classics by Cole Porter,Irving  Berlin and George Gershwin delivered with such emotion whilst relying upon  the jazz tradition is a pure delight to listen to. I have taken the  opportunity to listen to previous CDs by Ms Krall,and the performance on  this recording really should not come as a surprise. What really caught my  attention,and are the strengths of this CD,is the talent and ability of  Diana Krall as a jazz pianist,and her ability to meld her trio /quartet to  complement her delvery of the songs.In an age when production and studio  musicians cover a glaring limitation or lack of talent of many artists,Ms  Krall has it all and caresses the keys with a skill and emotion that belies  her years.If her talent as a vocalist and pianist werent enough,she has  some credits on arrangements as well. My admiration for some excellent  guitar work from Russell Malone and the bass credits shared between John  Clayton and Ben Wolfe.The atmosphere that is generated on this recording is  owed to a large extent to the talent of these gentlemen. The production on  this recording is excellent as you would expect from Tommy LiPuma and  Johnny Mandel.The overall feel of this recording just simply oozes class  that is not a readily available quality these days. The string arrangements  beautifully compliment the mood,and I think the purists can forgive me in  saying,loosen up live a little,let the jazz be accessible to everybody. A  real delight for me was to hear the Michael Franks track Popsicle  Toes,delivered with such sensual humour,it offers a new dimension to an  artist so unfairly labelled bland,thank you Ms Krall,from an old Michael  Franks fan. Whether you listen to this at dinner,when the sun rises or  sets,alone or with the one you love you are in for a rare treat.I could not  help but think of The Fabulous Baker Boys and wonder what Ms Krall could  have delivered in the vocal department!!! Above all this is an adult,smooth  and flawless performance...I had no regrets in parting with my money for  this one,and I have become a fan of this artist.I give it five stars,and  highly recommend that you listen to this with a good red wine,and a sense  of adventure.ements  beautifully compliment the mood,and I think the purists can forgive me in  saying,loosen up live a little,let the jazz be accessible to everybody.

0679746048|2.0|I picked up this book at the airport, hoping to read something that would  pass time and keep me interested during my journey.  The book was short on  length as well as other things -- like depth.  I felt like the book had a  lot to work with at the beginning -- a woman committed to an institution  because of a man's idea of gender roles, crazy characters, weird  doctors/nurses.  Unfortunately, the author never goes really far with her  topic and leaves a lot to be desired with the book.  Overrated --  Read One  Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Instead  Only read it if you like these coming  of age, depressed teenage girl books.
B00004C8TF|5.0|If you've ever wondered what recording was actually used in 2001 A Space  Odysee, look no further.  Herbert von Karajan made a recording of this  piece when this piece wasn't popular.  It was a risk, but now tends to be  one of the defining pieces of music by Richard Strauss.  Although there is  considerable hiss on this recording in the softer passages, the music is  beautiful and never overshadowed by the hiss.  The remastering by the folks  at Decca have made sure that all the pianissimos are still wonderful.  Karajan was a master of the quieter moments in a score, and teamed with the  Vienna Philharmonic doing Strauss, you have a great combination.  For  example, listen to all of track 2 and you'll know what I mean.  Of course,  that isn't to say that the louder more powerful parts aren't noteworthy.  Karajan was a master of those too.  Perhaps that's why he was the 20th  Century's greatest conductor (that's an opinion, not a fact).  It's all  captured well in this recording.  Decca has long had a tradition of fine  recordings. This remastering is superb.

However, that same span of time can be so  completely liberating, as if exposing yourself to the truth of these  horrors can free you to rise above them.  When you come to realize what  this album means, you start to see that we're all living in Radiohead's  dystopia- a world where increasing detachment from the human condition  makes us all slaves to our own collective misguided cause.  It's not about  the transports and motorways, the carbon monoxide, the yuppies networking,  or the neon sign scrolling up and down- it's about asking why those things  exist, and realizing how dead they make us feel.  OK Computer isn't a  precise formula of interwoven songs.  Radiohead themselves admit that it  isn't perfect, that it could've been tracked about a hundred different ways  and still ended up with the same theme running through it.  Personally, I  wish the still-unreleased &quot;Lift&quot; would have been included on the  album.  But complaining about this album in any way seems somehow  wrong.<br />If you're trying to decide whether to buy this album, DO IT.  I  often complain about an industry that I believe practices price fixing on  CD's, but knowing the content of this CD, I would pay exhorbitant amounts  of money to experience it.
B0000009RX|5.0|To my mind this recording contains Zappa's best blend of clever satirical  lyrics and accessible, carefully-crafted music. I can't think of any other  recording where he achieved both at the same time so consistently.  Later  in his career his humor became so broad and low as to be almost  unlistenable, and the best music was almost always instrumental.<br />My  favorite track on this CD is Absolutely Free, largely on the strength of  the unforgettable verse &quot;Dreaming on cushions of velvet and satin/By  music by magic by people that happen/To enter the world of a strange purple  jello/The dreams as they live them are all mellow yellow!&quot;<br />This  might not mean much to people who didn't live through the 60's (or who  can't remember them), but for those of us who were there, it's essential  listening.

0451526279|4.0|Emma is a touching, comeing of age story. It is about a young girl who is  close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both  good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read  all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains  more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would  recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book  that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other  novels.
6305307261|5.0|As I first saw this movie I was mesmerized, especially by Klaus Kinski's performance, which is a quality that is unfortunatly not seen much these  days, he has a wonderful way of absorbing his role. The last scene as the  vampire is with Lucy, shall forever stick in my mind, it is so strangly  romantic, that I almost feel sorry that the vampire dies.
078322608X|5.0|Time travel is an incredibly difficult subject to deal with, and Monkeys does a _superb_ job of finessing the tough logical details.  It has a very  engaging plot and for the last half of the movie you're twisting in your  seat trying (usually unsuccessfully) to anticipate what will happen next.   There are loads of hints regarding the outcome, yet I was caught completely  off-guard by the final scene.  The last line in the movie, and who delivers  it, is really a cherry on top!  As a piece of SciFi art, I put Monkeys  right up there along side 2001's rapturous celebration of the tragedy of  man qua man.
B00003BDXG|2.0|This is the kind of film that leaves you feeling cold, disgusted and depressed by the end of it.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to see this  film more than once and for many they shouldn't see it once.<br />Oliver  Stone's \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is a sick, cold, out of control movie that  attempts to show the media's selfish attitude towards violence.  The media  uses violence to get good ratings.  We all know that.  It's not a secret.  Any points this film makes about this are quickly covered in very short  sequences concerning the media and the rest of the film is just a lurid,  violent, negative trip.  It spins wildly out of control into a hole of  violence and dysfunction and it never attempts to crawl out of that hole.  The film is constantly down beat and shows no light at the end of the  tunnel but instead more darkness and depravity.  Maybe if Stone had  bothered to try and redeem the film it could have turned out better but  instead it ends on a down note.  It isn't a satire, it's to savage, to cold  and it sure as hell isn't funny.  And we don't even get the satisfaction of  seeing the two killers killed.<br />The story is about two people who go on  a violent killing spree across America.  They kill cops and people wherever  they stop without thinking twice.  They kill and kill and kill until they  eventually get caught and thrown in jail.  While in jail they end up a part  of a prison riot and at closing they are free and running away.<br />The style  the film is in is a very `70s style.  It is kind of Hunter S. Thompson to  extreme violent excess.  The film goes from black and white to colour to  green to some psychedelic image in a blink of an eye.  At first this seems  interesting but the novelty quickly wears off and it soon becomes  relentless.  I'm sorry but Oliver Stone needs boundaries when it comes to a  topic like this.  If he is free to do as he wants we end up with a film  like this.  Don't get me wrong, I think Stone is a great director.  \\"Platoon\\" is one of my all-time favourite films and I also love \\"JFK\\" and  \\"Born on the Forth of July\\" but this film is too much.  What starts out as  a point ends up as a rant and a rave.<br />The films only virtues are the  editing, Robert Downey JR's performance and one particular scene.  The  editing is incredible from a technical point of view.  It took over a year  to edit and it shows.  Downey is excellent as the British television  personality and the only good scene is the interview that Downey's  character gives to Harrelson in the prison.  I found that quite interesting  as it seems that it is the only time Stone bothers to try to get into  Harrelson's character's brain.<br />This film started out as a good idea but  turned into a film done in such a lurid manner it comes out as almost  pornographic violence.  Violence for the sake of violence.  If you want to  see a film that attacks the media but in a much more calm and in not as  violent a manner watch \\"Taxi Driver\\".  If you have a strong stomach and are  impressed by editing maybe check this out.  Others beware.<br />Thanxs....   \\"Platoon\\" is one of my all-time favourite films and I also love \\"JFK\\" and  \\"Born on the Forth of July\\" but this film is too much.

B000003BF1|4.0|Of all the Albums the Stones pumped out in the Sixties, this one is most fun to pop in, press &quot;play&quot;, and leave be.  Strange, given that  some of these songs are among the heaviest they ever attempted. &quot;Gimme  Shelter&quot; is as dark as &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, and is a  great deal murkier to boot. &quot;Love in Vain&quot;, the Robert Johnson  cover, is quite morose, and &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; is just plain  creepy.<br />But that's only half the story. &quot;Country Honk&quot; does  &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot; one better, stripping it down, and fiddling it  up. &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; starts sad but ends  hopeful. And the title track, my favorite, achieves something in the wash  of Charlie's cymbals and the laughing way Mick sings &quot;Bleed it all  right,&quot; at the end that comes the closest as the Stones ever got to an  expression of transcendant joy.  I'm not sure I buy that it was meant as a  sardonic reply to &quot;Let it Be&quot; (wasnt't this released before Let  it Be?), but it's a great song nonetheless, perfect to listen to in the  car.<br />While we're on that subject, isn't it about time we admitted that  this Beatles/Stones split is just silly? I've participated myself, I admit  (My review of Abbey Road wasn't all that thoughful and has won me no  freinds), but c'mon, it's not 1968 anymore.  I prefer the Stones, but the  Beatles were still pretty damn good. The two bands were just going in  different directions, that's all. Hey, for all the unkind things I've said  about the late Beatles, if it's a choice between them and Blink 182, I'm  all over that Octopus' Garden action.<br />But in the meantime, I've got this  gritty masterpiece to make me smile.
6305907145|1.0|If you are looking for a faithful adaptation of an Austen novel, this is not the movie for you.  There are major changes not just in the storyline  but in the basic characteristics of the major players. This is not one of  my favorite Austen works, but even so, it was a little odd seeing Fanny,  the main character, run shrieking and laughing down the stairs.  In none of  Austen's works would this be considered a polite thing to do, but  especially not here, where Fanny is supposed to be polite almost to a  fault. One could forgive this departure in trying to make the story more  appealing to modern audiences if the movie did not contain more serious  flaws.    When one decides to view a movie developed from Jane Austen's  work, one expects to be confronted with the petty foibles of humanity. What  one does not expect is that a major plot point will be the raping and  degradation of people in a subordinate culture.  It is true that such  terrible injustices occurred during this period of history; but it is much  too important a subject to be thrown haphazardly into a movie just to  create some dramatic tension.  To use it in this story is disrespectful not  only of Austen's work; it commits the far greater offense of disrespecting the unfortunate people who endured the  horrors of slavery.
B00000253N|5.0|There is a lot of introspection in the work, surprise, surprise; but its  not the Bob Dylan we expect, popping out to chastise us and society as a  whole for our shortfalls. Man, there is joy and poking fun here! The tracks  are all excellent, Bob Dylan's voice has never been better (I stand against  all the NASVILLE SKYLINE proponents), and the sheer depth of the musical  presentation is beyond anything he has presented before. I can see his  looking back in tracks such as TANGLED UP IN BLUE with a whimsical, almost  &quot;did I do that&quot; flair, while sadness within himself shows in  SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE. BUCKETS OF RAIN is a fun song- a front porch  sing-along kind of thing that endures despite time. I think thats the deal  with BLOOD ON THE TRACKS... Time be damned, we all look back, but only Bob  Dylan could do it with the style and chagrin we all love, envy and admire.  Buy it and protect it children.
B0000019PA|5.0|I am breathless, breathless, breathless.  NMH is other-worldly, the songs  leave me sad and elated and in wonder.  THere is no way to describe this  album, it's like dark carnival music and just when you think you are  understanding the story it twists away from you.  I can't get these songs  out of my head - I hum them in the shower and hear them in my dreams.  Just  when I thought there was no good music anymore.
6303257844|5.0|Speed kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Just by hearing the premise itself, you know you're in for a treat! Starring Keanu Reeves (the  Matrix) and Sandra Bullock (While You Were Sleeping), Speed is an amazing  action flick about a bus with a bomb on it; if the bus goes below 50 mph,  it will explode, killing all the people inside! While Keanu Reeves  desperately tries to come up with a plan to save the occupants and Sandra  Bullock keeps the bus moving, FBI agents are in search of our villan,  played expertly by Dennis Hopper. This movie is filled with great stunts,  laughs, and thrills; one of my favorite action films!
6302878527|5.0|What seems so clichéd now was quite ahead of its time back in 1966. The surreal opening sequence, featuring animated traffic signs floating past the screen whilst credits fade in and out, sets the mood perfectly -  complete with a beautiful Mancini theme - for a film that is somewhere  North of Comedy, but just a bit South from Drama. It's correct to assume  that very little has ever depicted a relationship so true to life.<br />The  bitter beginning shows the distance between the seemingly unhappily married  couple of Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Mark (Albert Finney) Wallace. It is  nothing short of fitting.<br />From that point on the movie jumps from  point-to-point on the time line of their relationship. The fun and  fancy-free aura of their early years to the bitter and cold homestretch, ... .<br />\\"Two For The Road\\" is certainly a far cry from anything  audiences had seen prior to that and is certainly something film makers try  to reproduce frequently - with far less success. The film is a classic in  its own right and something all movie lovers should witness. The  pain-stakingly real performance of Audrey Hepburn was no surprise and it's  also no wonder why she remains one of Hollywood's favorite leading ladies.  Albert Finney's portrayal of a loving man with a cold façade only  compliments his opposite's performance (ironically enough, it is most  evident when they clash). It's clear that this movie makes you fall in love  it it just as many times as the characters do, but you can only walk away  from it with a smile on your face for the seconds, with the couple uttering  their pet names for each other that are just as obscene as they are  romantic and driving off into the horizon, you see that even in it's  darkest hours, life is beautiful. It's hard to get that from an ordinary  movie, to say the very least.
B0000214F3|2.0|This isn't as slow as the press reviews made it. But it is slow. I loved the beautiful cinematography and the beautiful Claire Forlanni. Brad Pitt  seems like a nice person, so I don't dislike him, but I'm an actor, and I'm  a better actor than he is, and I'm better looking than he is! (As  monumentally conceited as that sounds!) And I'm out of work, and he's  making $20 million for giving sub-par performances like this one. Brad Pitt  is evidence that the cream does not rise to the top. Anthony Hopkins,  however, gives a wonderful, underplayed, natural performance.
B000002ADT|5.0|Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Buy this CD now!  Your grandchildren will thank you for it.  Take it home and listen - no computer, no phone, no  pool, no pets(OK, well maybe a cat)!  Regrettably I had never heard this  album until my father-in-law gave me the CD for Christmas.  I put this on,  sat down with a glass of wine, and was transported to another place.  Then  I read the liner notes and learned that the entire album was pretty much  one-takes.  The other musicians didn't see the charts until Miles brought  them to the studio. Amazing!  I believe another reviewer recommended  &quot;Somethin' Else&quot; as a great companion to this...I heartily agree.   I have owned the 1958 vinyl release from Blue Note for over 20 years and  never tire of listening to it.

6303367518|4.0|I had high expectations for this movie--and they were fulfilled! Meryl Streep (as normal) brings her character to life! And this time, her  character is no softie at all, like you may guess the first few minutes  into the movie. Streep plays a suburban wife named Gail with two young  children; when the family takes a vacation to a river area where Gail was  once a guide, they expect nothing but a good time. What they get is  kidnapped, by some rotten creeps who need Gail to guide them and some  stolen stuff down the river to get away from the cops. When Gail trys to  save her family and ditch the bad-guys, the audience is rewarded with tons  of amazing visuals, excellent acting, and non-stop action! Definately  reccomended.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I was expecting a good old-fashioned action/war movie when I saw U-571, unfortunately the results weren't very good. It quickly falls short with a  terrible script, awful acting, bad direction and an overly-long running  time. The great cast which includes superstars Matthew McConaughey, Bill  Paxton and Harvey Keitel even fail to make the film better. All in all,  U-571 is a terrible film, it is bound to make you sick from the obvious  historical inaccuracies and cheeziness. This is definitely one I wouldn't  rush out to see again.
6305265488|4.0|This is a cleverly done version of Cinderella, nothing profound, but Anjelica Huston absolutely steals the show as the wicked stepmother. Drew  Barrymore is surprisingly good.
0790731983|5.0|Given the brilliant, brittle stage musical by Kander &amp; Ebb as the basis for this film, who better to direct than the man with his pulse,  literally, on decadence, sexuality and self-possession: Bob Fosse?   This  movie is so seamlessly perfect that it like a model for making movie  musicals: the drama is completely, absorbingly intact, with electrifying  performances from all involved; the musical numbers both transport you to a  place a sheer nirvana in their nervy, showstopping staging, but also paint  a picture of an emotional wasteland; of falseness; of lost hope and most of  all of desperation.  While the current version of this musicalplaying on  Broadway generally tends to portray Sally as a two-bit singer, with no real  lung power (and this conceit works well), this movie gives us a kooky Sally  with real, passionate talent -- she blows you away onstage.  This makes her  particular lostness even more poignant.  The chilling Tomorrow Belongs To  Me, sung by the Hitler youth, is expertly woven into the fabric of the  movie.  A supremely satisfying visual artist, Fosse's slick, razor-sharp  moves have never been more specifically utilized to translate a real story:  here, the movie itself is choreographed, with a pop, a sizzle, a deadpan  showbizziness that is the essence of the musical's irony.  Perfection.
0425170349|5.0|What a awsome book. I am a huge Clancy fan and with a few exceptions love  all of his works. This is easily one of his best.       It has a wonderful  plot and lots of action. The pace of the book just never lets up and it is  very hard to put down.       I suggest this book to any reader who loves  books with lots of action. You won't regret buying it!!
068484267X|5.0|I loved Angela's Ashes and I recommended it to my husband who is reading  it on a long plane ride.  He just called and said that he likes it a lot  too.   It's a great book, wonderfully written, and reading it makes one  very greatful for all one has.  Greatful for all the food in the cupboard  and the warm home to live in.  Sorry that there is such a thing as  alcoholism.<br />But greatful that such hardships can produce a man who grew  up to have a sense of humor and the intelligence and motivation to write a  beautiful book about it...Highly recommended...HJK
B00004SCX6|4.0|While others may not appreciate Britney's songs, I do. She is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. I've taken the opportunity to research  backwards and forwards Britney's background, career, and yes even  competition. All in all, she ranks top of everything. Forget the rumors,  forget what the majority WANTS you to believe, and actually listen. A lot  of artists &quot;recycle&quot; or seem to, it is the nature. Here, we have  a genuine person that cares about what she does. She does it well.

B00004TWZG|5.0|I first saw The Professional on VHS about 2 or 3 years ago and LOVED IT.  Seeing it again on DVD shed some new light on how truly amazing this film  is.<br />Set in New York City, Jean Reno plays an Italian hitman named Le&oacute;n,  cold-blooded and stand-offish, who becomes the only friend of 12-year-old  Mathilde (Natalie Portman in her film debut).  After her family is gunned  down by a corrupt DOA official (semi-wacky Gary Oldman), Mathilde seeks  refuge with Le&oacute;n, taking to the streets, and becomes a sort of apprentice  in the skillful, dangerous art of &quot;cleaning.&quot;  Mathilde, in  return, teaches Le&oacute;n about love, friendship, and laughter in many of the  most precious moments captured on film.<br />Luc Besson (director) skillfully  blends drama, comedy, tragedy and action in this wonderful delight of a  movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of decency in  their heart.
0446677450|1.0|disturbing, disturbing, disturbing.  hey everybody! i have an idea!  why don't we spend all our lives obsessing over money and wealth and ignore the  truly important things in life?  i mean, doesn't that sound like wholesome  fun?  and once we do become rich, all the problems in our lives will slowly  fade away...seriously, who cares about the environment, starvation, or  moral values?  america sure doesn't!  and whatever america does has to be  right--after all, being american, i'm supposed to have strong national  pride, right?  if you haven't caught on to my sarcasm yet i pity you...i  also pity the people who actually find this book meaningful and important.  take a look in the mirror and ask yourself what is truly important in life.   live life like it was your last day on earth--i guarantee it would be the  exact opposite of what this book suggests.
B0000074FL|5.0|My original tape of this recording is an original, and I lost the felt to the head about 6 years ago.I have looked all over for this title, and just  found it here on Amazon! It is the best Lizzy title, full of hard, edgy  riffs, and Phil Lynott's amazing and poetic lyrics. The Pressure will Blow,  Hollywood, Angel of Death, are great, but if you want to look into Phil's  soul, listen to Renegade. A deeper look would mean you knew him personally.  A more troubled and short lived career probably never existed, but for a  short time, this warrior poet ruled the rock world. Never let the candle go  out.
1558807381|3.0|Legend deserves a new rating system entirely.  It is both a terrible movie and one of the great unintentional humor classics of our time, and how can  you express that with a number of stars?  The first time I saw Legend, it  took us almost five hours to watch the movie because of the amount of time  we spent laughing, then rewinding to see what we'd missed.<br />Legend is, on  the surface, a fantasy or mythological story about two innocents battling  the devil for the Future of the Free World.  However, the plot is obscure  and jumpy, so it's fortunate that it's really unimportant.<br />The best part  of this movie is the unintentional humor, which comes from so many  different sources, and is so strong that I don't hestitate to call Legend a  classic.  This movie has it all - special effects error humor (look for the  wobbling unicorn horns and the palpably visible string suspending the  Christmas tree light playing the sprite), physical humor (the marvelous  Dances with Dwarves scene, in which tin plates are hurled around to use as  (I think) reflecting mirrors), even profound questions (*why* is there only  one soul in hell, and what did he do? what is with all the screen-obscuring  things constantly drifting around - bubbles, feathers, etc.?  what's with  all the glitter?).  And on repeat viewing, more questions arise (like why  does Tom Cruise spend 90% of the movie crouching? and for pete's sake,  what's with all the GLITTER everywhere?)<br />There's no way to watch Legend  as a serious movie, but anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy the  experience enormously anyway.  Caveat: do not attempt to consume popcorn or  other refreshments while watching unless someone present knows the Heimlich  maneuver.  It's far too likely that you'll aspirate something while  laughing.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Has anyone noticed that this movie is made for women.  Almost all of my female friends LOVED it, and almost all of my male friends HATED it.  Men  were expecting something completely different (lots of WWF fighting I  guess); this movie was VERY violent, it did make you think.  The most  appealing movie I have seen in years a definite &quot;buyer&quot;.
B000002JNJ|5.0|For definitive die hard metal Pantera deliver the goods. The title track  riff is awesome and Phil Anselmo's vocals are at their best on this debut  album which gets off to a great start.  The song which makes the album for  me is `Cemetery Gates' which simply stunned me. Oozing  atmosphere from the  opening guitars Anselmo's vocals make a welcome change as he sings softly  (yup, it is possible). Breaking into a heavier riff the song doesn't forget  how it started and retreats back to the soft but sad mood. An epic  achievement, very moving, Pantera understand how to wield metal and add  that gentle touch. As for the rest of the album, your ears are going to  bleed!<br />More highlights from the album include the warp-speed `Shattered',  the brutal solo-inclusive `Heresy' and the moody `The Sleep'. A superbly  talented band, its good to see Pantera still playing razor blade metal in  an age of rap-rock.
0790734435|4.0|As an ordinary action film--one designed to sell toys at McDonalds and sedate the audience with cartoon violence--Batman Returns is an awful film.  Actually as just an ordinary film with the requisite ties to reality, it's  still awful. The script consists of grandiose scenes tied together with  plot-holes and every bit of logic in the film is badly flawed.     As a  dark, twisted, nearly-surreal fantasy however, Batman Returns just may be a  near-masterwork. The mood and look of the film are perfect--there's no  worse time to be depressed than on Christmas, and no worse place to feel  that depression in than Gotham city. So are the actors--Keaton realized  that the best way to play a larger-than-life character was to underplay  him, and his Batman and Bruce Wayne are interesting because you sense  they're always holding back. Pfeiffer's Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a terrific  performance--her mood swings, sudden bursts into giggling, and sexy  moodiness make up the definitive version of the character. And when she and  Keaton interact you see how well they go together. These are two seriously  screwed-up characters who are drawn to each other through very visible  needs.  There is no better scene (spoiler ahead) in the entire Batman  mythos than when the two, dancing together, simultaneously learn of each  other's secret identities. The music swirls as they separate and look at  each other in anguish--in the realization that their lives can never be the  same.       DeVito's Penguin is near the same league, a performance played  maximum grotesqueness and disgust. This slime drooling  freak/mutant,abandoned at birth and determined to revisit his agonies on  every new-born, is the most freakish villain Dickens never came up with.  The Penguin is living sludge, vengeful and crude. He's nothing like the  character from the comics and thank God, because the original Penguin was  the most boring villain Batman ever faced.(The Batman animated series,  throughout over 100 episodes tried to stick with the more traditional  Penguin and Catwoman--the result is that not a single interesting episode  revolves around them.)       In the end,what's most interesting about this  film is that though built as a standard studio moneymaker, it reaches such  epic heights of twisted, grotesque fantasy that one realizes the film has  turned into a much more personal vision--dark, mean-spirited(and so what if  it is? who gives a damn what bothers Leonard Maltin?) and yet deeply  sympathetic with its three star freaks. Batman, Catwoman, and the Penguin  are all drawn together: they're all damaged people, and all are put through  cycles of humiliation, disgrace, and torment. By the end Batman--unlike in  all the other films--doesn't emerge triumphant, but rather battle-scarred  and stoic about his misfortune.  All this weirdness and darkness went down  badly with the public, who found they couldn't count on the film to serve  as a babysitter--they expected the film to be like all the movies that have  McDonald's tie-ins, the brain-rotters so many parents would prefer for  their children to see rather than risk any honest confrontations with  sexuality or violence. Batman Returns isn't one of those latter films. It's  a commercial film from a major studio and a cashcow. But the vacuous  puerility and campiness of the sequels made in reaction to it by Joel  Schumacher prove that the film touched a nerve. Batman Returns is a dark,  twisted fantasy--a tragic fantasy, and a very admirable film.
6303942830|5.0|I have seen this film a number of times, and it continues to impress me with its superb casting, breathtaking cinematography, lovely and memorable  musical score, and impeccable settings.  Overall, this was one of the best  films of its decade, and I consider it to be one of the best of the past 30  years.  (I have even used this film to teach certain aspects of  videography.)  The battle scene in the valley and the siege scene give you  the feeling of what it was like to be there almost as well as the beach  scene in Saving Private Ryan let you feel that you were present at D-Day.   The picture pulls you in and carries you along; the casting and acting are  so good that you believe every character. other reviews point out the  outstanding performances, but rarely do you see such uniformly excellent  performances from top to bottom throughout a movie cast.  The movie  captures the spirit of the book well.  Michael Mann's outstanding direction  gives the last half of the movie the feeling of a headlong sprint through  the wilderness, leading to the final battle scene.  This is a  &quot;must-see&quot; for those who enjoy period movies.

6304913176|5.0|Starship Troopers is a must see movie for any fan of Science Fiction or Insecticide!  Extremely bloody, insanely hokey, this film should not in any  way be taken seriously.  Although the storyline does have some serious  elements (playing up the power of propaganda) it mostly does one thing, and  that is:  It Makes You Hate Bugs!  Put aside all the naziesque  similarities, the only over all message I got was that in any war, the  enemy is nothing but an enemy.  And it's either me or them.  It sure as  hell isn't gonna be me!<br />The special effects were what made the movie,  it's just as good on mute as it is with the sound blaring.  Pure eye candy  fun.  The gore is probably what limited this movie's success at the box  office, but it's only a movie!  The bugs aren't real!  And my weren't those  body parts realistic!  Throw in Denise Richards and you can't go wrong!  Paul Verhoeven is definitely a misunderstood genius and this movie proves  it.  An all out testosterone/adrenaline cocktail that you'll watch again  and again.  If you haven't seen it yet just buy it, there's no point in  renting it unless you like throwing away money.  This is a solid video  purchase for any home collection.  Especially if you have any insect  phobias!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|i think this movie ius another hit <br />with the pour wether in the winter this              <br />is a great<br />movie to wach
1561007773|3.0|Okay, loved The Wizards First Rule, but I wasn't too happy about the end of Stone of Tears. It was way too easy! Richard kills the Sister of the  Dark and doesn't send his Daddy to the nether regions of hell, which he'd  already been warned severly of doing. I understand Goodkind was going for  emotion, but in doing so he left the whole thing unsatisfying. I felt  betrayed. I mean, I've read enough books to know you never really kill off  a main character like Kahlan, so ,to me, the emotional battle was  secondary. Richard had it too easy.
B00003CX5P|5.0|i like all the star wars films they are all <br />my faverite movies i like scifi <br />movies
B000001G16|4.0|I have always suspected Ritchie of being a fine musician, more than his  work in Bon Jovi would allow one to guess,and this album was a welcome  confirmation.Filled with very competent guitar work and lots of feeling-on  top of that add his excellent voice,this is a total coup.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|i like the whole series<br />i think the evil dead  series<br />is a great horror movie
B000024D4R|5.0|I bought this when it first came out in '77 and instantly fell under it's  spell. I dont really have a 'favorite' Floyd album, but this is the one  that probably had the most impact on me.  Waters' lyrics are fabulous, dark  and cynical, some of his best. Not a happy record, but still a great one.  Very atmospheric and moody.  But the best thing about this album is David  Gilmour! His solos on &quot;Dogs&quot; are goosebump material, and the  'swine noises' he makes with his guitar through a talkbox on  &quot;Pigs&quot;, are the best use of that effect I've ever heard. Gilmour  is one of the all time greats, he can say more with one note than a hundred  other 'guitar heroes' say with twenty. And I'm pretty sure it's Dave who  wrote and played the great bass part on &quot;Pigs&quot;, as well.  &quot;Sheep&quot; is the weakest track, but it has some stunning vocal  effects, and a cool keyboard intro. I've owned this album on 8-track,  vinyl, and now CD, and I still love it. If you are a Floyd fan you must  have this. If your not a Floyd fan, please dont buy it. I'm sure you'll  hate it.
B00004U2A1|5.0|i think evil dead 2 is a great movie <br />to wach on a cold evening
1571200851|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift, as I am always trying something new. While  not traditionally Japanese, this book has wonderful techniques, beautiful  photography and instructions.  The projects included offer a wide range of  intrest.  It has generated my &quot;creative juices&quot; and I can't wait  to get started. All quilt enthusists should add this one to thier  collection.
B000000WA4|5.0|This double disc has to be considered the greatest effort from the Smashing Pumpkins.  It was a bold and risky move for them to release a more  expensive album for consumers when they could've just released a single LP  with bascially the hits at a cheaper price.  Thankfully, they didn't do  this.  The songs here are very different from one another, but each holds  immense emotion, and this makes it a success without question.  The  experimental, somewhat techno-vibe of &quot;1979&quot; became one of the  band's biggest hits, while other rock epics like &quot;Bullet With  Butterfly Wings&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; became radio and  music television staples.  I find some of the best moments though come from  the songs not heard on the radio or always played at concerts.   &quot;Muzzle&quot; and &quot;We Only Come Out At Night&quot; should've been  hits because of the honesty Corgan exerts as he reflects on childhood and  thinks of the meaning his life has.  Two other solid tracks are the light  and beautiful &quot;In The Arms Of Sleep&quot; and the positive mid-tempo  rocker &quot;Here Is No Why,&quot; which has a great chorus speaking of  optimism.  Some of the songs also have a true, roaring hard rock vibe that  continues from start to end, and the best of these are probably  &quot;Bodies,&quot; &quot;Tales Of A Scorched Earth,&quot; and &quot;F-ck  You (An Ode To No One).&quot;  Corgan's softer and even more experimental  side comes out in both discs on the many love epics like &quot;Porcelina Of  The Vast Oceans,&quot; &quot;Lily (My One And Only),&quot; and  &quot;Beautiful.&quot;  The love songs are very mushy and remind me of soft  rock, but they do show how much variety exists on MELLON COLLIE AND THE  INFINITE SADNESS.  No matter what happens with the cloudy future of this  band, this epic double release will be one of the 90's best pieces of rock  music, and it also may bring new fans who can hear the many sides of the  Pumpkins just through this album.
6305823839|4.0|The film just blew me away. I had previously been involved with this world although I was not an active participant with H. I have seen how heroin  effects a person's judgement. Wild things can happen! Suprisingly it did  not affect the person's intellectual abilities. So make what you can out of  it.
B000002U9L|5.0|the film came out in the year i was born (1986) and i have been an  obsessive david bowie fan ever since i first saw it when i was 6.the cd  does the brilliant film justice.&quot;as the world falls down&quot; has  brought me to tears many atime (lol) and its the best soundtrack ever.
B000003CKH|5.0|I first heard Fashion Nugget about 5 years ago and I was listing to the cd  still today! I know alot of these reviews are people who really like cake  and are of course gonna say they like them but if you have never heard them  or are not fimialiar with ALL of there songs them buying this cd is the  next step. Unlike most Cd's this cd's songs are all amazing and I really  mean that. Cake has a way of expessing feeling and emotion into every song  and people over look that. The songs are all amazing and for some reason  you will be humming them in your head all day until you get home to hear  them!!! Don't question buying this Cd It might be the best Cd you ever  bought. It was for me!
0800141601|5.0|One of the best movies in this category, highly recomended.
0441172717|5.0|Most people interested in sci-fi has heard of Frank Herbert's Dune series,  not as many has acctualy read it. This is a sad mistake on their part. The  main thing about Dune though is that you don't have to be &quot;in to  sci-fi&quot; to enjoy it. What makes it such a excellent work is not the  sci-fi part but F Herbert's eye for details. The way he tells his stories  has many times been compared to Tolkien and many other great authors,  mainly for this reason. The reader is taken on a journey filled with  legends, side stories and plots, told in unique way - the Frank Herbert  way.<br />One should however not ignore the sci-fi aspect of this work to  easliy. Instead it should be seen as something that takes Dune to even  greater heights - the heights that won it both the HUGO and the NEBULA  award.<br />Dune lets us follow the young to-be-Duke Paul of the house  Atreides to the planet Arrakis (Dune) as his father, the Duke, is given the  govering rights of the planet. Arakkis is however not just any planet - it  is the only planet that has the melange - the spice. &quot;He who controlls  the spice controlls space travels&quot;. As such it is a great source of  power, and thus the house of Atreides will not go unchallenged. What will  happen to the young duke, to the planet Dune and to the original inhabitans  of the world. There is only one way to find out, and it involves a lot of  reading - time to considered well spent.
6305807086|1.0|I, too, waited with baited breath for this DVD to arrive - thinking that I had a rare comedic treat in store.  Instead I found a plot that is plain  old bizarre.  While I did get a laugh or two, I couldn't find anything to  write home about.  I have to wonder if the movie-going public is so  desperate for entertainment that ANYTHING the least bit different is  greeted with cudos.  The friend that I watched it with agreed with me that  it was strange.  Neither one of us enjoyed it and, indeed, wondered what  drugs Jonze was on.<br />Frankly, I thought it didn't have a plot.  The  charactors are pretty much disagreeable.  And, it's not very funny.   Different, yes.  Good, no.  Maybe I don't get it?  Maybe I have  pedestrian tastes in movies?   Whatever it is, this is not one I want to  watch again.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I went into this flick not expecting much. But, right from the start I was glued to ths edge of my seat. It's a cool, well written, well directed and  well acted thrill ride. Clearly the best sci-fi horror flick since Aliens.
B000002WYT|5.0|I used to hate Dave Matthews when this cd first came out. Back then I was  about 13 or 14. But now that I'm older, this album is always in my cd  player. I mean it fits every situation and feeling that I'm in and I can  just relate to everything it has to say. Dave is truly amazing in his  ability to write astounding words and come up with moving rhythms.  &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; is my favorite song on &quot;Crash&quot; and  is my favorite song in general. The song talks about being merry throughout  life as if there were no tomorrow. But anyways...for all those who are  thinking twice about buying this cd, don't even think; pick it up and  listen.
6304025831|4.0|I am a lifelong diehard Deniro fan as well as a diehard Pesci fan. After a look at the cast of Casino, you might be thinking of it as a sequel to  Scorsese's earlier film, Goodfellas. I felt that in many ways, Scorsese  attempted to do everything in Casino that he did not do in Goodfellas. The  result? A good movie, but nowhere near deserving the ammount of acclaim  that Goodfellas received. For one thing, Casino drags much more than  Goodfellas. Casino is two tapes of wiseguy action, yet gets very  repetitive. The film examines the inner workings of a Las Vegas casino run  by Deniro who plays a very good role as a cardshark and expert gambler.  From this description, it is hard to find any weak spots. Perhaps if  Scorsese had trimmed some of Casino I would have rated it a firm 5 stars.  One breath of fresh air is Sharon Stone's great performance as Ginger, a  cardshark herself not to mention a temptress. Bottom line, if you are a fan  of Deniro, Pesci or just the Mob, this film is worth seeing.
048622709X|3.0|Bridgman gets a lot of credit for his mastery as an illustrator.  Nevertheless, as a tool this book would have been more useful with  photographic references of hands in various positions. By using Bridgman's  illustrations as a guide, you end up simply aping his style to some extent.  The end result is like when you photocopy a photocopy: a little grainier,  much muddier version of the original.
B00003CWTI|5.0|My initial screening was on video.  I found myself thinking of many negative descriptors while watching the movie through.  &quot;Too  much&quot; &quot;Too serious&quot; &quot;Weak point&quot;,  &quot;Ridiculous&quot;, &quot;Too sentimental&quot;...but in the end  &quot;Wow&quot;.  By movies end, I was captivated.  Performances as well as  story turns had me at times amused, at times entranced, and at times, in  tears.  Odd movie, to say the least.  But one with subtle -- sometimes  hidden -- impact.  Agreed, you need some patience and open mindedness to  appreciate this one, but in the end, I found it well worth the effort.  I  wish I would have seen it in the theater.  Highly recommended.
B00004TWZG|5.0|Despite repeated viewing of this movie I cannot fully determine why it works so well when compared against dozens of similar works released each  year.<br />I suspect that, unlike many of his American counterparts, Luc  Besson developes the characterisation of the leading players without  lapsing into the schmaltzy sentimentality that often ruins many potentially  great competitive titles.<br />Jean Reno excels as a functionally illiterate  hitman lumbered with the custodianship of newcomer Natalie Portman whose  character - despite her age - possess all the wily street smarts of a  native New Yorker many years her senior.<br />Gary Oldman is, well, Gary  Oldman. His drug influenced behaviour stole the show for me. One really  never knew how he was going to respond in any situation and, as such, came  across as a truly frightening personality.<br />It seems that Besson has  successfully sneaked into the back yard of America to produce, with a  distinctly European style, a standout movie that has traditionally been the  prserve of Hollywood. And has done it better!
6305823839|5.0|Few movies ever make me laugh out loud, let alone feel the need to look over my shoulder hoping no one recognized that it was me laughing at THAT!   I loved this movie.  One of the blackest of black comedies that has drawn  me back again and again.  And even under multiple viewing, the story, the  acting, the film as a whole, holds up tremendously.  Granted, you might  have to be slightly demented, yourself, to fully appreciate this film, but  if you haven't been scared off yet, loosen up those butt cheeks and ride  this one through.  Highly recommended.
B000000OEI|5.0|Not many scores are noted for elevating a movie's value to an extent that  the movie by itself won't do as good with the score in combination. This is  one of those scores that MUST be in the movie in order for its survival.  Known for countless movie trailer music, Crimson Tide defined the 90's  music genre. It started a new and diverse way of conducting music. It uses  a repeated piece of music throughout the soundtrack in variations reminding  you of the theme. It holds five tracks, a couple of them super-long, yet  enjoyable to the very most. Indeed an inspiring movie score from the very  popular Hans Zimmer, this is the CD to get for an action packed ride  through your ears.<br />Vulcan, the Leveler aka the Vulcan
B00001NFCY|5.0|I don't know what is wrong with everyone, but I was reading the reviews,  and all most all of them are negative.  If you don't like Creed, then don't  write a review!  I have had this album ever since it came out, and love it.   They give a positive message, with out all the cussing other bands use.   The latest single, With Arms Wide Open, is a beautiful song written about  his little son.  Every song has a good meaning to it.  For those of you who  can't see that.. I am sorry.
B00003CX95|5.0|You will never ever boring every time you see this movie. Mel Gibson was acting his role from his heart and you will see how the scottish people was  suffering form the english...<br />Don't think, go and buy it right away..!
0684874350|5.0|After reading the first few chapters of this book, you will be tempted to  abandon this exercise in emotional stabitlity.  For it is not easy reading  for those who are compassionate and prone to vivid imaginings. Once you  start reading, however, you take on a mission.  You need to see Frank  through all his difficult times and assure yourself he will not succomb to  such deprivation. You are at one with this child in his search to 'be'  where he must first survive.   This book is a wakeup call to the complacent  who refuse to hear the 'silent needs' of the very young.  It serves to  remind us that all children, then and now, desperately need a sense of  belonging and a source of security. It illustrates the ability of a boy to  derive the simplest of joys in the weariest of circumstances. Final note:  You will be less self-consumed as you reach the end of the text.  You will  probably set a box of tissues adside as preparation for the finale. This is  not necessary. The ending is anti-climatic in contrast to the emotional  echoes rendered within. <br />&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a book full of  wonder and dismay.  It is an experience not to be denied.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is the most fabulous album I have heard in years. The first song on  the album,&quot;Riding With The King&quot;, was reminiscent of my growing  up years in the 50's,---listening to and dancing to the smooth velvet songs  of the South. I can't imagine any other two musicians making such a  marvelous mix.  There is nothing more exciting that a student and teacher  jamming together. When listening, I can feel all the emotions these two  musical geneouses are protraying.  The only thing I wish is that my son  could have been the drummer on the CD. It would have been so exciting for  him to have experienced a life long dream of his, to play with the best. I  only hope in the future, the duo will make a live performance on TV with  some of the songs from this album.
B000000OPW|5.0|Pushed ahead by the successful single (based on the Pompeii volcano  eruption) &quot;Cities in Dust,&quot; Tinderbox was the first of SatB's  albums to reach the top 100 album charts. It is the group's creative peak.  Peepshow failed to venture too far into the mesmeriziing quality that made  Tinderbox famous, while Superstition fell too far into electronica and the  Rapture was mostly  manic depressive. The strong points here remain Sioux's  powerful voice, and Steve Severin's (Bass/Keyboards) solid playing and  songwriting. Drummer Budgie supplies nice touches, like the marimba's in  &quot;Land's End,&quot; one of the better tracks. John Carruthers, the  band's guitarist (who was mysteriously sacked) does great playing.  &quot;Candyman&quot; and &quot;This Unrest&quot; are unforgiving rock tunes  with brutal lyrics, the former blasting child abuse. Other songs, such as  the terrifying &quot;92°&quot; and the &quot;Cities in Dust&quot; b-side  &quot;Execution&quot; instill a sense of impending dread, the latter's  ringing piano echoing till the very end. The former's tone is set by the  dialogue at the very beginning. &quot;Lullaby&quot; has odd orchestral  manouvers, and &quot;The Sweetest Chill&quot; is a dense and swirling  masterpiece. With the acoustic chorus of &quot;Cannons&quot; and the  seemingly misplaced &quot;Party's Fall,&quot; which showcases Sioux's rare  vulnerability, Tinderbox can enlighten, as well as disturb. All the guitar  riffs, the often multiple vocals, strong rhythm section come together  remarkably, more so than the manic depressive Hyeana. It proves as one of  the most remarkable triumphs of the decade.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is Radiohead's tragic masterpiece. Every song is genius, though I  have a special affinity for Paranoid Android as it is the song that first  made me fall in love with the band. But this isn't a collection of separate  songs, and it is certainly not background music--it is one connected story,  and a sad one at that, lamenting the slow demise of real humanity as we let  machines take over our lives, imploring us to save ourselves from the fate  of &quot;the yuppies networking&quot; if we can. Besides the brilliant  melancholy lyrics, the music itself is awesome, and Thom's voice as usual  is the beautiful centerpiece of it all.   Compared with The Bends, OK  Computer is heavier, more difficult, more depressing, and often less  hooky--and it is all the more stunning for it. The Bends (which I also  LOVE), while its lyrics certainly don't tend to be upbeat, is easier to  listen to, and is much better as background music (though it should be  appreciated as more than that) than OKC.   More than anything else, OK  Computer is a work of brilliant musical art--buy it now. As for whether  Radiohead can top this, it may not be possible, but I don't care. I eagerly  await whatever else they have in store. They are the best.

6300214753|5.0|This is a classic, worthy to be on the most avid film collector's shelf.  Matthew Broderick is priceless as the all-knowing Ferris, playing hooky one  last time before graduation.  Alan Ruck plays Cameron Frye, his best  friend, who gets coaxed into the fun and frolicking.  Mia Sara is also  stunning as Ferris' main squeeze &quot;Sloane Peterson&quot; but perhaps  the funniest character in this movie is Jennifer Grey who plays Ferris'  younger sister Jeanie. She is constantly trying to get him &quot;caught in  the act &quot; of skipping school, but in the end comes to his aid. A must  for all students and teachers to see.
6305657947|3.0|The original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR had high drama; Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway really knew how to keep up the suspense.  The remake is cuter and  livelier, but this doesn't make it better.  A certain restrained aura about  the original flick gives it a tenseness that we share; the remake is too  active, jumbled, does too many things at once.  I wish someone would tell  me why Hollywood engages in so many remakes of perfectly fine movies.  If  the answer were: &quot;to take a fine movie and make it better in one  respect,&quot; I'd applaud.  Sometimes a classic movie can be made better.   Suppose the original is in black-and-white; maybe color would make the  remake better (or maybe not).  Maybe the flaw in the original was an ending  imposed by the old Hollywood code; a more satisfying and realistic ending  in the remake would be a good reason to remake the movie.  My fear,  however, is that the producers these days who want to remake an old movie  have no idea what it is about the old movie that they can improve.  In  short, they have no imagination, no artistic vision, just a desire to  remake a movie.  Maybe they hope that some people will see the title 'THE  THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' and say, &quot;Hey, I've heard of that, it's supposed  to be pretty good,&quot; and buy the DVD and, to their surprise, it's not  the movie they heard of but just the remake.  I bet BEDAZZLED is another of  these disappointments, though I haven't seen it; but I can hardly imagine  improving on the great original BEDAZZLED.  I'm a sucker for these remakes,  because I keep wondering how they could have improved on the original, and  49 times out of 50 I'm disappointed.  Bottom Line: See one of the THOMAS  CROWN AFFAIR movies, preferably the original, but the remake is OK; if you  see the remake first and you like it, you're in for a treat with the  original!
158234082X|5.0|Speaking as a chef, this book ROCKS!  I absolutely devoured (pun intended)  it from cover to cover.  I've worked in kitchens that are carbon copies to  the ones Mr. Bourdain speaks of.  If you are looking for an accurate, no  holds barred account of life in the culinary industry, look no further.   Besides, anyone who has the guts to call that ridiculous Emeril LaGasse  &quot;ewok-like&quot; certainly has my vote!
0783242808|2.0|OK let's see...4 high schoolers who try to get laid before they graduate. Haven't we been down this road way too many times before? Enough times to know the outcome before the opening credits even finish. Now that we know  the plot, let's talk performances. This movie signaled the official  typecasting of Jason Biggs as a loser who can't buy a date who ends up a  winner in the end(His next movies, Boys and Girls and Loser are basically  American Pie ripoffs with less sex with pastry). Mena Suvari, however, was able to put her  average performance behind her after her brilliant acting in American  Beauty.   Simply put other than a few clever jokes and out-in left-field  sight gags, American Pie was simply just another oversexed teen flick. You  can only beat a dead horse for so long before it's no longer fun,<br />ACS
0767824571|1.0|Not enough good laughs - too many slow, awkard, corny moments.
B00000FBRE|5.0|I have been a punk fan for as long as i can remeber, mostly listeng to  bands like NOFX, Goldfinger,Pennywise, Blink 182's old stuff,MxPx,and a lot  of other great bands like that. I had always heard that lagwagon was a  great band but didn't get around to buying one of their albums till the  other day. The reason i picked this one was cause it was on sale. At first  i thought this cd was okay, but after listening to it a few time i started  to really like it. Lagwagon is a great band, for any punk fan.they kinda  remind me of no motiv, but faster. Buy this cd.
0784011214|5.0|THis is one of the greatest action movies I've ever seen...especially coming out of the 80's!   Sly is great in the series...and this one is one  of the best Sly movies I've ever seen, if not the best.
B00000IBRX|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it is soooo moving visually. It is such a wonderful movie. The actors are incredible, the feelings are too. The  writter i could tell put soooo much thought into this movie. This beyond  what i would have imagined about this movie are here. The questions of life  and death, heaven and hell, and god all seemed to come up. Everyone  questions these things and this writter wrote what he thought it was like.  Its a beautiful movie. From an artist point of view it is inspirational. I  have never been so inspired by a movie. Everything is soooo beautiful to  look at. Robin williams brings a funny spin to a serious movie. It's a  really enjoyable movie for anyone who likes movies that make you think!
B0000047BA|5.0|When the movie came out, a modern film noir, the stand out features to me  were the script and the music. Here I'll talk about the music. What superb  contempary music that fits well in the with long summer days as the human  drama the unfolds before the eyes. The vocals, by John Lee Hooker, gives a  painful objurgation at human nature. The cool/blue horn of Miles Davis  gives a solitary notion of a individual human struggling with his passion  and greed. Add Roy Rogers and Taj Mahal guitars' accretions too this  poignancy, you have a melancholy that is aggraviting existence. Even Track  #11 &quot;Murder&quot; seems a delight blow to the conscience.
B00004XPQL|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie so much, it was amazing, very well made.  It kept me at the edge of my seat while I watched it at the movie theatre,  everyone I know has seen it, and I can't wait to own it, I love it, a must  see for everyone and everyone who likes horror suspense, please go rent it  or buy it you will not be dissapointed.
1573225517|5.0|That may sound cliche, but it's true.  &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is a book I bought more out of a lack of choice - I was in an airport about to go on  an 11 hour flight, and it was that or some lame Robin Cook medical  thriller!   I knew I loved the movie, but I thought for some reason I  wouldn't like the book.  For the first like, 25 pages, I didn't even enjoy  reading the book.  But then I suddenly GOT Nick Hornby's sense of humor,  and the book was hilarious!  I read it probably twice during my trip, and  I've read it a couple times since then.  Right now it's on loan to a  friend, and I know she'll love it too.  There are too many funny parts to  even rememeber them all, but I just thought of the one where Barry joins a  band - and by coincidence it is called Barrytown?  Well, I would HIGHly  recommend this book, no pun intended. :)
6304083769|4.0|Ok this movie is great, and the story is very action packed.  It also has a sort of deeper aspect to it with the whole ghost story (you have to see  the movie to understand).  The only reason I gave this movie four stars (I  actually would have given four and 1/2 but I can't) is because of the  nudity.  While it isn't sexual it is gratutious.  Whenever a person uses  invisibility they have to take off their cloths.  It gets a little  annoying.  The rest of the movie is good though, and I would say that this  would at least get a PG-13.
0316777722|2.0|I decided to order this book after hearing the author read two of the  chapters on national Public Radio (NPR). Both chapters covered his life in  France. It seemed quite a novel idea; an American sharing his experiences  on life in France, unsuccessfully trying to come to grips with the vagaries  of the French language. On each occasion, the stories were very witty, and  delivered superbly. On this basis, and on the understanding that the book  would be &quot;more of the same&quot;, I decided to order it without delay.  Unfortunately, I found the book very disappointing. Why? First, the number  of words per dollar is very low. Okay. Never mind. What else? Second, only  2-3 chapters (toward the end of the book) are devoted to the challenges of  life in France. The rest covers the authors' earlier years in the USA, and  is not in the same league as what I heard on NPR. Overall, the book cannot  be described as &quot;funny&quot;. The chapters are generally unrelated to  each other, merely representing a relatively disjointed collection of  anecdotes lacking a true punchline or meaning. It took me approximately  three hours to read the book, and I felt no enlightenment or fulfillment  afterwards. Repeatedly, I gained the impression that the author is trying  to emulate Bill Bryson. The problem is that he does this very  unsuccessfully. Perhaps I should just blame NPR for giving an entirely  false impression of the book.
0812523334|4.0|The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects  on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War.  While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four  daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo,  Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war. The four  girls must learn many lessons in life and grow up to be fine women even  during hard times. The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true  friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to  marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt.  However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and  focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes  you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the  experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why  i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless  classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book. I enjoyed the  book alot.
0800103661|5.0|This movie was brilliant, it had a story that was both simple as it was complex. Everything about this movie breathes science fiction, but if you  look at the state our current society and technology is in, you will notice  the frightening world of Gattaca is not as far as it seems.<br />The setting  is beautifully done, every image gives you the idea you're living in a  stylish new society, as if your looking at the designs for the image of our  own future. <br />Everything is big, yet the characters remain small and still  interesting enough to carry the story. In the world of Gattaca you are a  mere number, but in this impersonal world you actually see that the  characters are not all robots in a society that has made rules by which all  must live, but individuals that wish to break those rules and find their  own personality in an endless sea.<br />Any inteligent human being that loves  sci-fi must have seen this movie at least once.
B00000099Y|5.0|Following on from Opiate and Undertow, Aenima again sets the standard for  a unique alt-metal music category.  This album would have to be my all time  favourite, and it's one of those CD's that I don't get sick of.  The depth  and texure of this album is amazing, and the filmclips show the thought and  energy that this album delivers.  Tool are a band that are very powerful,  and leave your head repeating some of their frearsome riffs.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Come on now, it's only entertainment! I especially like the &quot;Bonnie  and Clyde&quot; song. I don't advocate killing anyone, but I know the  feeling when someone tries to keep your children from you. Even &quot;Just  Like Me&quot; has the tongue in cheek everyday sarcasm  people use.
0440178002|5.0|This was one (if not the) best book I have ever read. Clavell weaves this  masterpiece of adventure, lust, war, and history  into a novel that keeps  the reader in a state of utter suspence for all 1152 pages. On every page  of the work, the story thickens and a new twist in the plot is revealed.
0780631684|5.0|All I really have to say is that Final Destination was the best movie ever made.  A horror movie starring Devon Sawa... what could be better?  Even  those who aren't fans of his are sure to love it.... Thrilling,  suspenseful, and definitely scream-worthy... can I give it six stars?
0380973464|3.0|This is such a long book that I'll keep this short: it is a great book for the first quarter, a good book by the time you hit the halfway point, an  interesting book at three quarters, and a terrible dissappointment at the  end.<br />   Mr Stephenson should get a better editor, because at over 900  pages, this is no way to end a book.
B00000DHTF|5.0|You could just buy it for Loose Ends: it brought tears to my eyes the  first twenty times I listened to it.  Thundercrack, Restless Nights, an  unsettling version of Born in the USA, Cynthia, and Janey Don't Lose Your  Heart are only a few other highlights.  You have never heard Bruce sound so  innocent as in the better version of Mary Queen of Arkansas than in  &quot;Greetings From Asbury Park&quot; included on this album.  Even for a  regular Bruce fan this box set is a must have.  There is so much more to  &quot;Tracks&quot; than the highlights included in &quot;18 Tracks&quot;.   Advice to those who are considering buying &quot;18 Tracks&quot; in  addition to this box set for the two extra songs: don't bother.  Just get  Napster and download both songs. Don't fall for the money making trap.
0671034065|5.0|After the first chapter I had to get up and get a box of tissues.  I think  I pulled a muscle laughing so hard.  I can relate to Janine, I don't know  how many times my husband hasn't had me half scared out of my skin and like  Sam it was never on purpose.  It was a good mystery, which maybe we all  figured out quickly, but I still got attached to the four list makers.   Sometimes the tissues didn't just wipe away the mirth.  As usual thank you  Linda for some hours of great enjoyment.  PLEASE KEEP IT UP!!!
B000000OSE|4.0|This is definatly the album to get if you are a G n R fan,mixing heavy  rock(double talking jive,right next door to hell) with classic songs (don't  cry, november rain)until a new album comes along buy this one!
B00004T9VY|5.0|Yeah, I know. How can we still adore the music from someone whose own recent public pronouncements belie the dreamy humanism and tolerance of the  lyrics in these songs. After thirty years of listening to this, it still  puzzles me that anyone capable of writing such beautiful lyrics and such  enchanting melodies and arrangements could himself become so rigid and  intloreant. Go figure! Yet the music remains, folks, a monument to late  sixties-early seventies consciousness, a pillar to the edifice of the of  the whole notion that we could change the world and make it a better, more  tolerant, and more humane place to live in. All the music here is  wonderful, and I can listen to the album without missing a lovely beat,  from \\"Where Do the Children Play?\\" to the closing \\"Tea For The Tillerman\\".  Even the cover art by Cat himself, a gentle recollection of popular English  dinnerware art of the fifties, contributes to the mood here. My own  personal favorites are \\"But I might Die Tonight\\", a passionate reminder to  would-be workaholics of the dangers of a life poorly lived, \\"Into White\\", a  dreamy ballad, and \\"Father And Son\\", a provocative look at the generation  gap of the times. This terrific album is a reminder that sometimes art  rises above the level of its all too human creator. Enjoy!
B0000029AL|5.0|From the opening lines: &quot;good evening people welcome to the  show&quot; to the funky blues cover &quot;walking the dog&quot;, this Raw  and energetic debut from Aerosmith grabs the listener and does not let go.   This cd has all the attitude of the Rolling Stones and the same ability to  be better than the sum of their parts.  The highlight here is &quot;Dream  on&quot;. The song gets massive classic rock radio airplay and still  remains fresh today.  &quot;Mama Kin&quot; is the next best song.  It's  hard driving rhythm and catchy chorus keeps this boogie enjoyable for  repeated listens.  &quot;Make it&quot;, &quot;One Way Street&quot;, and  &quot;Movin' Out&quot; are memorable blues-oriented hard rock songs that  hold up well today. The rest of the cd is strong without a single weak  track.  If you are an Aerosmith fan, you know its a great listen.  If you  dont have it,  get it because you wont be disappointed.  This is a great  classic rock cd that should be in any collection.
B000002GQK|5.0|This is the first of the &quot;post-concept&quot; album releases of the  fabulous group that had first put the vital and exciting new sound of  synthesized music on the map and integrated it with such mastery with the  wall of dreamy electric sound they are so famous for. After exhausting the  field of concept albums with four or five in a row, commencing with \\"In  Search Of The Lost Chord\\" and ending with \\"Question Of balance a few  breathless years later, the group finally retired in the early 1970s to  regain their energy and momentum, and eventually released this new album,  which features a wide range of terrific songs written by each of the band  members, but really lacking any unifying theme other than the interesting  word play on the musical scale with the album's title of Every Good Boy  Deserves Favor i.e., first letter of each of the words in the title works  out to EGBDF, or the musical scale. Nothing like historical musical trivia  to spark up a review!<br />There is a lot of good listening here, and a lot of  musical virtuosity, especially with Mike Pinder on the Moog synthesizer,  but also with great electric guitar and bass work by Justin Hayward and  John Lodge, respectively, and also with terrific work by Graham Edge on  drums and Ray Thomas on a variety of wind instruments.  Of course, \\"The  Story In Your Eyes\\" was the smash single driving the album up the charts,  and every song from The Procession\\" to the final \\"My Song are quite good.  My own personal favorites are \\"The Story In Your Eyes and a terrific song  that never got any air time at all, \\"You Can Never Go Home Again\\" written  and sung by Justin Hayward. By the way, Justin and John (Lodge) later  released a interesting album called \\"Blue Jays\\" that I would love to see  come out on CD. While it is an uneven album, there are four or five songs  in it that truly deserve to see the light of day again, and unfortunately  they never play any of them in concert. As far as this album is concerned,  in my humble opinion it is a definite keeper. Enjoy!d,  in my humble opinion it is a definite keeper. Enjoy!
0440224764|2.0|The majority of the reviews are pretty accurate.  You do feel like your  reading one LONG ending.  But I chalk that up to style.  It was just  different.  I don't want to criticize Grisham as this is the first book I  have read of his (I'm not a big fiction reader), but something is missing.  However, overall it is an okay read....unitl the end that is.  The last  three pages of the book absolutely ruined it for me.  A man (Patrick) who  has thought this far ahead and executed as he did throughout would NEVER  have been in a position to let something like that happen.  It left just  too sour a taste in my mouth. All that reading......and 3 pages ruined it!
B00003Q43A|2.0|One of the most dissapointing movies I've ever seen. I waited over 6 hours in line to see the sneak preview of this film. While initially excitited by  the dope special effects, the movie quickly turns into mindless drool. I  recommend the 1st 20minutes, but nothing after that.
B000002G60|5.0|It is common to see evolution of an artist going from folk-rock towards  jazz tendencies. In S.V.'s case, it is a good surprise. This album has  humour. A sort of &quot;dark humour&quot;, if you want.<br />Mister Sax would  be proud: Suzanne Vega ont his album just sounds like New York City !   Although different from her previous works, this cd has some particular  merits. First of all, the sound is wonderful, near lifelike (hear those  cymbals, and that bass!), and her voice seems to 'get out' like never  before (her previous records had excellent sound, as well).<br />Second, the  quality of &quot;musical constructions&quot; is admirable. And a song such  as 'The World Before Columbus' will surely recall some older (more 'folk')  material, a nice touch. I also give it five stars because it received,  justifiably, some rave reviews - even the the pages of The Abso!ute Sound !   Still, an album that won't leave your mind without some considerations:  you like it or you hate it, the choice is yours...
6305075468|5.0|Murnau's incredible film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is one of the, in my opinion, two greatest German silent films ever produced. The second being  the Cabinet of Dr.Caligari. It so eloquently expresses what Bram Stoker  wrote into his novel. Fear, paranoia, mystery, and intrigue. Schreck's  performance of the hideously gruesome Count Orlok will forever leave an  indeilble imprint in my mind. Furthermore, the use of lighting and early  special-effects add incredible atomsphere and wonder to the viewer. All in  all, the film plays with the viewer's psyche. It pulls you forward,it pulls  you back. It challenges you to think abotu your neighbors. It challengess  you tothink about your family and friends. A must see for all of humanity.
B00001SIES|4.0|One thing before I review the album: I shall not write once the word - a  name of a certain band - which has been overused in these review pages;  let's just put it down as a swear word for the moment. Now, the album:  Showbiz, by MUSE - not the other bands. Let's just focus on that for a  second, not all the extraneous minutiae plaguing the discussion. It rocks -  in an intense, arty, epic manner.  Granted, the lyrics are relatively  simple and betray their only recent emergence from their teenage years (all  three of them). However, there is no crippling detriment to the places  where the music takes us at all - enough feeling is imparted on to the  songs as to give us a potent emotional rush. Oh, yes, the songs, the music  ! Much has been made of the first two tracks, but the standouts here are  &quot;Uno&quot;,&quot;Sober&quot; and &quot;Fillip&quot;. On these  rockfests, Muse infuses an energy of a kind seldom found in music being  made right now. It's intelligent rage; spaced-out earthiness. The more  ballad-type tracks also resonate strongly, displaying a songwriting talent  not to be sneezed at. There are fewer &quot;weird sound effects&quot; here,  but this does not detract from this record - it is another reason to  discard the omnipresent comparisons. I believe this band deserves much more  respect than it currently has. Enjoy the music for what it is -  high-quality rock music - get this CD and you won't be disappointed.
0790740443|4.0|I'm sure this was a tough role for Kurt Russell to play, having to get across the lions share of his emotions with body language, and through his  eyes since he has so little dialogue.  For me, at least, it worked.  His  character, Todd, speaks only when absolutely necessary, which isn't too  often, and lets his actions, eyes, and body speak for him for the rest of  the film. As far as I'm concerned, this is done well, and is very realistic  considering the upbringing his character has in the military where you only  speak when spoken to.<br />As for the rest of the movie, I found myself  enjoying it immmensely.  The slow transfomation of Todd's character,  beginning to learn how to live with other people, how to interact with  them, and his own inner struggle with the first stirrings of lust, not  knowing what it is, or how to actually deal with it.  And by the time the  last act of the movie was playing, where he had to defend the people he had  been getting to know, I was well into the movie and ready to go with the  flow, and let the action stand for itself.<br />So, all in all, a good movie  that I would recommend to anyone who wanted to see something just a little  different, or anyone who is a Kurt Russell fan.  Enjoy.
B00004TRD8|3.0|the terminator returns in this action-packed sequel.  But beyone action and special effects there's not much there.  A mediocre story that we're  given only only to get the audience from one action scene to the next.  The  movie is entertaining on the basis that you've seen the far superior first  film.  The film does do what Cameron wanted it to, however.  That was to  build a new level of special effects in the early 90's.  On that level this  is a succesful film, but almost seems more like a sequel to The Abyss  rather than The Terminator.  Just as The Abyss brought cg up a notch, so  does this film.  An entertaining film no doubt especially if you watch the  director's cut version and have seen the first film.
B00004T8RK|5.0|While this album may not be a TEN or a VS. it certainly holds up on it's own.  The album has more of a late 60's/early 70's vibe. You can certainly  tell by the Who-influenced opener, Breakerfall.  That song, and God's Dice,  are the only two full fledging rock songs you'll hear on the album.  The  rest of the album ranges from acoustic ballads, experimentation, and even  ukelele.  Once again Pearl Jam has taken the cheap production style that  they used on Yield but it allows the songs to rely on singing and  performance rather than slick, computerized fakery.  There is a theme of  innocence that really intrigues me about this album.  In the song, Soon  Forgot, Eddie just sings and plays ukelele about a man filled with greed.   The song sounds like a joke at first but when you listen to the lyrics you  can catch the cynical irony expressed by Eddie.  I only listen to emotional  and truthful music so that maybe can help any of you wishing to purchase  this cd.  You won't regret it.
B000002BMD|5.0|An incredible album of depth and feeling from this Welsh band. The  disappearance of Richey Edwards marred the release of this one, but all  tracks are smartly-written and deftly combine   introspection with a  working man's angst. The #1 Brit anthem &quot;Design for Life&quot; is the  highlight, but &quot;Kevin Carter,&quot; is a biting critique of media  pressure and &quot;Small Black Flowers&quot; is a touching piece on loss  and desolation. &quot;Australia&quot; combines James Bradfield's sharp  vocals backed by Nicky Wire's piercing bass track. &quot;The Girl Who  Wanted To Be God&quot; should have been released as a single-- it's that  good. The album is a modern masterpiece though a departure from the Manics  punk roots. It never got much airplay in the States thanks to a cancelled  American tour. But Sony should share in much of blame for not backing the  band in the U.S. &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; album is truly one of the  best of the 1990's though no one in the states has heard of it. A  must-listen!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I was introduced to Dido by my camp counselor and immediately fell in love  with her music. when i got home, i rushed to get her CD, and i listen to it  non-stop. it's a totally different sound compared to my usual sugar ray or  counting crows cd. i love it to listen to when i wanna chill. i suggest u  get this cd because it's definately worth it.
B000002UDB|5.0|Hehe, okay, I know that's Monkees (&quot;Daily Nightly&quot;), not  Beatles, but so what? It describes this album perfectly. Beautifully put  together, with a great song list.

B00000K19E|5.0|Ever wanted to be important, to live a life that matters? Well take a look at &quot;The Matrix&quot; because it starts with the premise that we are  all living pointless lives, slaves to frighteningly powerful beings that  prevent everyone from knowing their true state. Here enters the myth. There  will come a redeemer, who will see through all deception and become the  perfect warrior in mankind's cause. He will be the &quot;ONE&quot;.<br /><br />I don't know what possessed the Wachowski brothers to turn a borderline  successful comic book idea into a sixty million dollar extravaganza. But  WOW! I'm so glad they did. Talk about entertainment, this film keeps your  butt firmly on the edge of your seat and your jaw on the floor. The action  is intense, the plot is multi-layered and the effects are sumptuous. I  should also point out that for a cast that knows little about martial arts,  (a few months training prior to the filming), they sure can fake it. You  will believe a man can fly.<br /><br />Science fiction has explored the  implications of virtual reality fairly thoroughly over the past two  decades. From Steven Lisberger's &quot;Tron&quot; to Star Trek's &quot;Holo  Deck&quot;, we're well versed on the idea that the virtual will some day  rival the actual. With The Matrix however, it is all brought  together into  a frightening whole.

Talk about an  existentialist's wet dream. But what of those non-conformists on the  outside?<br /><br />We meet them through Neo, a corporate neophyte and part  time hacker. The powers-that-be have turned their attention to young Neo,  (Keanu Reeves), not for his illegal computer hobbies but because the  mysterious Morpheus,  leader of the underground, has shown an interest in  him.

B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is the most expensive album I own. The vinyl LP, the cassette, the US CD, and the UK CD: that's about a hundred bucks. What the heck -  it's worth it.<br />Here, the Beatles embrace acoustic folk, moving away from  rockabilly covers, and writing Dylan-like lyrics. Dylan with Everly  Brothers vocal harmonies is a luscious idea. Bob is Mr. Folk, but the guy's  voice is a bit tough on the ears. The guitar work is technically  conservative - and musically riveting. What a combination! Take a whiff.  There's plenty of marijuana smoke in the air.<br />One of the best ways I know  to judge the atmosphere of a Beatles' album is to count who does what  songs. I know the compositions are labeled \\"Lennon/McCartney,\\" but that  just means John and Paul split the royalties 50/50. How much money do  George and Ringo get from three decades of royalties? Squat. Poor George.  Sad Ringo. Anyway, Paul is still doing cute bouncy lullabies (You Won't See  Me, Michelle), while John rocks-out (Wait); but there's a difference. Paul  moves closer to hearty rock (Drive My Car, I'm Looking Through You), while  John is downright tender (Norwegian Wood, In My Life). Regardless of the  type of song which each attempts, John's and Paul's compositions are  different, and distinctively individual. Each is developing his own style.  Note John's bitterness on the \\"love\\" songs `Girl' and `Norwegian Wood.'  What's the story? Does John torch the place because he didn't get no  satisfaction? `Run For You Life' is nothing short of vindictive. So much  for dope and peace and love. Separate, John and Paul are gratifying  musicians - together, they're brilliant. \\"Genius\\" isn't an accident. It  takes buckets of perspiration. Neither John nor Paul is at his peak of  brilliance, but they're close, damn close.<br />Beatle three, George, turns  out a dramatic `Think For Yourself' and the sparkling guitar work on `If I  Needed Someone.' Sad Ringo should have stayed home: the pathetic guitar  work destroys `What Goes On.'<br />In summary, Rubber Soul is one of the  Top-10 most influential and phenomenal recordings in the history of popular  music. Not too shabby. I rate Rubber Soul just one step behind Life In The  Foodchain by Tonio K.<br />Technical Note: The UK CD release sounds wonderful.  None of those dizzy \\"ping-pong\\" vocals and instrumentals jumping from one  channel to the other. Try this in pseudo-four or five channel surround  sound: lots of \\"out of phase\\" harmonics from the rear speakers.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I love this movie!<br />This is a movie rich in the Thai culture.  It also portrays the olden Asian culture really well, with men always the better of  women and men could have more than one wife.<br />The King had hired an  English woman to be the governess of his many children.  Anna went to Siam  with her young son, but not forgetting to bring her western ideas along.   The King, an autocratic figure respected by all, of course, could not  accept the different ideas brought in by Anna.  There was really a clash of  cultures between the two parties but somehow they could compromise with  each other.  Chow Yun Fat has played the role of the King very well!<br />This  movie hooked me to the television screen for the whole length of it.  It  will make you feel all kinds of emotions like sadness, happiness, anger and  you will certainly be touched in certain parts.  Overall, a brillant movie  for all!
0800132335|5.0|There is only one word to describe the excellence of this film, and I don't think I know what it is. Das Boot is surely the greatest submarine  movie ever made in the history of film making.  Incredibly realistic, good  acting, high tense adventure, a non-stop thrill ride of the senses.  Jurgen  Prochnow places himself as one of the greatest actors in the world with his  performance as the Captain of U-96.  Based completly on a true story, I  firmly beleive that this movie is not only the best submarine film, but  quite possibly the greatest World War Two film ever made.  It includes all  aspects that make a good war movie what it is.  Action, Passion,  Compassion, Thrill, Horror, and Uncertainty.  I strongly recomend this film  to ANYONE.

6305609721|5.0|Let me begin by stating that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was the first S.T. film I saw in the movie theaters.  This wasn't by choice, however.   When Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan came out in theaters I was only seven  years old and my dad said it was too violent for me to see (I know! ).   Sadly the DVD version is the first time I ever saw it in the widescreen  format. Before that it was always the pan an scan video with the cool boxed  pictures of the film as the cover art.  I have read many reviews about both  films and there seems to be a huge debate over which of these excellent  films is the best Trek of all.  I really like them both immensely and even  though, to me, it feels like Part II has the majority vote I must go with  the minority and say that Part IV is the best.  Again, please understand  that doesn't mean that II is not wonderful.  It is.  I'd give it 4 and a  half out of 5 stars.  But IV gets all 5.  Maybe it is because it was the  first one I saw on the big screen.  There was a great atmosphere and the  place was packed.  In fact everytime I go see a S.T. film there's this bond  I feel with the other audience members that you don't feel when you see  most films.  Every punchline got huge laughs.  It was like we were all  friends.  I have always enjoyed the lighter side of Star Trek.  The Trouble  With Tribbles comes to mind immediately.  It was so funny making a little  furry round animal into this menace that constantly multiply when given  food.  Why should you always have to take yourself seriously?  In fact  that's one reason why I watch Part IV more often than II...it's more  relaxing. And I mean that in a good way.  Nobody dies in this movie, unlike  Part II where many people are killed.  Don't get me wrong.  I love action  and sci-fi put together (The Matrix)but they really do suck the energy  right out of you.  The concept of an alien probe coming to earth seeking to  communicate with humpback whales but to no avail since they've assumedly  been extinct and in the process knocking out all main power to anything it  comes in contact with may seem outrageous to some.  I think it was a nice  way of saying if we don't stop killing off species one day it's gonna come  back and bite us in the butt.  Leonard Nimoy called it an &quot;Ecological  house of cards&quot; in the director featurette on the DVD.  One day we  could pull a keystone card and the whole house will fall down.  The whales  by the way looked incredible.  Until I got the DVD I had no idea that only  5% of the whale shots were real and the rest weren't.  The dialogue with  the cast is terrific and I really enjoyed the fact that Spock wasn't fully  himself and that he still needed time to find out who he was and how he  felt.  You could sense that with his attempted use of &quot;colorful  metaphors&quot; and such.  Oh and that crowd cheered forever when he gave  that punk on the bus the Vulcan neck pinch for playing his radio loudly.   In this film Kirk got to be Mr. Romantic again, the way many remember him  from the television series.  Charming, witty but a bit clueless at times  (L.D.S.?).  The dinner scene was his best as he's trying to persuade  Gillian to give him the whale's as his communicator goes off and he tells  Scottie to tell Uhura and Chekov &quot;Phaser's on stun, good luck, Kirk  out&quot; with this goofy look of embarrassment on his face that works so  well.  Everyone has an important task to finish: McCoy and Scottie getting  the glass walls to hold the whales in and paying for them by giving the  owner info on transparant alumminum (&quot;Is it worth somethin' to ya or  should I just punch up clear?&quot;), Sulu must get a helicopter to  transport the walls (I still wonder how he stole it...perhaps he put his  communicator inside when he was talking to that guy and they beamed it  somewhere else later..who knows..it doesn't matter), and Uhura and Chekov  have to get energy to recharge the Klingon dillithium crystals bystealing  them from a nuclear &quot;wessel&quot; called, oddly enough, the  Enterprise.  Chekov's interrogation scene is hilarious.  Not a single  weapon is fired with the exception of a harpoon which gets deflected by the  Bird of Prey.  The rescue of Chekov gives McCoy his best scenes, giving a  woman a pill that grows her a new kidney and mixing words with 20th century  doctors (&quot;We're dealing with medievalism here&quot;) and the way in  which they escape the hospital was outstanding (I love the frantic pace).   After the whales are saved and beamed up it's another sling shot around the  sun (anyone remember when they first tried it on TV in the episode  &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;)?  As you can tell I love this film.  I  only wish they had done another like this with the original crew.  I know  the majority will still say Star Trek II, which by the way has one major  flaw in that Khan could not have recognized Chekov (he was not yet a member  of the Enterprise crew during Episode #24, Space Seed, which I like to  watch before putting in Part II. Chekov's first appearence was Episode #30,  Catspaw (The Star Trek Encyclopedia))is the best film. But for me Star Trek  IV: The Voyage Home stands tallest in the end.
0688152023|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I just bought it and I can't wait to get started.   I've read it from cover to cover a few times, and I'm more than pleased  with my purchase.  The magnificent bodies are marvelous and breathtaking.  It's true that the first few pages are bios and frou frou, but their  stories are inspiring and motivating.  Plus, they discuss why dancers'  bodies are more agile and sculpted than most athletes, as well as tips on  getting started, how to listen to your body and optimize your  workout.<br />The workout is divided into six sections.  Warm up and Stretch,  followed by Abs (14-20 minutes), Floor barre (12-16 minutes), Ballet center  (16-22 minutes) and Legs (16-22 minutes). Although they say you can do the  entire workout as time permits, they offer suggestions for 10 or 20 minute  workouts, as well as specialized workouts to correlate with specific sports  for strength and flexibility or body parts of concentration.  The  instructions are clear-cut and detailed and along with the music selections  they recommend, you'll feel like a prima ballerina. Personally, I have a  lot of fat to lose so I plan on using this workout as a supplement to an  aerobic regimen. I'm looking forward to using this workout every morning to  get my day started.
B000000132|5.0|Turn of the Cards was the third Renaissance album I ever purchased, A Song  For All Seasons and Ashes Are Burning being the first two.  This album  takes a significant turn from the  airy, dreamlike tracks featured on the  earlier Ashes and the later Seasons LPs.  On Turn of the Cards, Renaissance  seems to provide an alter ego to Ashes, its immediate forerunner; the  tunes, while equally grandiose and expansive, are much darker and more  brooding in both music and lyrics.  Some might describe this entire album  as downright depressing, and this isn't entirely inaccurate.  The haunting  tone of the album however, doesn't detract from the pure beauty of either  the whole or its individual parts, as Turn is certainly a masterpiece in  its own right and offers listeners a level of excellence that the band,  unfortunately, never managed to equal in any of their subsequent albums  (although A Song for All Seasons comes very close).<br />Each song taken  individually, &quot;Running Hard&quot; is probably closest to the sound  that most Renaissance fans will recognize from the lighter Ashes.  Still  pensive and introspective, the song is about as upbeat as this album gets  and starts out with a truly stunning piano solo that builds to a soaring  splash of sound.  Near the song's end, a similar climax drags the listener  back down to earth with both lyrics and a style of music that evoke a  palpable sense of loss.  &quot;Things I Don't Understand&quot; is a  whirlwind of instrumental flourish and tempo shifts, with a driving beat  throughout and an ending that ultimately renders calm from chaos, a true  Renaissance hallmark.  Here, the band pulls out all the musical stops and  leaves practically no sound or style unheard.<br />&quot;Black Flame&quot;,  along with &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, is perhaps the album's darkest piece  and musically, easily its most spare.  It is also one of its most  triumphant, hypnotically leading the listener deeper and deeper toward  despair until the last chilling - and they are chilling - notes expire.   &quot;Mother Russia&quot; itself, is probably the album's best-known track,  and with good reason. The story of Soviet novelist Alexandr Solzenytzin's  internment in a Siberian workcamp (&quot;banished for his written thoughts,  starving for his fame...&quot;) is made all the more real by the effective  use of authentic Russian instruments and musical styles.  True to form,  Renaissance paints a very vivid picture of the psychological and physical  abandonment experienced by the subject and we can almost see him standing  silently in the deep snow covering a barren and endless northern  landscape.<br />The remaining two tracks, &quot;I Think of You&quot; (an  ethereal but lonesome filler piece) and &quot;Cold is Being&quot; (nothing  short of a dirge) are somewhat second-tier offerings, but only when  considered alongside the album's more powerful songs.  Even so, they do not  detract from the overall superiority of Renaissance's darkest, and most  weighty, production.<br />Listeners who've never experienced the thrill of  Renaissance would be best served by purchasing both Turn of the Cards and  Ashes Are Burning, and listening to them back-to-back.  Although these  albums were produced within a year of each other, they represent different  sides of the same lush and amazingly complex coin that long-time  Renaissance fans continue to treasure and use as the standard by which all  other so-called art-rock groups are measured.
B0000024RQ|5.0|This album gives me a lot of joy. I was tempted to give it only four  stars, since I think that Dylan did some more consistent albums later on,  but I realized my faulty reasoning. Here he is in all his glory, just a man  and his guitar (and occasional harmonica), a raspy voice and a few simple  chords. Some of his best-loved songs are here in this early release,  including &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and a personal favorite of mine,  &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.&quot; With these songs in particular,  Dylan shows a remarkable turn of melody, for which he isn't always best  known. Other songs show a lot of blues influence, but I think the title  says a lot - this is Dylan freewheelin', just doing his thing with no  embellishment and having a good time doing it, even when the subject matter  becomes serious.
B00000373U|5.0|I don't want to see you in the morning  but please see me for the rest of  my life.  There isn't a cigarette long enough,  a drink deep enough to last  me through this date.

B000000W5N|5.0|Forget all the pretentious drivel thats been said about this album--forget even more the persistent drivel and myth about &quot;Exile on Main  Street&quot; being the Stones best album. &quot;Exile&quot; is a fair  double album in search of an editor who could have made it a good single  album (of course since the Beatles did a double album, the Stones had to  follow suit, but &quot;Exile&quot; has even worse filler than &quot;The  White Album,&quot; I mean come on folks, just what in the hell are tracks  like &quot;Radiator Blues&quot; or &quot;Turd on The Run&quot; on  &quot;Exile&quot;?). The Stones could only really come into their own after  the Beatles broke up because Jagger was always looking over his damn  shoulder worrying about what the Beatles were doing and trying to  &quot;answer&quot; each album of theirs and positing the Stones as their  &quot;evil twins.&quot; When Jagger stopped doing this, the Stones could at  last become what they were meant to be. This is the album that solidified  forever the Stones deserved reputation (must avoid using the cliche  &quot;classic&quot;). It would almost be worth it for just &quot;Sway&quot;  alone (listen to that persistent, mean, wicked riff of the rythm  guitar--the credits say only Mick Taylor played guitars on this track--he  became Richards' fair-haired &quot;good&quot; twin with this album--they  played off each other so well though they never bonded personally). Yes,  almost worth it for just &quot;Sway&quot; alone, except for &quot;Moonlight  Mile,&quot; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and all the rest. The first period  with Brian Jones was great and experimental, but with the Mick Taylor  period, the Stones reached the apotheosis of their own, unique, mature  sound. This is the one to have if you could only choose one (this and a  copy of &quot;satisfaction&quot;).
B000002BSG|5.0|What can I say? Jay Kay out does himself on this mainstream showcase.   This album introduced Jamiroquai to the masses in the U.S. with the smash  &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; which is sadly under-represented in the widely  succesful video.  The musical changes in that song are smooth and  reminisint of the 1970's work of Marvin Gaye.  &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; is a  disco masterpiece..the vocals, strings, and instrumentation of the band are  very impressive on this track which will have u dancing around your living  room.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is one of the smoothest soul jams released in  quite some time.  This track proves that Europeans can groove to American  Soul too.  &quot;Alright&quot; is another killer soul jam that makes u want  to dance and sing to your significant other.  The best of the rest are  &quot;Didjitial Vibrations&quot;, &quot;Spend A Lifetime&quot;,  &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; and &quot;Use The force&quot;.  I  highly recommend this album to anyone who loves the old school soul of  artists like Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind and Fire, Marvin Gaye, Prince, and  Al Green.
0140282033|4.0|Joanne Harris' wonderful novel, Chocolat, is a treat for all the senses.   She drew me into a world where I could just taste the bittersweet chocolat  Vianne mixed and moulded in her little shop.  I could hear the whispers of  the wind across the square, smell the smoke from the river, and feel the  touch of her daughter's hand. Harris mixes religious and pagan themes.  She  exposes the petty hypocrisies and politics of rural village life.  But she  also created wonderful rounded characters who I missed when I finished the  last page.  I fell in love with Lansquenet and its residents.  The only  criticism is that I felt the priest's story was rushed at the end and I  would have liked to have him face Vianne one last time.  Otherwise a  delightful read.  I look forward to reading Blackberry wine.
B000002NJS|4.0|RAY OF LIGHT is Madonna's best, most mature and introspective album since LIKE A PRAYER.  She provides insights on fame, life, love, and spirituality  through sophisticated and introspective lyrics that are beautifully  enhanced with electronic music.  Madonna said she has always loved techno  and electronic music, but that those musical styles were always cold.  She  wanted to show that electronic and techno music could be warm and  emotional.   With RAY OF LIGHT, Madonna succeeded in achieving that.   Although, I feel RAY OF LIGHT employs more of an electronic than techno  sound.  Standout tracks on this album include:  &quot;Frozen&quot;  (haunting and chilling), &quot;Skin&quot; (hot and heavy beats), &quot;Sky  Fits Heaven&quot; (Great song for driving), &quot;The Power of  Good-Bye&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (which is probably the best  song on the album).  Madonna said in VH1's &quot;Behind the Music&quot;  that &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a song about hope, a celebration of life,  of newness.  I totally agree with her and can definitely feel it in the  song.  This energetic and fast-paced song starts off with a guitar riff and  continues to build in musical levels, emotions, and excitement.  And just  when you think the song ends with Madonna's high-pitched scream, it  continues for a little while longer.  Thus, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a  PERFECT example of a song that successfully carries a person on an  exhilerating and emotional roller-coaster journey.  And, Madonna's amazing  vocals on this song just add to the exhilerating journey!  I have never  heard Madonna hit such high notes before.  Overall, RAY OF LIGHT is an  impressive body of work that is not as dance-based as I thought it would  be, but is by no means weak or soft.  It's right in the middle, and that's  okay :)

B000002J09|2.0|Led Zeppelins actual talent and innovativeness are often very much  exaggerated. This album despite it's &quot;awesome&quot; reputation is  nothing special.
B000007OY0|5.0|This movie is most definatly my all time favorite. When I first heard of it on cable tv I was sceptical and didn't want to see it at all. Then my  dad rented it and made me watch it, I was hooked within the first 10  minutes. The movie was casted great, it was incredibly written, and I am  still arguing with my sisters boyfriend whether Andy actually commited the  crime that sent him to prison for 20+ years. All in all this movie will not  be a dissapointal if you either buy it or just rent it(but save yourself  the time and just buy it, you will thank me later).
6301963911|5.0|This was the film that made me want to work in the movie business.  Great, yet offbeat non-Hollywood like script, and charming Diane Keaton, help make  this one of the best motion pictures of all time.  Woody, as always,  playing the 40ish, Jewish, neurotic... but he does it so well!<br />Tony  Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken and even Paul Simon,  are all terrific in this story about two people growing apart.  <br />Flawless  editing by Ralph Rosenblum.  This genius really helped create the structure  of the film to make it the polished gem that it is. (The hilarious  &quot;cocaine&quot; scene was constructed  simply because the audience  needed to know that Allen/Keaton were going to the California.)  <br />I was  so happy when it won all the Oscars that it did, despite what a lot of  other folks thought.  Witty as hell and as American as apple pie... well,  maybe with a Matzoh crust!
6304233639|1.0|Independence Day is definitly the worst movie,science-fiction or not,ever grace the silver screen!The characters are cut and dry,the plot is a bad  rip-off of War of the Worlds,and the movie is filled with so many plot  incansistances that the whole film feels like one big mistake,and thats me  being generous.Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin spent so much time on  special effects and blowing up famous landmarks that they forgot that they  were actually trying to make a movie.Everything is clouded in so much  stupidity that its hard to find this movie entertaining. Everybody says its  fun but does that mean that in order for a movie to be entertaining it has  to make no sense!Examples-Will Smith's Girlfriend should have been fried in  that tunnel,a laptop shouldn't be able to link with an exterrestrial super  computer,and if these aliens are telepathic wouldn't they be able to tell  that two humans have boarded the mothership.I'm trying to keep this  short,so in conclusion Independence Day should never have been made.PERIOD!

B000000HXK|5.0|this is the real stuff. undiluted &amp; without pretention. not a placebo, simulacrum, 'Spiritualized' heroin epic, and not about drugs. the cover  photo reflects the music better than words can describe. the break in the  time-lapsed cloudscape is a small, barely tangible infinitude of catharsis  from cumulative pain.  here's one way to enjoy such a perfect record. step  1: locate the cd (not impossible) step 2: play it.  step 3: repeat step 2  until it melts into your mind. feel and forget.
1558216847|3.0|This is quite possibly the most maddening book I have ever read. If it is  true, it is, as other's have stated, an amazing testament to the strength  and endurance of man when faced with incredible hardships. If it is in part  or in whole a fabrication, it is a very deft one. Another reviewer here  concludes that it doesn't really matter if the story is true or untrue, as  regardless it makes a great yarn. Well, I think it *is* important. The tale  Slavomir relates is so moving, and evokes such empathy (as evidenced by the  thousands of letters sent to him after it was published), that it would  almost be a criminal offense if it turned out he was trading on the  credulity of masses.<br />If much or all of the book is invented, then it  changes from being a monument to human will, to a monument to the  complexity of mental illness. If Slavomir isn't telling the truth, I don't  think his intent is cynical. Rather, it is the result of some sort of  dementia. I don't doubt that he suffers from nightmares and other residue  of some sort of traumatic experience. Perhaps his mind was broken by the  torture inflicted by the Russian authorities, and he fantasized about  escape. Perhaps he snapped in Siberia, and his dreams about escape became  real to him. One can speculate endlessly, as there is no point in the book  where I felt I could state incontrovertibly that it was untrue. I'm not  trying to impugn Slavomir's integrity, it's just that incredible tales  demand at least some ordinary proofs.<br />I would love to see the veracity of  this tale investigated. It should be possible to discover some  corroborating evidence.
0451169514|5.0|It's a long one, but well worth. Great characters, reminds me a bit of  Stand By Me. The suspense about the evil is well done, and I personally  found the ending satisfying enough. This is definitely a book worth reading  more than once, as any good story with lots of depth should be. This  definitely is King at his best.
0792846338|5.0|Based on the darkly humorous thriller novel by Stephen King,this film is succesfully adapted to the screen, thanks mainly to the powerful and often frightening performance by KATHY BATES (who incidentally won an oscar for Best Actress for her role in this) as the psychotic and obsessed fan of novelist, Paul sheldon who is equally brilliantly played by JAMES CAAN. The film has many edge-of-the-seat moments...  Thrillers don't come much better than this and this now is a fine classic. Lauren Bacall is also seen here in a brief cameo role as Sheldons' agent.

B000002NJS|5.0|This emerged as one of Madonnas very best albums to that point in her career. Produced by William Orbitt and Madonna herself, the best cuts on  the album are hard to choose as all are stunningly unique in their own way.  Popular choice probably would be the upbeat title track itself, RAY OF  LIGHT, the haunting and atmospheric, FROZEN, and the moving, THE POWER OF  GOODBYE. The hard techno sounds of SKIN and SKY FITS HEAVEN are other  highlights of the album as well as NOTHING REALLY MATTERS, SWIM and TO HAVE  AND NOT TO HOLD. This was like no other Madonna album to that point with  this being ahead of its time and the result effectivley reflected her new  image and sound. LITTLE STAR and CANDY PERFUME GIRL are perharps the only  cuts on the album that dont quite match up to the quality of the other  tracks but apart from that this is a thoroughly excellent album from one of  the worlds hottest talents! Madonnas vocals remain as glorious as ever  throughout the entire album!
B00004BZ0N|3.0|Great rock n roll songs, but I had heard it was the Clash's best album.  No. If you want rock buy this album, but if you're looking for Clash PUNK  buy The Clash, or Give em Enough Rope. Must note that the lyrics on this  album are very exceptional, check out &quot;Clampdown&quot;.
B0000025RI|5.0|Quite simply, Michael Jacksons very best album. None of his work after  this (even 1987's, BAD) could top this classic album. Cream of the crop is,  BILLIE JEAN, one of the greatest records of his career! BEAT IT and  THRILLER all come close to the quality of that particular cut. Every other  track also sound classic, including his fabulous collaboration with  ex-Beatle, PAUL McCARTNEY, on, THE GIRL IS MINE. WANNA BE STARTIN'  SOMETHIN' and HUMAN NATURE are also exceptionally good tracks. The album  was produced by QUINCY JONES and Jackson himself and sold in excess of over  40,000,000, worldwide and became the biggest selling album in history.  Unique and ritously funky, this album is Michael Jackson at his very best  and at the peak of his career. Highly recommended!
B00000JH09|5.0|System Of A Down has to be the most original band on the nu-metal scene  right now, spare Incubus and Mindless Self Indulgence. They have one of the  best singers I have ever heard in Serj Tankian, with his inane ramblings,  psychotic whimpers, and whisper to a scream verses/choruses. He is original  and charismatic, and he holds an amazing stage presence. If you have a  chance to see them live, go see them, they are amazing. Serj holds not only  personal anger, he also holds anger towards the Armenian government, the  country where the band originates. They are a political band, believe it or  not, although they do sound a little like the metal scenes' comedians at  first listen. The band are all excellent musicians, and every instrument is  very clearly brought out by Rick Rubin. Shavo's bass is excellent and is  very easy to hear. There are even occasional bass solos on this  masterpiece. Daron's guitar work is also wonderful, and he often explodes  into huge choruses and such. John is a good drummer, and very consistent as  well. They all come together to make one of the most awesome bands I have  ever heard. They are a mix of funk, rap, metal, folk, and politics. No one  dared do this kind of thing before them, and that is why they are so  original. My favorite songs on here are P.L.U.C.K., Sugar, Spiders, War?,  CUBErt, and Know. This one also comes with a limited edition ECD that has  four of their best tracks live, although I really don't think it does  justice to their great live show. It also has the video for Sugar, which is  nothing short of superbly produced. Also check out Nuclear Rabbit, Tribal  Disco Noise, Linea 77, and Toxic Field Mice.
B000002BSG|5.0|One of their greatest albums to date! Acid jazz and funky, soulful pop are  the orders of the day on this album and tracks such as, VIRTUAL INSANITY  and COSMIC GIRL are quite simply, classics! The album goes from strength to  strength, being fresh and vibrant from their previous material. USE THE  FORCE, ALRIGHT, DRIFTING ALONG and the title track itself, TRAVELLING  WITHOUT MOVING are just some of the albums many high points. Great, classic  sounding, funky music throughout the album. Highly recommended!
0140177396|4.0|Mr. Steibeck has managed to write an exelent novel,&quot;Of mice and  men&quot;.The novel has a very interesting layout, and it deals with some  aspects that are familiar to us in every moment of our lives; lonelyness,  authority, dreams, and friendship are the main ones. The book has also a  very good and interesting relationship between the main characters, George  and Lennie.I think that their relationship is the main plot of the  story,but the shocking part is George's last action.  I would recomend this  book to a teenager because it teaches us how to afront our problems.
B00000DFRS|4.0|Whitney Houston returned to the studios and satisfies adequatley with this  fabulous collection of funky, hip hop, soulful tunes. Produced by Houston  herself and Clive Davis, this emerges as her greatest album since 1990's,  I'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT (and is also her first studio album since that  release with a string of soundtrack albums being released throughout the  1990's from her movies). Houstons powerful and expressive delivery can be  found on every track with the best cuts being the title track, MY LOVE IS  YOUR LOVE, the extremley catchy, IT's NOT RIGHT BUT IT's OK, IF I TOLD YOU  THAT, IN MY BUSINESS and the Motown sounding, YOU'LL NEVER STAND ALONE  which features the classic sound of the harmonica played by the legendary  STEVIE WONDER. I LEARNED FROM THE BEST is easily the best ballard of the  album but surprisingly its the groovy R and B numbers that takes up most of  the album. The album ranges from good to very good and is highly  recommended to any soul/r and b fan!!!
B00004THAY|5.0|This has to be one of the best blues cd's I have ever heard. BB King &amp; Clapton play their hearts out on this one. It's such a treat to hear Clapton &amp; King playing acoustic blues &amp; their searing duel electric  lead solo's. I had high expectations for this release and they produced 10  fold. Thank you EC &amp; BB from a big fan. ...
6304106017|5.0|Quentin Tarentino stars as a deranged convict who, along with his brother, played brilliantly by GEORGE CLOONEY, kidnaps a preacher (HARVEY KIETEL),  and his two kids (which includes JULIETTE LEWIS of NATURAL BORN KILLERS)  and flees for the safety of a remote nightclub in Mexico, only once they're  there they discover that the club is actually a safe haven for blood  thirsty vampires! The plots twist was as surprising as ever as origanlly i  thought this was settling down to be a hostage drama but then thats the  genius of Tarentinos work. This movie is as compelling as ever with the  dialogue often being very darkly humorous, whilst the performances are top  notch and this film is certainly nothing short of one long, wild adventure!
B00003CWTI|5.0|I had a chance to pre-screne the DVD version and it is wonderful.  So many times DVD bonus material is worthless. This is not the case with Magnolia.   The &quot;making of&quot; documentary really added to the exerience of the  movie and made a second viewing of the DVD really fantastic.  <br />I saw the  movie in the theater and I know that much of the audience in the theater  HATED this movie.  It is not everyone's cup of tea.  But, if you love  strong character development and filmakers with a flair for the unusual you  will find much to enjoy in this movie.  <br />Few movies stay with me past my  exiting the theater or turning off my TV.  This is one that kept crawling  back into my head and became more meaningful as I thought back on the film.
B000006YXV|5.0|Marvin Gaye has got to be the most definitive man of soul! His politically aware songs such as, WHAT'S GOING ON and smooth, lush love songs like,  SEXUAL HEALING are fine, well remembered classics. He was Motowns leading  male artist and his collaboration with the queen of Motown, the equally  magical DIANA ROSS, are amongst some of his greatest work with the  timeless, unforgetable classic, YOU ARE EVERYTHING as well as the fabulous  collection of songs he cut with Ross for their classic 1973 album, DIANA  AND MARVIN. He also worked with Motowns other great female vocalsists such  as KIM WESTON on the classic, IT TAKES TWO and TAMMI TERRELL (his most  famous partner who sadly passed away of a brain tumour in 1970) who he cut  countless classics with such as, YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY, THE ONION  SONG and AIN'T NOTHING LIKE THE REAL THING. This wonderful compilation  offers all of these classics with notable and inevitable highlights being,  I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE, LETS GET IT ON, ABRAHAM,MARTIN AND JOHN  and MERCY,MERCY ME. Every tracks a classic and Gayes' voice remains as  unique and unmatched as his songwriting talents. An album that must be had  in any soul/R and B collection!
0783242808|5.0|The funniest movie of 1999! One of the best comedys ever created. Jason Biggs Shines
6302779278|2.0|The much hyped film, released in 1992 features two very bright talents but to my surprise (and in my own personal opinion of course) is rather  lacklustre. The story often careers along on a soap opera, t.v movie type  level, with no real chemistry between the two leading stars. To its credit  though the soundtrack is magnificent with Houston singing such great tracks  as, I HAVE NOTHING and I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU with all her heart and soul.  The main trouble is that its plot is somewhat predictable, giving very  little in the way of suspense but in all fairness there are a few  surprising twists to the story but overall the film is at best, enjoyably  about average.
B00001NFCY|4.0|With only the &quot;Higher&quot; video and a recommendation from a local  heavy rock band to go on, I kicked the tires on Human Clay.  What I found  was a bridge between modern heavy rock and the pre-Seattle days, a surging  and ebbing sound that`s alternately angular, full-force, and gentle.  This  is Creed's signature, along with the Eddie Vedder-esque vocals of Scott  Stapp and a melodic sense that has bigness without being bloated.  They  satisfyingly take on forward looking themes (\\"Higher,\\" \\"Are You Ready?\\" and  especially \\"With Arms Wide Open\\"), self challenge (\\"Faceless Man,\\" \\"Inside  Us All\\"), and necessary railing (\\"What If,\\" \\"Wash Away Those Years\\").   Highly recommended.
B000002LND|5.0|A superb collection of Madonnas' classic early days between 1984-1990,  beginning with the teeny pop track, HOLIDAY to the excellent cut, RESCUE  ME. Classic after classic with notable tracks being, LIKE A VIRGIN, INTO  THE GROOVE, LIKE A PRAYER, VOGUE and PAPPA DON'T PREACH. There are some  other hits such as, TRUE BLUE and WHO'S THAT GIRL questionably left on the  shelf but on this whole this compliation is excellent and well worth  having. As the album goes along it goes from strength to strength and this  is the perfect introduction to someone who knows little of her work.
6305311463|5.0|This is one of the best Bruce Willis films to date. With non-stop action the entire 2nd half of movie. Great cast, and special effects throughout  movie. Get this DVD, it is great.
052594527X|5.0|An imaginative story with an astute, finely drawn heroine who wrests a  life and love of her own from a society that would deprive her of control.  A delight.
B00004T9UF|3.0|A decent album, the violently disturbing tracks are offset by a few good  tracks that ring with a darker sense of humor than most of today's popular  music. A few of the tracks even invite one to sing along, but still a few  invite one to curl up in a corner and cringe.
B000002MUQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This is still a pretty solid Van Halen album, but  that's all it is. In my opinion, there are only a few standout tracks on  this one. The first one is &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You,&quot; the classic  song that sounds great with Sammy singing it. Very nice job! &quot;Don't  Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot; is a very powerful song about young  criminals and the guilt-complex they get (that's my interpretation,  anyway). This is a very good, mature song that also has an interesting and  appropriate video. &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; comes close to recreating some  of the fun tunes from early on in Van Halen's career. It has crazy playing,  crazy singing and crazy vocals. Pretty cool tune! The rest of the songs  don't really stand out to me, but are solid material. I definitely  recommend this for fans, but for newcomers, I'd say get the self-titled  debut, which I (and many, many others) consider to be the bands' best.
B000003BEM|5.0|This is the Stones' best record, narrowly beating out Exile on Main St.  and Aftermath, in my non-too-humble opinion.  The vibe is downright  frightening and sinister-sounding, as if we're listening in on some sort of  satanic hootanany -- which, of course, we are....
B000002MIB|5.0|I really wish there were more Van Halen live albums, because this one  really cooks! Sammy Hagar sounds excellent as usual and the band plays  awesome on every track.<br /> &quot;Judgement Day&quot; sounds absolutely  furious on this, better than the album version, in fact. &quot;Ain't  Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot; sounds really good. Sammy does a nice job on the  Roth-era classic. &quot;Ultra Bass&quot; is outstanding! Finally, we get to  hear Micheal Anthony at the forefront, not drowned out by everyone else.  This is a very impressive solo and it's about time he got one on an album!  &quot;Pleasure Dome/Drum Solo&quot; is incredible. Some very heavy guitar  leads into a long, amazing drum solo by the incomparable Alex Van Halen.  This guy has the energy of ten men, I'm sure. How he can do those  lightning-quick solos for so long without collapsing is beyond me. Wow!  &quot;Love Walks In&quot; is one of my favorite Sammy love songs and sounds  superb with Eddie on Keyboard and Sammy on guitar. &quot;Right Now&quot;  sounds great as usual, as does &quot;Why Can't This Be Love.&quot; Well,  I've highlighted some stuff by everyone but Eddie. &quot;316&quot; is his  shining moment on this album. An amazing solo that has to be heard to be  fully appreciated. His guitar work is great on every song, but this is the  standout for him.<br />Well, everything is awesome about this one except for  one thing; the sound quality. It sounds too spacious, as if they recorded  in the middle of the concert hall. As a result, it sounds like you're  listening to the album with a concert hall effect on all the time. Too much  echo is a result, which makes it harder to differentiate things.<br />This is  my only complaint. It is a small one considering how good this album is. If  you are a Van Halen fan, you will love this. If you are a Sammy Hagar-era  Van Halen fan, you will love it even more. There's only one way to rock,  apparently, and this is it!
B00004TH7Z|3.0|I am glad to see thatthey are headed back into the right direction.I think  that this really needed more work before it was set free.I am an old Maiden  fan from the vary start,so I know how to fairly rate this attempt to regain  what was lost.There is just alot of areas where I feel that there should  have been muchmore put into this.Yes,it is good but,No,it is not the best  by far.I am sorry ,I was expecting so much more than what I got.The works  of the past are much deeper and darker as they need to be to really capture  the grip of Maiden.Iron Maiden is getting soft,I have to say.Nice touches  but they need more of the Power slave and Number of the beast edge brought  back into life to recapture the Maiden sound at its fullest.Nomad and  Fallen Angel are two fine exsamples of the true Maiden sound that we have  all grown to expect from Iron Maiden.Please don't say that it is because  the old boy's can't take it,hell look at Sabbath,and they seem to still be  ontop of the whole metal edge.A good start,now lets go back and put some  life into this?Lets not go the way of J.P. we all know they fell when they  became soft so to say?????A god metal record,but not one of Maidens best.
0792846303|5.0|THE FOG is easily one of the most frightening films I have ever seen! It's also the only film John Carpenter has made which evokes the same  &quot;feeling&quot; HALLOWEEN gave me upon its first several  viewings.<br />The cast is one of the best ensembles ever gathered. Jamie Lee  Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, Janet Leigh, Nancy Loomis, Tom Atkins, John  Houseman, Hal Holbrook and several more... come on! Who could ask for a  better group! <br />The atmosphere is rich and the slow, dreadful pace of the  glowing mist makes for a splendid supernatural killer. Add in numerous  shocks and unbearable suspense at the films' climax (Ms. Barbeau's   attempted escape across the top of the lighthouse alone!), plus a coherent  plot, makes for one of the all time greatest scare films, which frequently  seems to be overlooked. Maybe if it had come out before HALLOWEEN it would  have received more attention on the positive than constant comparison to  its predacessor.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Isn't she lucky.  Her new record Oops I did it again was great. Her video is awsome.  In this album she once again proves that she has an incredible  voice and not just another cute face.  She sings like no other female  singer.  In my opinion her hits just get better and better.  You thought  her first record was great, you should get her new CD.  Lucky is my  favorite track from the CD.  You could tell I really like the CD. And to  all the people that say that britney can't sing or that the lyrics are  boring, you're wrong.
B000002C1W|5.0|Few people have heard of A Momentary Lapse of reason, and they don't know  what they are missing. I understand everything about this album, what  Gilmour wanted to communicate thru his songs. When i first got it, i  listened to it ones, and then i threw it away on the bad pile. The next day  i decided to give it another try, and i started to get into the music. you  can never like an album from it's first try. <br />Signs of life, and Learning  to fly are great songs that start the album. My favorite song is On the  Turning Away. I also play guitar, and when you play the songs you'll see a  difference. <br />My point is that this is a great album, not Pink Floyd's  best, but one of them. If you don't like it, give it another try and listen  to the music, if after that you still don't like it at all, well, then you  don't know what music means.

B00003CX9W|5.0|Not only is this the greatest piece of animation Walt Disney ever made, it is also one of the most original and daring works of art in all of history.   Perhaps only Manet's Olympia, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring or Kubrick's  2001 approach it in terms of artistic risk.  The abstract animation of the  opening sequence is an amazing step for a mere &quot;cartoon.&quot;  There  is humor, real drama, and even death.  And the whole thing has a peculiar  coherence.  <br />Some of the segments don't work as well as others; I didn't  particularly enjoy the interpretation of Night on Bald Mountain and I've  never been all that much of a fan of the Sorceror's Apprentice segment.   But, ultimately, that doesn't matter; Fantasia is as innovative a work of  art as anyone has ever made, it remains my favorite movie of all time, and  I'm delighted that it's finally on DVD.
068818071X|5.0|I was handed this book from a friend visiting from London.  I couldn't put  it down.  I plowed through the book in just a couple of days.  Watermelon  was also fantastic and I can't wait to read &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot;.   Marian has the ability to take her reader into the pages and live the lives  of her characters.
B00004LN16|5.0|I am an AC/DC fan.  I love the band.  I'm going to see them at Madison  Square Garden with a sell out crowd of fanatics.  The new CD IS as good as  any other.  People say it's not &quot;Back in Black.&quot;  Should it be?   No...it is 20 years later and it still rocks.  It is very good..better than  anything since at least B-N-B.  It does not have an instant favorite like  &quot;Heatseeker&quot; or &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, but man...song for  song...it is better than those albums.  BUY IT.  I GUARANTEE you will not  be disapointed.  If you're an AC/DC fan, than you will like at least 10/12  songs.  If you're a true fan, you will love them all and not be critical.
B00004RFFL|1.0|...and don't even bother with this video.  I wish I had even one good thing to say about it but I don't.  I especially hated the mousy Charlize  Theron.  Geeeze talk about poor acting, she wins the razy for 1999.  It is  hard to believe this film even made it to release.  Want to see a great  film instead?  Rent, or rather, buy &quot;Bottle Rocket.&quot;
0783223218|3.0|I didn't like Sydney Poitier in that movie.  He was too distant.<br />Bruce Willis was good, though, but still, don't have to do much to be that kind  of character...<br />Plot was good.  A few very good violent scenes.   That's  about it for that movie.
B00003CX9W|5.0|No wonder it took until the Sixties for people to appreciate this 1940's classic.  This mindblowing trip through time and space, death and rebirth  was at least a generation ahead of its time (and it takes a good head to  fully appreciate this psychedelic masterwork).  Don't let the kiddie  sequences fool you -- they're also a vital part of the experience -- this  is an Adult film (and I'm not talking about those topless centauresses)  that works on many different levels of perception.  What WAS ol' Walt  smokin' or droppin'?
6304240554|5.0|This sequel to Night of the Living Dead(1968)is highly as effective as any other horror film that I have ever seen.Directed by George A.Romero(He directed Night of the Living Dead),we find three people trying to survive the apocalypstic nightmare that has been caused by these flesh eating creatures.There lust for human flesh is made all too clear with the superb special makeup effects by Tom Savini.While we watch the characters try to survive and keep themselves from being torned apart we also are drawned into all the gore that this film throws at us.Just imagine what it would be like if the dead really did rise.Forget nuclear war.Maybe that was George A.Romero was asking himself while making this sequel.The most famous exploding head scene really knocked me out as a horror fan.Dawn of the Dead proves that with all the gore they have in this film,there are no limits when it comes to shock value.I myself would highly recommend this horror classic and think it is the most highly praised (Or at least one of )horror films in generations to come.Dawn of the Dead is a horror film I really enjoy.
B00004UEDR|5.0|This is the best Sandra Bullock performance I have ever seen, besides Practical Magic. It was a wonderful movie full of laughs and tears and it  really shows Sandra at her best. She plays an alcohalic perscription drug  abuser that is nearly forced to come clean, ordered by the judge. She is  faced with the challenges of keeping her mind straight and fighting the  temptations to drink and abuse pain killers. She strives to over come her  other weakness, her partying boyfriend. It shows how far she will go to get  what is forbidden and how far she will go to stop. This was a wonderful,  heart warming movie with so many funny parts. To me, her second best movie  she has ever made.
6305537798|5.0|This movie is a must for everyone! Its funny and is great for sleepovers. What makes this movie great?  Its the acting and the humor. Julia and Heath portray their characters wonderfully, and the crazy, secretly writing love  stories to portray her fantasy guidance councelor is a real kick. The scene  at the prom where Bianca punches and kneels Joey(we all know where) is  great because she is taking after her sister and no one would think she  would do that. Everyone should go see this movie and they will fall in love  with it! :c)
B00000K3UR|2.0|You'd think that with a superstar like Adam Sandler, &quot;Big Daddy&quot; would be really good. Unfortunately, it's not. &quot;Big Daddy&quot; has  it's moments, but not enough to save it. Even Adam Sandler himself can't  save it.  When I saw it advertised on TV, I liked the idea because it  looked and sounded funny. And you'd expect it to be. I mean, Adam Sandler's  characters are nearly always silly, childish and immature and you can just  imagine him trying to take on the responibilities of caring for a little  kid. You just can't help but laugh. However &quot;laugh&quot; is what I  didn't do as much as I expected to when I saw &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.
0783208227|5.0|First off, oh my goodness!   Let me just say that I absouloutley LOVED this movie!  At first, when my mom told me that we were going to rent it and told me the name, I was like &quot;'Heart and Souls?' Sounds pretty  dumb to me, probably the typical romantic comedy, I'll hate it,&quot; and  then I watched it!  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! I laughed, I  cried, I jumped for joy, it was an all over fantastical film!  Robert  Downey Jr. gives and excellent performane (as always, and Alfre Woodard and  the rest of the cast just dazzles!  One of my favorite parts (and one of  the funniest) is where Downey's character is dancing down the middle of the  street with the ghosts (Kyra Sedgwick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, Tom  Sizemore) singing &quot;Walk Like a Man.&quot;  It would be strange to see,  conisdering that the only one who can see that ghosts are Downey himself,  so all the rest of the world would see would be one crazy man walking down  a street singing to himself!  Oh, this movie is definitley in my favorites  collection!   I'll never get tired of it!  :) Buy it, rent it, just watch  it!  You won't be disappointed!
B000002JB3|2.0|I am inexplicably biased in favor of Phil Collins. His work with Genesis  led me to Peter Gabriel, and eventually to much more obscure, exciting  music than I would have ever discovered without him.  Therefore, even when  Phil was releasing more commercial music in the late 80s and early 90s, I  still rushed out to buy his latest, and liked it more than critics could  ever understand.<br />However, Phil had always managed to keep a bit of a dark  side to even his solo material. Up until now. Out of Genesis, divorced from  his second wife, 1996's &quot;Dance Into the Light&quot; found Collins  abandoning his former darker, moving songs in favor of... well, the title  track here, for starters. A horribly ill-advised Bob Dylan remake and  &quot;River So Wide,&quot; which sounds like a 1996 Clinton campaign speech  don't help. In fact, the only track that warranted more than a passing  listen here was &quot;Love Police,&quot; which somehow wasn't released as a  symbol.<br />Too bad. I always wanted to show all of Collins' critics they  were wrong...
B000002J2D|4.0|In one small way you could almost call this Genesis Western album. Between  The Ballad of Big and Burning Rope the image of the old west as the last  vestage of adventure and challenge comes out. The lust for adventure theme  runs deep in these songs.<br />In some ways this is a transitional album with  Follow You Follow Me providing a glimps forward to Genesis' wider pop  acceptance. <br />But you still understand why Genesis was considered  progressive rock in the 70's. The imagery invoked by Scenes From a Nights  Dream remind us that wild visions of music of the 70's are really missing  from todays music.<br />Musically it just sounds great. I play this one in the  CD player all the time at work.
B000002UWE|4.0|Talk Talk has great musical skill.  The lead singer is an exceptional  keyboardist and the result is a nice, easy music (not very fast-beat like  Devo, but more like A Flock of Seagulls).  The first five tracks are very  good for they represent the more common style of New Wave music.  The later  tracks are also nice, but being a New Wave fan, Talk Talk seemed to have  drifted away from their typical style of work.  Nevertheless, every track  on this CD is worth listening to.  You can listen to songs over and over  again, yet not grow tired of them.  Some may complain that Mark Hollis'  voice is right-out annoying but seriously-- How many New Wave bands out  there actually have perfectly harmonic vocalists?  Not many, so don't  worry.
B000002V0Q|2.0|I used to have this CD and it got old fast when I bought Peace Sells and  Rust in Peace. Those 2 albums killed Countdown. This is the decline of  Megadeth. It's when they started playing the Cryptic Writings sound they  have now. I thought it wasn't bad at first but after a while I got sick of  it. Not recommended if you want Megadeth for the 1st time.
B0000028MA|5.0|The \\"Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,\\" released in 1992, is a special album, and perfectly captures a cool time in rock and roll history. [[ASIN:6305283516 Singles]] was a somewhat hyped-up movie that was a tad lacking in my opinion, but this less-hyped CD lived up to the promise and talent of the Seattle rock and roll scene. Furthermore, the artists who contributed to this album had a real connection with each other, feeding off one another with a sense of purpose, community and committment to make the best music possible. Truthfully, this is one of the best rock and roll soundtracks I've ever heard.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002B8A Alice in Chains]], [[ASIN:B000ETQRCM Pearl Jam]] and Chris Cornell, as well as Cornell's raucous band, Soundgarden, all sound amazingly seasoned and mature on \\"Singles,\\" not anything like new kids on the big-rock scene back in the early 1990s. These guys obviously spent years before this album honing their skills and craft, experiencing life in order to give us great music. This album broke some bands, but it also re-established the talent of the heavyweights like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, all of whom roamed the earth touring at the time, churning out music and making a great name for themselves with the ease of a fluid guitar chord.<br /><br />Chris Cornell's beautiful \\"Seasons\\" is incomparable, a breathtakingly reflective song that's nearly foreboding with its dim message of life and time moving on while one possibly gets left behind. \\"Seasons\\" is best absorbed and enjoyed after several listens, but many of these songs are instantly hummable. The \\"Singles\\" soundtrack offers a bit of everything: heavier \\"grunge\\" rock (\\"Birth Ritual,\\" \\"Overblown); pop gems by Paul Westerberg (\\"Dyslexic Heart,\\" \\"Waiting For Somebody\\"); a glam-rock ballad (\\"Chloe Dancer\\"); a live song (\\"Battle of Evermore\\"); old stuff by Jimmy Hendrix (\\"May This be Love\\"); and some radio-ready hits (\\"Nearly Lost You,\\" \\"Would\\"). There are also some oddities and unexpected artists thrown in, perhaps to lighten the heavy grunge load that many expected at the time. Overall, the beauty of this soundtrack is in its unexpected diversity.<br /><br />Smashing Pumpkins were outsiders to this project, a Chicago band that fit in like a new Hendrix perm. Many people were introduced to the Pumpkins via this soundtrack (like me), and the lucky Pumpkins did not  disappoint, offering the spaced-out \\"Drown,\\" a lulling, breezy track that turns deadly by the end, and ranks as one of the band's best offerings ever. For me, this was the first time I realized that music could be  dreamily hypnotic, spaced-out to the max. \\"Drown\\" eerily closes the CD on a bleak and blaring note, a myriad of squealing guitars mixed with heavy base and jazzy drumming by Jimmy Chamberlain. It's the type of song that, if played until the end, would scare people out of bars by closing time. \\"Drown\\" offers no real hope, no sense of happiness to be alive or thankfulness for being included on a big-named soundtrack, yet in its raging sadness, the song actually reaffirms the dedication, heart and true feelings that all these contributing artists were pushing at the time.<br /><br />Strangely, if you run down the list of artists and their songs featured on this classic album, you notice two things: either the band's shelf life has completely run its course commercially or, even sadder, the bands are completely defunct.

0790731940|4.0|I think this is a very well done film. It's very funny, but at the same time, there's no humor in it that would be very inapropriate for children,  making it a film good for the whole family. <br />Brett (Or should I say  Bert?)is just such a charming character, and yet, at the same time he has  obvious flaws, making him much more down to Earth than some heroes.<br />The  DVD doesn't have too many extras... Biographies on all the main actors, and  that's it. Of course, this is my first DVD, so I can't properly  compare...<br />What else can I say? It's a great movie, and certainly one  worth at least renting.
0140187650|5.0|This is philosophically speaking one of the most important books of all time.... regarding political affairs and ethics....<br />First, you have  Hannah Arendt. Her book on totalitarianism is a classic: she was THE  mid-century philosopher/historian/sociologist. She had a brilliant mind and  brilliant contemporaries to work with. She was an able writer and  stylistically good. And she had an assignment to write about Adolph  Eichmann, Nazi bureaucrat. <br />And Eichmann was more troubling than anyone  figured. Rather than deny his actions, he embraced them, using the Kantian  notion of duty dervied from a consequential imperative. He was just doing  his job-- hence the banality of evil.... what does a person do when the  accomplishment of the normal-- in his case, getting trains from one place  to another-- encompasses the extinction wholesale of a group of  people?<br />Thus comes this book. It is an accounting of the trial in  Jerusalem in 1961 (I believe....) A great read, although, as is anything  regarding the Holocaust, a little bit dark....<br />I'd read it if I were you.
B00004TWZG|5.0|A fan of the original U.S. release, I made The Professional one of only a very few videos I actually chose to own rather than simply rent.  I still  have that U.S. widescreen VHS.  And now I just picked up the long-awaited  U.S. DVD debut of Leon: The Professional.<br />The quality of the transfer is  among the best seen on DVD.  The sound is also of exceptional caliber.  Even more impressive is the fact that one can optionally isolate the  excellent soundtrack for listening sans dialogue and other audio  effects.<br />And then we have the extra 24 minutes.  I do not doubt that it  was wise to excise most of these scenes from theatrical release (especially  the Russian roulette bit) in the U.S. market.  The movie works well enough  without them.  But these extra scenes--intended for viewing by at least  nominally sophisticated adults--are mostly powerful, intriguing, and add  much to what is in essence a character study/love story.  And you see both  main leads--Reno and Portman--commit to their best acting only in these  scenes!<br />A real gem.  Note that the extra 24 minutes occurs fairly  &quot;cleanly&quot; in two sections, which I can highlight (email) by  timeframe on the DVD for those who have not seen the original U.S. version.
0790751089|4.0|This is a story of what could happen when someone settles for less when they're young, and later on in life, they find the real thing. This is just  what happens to the two pivotal characters, Robert and Francesca, in this  film. It moves a bit slowly, but it is a very engaging story about a  ill-fated romance between older adults, starting in the mid-'60s, and  ending only when one of them passes away...and not even then! If you like  to cry at movies, then this is definitely one you should pick up. By the  time the film ends, you would've went through a box of Kleenex!
0790749998|4.0|This movie didn't have enough fight scenes, and some of thescenes weren't even real.  Like where he runs across 5 guys and bounces off the wall and kicks another one, sorry, but that wasnt' real.  But, with Li's first starring role in a Hollywood movie (Lethal Weapon 4 was not a starring role), he gets the benefit of excellent choreography.  I love Jet Li, and I have just about all of his movies, but this could have done without DMX, who is a very terrible actor, and Aaliyah wasn't that bad.  The fight scenes that were there were very good, especially the football scene, which wasn't really a fight scene, but was very amusing... This movie is a great modern-day remake (of sorts) of Romeo &amp; Juliet... which for any movie, is darn near revolutionary.  For his first big-time movie with him as the title character, he did a good job nd I can't wait for his next movie.  I would get this movie even though there aren't that many fight scenes, but they are good though.
B000023VR6|5.0|Hats off the Dr.Dre and all his friends for this excellent cd.  All songs  were fantastic on this album.  I recomend it to anyone and everyone  planning on buying this cd.

0441172717|5.0|I first read Dune six years ago after seeing the movie at a friend's  house. I soon realized that the movie was barely a Cliff's Notes version,  though it is a good pronunciation guide! There are simply too many plots  and subplots to squeeze into 3-4 hours.    The imagination of Frank Herbert  is profoundly at the core. How could one person invent so many original  concepts - the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats and the Guild for starters! And  then to go on to so thoroughly and accurately codify human nature and  societal nature in things like the Bene Gesserit axioms. It's as if he sat  on top of a mountain and just studied humans, and our cultures and  religions, for a few years.    One of the greatest strengths as far as the  plot goes is in developing three-dimensional characters. It is not always  clear-cut who the villains are and who the heroes are - they are human, a  compilation of good and bad, just like we all really are. The most  two-dimensional is the overtly evil Baron, but in a book where the line  between good and evil is so frequently blurred, it was probably a necessity  for him to stand out as the villain. However, there are times when it's  hard to hate even him too much.        Not only is this a great book with  an almost Shakespearean plot, but I believe I learn something new every  time I pick it up. It can be a beginning point and and ending point in a  study of human and cultural evolution, not forgetting the other books in  the series, especially Book 3, Children of Dune. If it's possible for one's  I.Q. to increase, this is one book that could do it.
0767825411|5.0|Ghostbusters (1984)<br />Ghostbusters is a classic film that'struly one of the best movies ever made.<br />The story is extremely original and has been copied,but never touched.<br />The story is like this: three college friends open a business called &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;,which are a group of exterminators who eliminate Ghosts. <br />They use a unique weapon called a &quot;Proton Pack&quot; that shoots a radioactive beam of energy that captures a Ghost,giving the Ghostbuster an advantage to trap it.<br />They capture one Ghost in a Hotel and are extremely sucessful. However,a man who works for the Environmental Institute feels that their Ghostbusting equipment is hazardous to the city of New York.One day,he drops by forcing them to shut of the compound that contains the captured Ghosts.This is when all Hell breaks loose.Ghosts roam the city of New York,and a Guardian is planning on taking over the World.Only the Ghostbusters can save Humanity.<br />This film is simply incredible.It has a very tight script,very solid and strong direction from Reitman,a splendid cast, wonderful special effects,and a great script full of excellent dialog and one-liners.<br />The film very effectively balances comedy and horror and never overdoes it.It managed to be funny and scary all at once,never in any area overdone.<br />Ghostbusters is simply one of the greatest movies of all time.  Buy it now,because if it's not in your video collection,your not a movie buff like you think you are.<br />On a side note,...although Ghostbusters is marketed as Family fun,it's quite a scary movie.There are plenty of scary moments and there's even some profanity (a REAL big no-no in a kid's movie).However,the 9 and up crowd will absolutely love it and will probably want to see it over and over and over.

B000002BMD|5.0|The Manic Street Preachers are certainly not strangers to the great song,  but with &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, they finally had a great album.  This is their most popular album and justifiably so. Although  &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; and &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; had  their moments, they were never quite good enough to be great. &quot;The  Holy Bible&quot; was a more complete, if frequently harrowing album that  marked their least accessible work to date. &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;,  however, is stunning from start to finish and will no doubt be seen as  their greatest work for years to come.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Sick of sugar coated bland music about being 'not so innocent' or 'give me something to break, it's just one of those days' where it's so obvious that  the mainstream is trying to sell itself on everyone's insecurity? You want  real music?  Check this one out. No screetching guitars that are in the  same chords and no incoherent unimaginative lyrics about 'breaking stuff'  and 'why do you hate me?' that rides music so much today. The lyrics are  healing and positive.  Well done singing, deep and colorful soundscapes.   If you feel you've grown up, you might want to try Pet Sounds.  In fact  listen to it a few times.  At first you may not be that impressed and  thinking, &quot;Why is this album credited for setting off Sgt. Pepper by  the Beatles?  I don't see the connection&quot;.   Consider a few months  before Pet Sounds released.  Barbara Ann was the big Beach Boys single  right before Pet Sounds.  Then consider Pet Sounds lyrics and music.  You  talk about a big leap in maturing musically on Brian Wilson's part, and it  set the tone for what was to come in the future.  Total artistic control  and forget the constant yakking about cars, surfing, sex and California.  A  ballsy move by Brian Wilson.  Just knowing how much guts that guy had in  comparison to his previous efforts before Pet Sounds, is enough to keep me  listening.  Not just that, I consider it probably the best rock/pop record  ever done.  It's something you can't put into words.  If you don't know  what I mean, then you're not listeing...or you haven't grown up just yet.   Get Pet Sounds!
0792140346|5.0|This is another one of those movies that i did not have very high expectations for but was pleasantly suprised by.  I am not a big Richard  Gear fan but he was good in this movie.  This movie also made me an Edward  Norton fan, he is great in the film.  The plot is more complex than it  appears and the characters do a good job at executing it.  This is one of  those movies that's good throughout and the ending just highlights the rest  of the movie.  This movies ending is one of my favorites of all time.  It's  a five star movie from start to finish.

6300183971|3.0|This is an unusual movie liberally based on an unusual book. But just because they share a quality doesn't mean they're really that similar.     I'll begin with what I liked: the casting was perfect, with the actors  looking as much like their characters' prose description as possible  (except I don't really see Patrick Stewart as &quot;lumpy&quot; or  &quot;ugly,&quot; like the book-Halleck was). The acting was phenomenal,  the sets were as barren and beautiful as Frank Herbert described. The  special effects were great, considering they didn't exactly have the kind  of computer-animation that went into present day greats like Titanic.     Now for what I didn't care for: the writing. The voice-overs were good, but  I give the actors the most credit there. There were times when I had to  wonder if David Lynch &amp; CO. had ever read the book. Now, after all but  memorizing the book, if I watch the movie, I find myself thinking far too  often: this didn't happen this way .... neither did this... etc etc. I  realize that there's just no way to condense this book into even an  over-long feature film and remain perfectly true to it, but I didn't feel  like an attempt was always made. Perhaps a review of a movie based on a  book should concentrate more on the movie, however, there's no way one can  follow this movie without a pretty good understanding of the book; but  after one has read the book, one is often left shaking one's head at the  blatant straying from the original. Mr. Lynch definitely had his own ideas  about the Bene Gesserit, portraying them as actually having supernatural  powers. And nowhere in the book was there any mention of the Reverend  Mothers shaving their heads. Quite the contrary, actually.   Maybe I'm a  bit of a purist, but I feel that, in the case of something as profound as  Dune, which is rare indeed, if you can't make the film right, it shouldn't  be made. A mini-series *might* be a better vehicle. But it was nice to  actually see the worms and it was a huge help with pronunciation. And Kyle  MacLachalan as the boy-hero was much better than many other  &quot;boy-heroes&quot; we see in sci-fi. And kudos to all the actors for  doing so much with so littl

6302752337|5.0|One awesome flick about two guys doin their thing. Along the way society, the &quot;supposed&quot; normal and &quot;respectable&quot; people, hassles  and lashes out at them -- trying to stomp out their dreams. In the end,  society takes them out in a terrible display of pure idiot prejudice. I  believe their spirits continued on -- society can never stomp out the  spirit of Capt. America and Billy!<br />Two Thumbs Up for Fonda and Hopper --  I'm proud to own a copy and be part of the modern motorcycle generation.
B00000JZC4|4.0|If your one of the endless people who heard Take a Picture on a radio and  you havent heard anything else, i recommend you buy the single..the rest of  this album(with the exception of Miss Blue) Is much more obnoxious and  heavy(the way it should be). A great overall effort, This album has much  more variety than Short Bus did, Although I just love the sound on Short  Bus though, I recommend their first album over this one.
B000002OX7|5.0|Truth is, Who's Next wasn't the album I wanted to buy.  I was looking for  Odds and Sods, or something with 'Long Live Rock' on it.  I still want  that, but I'm REALLY glad I bought Who's Next first.<br />Who's Next was born  out of failiure - the failiure of the Lifehouse project.  But it's no  failiure at all - It is a glorios success.  In no time at all, Who's Next  has grown to be one of my faovrite all time records.<br />Look at the cover,  for start.  It is hillarious and provocative at the same time.  The Who  were past their 'trashing equipment' days at that point, but the cover  shows they didn't forget the art of making a strong visual impression.<br />(A  short complain - I think that the addition of the preiviously unreleased  songs harms the album - Why do you think they WEREN'T released in the first  place?  Some of them are really nice, but I would have prefered them in a  second CD, not on the same one)<br />It is the music, beyond all, that  captures you.  The rythem guitar on 'Barbara O'Reilly', John Entwistle's  powerful My Wife, which is a sad, powerful song... 'All I did was have to  much to drink'.  Going Mobile is energetic like few songs ever are, and  'I'm in Tune' is wishful and touching.<br />But to me, The Song is Over is the  best of the bunch (Though it's a VERY close call).  When Roger Daltney  roars &quot;I'll Sing My Song to the Wide Open Spaces&quot; I was thinking  for a moment of Nick Cave at his best, but there is a beauty here that  supersedes even his great tunes.  Talented artists could persaps write  songs which have this level of Energy, or this beauty, but not combine both  in one song like The Who.
B000002H1T|5.0|Wow, what can I say! This CD is almost as good as the Cars first album. So  close that many arguments have begun over the merits of both albums! As a  big Cars fan I say, &quot;you can't go wrong with this CD/Album!&quot; Even  better, I got to see them on tour the summer it came out! Takes me back.
6303212379|5.0|I was a teenager when this movie came out.  I'm now in my early 30's, and still love this movie.  My husband, in his early 40's, also loves this  movie.  To heck with the kids, we grownups like it!  Will continue to watch  it occassionally for many more years to come.  It's a great, lighthearted,  family movie.
B00004W19V|4.0|This movie is by far the ultimate classic 80's movie.  It haspretty good effects, a good story line, and who can forget Ally Sheedy....  I recommend buying the movie.  If you don't buy it for yourself, buy it for your kids.
B00004TL21|4.0|This Is the my 2nd favorite rock album of the year (behind papa roach)  this album has some of the best slow, but scary rock songs of all time in  &quot;Passenger&quot; featuring the lyrical stylings of Maynard Keenan  himself, and &quot;Change&quot; (in the house of flies)their current single  doing very well.... the cd has great Riffs, Scratches from the Turntables,  and Beats behind the man Abe Cunningham... Chino Moreno has a great voice  both scary, and hardcore.... the only problem with this album is some of  the songs are pointless like &quot;teenager&quot;... but the rest of the  songs are cool with me especially &quot;feiticeira&quot; and &quot;knife  party&quot; Bottom Line another winner for the Deftones!!!!
B00003A9QI|5.0|I don't consider myself to be a critic, just someone who knows what he likes. I'm a Film and TV graduate currently majoring in sound design and music composition. <br />When I saw 'Cider House Rules' for the first time, it was a relatively unknown film here. The Oscars were months away and I wasn't aware this film was nominated for various categories then. Anyway, I really enjoyed the film and what made me love it even more was the moving soundtrack by Rachel Portman.<br />I really love the main theme. It sets the mood of the movie beautifully I feel. Despite the recurring theme (G, G (octave), F#, D, E, D, B) it does not overwhelm the scenes or the characters in the movie. Portman has struck a great balance between subtley and the obivous. Take for example the theme for Dr. Larch's death. She did not come up with an over-the-top 'death overture', instead she came up with a poignant and stately version of the main theme. It was also nice and short, with a little bit of lingering effect towards the end because of the chord she ended with. Subtlety at its best.<br />To me, this soundtrack bears a lot of resemblance to 'Forrest Gump' (which I love a lot) - not in terms of composition but in terms of structure. 'Cider House Rules' features many short little themes within the movie which is similar to 'Forrest Gump'. Because of the brevity of these themes, we feel as if there is only one recurring theme throughout the movie. Both composers use the piano as the main 'voice' for the characters and both main themes have the same rich, wispy and almost child-like quality to it. There are only but a few soundtracks that I truly consider timeless. 'Somewhere In Time' (by John Barry) and 'Forrest Gump' (by Alan Silvestri) are two of them. I'm pleased to say that this is now one of them.
B00000K2SC|5.0|You need to see this movie.  PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE.  Ever since I saw this in the theater I have been obsessed with it.  I bought it on video, and now  I'm in the process of buying the Propellerheads album, because of their  song in the movie 'Spybreak'.  Laurence Fishburn has got to be one of the  best actors around today.  The special effects are absolutely incredible  and the story line is top-notch.  All I'm waiting for now is The Matrix 2  and 3.
B0000019HU|5.0|For years and years, I had heard vague references to Slint in music  magazines I read.  Albini raved about them, and for some people, Albini is  the god of indie music.  Not for me.  The first place I heard Slint was in  the soundtrack to the movie Kids.  The last track was Slint's 'Good  Morning, Captain,' and after hearing it, I knew I had to hear more.  Slint  isn't catchy in the conventional sense--they neither employ hooks or  teasing melodies--but they do catch.  There is something in the spindly  guitar riffs, the precise drum beats, the throbbing, subversive basslines  which screams as softly as the whispered vocals (and with equal passion) 'I  am something!'<br />In a world where music is a commodity, manufactured for  the masses, this record stirred something.  It was something.  Brian and  Britt from Slint both started out in a Louisville hardcore band named  Squirrel Bait, a bit more cerebral than some of the other bands out there,  not in their lyrical presentation but in the energy of the music, a subtle  complexity that hinted at what Slint would become.  However, it cannot be  said that Slint is a reflection of Squirrel Bait--they almost reject the  notions of hardcore music--instead, they chose to become something of their  own imagination.<br />Spiderland represents what music could be as well as  firmly declaring what it isn't.  'Good Morning, Captain' is the most  dizzying song on the album.  It 'rocks' harder than any song I've ever  heard and it comes from a soft record.  With tracks like 'Don, Aman' and  'The Washer,' there is a beauty so intense and intimate, intricate and  simple, that your eyes will water.  Spiderland is my desert island record.   It is the best collection of songs and art and emotion I've ever heard.  <br />If you do not buy this record (it is your choice), you will be cheating  yourself.  And your ears.

B000002GQE|5.0|maxxroach@hotmai   DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is a milestone in recorded music. Any music for that matter. The attention to detail and arrangement is  astounding. I believe music does not degrade in quality because of its age.  The term &quot;dated &quot; does not apply to me, But keep in mind this is  quite &quot;60's&quot; sounding. All the tunes are excellent .appealing..  From a classical standpoint, there are some fantastic classical parts and  this album represents of the best pairings of orchestra with rock or pop  ever made. Most of the stuff on here is trippier than most say. It has a  giddely-gloomy atmosphere.The Moody blues have an excelent rock ripoff on  here as   well with PEAK HOUR, which does seem out of place but remains one  of the best MOODY BLUES jammers. DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is THE MOODY BLUES AT  THE CREATIVE ZENITH OF THE BAND'S CAREER--- ITS BIRTH.

0802136834|5.0|I have been participating in Tudor-period Renaissance fairs for over 10  years now.  This requires sometimes intensive research into the lives major  (or minor) figures of the time, and I have yet to find a better all-around  source than this book.  The criticism that the information is presented  rather dryly at times is accurate, but this is not a novel!  The rarity  with which the author takes literary license is a strength in a resource  book, not a weakness.  The text is detailed, and supported by direct quotes  from communication between the main figures of Tudor court life, including  Cardinal Wolsey, Eustache Chapuy, Cromwell, and others.  I would highly  recommend this book as a principle source for anyone researching the Tudor  period in England.
0060916540|5.0|I found this book to be a gripper. The kind of book that you grip onto  reading well past your bed. I couldn't put it down and read this book well  past into the morning.<br />The author writes about his ordeal after his  accident high in the Peruvian Andes. After his fall caused by his friend,  he struggles to survive and to return to civilization. His lonely account  of his survival is a testament of his determination and his will to  survive. <br />This story is a must read. The pace and the plot is terribly  engrossing and compelling.
B00003CWL5|1.0|if this movie is what america finds beautiful, then this country is in more trouble then i thought. i have nothing against satire, as long as in  the end a lesson of some kind has been taught. what lessons were taught by  American Beauty? apparently, that it's okay to have an affair if your  husband is a jerk. that it's okay to be a drug dealer if your father is a  jerk. that it's okay to lust after your daughter's friend, as long as your  wife doesn't love you. that it's okay have no moral standard what so ever  as long as you live in suburban hell. i'll allow for other people to seek  out their own meaning to the madness that is American Beauty. some of my  friends say it made them sit in the empty theatre and think for a while. me  too. think about why i spent my evening watching a film that paints a  not-too-condescending portrait of debauchery in America. i found there to  be interesting aspects of the film. certain scenes between wes anderson and  chris cooper were extermely well written and acted, as was the now famous  &quot;pass the asperagus&quot; dinner table scene. but for each well done  moment, there were ten more that left me scrathing my head in bewilderment.  the direction by sam mendes is so obviously theatrical with his use of  lighting and shadows that one wonders why he doesn't just stay on broadway.  and just because he introduced the Great White Way to Nicole Kidmans  breasts doesn't mean he had to do the same with two under age actresses is  scenes that were at best superfluous and at worst exploitive. that is all.
B00004XMVH|5.0|These vessels -- manned by some of the bravest sailors in WWII-- were the backbone of Germany's naval campaigns.  During WWII, German U-Boats sank over 14 million tons worth of merchant men craft. They also sent 2 battleships and 3 aircraft carriers to Davey Jones's locker.  Why, even the English aircraft carrier, Royal Oak; which played a predominant role in sinking the Bismark, met its fate at the hands of a valiant U-Boat crew!  In his memoirs, Sir Winston Churchill even admitted that the U-Boat situation in the Atlantic Ocean greatly troubled him.<br />This is the back drop of this story.  In its 1942. German U-boats are reeking havoc in the Atlantic; thereby crippling the allied war efforts in Europe. England, an island nation, is on the verge of being starved out of the war.  <br />To counter this enormous problem, the allies devise a scheme to capture a German decoding machine along with supporting documentation off a German submarine. This prize would give the allies an advantage; it would tell them where the German U-Boat wolfpacks were operating.  To capture one of these enigma machines, an elite submariner commando task force was assembled.  This commando task force accomplished its mission. Unfortunately, while executing the mission, their own submarine is torpedoed.  They now find themselves trapped on a German U-Boat -- where everything is in metrics and written in German.  <br />This film gives you plenty of &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; suspense.  The allied crew now find themselves in a strange -- but very real -- &quot;parallel universe.&quot; Enemy vessels are now &quot;friendly.&quot; Allied vessels -- such as destroyers -- are now deadly adversaries.  <br />I know that comparisons with the film &quot;Das Boat&quot; are inevitable.  However, please Don't get wrapped around that axle.  &quot;Das Boat&quot; is a great [anti-war] movie that accurately portrays life on board a German U-Boat during the latter years of WWII.  U-571 is not intended to be &quot;accurate&quot; or &quot;realistic.&quot; It is intended to be a good, old-fashioned, suspense-filled WWII submarine flick -- which, it is.  <br />This is a great action-suspense film that you'll enjoy.  There will definitely be no &quot;snooring&quot; during this film. Definitely worth watching more than once. <br />As an epilogue, many vessels in the German U-Boat fleet met with watery deaths.  After the allies captured the decoding machine, swift Hunter-Killer anti-submarine surface vessels found German submarines and sank them. By the end of the war, over half of the sailors that served on German U-Boats never made it back home.  This is worth remembering while watching this film.  END
B00000G3Q4|5.0|What else can anybody say but....WOW! Being shamelessly over the top does pay off in a movie of this caliber. What a ride. Sam Raimi would later go  on to direct the two great sequels and the brilliant Simple Plan, but this  is his masterwork. A low-budget, comic-horror excursion unlike any other. A  movie so proud of its gore and hideousness that it promotes it on the front  cover. &quot;The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror.&quot;  The movie's  plot is typical, college kids going to have lots of sex and partying in an  abandoned cabin....find an old book.....unleash evil. That is where the  real pay-off comes in while watching your squeamish friends cringe at the  disgusting visuals that Raimi proudly spills across the screen. Bruce  Campbell, who has made his mark on cult-movie history with these  installments of the Dead trilogy, is perfect as the niave yet vengeful  hero. He would later be built up in the sequels, but I think this movie  portrays him at his most primitive, enjoyable area of the role known as  Ash. The ending's atmospheric tone makes you relate to Ash as he struggles  all alone to survive the night. There is a particular scene where his eyes  are closed tight, his back is to the wall, and he is mumbling to himself  about how he doesn't want to go like this. This scene is the most  definitive scene in the Dead trilogy, and the genre's history. A movie that  does not hold back or let up, it is a MUST for all horror fans.  I can only  think of a few movies that come close to the quality of the first Evil  Dead. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Evil Dead 2 both come close, but the  throne still belongs to the first and best. I highly recommend this to  anyone who loves movies.

0671034065|5.0|This book was by far one of Mrs. Howard's best endeavors. Her witty style  and comic characters kept the story fast-paced and exciting. The  complexities of the plot pulled me in and kept me reading until I finished  and left me marveling at the ending. Mrs. Howard's style of writing in this  book made it one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to read. This story  is about four friends who come up with a list of what makes the perfect  man. Although it started out as a joke, the list quickly made it's way into  the news. Unfortunately, a man who is not so perfect takes exception and  murders two of the friends, and one of the friends, Jaine, enlists the help  of her policeman neighbor, Sam. As the plot unfolds, the two fall in love,  but can Sam prevent the killer from ruining that love?
0920668372|5.0|I just read this book yesterday (the French version, actually!) for the first time.  It was a gift from a friend, so I read it aloud to my 7 month  old son, and by the time I reached the end I was in tears!  I can't believe  that anyone could actually find this book offensive or misguided in any  way, it is a pure expression of a mother's limitless love for her child.   Sure, it's preposterous that a mom would really drive across town with a  ladder on the roof of her car to sneak in her son's room and rock him and  sing to him while he's sleeping, but I think any loving parent can relate  to the sentiment!  It's only a story, people!  I think this is one of the  most heartfelt, sweetest books I've ever read, and I would highly recommend  it for children and parents alike!
0553278398|5.0|Asimov outdid himself when he wrote 'Prelude to Foundation.'  This was the first Foundation story that he wrote after the original series in the 40's.  'Prelude' is the story of young Hari Seldon as he comes to the Galactic  capitol Trantor to deliver his paper on the new science, pyschohistory.  But Seldon's work is coveted by those who would pervert it and use it for  thier own devious ends.  Seldon's flight from his enemies takes him across  the face of Trantor.  Along the way Seldon learns the vital clues he will  need make his science of prediction work.  Populated with cunning  characters and fantastic worlds, this is one of Asimov's greatest works and  sets the stage for the entire Foundation universe.  Science-fiction at it's  best!
B0000019HU|5.0|slint's Spiderland is probably the most rated yet underheard album of the  last ten years. Most music fans have an album that they feel charts their  own personal growth from a pop fan to an appreciation for something a  little more 'serious'. An album that on first listen  sounds alien and  unapproachable but with repeated listens opens itself up to be a work of  beauty and grace. Spiderland is such an album.
B00004TL21|5.0|After listening to White Pony I was literally in awe. This could possibly  be the Deftones finest album so far. White Pony is nothing like any of the  Deftones other stuff. The majority of the songs are melodic and a much  slower tempo than what most Deftones fans are used to. Don't let this scare  you away because White Pony still has a few songs like Korea, Street Carp,  and Feiticeria that have the heavy beat that all Deftones fans love. The  standout track on White Pony is Passenger because it is a collaboration  between the 2 best singers in the world, Chino Moreno and Maynard James  Keenan(Tool &amp; A Perfect Circle). That song is just breathtaking and you  have to hear it yourself. Overall this a must buy album and so far is the  album of the year. So if you don't have it yet(shame on you) go get it now!
B00004TH6O|4.0|Get this disc !! Will it remind you of something else ? Maybe a sound here or there, but it's so unique in many of it's own ways. The disc has many different variations through it. From cool rock hooks, to thrashing, ripping guitars with distorted vocals. If it's rock n' roll you like, then this disc will be a very pleasent suprise, with many new fresh twists on the classic rock sound you might be used to. Get this CD and hear a progressive band at it's peak (as of now, at least).
079074841X|1.0|It's pitiful that a couple as &quot;capable&quot; as Nicole and Tom would stoop to such a disgusting and odd script.  Shame on them.
B000002OX7|5.0|Maybe!  This band, at the absolute height of their formidable talents?   They were awesome.  Saw them near Saint Louis when this album was new  (Summer '71).  Unbelievable.  Yup, they wained a bit later, but not on  this! How many other rock releases from 1971 can you even stand to listen  to now?  1971 was &quot;a very good year&quot; for music, but this is  really tops. Check out Pete's live in Chicago album from last year to see  how well his writing holds up now, after all this time.  Fantastic stuff.   A killer album that also contains the all-time dorm speaker-tester  &quot;scream&quot;.  Can you guess where?  Great cover art, too! It's  really a shame I can only give 5 stars for this.
B000002UA9|3.0|Although this album *is* immensely important to the early 1960's rock  movement, it's important because of the four big singles on it rather than  the album as a whole. And this is not an attack on Please Please Me, it was  released in a singles era and no one was really putting out (or expecting)  proper albums.<br />Should you buy it? Well because the Red Album compilation  only covers 2 of these songs, this is still an important part of any  Beatles collection. It's not essential like Rubber Soul is essential, but  the story behind this album is so well known that you really should at  least listen to it. <br />And it's fairly enjoyable anyway. The 4 big songs (I  Saw Her..., Please Please Me, Love Me Do, and Twist &amp; Shout) are all  great, and Boys, PS I Love You, and There's A Place are good songs. The  rest is listenable but nothing you'd want to come back to often.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Edited on 8/18/2008<br /><br />It's not often you say that the movie is better than the book, but Frank Darabont took a good novella by Stephen King and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece. Everything in this film works. The acting and writing is out of this world. I still don't care for Tim Robbins as an actor, but he didn't get on my nerves too bad mainly because this movie is just that good. This is in my top 3 favorite films ever and it has been that way since the first time I saw it over a decade ago. If you haven't seen it yet or even if you have, you must own it. I guarantee you will watch it more than once or twice.
B000002UAI|3.0|Beatles For Sale is actually a fun listen, and the song writing on No Reply, I'm A Loser, and Baby's In Black is more sophisticated (albeit not  necessarily &quot;better&quot;) than anything up until that point.  <br />There's some great stuff here. In addition to the opening three, Rock  And Roll Music and Eight Days A Week are superb, and I'll Follow The Sun  and Every Little Thing are legitimately fun songs. <br />What detracts from  making this album an &quot;excellent&quot; album is the weariness (and the  presence) of a lot of the covers. Should you buy this one? For a complete  Beatles collection I say yes, it might be considered the worst in their  catalogue (this or Let It Be) but it's still enjoyable (personally I think  it's a better listen than Please Please Me and With The Beatles) and there  are songs important to the Beatles' story on this. <br />For those that are  &quot;essentials only&quot; people, I think you can pass this up though  just because this album is neither uniformly &quot;excellent&quot; or  really that important (compared to other Beatle albums).
0316777722|5.0|I think David Sedaris and Henry Alford are the two funniest people writing  right now. Sedaris's new book is perhaps more commercial than his other  ones--some of the topics are a little more obvious than ones he's tackled  before--but it is no less funny. Can we blame him if he wants to laugh  about foreigners making funny lingual mistakes, or waiters in pretentious  restaurants? Granted, these topics are sort of like shooting fish in a  barrel. But they're no less funny for being obvious.
B000002UAF|4.0|This album absolutely rocks (almost uninterruptedly) from start to finish.  There are timeless classics on here (the title track and Things We Said  Today) as well as 5-6 other stellar early-Beatle tracks. <br />There's really  little filler on here compared to their previous two outings, which makes  for a solid listen, but what detracts (if anything) from putting this album  in the masterpiece vein is that the album is still moreso just a collection  of songs than a proper album. And that's not a knock, A Hard Day's Night is  still spectacular and is easily a rock and roll essential, but it's just  not up to today's standards of what constitutes a 5 star rating.<br />In a  way, the previous two albums tapped into a rock and roll atmosphere that  was ready to burst into the mainstream, and this album came to embody that  1964 rock and roll movement's energy. An essential album.
6305897786|3.0|Why are there so many movies about the Devil lately?<br />Johnny Depp seems to be better known for his weird characters in movies such as ... Edward  Scissorhands ... Sleepy Hollow ... The Astronaut's Wife and now The Ninth  Gate.<br />The story was a bit slow to develop with a a scene reminisent of  Eyes Wide Shut. The ending was a total dissappointment!  I wouldn't buy  this one...if you're still curious - rent it on video.
B000002UAC|3.0|Don't be put off by the 3 star rating, most people here give something 3 stars and write a negative review; but 3 stars means an album is  &quot;good&quot;. And With The Beatles is certainly a good pop  album.<br />This is definitely a progression from their debut, the songs are  produced more sophisticatedly and there are less dull moments in the  listen. It Won't Be Long, All My Loving, Please Mister Postman, Roll Over  Beethoven, and Money are all great early Beatle tracks. The rest of the  record is a collection of good to decent pop songs and one dud (Devil In  Her Heart). <br />Is it essential? Not for the casual rock fan, no. But for a  complete Beatles collection, yes it is. You can find All My Loving on the  Red Album, but there are 13 other tracks you can't find anywhere else that  make up an album integral to the Beatles' early years.
B000002U82|5.0|Not too much to say: this is surely the best album from Pink Floyd and it  is in my personal Top Ten Disc. What emotion each time I play it.
B000005GWH|5.0|This was the first CD by Richard Elliot that I had the  privilege to  Listen to. Needless to say I have several of his CD's in my collection now.  Without going into a lot of detail it is still my favorite(maybe because it  was my first). There is not a bad song on it. Richard is melodic, soulful,  and smooth. At the same time he is funky, brash, and bold. The man can play  any style and play it well. Just one warning! If you buy one of his CD's  you will want them all! Happy Listening.
B00003CXGG|5.0|I bought this movie on a hunch that it might be good, as I like Jet Li and wanted to see Aaliyah's debut acting.  The open scene set the pace, and I  liked the plot of 2 families, Asian and African American, having conflict  with the dad's and friendship with the children (Li and Aaliyah).  What  made this movie great was the sound track, as the music and sound effects  from the fight scenes and explosions came alive in the digital format.   This movie is a must see if only for the sound effects, action scenes, and  lesser degree the plot.

0783241399|4.0|I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. In fact I wanted to love this movie. I wanted to be able to rave about it to my friends and  family. Unfortunately the Hurricane while it's a good movie, with a great  performance from Denzel Washington but it isn't the great movie should be.  I am a big Norman Jewison fan. He's made some really great films (in the  heat of the night, A soldiers story, and justice for all among others)  I  went into the Hurricane expecting to see an even handed portrayal of the  struggle of Reuben 'Hurricane' Carter. That being said first off Denzel's  performance as Reuben hurricane carter is one of the best perfoamences of  his career. The fact the he didn't recieve and oscar for his performance is  a absolute travesty. His performance was 100 times more intense , more  involving and outright amazing that Kevin Spaceys in American Beauty. And  I'm a Kevin Spacey fan. Jewison's direction is also very good as well. The  fight scenes are amazing. They're almost as good as the one's in raging  bull. The black and white cinematography adds a real energy to them.<br />My  problem with the hurricane lies in the fact that the producers changed some  facts to make the story a little more pallatable to the masses. I had no  problem with the subplot of Lazarus and the the three freindly canadians  that help in freeing the hurricane. I have no problem with them changing  the facts to make the story more entertaining. I just wished that they had  taken a little more care to tell his story more clearly. For instance, What  happens to the hurricane's wife? after he tels her to divorce him she  completely drops out of sight. What did these Canadians do for a living? I  know they were lawyers but did any of them actually work?   and What about  John Artis? The other man who served 20+ years in prison. The only mention  of him in the hurricane is a less 2  minute stanza where Denzel talks about  him being his hero. I would've liked to hear more about his struggle. Maybe  in the interest of time that these things were glossed over but in watching  the Hurricane again (2nd time) I noticed some of these glaring plot holes  that I'd expect to see in a cheesey Hollywood thriller and not in a  biographical drama. Overall I'd recommend the Hurricane largely because of  Denzels powerhouse performance. You wont see many that are better. It's not  a perfect movie but a good one whose intentions and hearta are in the right  place.
0553577123|5.0|I was amazed at the depth of understanding and writing abilties of this  young teenager while she was in hiding during the Second World War in  Holland.  As a teenager myself, I feel like Anne is writing my own thoughts  on the pages before me and I realized that this hardship of the Holocaust  she faced made her wise beyond her years.  What a strong and optomistic  girl in the face of such adversity!  I wish I could have the chance to  speak to Anne Frank and tell her that she has written a true statement of  human nature so wonderfully.  I admire her so much for her abilties to  write freely and honestly about issues facing all human kind and especially  in the hearts of teenagers.  I am glad that I came upon reading this small  treasure that was written in a time of war, and am able to hear her voice  so loudly now in the present many years later.  I would reccomend this book  to all who want to see and hear what it was and is like to be a teenager  faced with such a terrible hardship.  There is much to learn from Anne  Frank, young and old.
B000024D4R|4.0|Animals is a very well done record from the best rock band ever. A few  loose ends hurt it, but all of the songs are excellent. I'm getting very  used to the five-song CDs that Pink Floyd have made, with their overlong  tracks and very provocative meanings. Animals is similar. The first and  last songs on the album (Pigs on the Wing 1 &amp; 2) are good ways to begin  and end it. Then we have Dogs, arguably the best song on the album. This  song is one of my favorites because it combines David Gilmour's great  guitar playing with Roger Waters' poetic lyrics. Pigs and Sheep are also  well done, but nowhere near as good as Dogs. Pigs and Sheep all suffer from  the same problems. They both lack the musical influence of David Gilmour,  who wrote some of the best Floyd music ever. Animals is not by any means a  bad album but it's not an excellent one. It is a must-buy for a Floyd fan.
B000000OU4|4.0|Originally I was not as enthused by this recording as I was for most of those that preceded it.   Perhaps because this recording took a different tact than his others.    A decidedly different album for Pat. The album starts out with three very contemporary and deceptively radio friendly pieces  that flirt with hip-hop and smooth groove sensibilities.  At first you might want to dismiss these because of that.   I did almost did.  I would ask that you take a closer listen.   They're subtle pieces with interesting segues, hooks and nuances.  Pat shows that he could groove on these, improvise soulfully and incorporate disparate influences into something Pat Metheny or more accurately Pat Metheny Group-like.   On the fourth piece the master shows himself. That piece being \\"To the End of the World\\" and continues through  six very good pieces and finishes on a true high note with \\"Stranger  in Town\\". There are pearls here, definitely. \\"Episode  D'Azure\\" is a wonderful ensemble piece with Pat and Lyle weaving in  and out throughout the piece. A dynamic and inventive piece. The title cut  is raw passion, steadily building, layer upon layer, Pat's synth-guitar  wailing longingly over a primal rhythm.  \\"Red Sky\\" is another one  of those pieces that like. \\"To the End of The World\\" shows Pat's  understanding of tension and release.  \\"Stranger in Town\\" is my  personal favorite, a guitar player's piece.        This album shows what an  inventive musician can do with contemporary music forms and not sound  cliched.  Pat's take on the current forms played heart, soul and  individuality.
B000002A3T|4.0|The Division Bell is Pink Floyd's latest album and clearly not their  greatest. Most of the tracks can work on their own, but the album has a  loose concept feel to it. The album discusses the problems the band had in  the past with Roger Waters. Some of the songs even seem to provoke a  reaction from Waters himself (A Great Day for Freedom and Lost for Words).  The keyboards are here in full force finally, with Richard Wright back to  full member status (In Momentary Lapse of Reason, he was not officially a  part of the band; he was a sideman). He seems to have more freedom in this  album, given backing vocals on his songs with Gilmour and lead vocals on  Wearing the Inside Out. David Gilmour has a few good songs here, especially  Coming Back to Life and High Hopes. A few songs, such as Cluster One and  Marooned, sound like songs from relaxation tapes! The Division Bell is  better than Momentary Lapse of Reason and the better trio album. But Roger  Waters' lyrics are sorely missed.
6304936303|4.0|The last boy scout is one of the best action movies you are likely to see on DVD, if you want action then this is the ticket, not only is it a  fantastic rollercoaster ride of an action movie, it is also one of the most  hilerious and funny action films you are likely to see!<br />Let's face it,  its was never going to win any oscars but the film is brilliant and very  watchable time and time again which is an important criteria for any DVD  purchase<br />The picture is fantastic as is the 5.1 dolby digital sound as it  blasts out from every corner of the room, the disc is only let down by  little extras but don't let that put you off, if you want to watch the  movie BUY IT!<br />The best Action Comedy of the 90's
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the rare gems of rock 'n roll. Every song  on the CD is great and a classic. On the Run is one of my all-time  favorites for its cool sound effects and, of course, Richard Wright's  synthesizers. Time is another classic, speaking of the life cycle and aging  process, helped along by David Gilmour's guitars and Roger Waters' lyrics.  The Great Gig in the Sky is Richard Wright's masterpiece, discussing the  afterlife and our opinions of heaven and hell as we know it. Money is  possibly the greatest rock song ever, and Roger Waters' best song. The  combination of the sound effects, the guitars, and the blending of jazz and  blues with rock themes is priceless. Us and Them, to me, is a song with a  strange pairing of writers (Roger Waters and Richard Wright), who never  were on the same page to begin with, and who had much hatred towards each  other. The song talks about war between lands and wars between two people  at once. Brain Damage is a trippy song, speaking of insanity and mental  instability (possibly a tribute to Syd Barrett?). Eclipse is a great way to  close the album and has a classic saying at the end (Roger Waters' line,  &quot;There is no dark side of the moon. Matter of fact, it's all  dark.&quot;). This is the best rock album ever and any comparison to any  other rock album is totally unfair. Stay with the best and buy DSOTM now!
031286504X|5.0|i found this old weird looking 1950's paperback of my dad's and read it, it was getting on in the day, and reading this book as the sunset neared, i  grew very edgy. i was alone in my sister's apartment reading about this  unbelievable world and setting. i just can't believe how mattheson can  write cliffhangers, my favorite part was him describing the protanganist's  favorite hobby was looking for his undead neighbor to kill him. also  amazing when the protaganist was experimenting with killing the undead and  he realizes his watch had stopped.... jesus just the best. my commentary  doesn't do it justice, but he painted a mood so hopeless and dreary..... i  will leave it at that.
B0000214F3|5.0|Hands down, this movie is intended to pluck the strings in the hearts and minds of those who are capable of understanding the generally simple yet  contextually intricate conflicts that take place within each of the main  characters and between them. As Death enters the world as a human, he is  faced with drives, senses, and desires characteristic of one. He learns of  the heart-throbbing reality of emotional love, as well as the stimulating  (to say the least :-)) power of physical love. He must, in a compressed  period of time, grow as a man to understand the responsibility that comes  with truly loving someone - the very human gesture of sacrifice. Paralell  to the growth of Joe as a man, Bill Parrish must come to terms with the  life he lived and the death he is facing, and he proves himself a man of  such character, inner strength, and spirit as to be capable of entering the  &quot;valley of shadows&quot; with total satisfaction, having gained all in  this life that he dreamed of, hoped for, and having received all the  rewards he did and did not expect. He succeeded as a businessman, a father,  became a man beloved by all he met and touched - he lived a  &quot;first-class life.&quot; And, of course, the emotional development of  Joe, Bill, and his daughter Susan are held together in the plot with a  story of corporate intrigue, betrayal, and the strength of truth and  friendship that ultimately restores the dethroned Bill to the head of his  corporate empire.<br />&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is an intellectual movie  that perfectly balances the emotions of (romantic as well as parental)  love, friendship and honesty and the realities of deceit and betrayal. It  has a smoothly-flowing plot enriched by truly beautiful soul-touching  music.

B00001NFCY|5.0|I 'discovered' this band through my friend - we'd be working or driving or  whatever and a Creed song would come on and she'd be like &quot;I love this  band/song&quot; and I'd be like &quot;Yeah, cool&quot; and started to agree  with her so I bought the CD  Human Clay and it rules! I didn't know people  thought they were a 'christian' band until I read reviews and listened to  people diss them - I just thought they believed in god and thats cool - I'm  not religious and I don't like what I consider 'Christian rock' but I LOVE  this CD an I don't think you need to be religious to appreciate it!  Creed  is awesome and I hope they put out a 3rd CD that is as cool as the first  two!
068484267X|3.0|My parents are first generation immigrants from Greece and lived a life  very similar to, if not worse than, Frank McCourt's.  Therefore, I am very  accustomed to hearing stories of poverty, misery and starvation.  I do,  however, also hear stories about a simple, carefree and down-to-earth  lifestyle that I can never even imagine having been born and raised in New  York.  My point is that noone's life is 100% miserable and McCourt's book  is lacking and incomplete in this way.  The bottom line is that although  McCourt's life was a rather miserable one, his story is anything but  unique.  What sets McCourt apart from anyone else who was raised in similar  conditions is the fact that he decided to write a book about it.  His  writing style is better than adequate, although slow at times.  And, I must  admit, it is rather impossible for a man his age to have such a flawless  memory of his youth.  Basically, I don't think McCourt meant to write a  history book or a guide on Ireland and the Irish and therefore his writing  should not be judged in this way.  People seem to forget that THIS IS A  MEMOIR.  Therefore, it is subjective and it is the world as seen through  the eyes of the writer.  Admittedly, this is not Pulitzer Prize-worthy  literature.  But then again, what is nowadays?  Simply put, this is a nice  book to try.  If you like it, finish it.  If you don't, there's no need to  attack the writer or the world.
B000002LGA|5.0|If American Psycho's Patrick Bateman ever heard New York he might have burned his business card and become a social worker.  In an era of slick,  Trump worship, 'get a job,' 'how far could man go if it weren't for all  these losers,' Reed provides a wake up call:  &quot;Try to be human  again.&quot;  He succeeds brilliantly.  I am personally put to shame and  snapped out of Style over Substance hypnotics imposed by Baywatch News  shows and slick pols and Kraftwerkian pop coldness every time I put this  disc on.  This is real.
B000001DTM|5.0|From the first cries of distorted guitar on Zoo Station, to the final  emotional beats of Love Is Blindness, Achtung Baby is a recording that will  forever find a place in my CD player.  The album was momentous for its  stylistic innovations and production quality at the time, and those same  attributes make it equally as relevant to todays music trends.  While U2  has been devoutly praised and harshly criticized for most of its projects,  someone who is either new to the band or their biggest fan can rejoice in  this album's simple, pure, inspired genius.  <br />The full range of U2's  sound is here...from the pure innovation of Edge's signature guitar sound  on Even Better than the Real Thing and the Fly, to Larry Mullen's  awe-inspiring beats layered with the Edge on Mysterious Ways, to the  inspired lyrics of Bono on One, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, and So  Cruel, music lovers will find this an album layered in sound.  Every time I  listen to this album I hear something new.  And I've owned it for 9 years.   <br />U2 took a major career risk when they laid it all on the line to  reinvent their sound following the amazing commerical success of the late  80's with the Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum, and still to this day you can  read the messages from fans on U2 websites criticizing the direction their  music has taken as of late.  You can hear the layers of growth, sometimes  brilliant, sometimes misdirected, in the recordings that follow this album,  Zooropa, the Passengers project, and Pop, but to hear U2's 90s sound at its  best and in its infancy, look no farther than this recording.  <br />Truly  this is an album that even today, nine years after its release, is relevant  to the current music scene.  That timeless quality is what makes Achtung  Baby not just a must have U2 album, but a must have album period.  Buy  it...you won't regret it.
B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho is the type of movie that is only for certain tastes.  You like it or hate it.  It's a good movie but it wasn't as good as I expected.   It relied on sex too much in certain scenes to drag out the running time.   Most of the sex scenes weren't necessary for the plot.<br />Christian Bale  plays Pat Bateman, a well-to-do exec with a dangerous nighttime actvity...  he likes to kill people.<br />The film is not as gory as one would expect  given the title, but that doesn't mean it's bloodless (because it's far  from that).  The film does give off some black humor including a scene in  which Bale tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine.<br />Over all it's a real  good movie.  It's too bad it has too much sex or else I would've given it  five stars.
630575067X|1.0|I went to see this the first day, waited in line for an hour (like a good fan), and what did I get? Disappoinment. The kid who plays anakin is  horrible, The Bad guys were 1 dimensional ( Does any one notice that darth  maul doesn't even speak! ) The only part I enjoyed was the final fight  scene. Lucus went a little too far with the power of the force. I hope the  second one is MUCH better (sequels in trilogys are always the best...)
6304826133|4.0|COP LAND is a highly entertaining piece of work. Sly Stallone gives a powerhouse performance as Freddy, the sheriff of Garrison, NJ. Or as Robert  DeNiro puts it, &quot;The sheriff of Cop Land.&quot; This is probably  Stallone's best performance since ROCKY. The bang-up ending sequence is  unforgettable. I highly recommend this film if you enjoy action-packed  movies that actually revolve around the characters. Watch it twice.
0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro gives his readers some food for thought about what it means to have &quot;dignity&quot; and how to approach one's job. Stevens, the  oh-so-pompous butler who narrates this novel, thinks he has carried out his  functions as a butler to an English lord with suspicious ties to the Nazis  in a way that exemplifies dignity. Although he expresses doubts about the  lord he serves, ultimately, he is nothing more than a robot, carrying out  orders without thought or regard to their consequences.<br /><br />More  disturbing, though, is Steven's lack of emotions, as well as his inability  to understand the emotions of others. As a reader, I wanted to knock some  sense into this guy, yet Ishiguro does a masterful job of making the reader  care about this butler, even if he has the EQ (emotional quotent) of a  gnat!
B000009RC2|5.0|This is definitely the best album I have ever heard.  I had no idea that  this type of music was out there.  Mclaughlin is unreal and cobham remains  one of my favorite drummers.  This is by far the most intense and awesome  recording that I have ever heard and everyone should get a chance to hear  it.
0385470819|5.0|This is a well told story with a solid plot and some captivating subplots.  The descriptions of the emotions of Carl Halley and the events that  surround him are told in a manner as if you were experiencing each action.  One misguided critic here felt that this story is merely an insult to one's  intelligence.  I say to him,&quot;Just what would you do if it was your  daughter who was raped?&quot;  Even if you do not agree with what the  message the author is trying to get accross, there is no doubt that the  story and drama behind it stand very strong.
1878424319|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because it sends very good messages. The four agreements  are simple and right to the target.  Although none of them is completely  new stuff, the author applies them differently, making them refreshing. For  instance, you must have heard the advice \\"always do your best\\" hundreds of  times before reading this book, but here it is applied to avoid regret and  pain in life, not to make an achievement, and it is exactly the fact. Most  of the time I feel unhappy not because I did not succeed in something, but  because of the thought that I could have tried harder and done better.  <br />What I don't like is that the ideas in the book are really just long  enough to be a magazine's article material. (It could have been a very good  article.) To stretch it to a whole book the author has to repeat himself  here and there, make inappropriate examples and talk a lot about \\"dream\\".  If you don't have enough time and are not into exotic religions, I suggest  you skip the first and last chapters, just read the first few paragraphs of  each of the 4 agreement chapters.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I never used to be a Red Hot Chili Peppers' fan.  With the exception of a few songs, I pretty much ignored them and their music.  But one night last  year, I went to a party and &quot;Californication&quot; was playing.  I was  immediately drawn in by the slightly off center beauty of several of the  songs and their depictions of life in California.  The songs put the  listener in the midst of wannabe movie stars and exploitive studio types,  and you feel the reality of the dark side of life in LA.  Plus, the  musicianship is excellent.  I don't think Anthony Kiedis has ever sounded  better.  Hopefully, the Peppers will continue to produce music of this  caliber and with this emotional impact, and I will keep coming back for  more.
0881030856|5.0|I LOVED this book!  So far it is the best book I have ever read!    I  really liked the way the bunnies acted and all of the stories they told.   It didn't get boring because it was about different things the bunnies did.   Like leaving their home, making a new home...  I loved it from the  beginning to the end!
B00000420F|5.0|Cecilia Bartoli burst upon the music scene with great and well-deserved  fanfare, and this collection of 18th century Italian songs is more evidence  that the acclaim is definitely warranted.  These are beautiful  performances.  The bell-like quality of her voice is enhanced by excellent  enunciation.  It is a joy to sit down and experience this CD.

0440219078|5.0|Like A Wrinkle in Time and Tuck Everlasting, Lois Lowry's The Giver is a book with appeal beyond the science fiction genre. It would interest a  general audience looking for a story about what societies value in human  terms.       It is a sophisticated book. Both Jonas and the reader are on  parallel courses, both gradually realizing the dilemma Jonas faces. The  reader begins innocent of the fictional setting, and discovers how it  functions as the story unfolds. Jonas, the 12-year-old protagonist, on the  other hand, knows nothing about societies in the past like our own and  finds out step by step. The dramatic climax of the book comes when the two  converge.       Lowry has imagined an intricate future society, with some  recognizable elements such as nuclear families, but other foreign  combinations, such as birthdays for all people on one day a year. It seems  to be a society that has taken social science ultilitarianism to an  extreme. Their language has a clinical sound, such as \\"comfort object\\" for  a teddy bear, and more poetic terms like \\"love\\" have no place.     The  author has done a clever job at \\"seducing\\" the reader by creating a society  with many desirable traits. One can see the reasons for the choices the  leaders made and that makes the drama and provocativeness of the book even  greater. It is a book that works skillfully on both the intellectual and  emotional levels. Recommended to readers 15 and older.
B000002MNL|5.0|This cd is great. One of his best. This and your arsenal are his best.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I like this CD except I feel guilty actually listening to it. All the  songs I can just ignore the ideas except for &quot;Kim&quot; track 16 that  is just DOWNRIGHT SICK! I agree with the  many people who think stan has  good ideas. My favorite song is The Way I Am. My advice is too download  Stan, the way I am, and maybe the real slim shady if u like it.  ...ensored version you won't be buying a cd full of music, you will be buying  a cd full of blanks and beeps.view forum complaining about  Em's lyrical content(Em=gangsta rapper? HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHA!!!), but what  these poor souls don't realize is that is what he WANTS them to do. He's  enjoys pissing people off(&quot;Criminal&quot;-&quot;Half the sh*t I say, I  just make it up, to make you mad, so kiss my white naked a**!)and he's damn  good at it. See what you don't realize you mindless zealots is that this  album is just too smart for you. All you hear is Em's sickness, you don't  bother to dig deeper, then you go on your &quot;blame the music for my  child's problems because I can't admit I'm an awful parent&quot; and your  &quot;this man commited a crime because he listened to violent music, not  because of his mental illness&quot; rampages. Really, you people make me  laugh. Oh yeah, to you so called &quot;hip hop heads&quot; who jock  Common(who is a great emcee by the way, but not god) but still hate on Em.  Stop being a underground D-*-C-K-R-I-D-E-R. and realize skills. Eminem has  a dope delivery, fresh lyrics, tight flow, and executes concepts to  perfection. What the hell else do you want? He's paid his dues and is more  entertaining then most of the emcees out today. I also want to extend my  &quot;chubby middle finger&quot; to that bigoted, cheap, pile of rags XXL.  Okay, enough with my cry-baby hissy fit and on to the album review. The  Marshall Mathers is an execellent album with solid production  throughout(Dr.Dre and Mel-Man, 45 King, FBT). The beats range to maniac to  mellow to sinister to bouncy.Em's lyrics are incredible and his hooks get  burned into your brain like a branding iron, it's great how he can come  with sick lyrics yet sneak in social commentary. His disses are hillarous  and songs like &quot;Stan&quot; and &quot;Kim&quot; flow like a great  novel. All in all, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is much better than  his last two. It's a roller coaster ride of an album exploding with  sarcasm, and emotion, but most importantly, it's too damn smart for  America. Sure, Eminem isn't the only great white emcee out there as these  brain dead teenyboppers would believe, but damn it, he's one of the best  emcees out today, and given time, he may become one of the best ever.  Peace.
B000002LOM|3.0|This cd is a good buy. Not morrissey's best attempt. this cd is still  good. Has some really good tracks.
0790731509|5.0|I love this movie.<br />I've watched it many times over and am always discovering more depth to the script and screenplay.  <br />Paul Newman plays  the title character with the cool, easy going grace the part calls for.   Cool Hand Luke is content with passing time, just as long as he is given a  little elbow room for his independent nature.  But he is given no room to  manuever by The Man.  Just like in &quot;One Flew Over the Cookoos  Nest&quot;, our hero is bigger and better than their antagonist, except for  the fact that time is one the side of the jailor.  As in his brutal fight  with Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke is fighting with a &quot;hand full of  nuthin&quot;.  His fighting philosophy is like The Clash lyric, &quot;We're  gonna fight, till you lose&quot;.  <br />Luke can take all The Man gives and  more, until tragically, his mother dies.  The prison warden decides that he  must lock Luke down, just when Luke is feeling the most claustrophobic; He  needs the opposite.  <br />Luke will not bend to the guards intimidation, and  the guards will not give Luke the elbow room he so desperately needs.   Especially because he is the viewed as an near-deity by the other  prisoners.  <br />There are many illusions to Luke as Christ.  Is Luke an  unwilling Christ figure?  I don't know.  He is to the prisoners.  He is  viewed as a mythic hero by the other prisoners.  He is the best eater, the  best worker in the Bull-Gang, the best musician, the best poker player, the  best escapee.  But his disciples abandon him in this time of greatest need.   He is looking for answers from The Man (and I don't mean Boss Godfrey),  but gets no reply.  Watch for the symbolism throughout.  <br />There is also  much to enjoy for the casual viewer.  This film has many classic scenes and  lines.  &quot;I ken eat 50 ehhgs&quot;, Lucille at the car wash (Oh Baby!),  &quot;What we got here is failure to communicate&quot;, and &quot;Saying  its your job don't make it right, Boss&quot;.Paul Newman is easy on the  eyes.  And the supporting cast, lead by chief disciple George Kennedy, is  superb.  I also enjoyed the Christian music throughout.
6303257844|5.0|this movie has everything to make it one of my favorites,but it would only be perfect if it didn't have bad acting at times and corny lines.
B00002E23E|5.0|There are three kinds of critics for this film.<br />The first include &quot;The ignorant&quot; They are about 25% of the Zeppelin Fan Base, These  are the complainers about poor film editing, bad sequencing, and they are  quick to point out that it is just another dollar made for jimmy page.   <br />The second type are &quot;The Easy to please&quot; They are about 60% of  the Zeppelin Fan Base, These people are those who are absolutely enthralled  that they get to see Jimmy with his bow, John beating his drums with his  bare hands, and the sexual vibe of Robert, and well, Nothing from the  faceless Jones, They don't care about the edits they just enjoy the music.   <br />The third type is &quot;The Eccentric&quot; They are about 15% of the  Zeppelin Fan Base, They have read all they can on Zeppelin, Wrote  discourses for high school english class, and used the same document for a  college paper and could tell you everything there is to know about Zeppelin  from the Riot House in LA to the ranch at Bron-Y-Aur pronounced (brom-rhar)  They like to explain to their friends what the &quot;tripped out&quot;  sequences are about.<br />Personally much like the second group I enjoy the  music, and the rememberance, I also like the insight to their personas and  I find it hilarious that as much as anyone complains about the quality,  they still end up buying the disc, as other reveiwers have said.<br />If your  a guitarist, drummer, or was once a pot head you're going to love this  movie.  That's all that needs to be said.<br />I'm just glad Zeppelin has  something to show for their years on the road.  It's too bad they were  screwed by the original film editor, remember they were lucky to produce  what they did.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Basically what i mean is that the radio plays the floyd and zepplin and  thats all fine and good but basically more young peeps need to know about  this album.  I just got into it recently and its defintitely all that  people say it is, lyrically, musically,.  Beautiful, beautiful music.
0345428056|5.0|This is a verry exciting story. I've almost read the book in just one  breath!!
6300218031|5.0|I can say it is great that the 80's went out with a bang thanks in part to this awesome movie. Although in hollywood it seems that only the popular, rich,kids deserve screentime. It is great that John Hughes decided to  abandon that cliche' and go with a story about two underdogs one who is so  smitten with the popular lead (Lea Thompson of Caroline in the city, Back  to the future fame) as the popular girl who is the object of Eric Stolz's  affection. The second lead is played by the amazing, versatile, actress  Mary Stuart Masterson. The morale of this movie is that you have all you  need and you dont even realize it. It is a great movie and surprisely not  too dated.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|I have to admit that I have not heard every song on the album. However the  ones I did hear I liked. The beats were ok but her voice was a little flat.  When the &quot;If you had my love&quot; single first came out I thought  using a synthesizer was kind of premature for a first single. Her voice  should have been showcased more. I do believe though that some people are  just hatting on Jennifer for no reason. They compare her to Madonna. For  the record Madonna is not a great singer, she just happens to have a cult  following just like Cher. The only talent they have is shock value. Yes  some say Jennifer jumped on the &quot;Latin Explosion&quot; bandwagon  spewing her puerto rican heritage,when in fact she cant even speak  spanish-this she even shamefully admitted. But I do give her the props she  deserves for making it in acting and now with singing. And don't blame her  for the success of her album, people are buying it, so they must have liked  what they heard. I support anyone who came from a poor neighborhood and  made something of themselves. Much respect Jen! Oh another thing:whats with  the constant references to Sean Combs, people want to know if some of the  songs were about him. Yeah he produced a song on the album but all the  songs were written before these two became an item.
0790740443|1.0|I watched this film with some friends a few weeks ago, and it was memorable due to the fact that it was the first time we all had ever agreed  on anything. We all agreed that we had just witnessed a truely terrible  film. The laughable plot is cliched from beginning to end - we were able to  guess major 'twists' throughout the film without much difficulty. There is  no depth to the story - the makers seems to have picked up the book 'How to  make an action movie' and made a film (complete with villian with twitchy  moustache) that followed it to the letter. The film was just so bad in the  end it left us whincing. If you don't believe me, then buy the film and  you'll see what I mean. Kurt Russell has no shame.
0064407667|5.0|I just got my copy of this book and already it's finished! Such a great story. Lemony Snicket rocks!<br />The interesting thing I found about this  book was that it was hard not to imagine it taking place in the past, yet  modern conveniences would pop-up unexpectedly to remind me it was more of a  present setting.<br />A part of me wishes these were written for us older  folks. The constant explanation of what things mean is so great for kids,  but not as fun for us adults.<br />However, I love them and the fact that he  refuses to put in the gushy happy ending that everyone expects. It makes it  more realistic.<br />That's the thing I love the most about these books, the  author has created a full world complete with his &quot;author&quot; Lemony  Snicket. So fun and interesting. <br />It's also nice to see a girl who does  something with her mind.
B00000DQSV|4.0|I know of no other band that changes its style and sound so much from one album to the next and still appear as accomplished and as authoritative on  every release.  Duran Duran somehow manage it.  Although their career does  have its odd shocker, by and large the band seems unable to put a foot  wrong.<br />On &quot;Notorious&quot;, they progressed from the maturing but  still dancey and poppy &quot;7 and the Ragged Tiger&quot; to a very good  funk/pop creation.  Following the loss of the Taylors, Andy and Roger, the  remaining three dived headlong into Chic-esque funk (the probable reason  for &quot;rocker&quot; Andy's departure).<br />On the whole, the album takes a  few listens.  The instant catchiness of &quot;No-No-Notorious&quot; is  offset by the harder to grasp &quot;Skin Trade&quot; and &quot;American  Science&quot;.  Once we have reached a state of acceptance with the album,  we are rewarded with a smooth, slick and rather menacing collection that  darkened the bright, breezy pre '86 Duran.<br />We all know the title track  that hits somewhere between an old style misfit classic and downright  irritating.  I rate it highly. The song goes very well with the third  single from the album, &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot;.  Again catchy and  again a little irritating, this would have people dancing to it if they  ever heard it.  These two are the funky ones.<br />We then move back to  perhaps ordinary pop.  &quot;Hold Me&quot; is one of those should have been  absolutley brilliant songs that comes out a little vacuous.  I love it, but  wish it had a bit more Ummmph!  &quot;So Misled&quot; is a kind of soaring  fast balled.  It neither gets the toe tapping nor gets the heart strings  pulling.  Its just sort of nice.  It kind of happens without being noticed.   To finish the pop, we have &quot;Proposition&quot;.  This is not nice.  It  is empty, causes no feelings other than a blandness and tries its hardest  ruin an almost perfect album to date.  Lets hear no more about it.<br />On to  the slower tunes and what feast awaits.  &quot;American Science&quot; and  &quot;A Matter of Feeling&quot; are really quite beautiful.  Either or both  fit comfortably with any of Duran's power ballads and either could have  made a stab of it as a single.  Instead, they chose to release &quot;Skin  Trade&quot;.  Oh Dear.  Try as I might, I cannot like this song.  I dont  like the vocals or the music.  The video they brought out with it was  almost as bad and did not help in my thoughts on the song.  I really cannot  see what all the fuss is about.  In my opinion, truly one of Duran's wortst  ever efforts<br />And now the coup de grace.  Duran like to put out the odd  dark tune and have done so throughout their careers, but nothing prepared  anyone for the sheer raw menace of &quot;Vertigo (Do The Demolition)&quot;  or &quot;Winter Marches On&quot;.   Winter is a very morbid sounding tune  (&quot;Like a death march.&quot; my Gran said.)  The title says it all  really.  The song gets you down.  Even when you try to sing to it, you are  defeated by its slowness.  A very good and very atmospheric song.  It  should not be listened to when you are feeling miserable.  It will make you  think there is nothing bright left in the World.<br />And finally  &quot;Vertigo&quot;.  This immense and frightening composition strikes me  as a song that may well be about the end of Roger Taylor.  Its relentless  keyboards and powerful beats are accompanied by words of drug addiction,  fear of fame and of destroying the fabric of something.  Coincidence?  I'm  not sure, but it is a damning song that goes someway to explaining the  terrible feelings some people must have put themselves through.<br />So all  told we have a strange mixture of songs on this one.  A quickie and a slowy  stop the album from getting 5 stars, but that should not be looked at too  much.  This album is packed with gems both beautiful and dark.  It is quite  a ride and it still sounds as important and as fresh today as it did then.
6305069611|5.0|Science fiction movies, like the literature with which they have an uneasy relationship, have long suffered from stereotyping and cookie-cutter  plotting.  In the 50s, it was monster movies; in the 70s, it was \\"Star  Wars\\", \\"ET\\" and \\"Close Encounters\\"; warm and fuzzy  with lots of action.  More recently SF films such as \\"Demolition  Man\\" have become vehicles for action stars.  Real stories,  particularly thoughtful adaptations of great SF books, are extremely  rare.<br /><br />This film, based on a superb novel by Walter Tevis (who also wrote  \\"The Hustler\\" and its sequel, \\"The Color of Money\\"), is  the story of an alien who comes to Earth to obtain water for his planet.  By introducing superior technology he amasses a large fortune and develops  a huge international corporation --- but develops addictions to both TV and  alcohol and struggles with the isolation of living on a world where he  doesn't belong.<br /><br />Roeg's film is by no means as straightforward a narrative  as the novel it's based on, and is definitely not for all viewers.  There  are virtually no special effects, keeping the focus where it belongs --- on  the characters and story.  However, some may be put off by the film's  abstract approach; it does require several viewings to appreciate some of  the subtle details Roeg packs into it.<br /><br />Like \\"Blade Runner\\",  this is a dense movie, although it doesn't have the visual flash.  David  Bowie's performance is astonishing (for the record, I was not a Bowie fan  when I first saw this movie).  Rip Torn, Buck Henry, and Candy Clark are  equally superb in supporting roles.<br /><br />If you're looking for dazzling visual  effects and space battles, you won't find them here.  However, if you enjoy  great acting and a unique approach to storytelling, you'll find this movie  easily rewards multiple viewings --- and gets better each time you watch  it.
B000002L9S|4.0|Madonna needed a follow-up to the explosive Like A Virgin and here she  does one better scoring a string of 3 #1s. The highlight of this album is  the country-tinged Live To Tell from the movie Vision Quest. Madonna sings  with an unusual sadness and take a look at the video where Madonna dressed  out of the glitz and glamor. Other notable tunes include the perennial  favorite Papa Don't Preach where Madonna claimed she had grown up and the  very dancy Open Your Heart, with her groundbreaking conical bra. 2 other  excellent tracks are Where's The Party? and White Heat.
B00004T9UF|3.0|this cd is funny but offensive. some strange words too. i sort of like think theres like better dudes to listen to. eminem is like all right you  know but like hes not the only person in the world. on the radio they got  cool music too. this cd is all right but like its like aaaaaaaaaaahh kill  me pop pop this that blah blah blah blah its like so blah blah  ahhhhhhhhaaahhh it gives you a head ache
B000002N3J|5.0|Like the Immaculate Collection, this is a greatest hits package but this  time round, Madonna reveals her softer side. So much controvesy has swirled  around her career, no attention ever gets paid to her music was what she  said. And truly indeed. You will find some of the most compeeling Madonna  ballads here like the classics Crazy For You, Live To Tell, Rain, Oh Father  and the #1 smash Take A Bow! But it is really the remake of Marvin Gaye  song I Want You, remade with UK trip-hop outfit Massive Attack. Madonna  injects sensuality into the classic and brings out a whole new  interpretation. The David Forster collaboration &quot;One More Chance&quot;  is a no frills acoustic effort with guitar, something totally unheard of in  early Madonna!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|This is a movie you are compelled to watch. It pulls you in with its non-stop action and pulls you out of the ordinariness of today's world. It  is excellent storytelling, and it has 'dynamite' special effects, more cold  salt water than any other movie, good 'representative' characters for the  morality tale it is, and a thoughtful query of 'what' is leadership for the  main character. The director pays homage to the British by using the race  for subsequent capture of a later enigma machine as the catalyst of events  in this story. (If you read the credits, the list of those various,  predominantly British, crews who made enigma captures are given tribute.  Note that in truth this honored company includes 1 American group.) (Credit  is also given to the British admiral involved with the original enigma  capture who was a technical advisor for the movie.)This is a story that  grabs you. It reminds you 'how awful is war' (and how unrelenting to be  caught up in one), and that in impossible situations the good in  individuals is distilled and revealed. The more obvious struggle of Matthew  McC's character [is it better to be everybody's best pal and personal  advocate or to be able to make some tough, touchy decisions that could  cause disaster for some if not all?] Eric Palladino's (&quot;Doctor  Dave&quot; from ER) character is used to great effect in pushing the  buttons that spotlight this. Jack Noseworthy illuminates his small, pivotal  role. Jon Bon Jovi makes you want to see more of what he can do. Dave  Power's tangible despair over being 'too big' for what he MUST get done  raps you right in the heart. And the German captain-- did he not exemplify  the determination to protect and preserve what was important to HIS  country?If you missed any of this by being too caught up in the nonstop  action, BUY THIS DVD AND WATCH IT AGAIN. These boys did a superb job of  giving honor to the sailors of that 'Greatest Generation', for whom combat  was still one on one.Thedvd has some terrific additional features that you  will be glad to have. More than that, buy this for the totally engrossing,  heartstopping rollercoaster of a good 'old fashioned' war story.
B000002MUW|4.0|Well way before Music, Madonna had already gotten into the groove and so  much more. Laced with tight beats and melodius rhythms, Madonna decided to  put out a rather black-sounding hip hop album. Featuring great songs like  I'd Rather Be Your Lover featuring an uncredited 2Pac, Inside Of Me-an ode  to Madonna's late mum, the unpologetic Human Nature with an incredible  video and the ultimately sensuous Sanctuary. Of course, who can forget the  great hits Secret and Madonna's biggest #1 hit Take A Bow. An odd inclusion  was the electronica title track co-written by Bjork. Odd but cool, that was  elctronica b4 the world knew what it was. Excellent joyous album!
630445841X|5.0|This movie is in my top 10 list of all-time favorites!  It is amovie for men and women (this is hard to find), but it works for both parties! I have seen it so many times I can't count and it still makes me cry!  The acting is superb! The story line is heartwarming, witty, and moving!  The scenery is beautiful!  If you haven't seen this movie - rent it or buy it!  You will not be dissappointed and I can almost guarantee you even the hardest hearts will break a little!
B000002L6P|5.0|Madonna's conquest of the world took off from here and from then on the  world found a new and resillient entertainer for years to come. Featuring  what was one of most famous hits Like A Virgin which wasnt even written  with her in mind but she sent it rite to #1. Most of the other songs  represent the early 80s Madonna whomwas having all the fun. Nice inclusions  are Angel, Dress You Up and the Marilyn Monroe-creation Material Girl. A  recommendation is the Madonna-penned Shoo-Bee-Doo.
0767903854|4.0|How delightful to make the trip we made in 1975-76 again with the  improvements of the last 25 years!  It was wonderful to reminisce about our  trip and to read someone who loved the country as much as we did.  I also  learned a lot more about the country than I knew before and it has endeared  it to me even more.  What time does the next Qantas flight leave?  Thank  you, Mr. Bill Bryson.  Thank you!
B000002LGQ|5.0|The potential of this album was never fully explored because it was  overshadowed very much by the controversies that surround the title track's  video. But cast away the imageries, Like A Prayer ranks as one of the best  Madonna albums. The gospel-infused title track rocked the house down.  Express Yourself dares you to do so and never take what's second best.  Cherish shows the sun-sweetness of Madonna with such girl-woman charm. Keep  It Together implores you to live harmoniously with one's most important  link - the family. And the highlight must be Oh Father which stirs up so  much emotions, a perfect ode by Madonna. There's the oh-so-sensuous duet  with Prince and so many more. Indeed a gem!
B00004T8RK|3.0|While Pearl Jam continues to be in a category all their own and far  superior to today's &quot;popular&quot; artists, this album falls short of  the standard set by previous works.  With each listen, this album is  growing on me, but it doesn't come close the enraptured awe inspired by  Yield or Vs.  This album seems to bounce around aimlessly, lacking a smooth  flow from rockers to melodies and back.  Hopefully this album has allowed  the band to work on some &quot;B&quot; songs they've been needing to get  out of their system so they can put together another 5-star effort next...   Unless you're a rabid &quot;Pearl Jam can do no wrong&quot; fan or  collecting their complete discography, I don't think you'll miss anything  by not buying this album.
0140282033|4.0|Chocolat is an adept, smoothly written novel about a stranger who blows into a small French town and wakes different passions and hatreds through  the tempting treats she creates.  Some suspect she is a witch, set to  corrupt the town during their season of Lenten promises and fasting; or is  she simply a gourmet who knows how to bring her customers exquisite  plesaure?  Chocolat is very well written with prose that flows along  effortlessly, carrying the reader into the lives of the small French town  and its inhabitants.  It couples a sense of sophistication with an  appreciation for rural life, wrapping it with a certain magical aura, which  nicely echoing how the main character feels in the town.  Soon to be a  movie, with Julia Ormand, Judi Dench and Johnny Depp...
B00000ILDE|3.0|Simply said, this was a great film without the extra 17 mins. They PAY film editors because they are experts in creating flow and consistency in a  film. When a director comes back and adds 17 mins to create a special  edition, with only a few exceptions, he creates a work which is FAR  INFERIOR to the original. The 17 extra mins added to this film are aboslute  film killers. They destroy the flow of the film in general, and a few  sceens with only one or two simple lines added turn a dramatic PUNCH onto a  wet noodle. I was incredibly disappointed, where can I get a DVD version of  the ORIGINAL theactrical release?
B00004TWZF|5.0|I can never forget when I saw this movie in Tokyo with 70mm print. It was beautiful, magnificent and very personal film about sea. It was  unsucssesfull in box office, thou, the audience didn't forget the beauty of  this film. When the movie was re-released as &quot;Le Grand Blue&quot; in  director's cut with French Language (Original language is English, by the  way)in 1992,  it became the instant classic in Japan.   Now thanks to the  Columbia Trister, the American audience can experience this  unseen  classic. The quality of the picture and sound are much better than any  other version, including expencive Japanese Laser Disc. It does remind my  first experience of seeing this one of the best movie in 80's.  If you love  movie of Luc Besson, this is must-buy DVD.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This cd is perfect, it was the first cd I bought from Joe Satriani and not  even because I liked his music style, it was the case that made me buy  it... it had an image of a comic character on it... forgive me, I was  young.<br />I'll never regret it, the songs are filled to the brim with  passion and soul. For instance the songs &quot;Hill of the Skull&quot; and  &quot;Circles&quot; are made by the hands of a genius.<br />Because they  represent a pure emotion converted to music, one song is heavy and  depressing another one is mesmerising and strange, the cd becomes very  personal.
6303257844|1.0|I absolutly dispise this movie!  I saw it when I was like 9 years old. I remember the whole time sitting there goin &quot;GOD, this movie ...&quot;  The action was very poor I thought.  I hated all the  characters &amp; there was no plot.  The plot was a guy was blowing things  up!  Thats a stupid plot.  The only good performance was Jeff Daniels &amp;  Dennis Hopper i Think.  But there were no good relationships between the  charachers.  I know a lota people really liked this movie, but trust me,  there are action movies 20 times better than this!
0140434089|4.0|The Moonstone and The Woman in White are considered to be the best works of Wilkie Collins.  Maybe so, but the novels differ tremendously.  The  Woman in White is a page-turning thriller of frantic proportions ... to the  extent it almost feels like a slapstick comedy.  The Moonstone is a  straightforward crime story, complete with well-developed characters and  interesting dialogue, culminating in solving the mystery: who stole the  Moonstone (..a collosal diamond)?.  The story is never dull, but compared  to The Woman in White it is hopelessly conventional. <br />So I recommend The  Woman in White over The Moonstone for most people.  However if you prefer a  more leisurely, conventional (ie, less complicated) read then The Moonstone  might be more enjoyable for you.  You really can't go wrong either way.
B000021Y77|5.0|i bought this just based on other reviews here and i'm really glad i did. this is definately one of the most original movies i've seen. what really  shines in this movie is not the plot, but the way the plot is told. truly  amazing. this shows how things can be so much different with so little  happening. last but not least, it's visually stunning: camera moves are  great, fastly cut on a techno track that adapts to the action, showing  sadness or hope. to sum it up, this is kind of a music clip that evolved to  a movie.
B00002E23H|4.0|So many movies today, are computer enhanced, that its almost impossible to get engrossed in a movie bacause nothing is believable anymore.  This movie  is not like that at all.  Sure there are times when you know something  really looks fake and just isn't possible, but the suspense, drama, action  and emotion, keep you from noticing it as much.<br />I watched this movie,just  because there wasn't anything else to watch, and boy was I suprised.  Now  every time it comes on I just have to watch it again.  I've already seen it  four times and each time I see something I missed the time before.  The  actors/actresses are amazing.  They truly look as if they fear for their  lives.  Thomas Jane as Carter Blake turns out to be a sexy superhero, who  just kind of falls into that roll by accident and runs with it.  This movie  should be enjoyable to anyone who loves suspense, action, and drama.  Just  enjoy it for entertainment, and don't over analize everything that can't be  for real, or you will miss out on a fun, entertaining movie.
6305892946|3.0|The plot was good in Scream 3, and the movie is less corny then Scream and Scream 2, but the movie was still just OK.  It wasn't scary enough for a horror movie.  It has plenty of gore and killings, but that didn't make the  movie scary.  After the first time you watch Scream 3 the movie gets boring  and even less scary once you know who the killer is.  Most of the  characters are stupid.  The movie has some comedy, such as one line form  Sidney (&quot;You want me m***********!) and two lines from Tyson (&quot;Oh  s***!&quot;, and &quot;Holy m**********!&quot;), which are funny at the  time they are said.  The ending to the movie ................. is sad ,  but I'm not going to say why because that would spoil the movie.  The gore  is cool.  I'd say you might not like this movie that much if you are over  the age of 25.
B000001Y42|3.0|Limp Bizkit debuted with Three Dollar Bill Y'all in 1997. The music is uneven in Dollar Bill Y'all. When I bought it I was expecting it to be like  Signigficant Other (much better than Dollar Bill Y'all), you know some hip  hop here some heavy metal there. But I understand that this is their debut  album, but that's no excuse to put just heavy metal on every track. The  music is too loud than their second release. Significant Other is alot more  toned down than this garbage material. Fred Durst sings like a pyscho in  this album. You really can't understand what he is saying. The gutarists  and DJ Lethal are wasted on this album, you can't hardly hear them over  Durst's crazy singing. This album is okay, but not a classic.
0800187792|4.0|A wonderful film that exemplifies how a relationship between a father and daughter should be whether it be in a single parent home or two parent  home.  Not only will you laugh at the innocence of a child, but you will  also cry at how real the emotions are.  A supurb film for adults and  children.
0345350499|2.0|This was the worst book I've ever read! It got boring not even half way  through! Everything's basically the same thing--love,betrayal, yada yada  yada... get to the point! Nothing really exciting ever happens, it's just  the same old thing. And when something does happen, it's not like a  &quot;BOOM&quot;, but more like a &quot;plop&quot;. It's all just a bunch  of poop. I felt that I wasted my time reading this.
0064407667|5.0|I'm 10 and I think this book is the greatest thing I read ever, including Charlotte's web and the new Harry Potter.  I can't believe some people gave  this book one star.  I would give it ten stars if I could!
0800105141|5.0|I have perused Gandhi's autobiography and, if we give him credit, he *was* an unusually good little boy and young man. Pretty ignorant otherwise of his life story, I came to the movie as much of a \\"blank slate\\" as could be wished. The development of Gandhi's character *is* evident - his initial protests based more on principle and faith in the British legal system than heartfelt compassion. The breach between Indian Muslims and Indian Hindus is also faithfully - if briefly - delineated. The film makes clear, too, that while many Britons were decent and humane, many others were mindless automata blindly serving a system whose humanity they refused to question. I was reminded, particularly after the ghastly massacre of over a thousand nonviolently protesting Indians by the British, of the Holocaust. Would Britons have complied had a similar program been initiated in India? One wonders.<br /><br />The storyline proper starts with Gandhi the lawyer being called \\"Sammy\\" and thrown off a train on his arrival in South Africa. From this point, Gandhi decides to campaign against what he considers to be manifest injustice, drawn more and more into the limelight of international notoriety. Gandhi understood that, at root, the British system was *intended* to be just and that, with the aid of the international press, he could successfully wage a campaign of aggressive passive resistance.<br /><br />I found it highly amusing as the film went on this phrase started to become well-worn: \\"Arrest everyone, but NOT Gandhi!\\"<br /><br />Great film.
B000002AGN|5.0|All praise listed is deserved.  A brilliant effort that it is impossible  to grow tired of. The question is: Where can we find more of this stuff?   The next best DBQ is the live album &quot;Jazz at Oberlin&quot; which has a  tune called &quot;Perdido&quot; that could bump all but two songs off of  &quot;Time Out&quot;. Perdido is that good. Buy both CDs now. Maybe buy  three sets, one for work, one for the car and one for home. Brilliant,  brilliant, brilliant.
B000007WNN|5.0|this is the best album ever. period. rick rubin's production fits like a  glove. this is the album ac/dc has been trying to make since back in black,  throwing in some doors influence with punk/goth attitude. &quot; wild  flower&quot; is rock and roll in a nutshell. &quot; love removal  machine&quot; and &quot;peace dog&quot; are cover band staples, for good  reason. This album was a favorite of many artists from Motley Crue to the  Beastie Boys when it came out. Rock &amp; Roll with brains ala the Cult.

6303014100|5.0|(Review updated July 25, 2015)<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" is one of my all-time favorite war films!  It re-creates the Civil War's battle of Gettysburg with superb acting, an excellent screenplay, a hauntingly beautiful musical score, and some of the  most authentic and stirring battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel \\"The  Killer Angels,\\"  this film follows the principal characters, and  chronicles the main events, which occurred at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from  July 1-3, 1863.  The events depicted in the film are notable for their  historical accuracy.  Some of the most exciting battle scenes in the film  are General John Buford's engagement with the Confederates on  the high  ground north of Gettysburg on July 1; the defense of Little Round Top by  Colonel Joshua Chamberlain's 20th Maine on the following day; and, of  course, Pickett's Charge on the final day of the  battle.  The battle  scenes contain plenty of smoke and fire, but are done  without copious displays of blood and gore.<br /><br />The acting in \\"Gettysburg\\" is  excellent throughout.  Jeff Daniels , who portrays Chamberlain, probably  gives the best overall performance, but Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Tom  Berenger (Gen. James Longstreet), Sam Eliot (Buford,) Stephen Lang (Gen.  George Pickett), and Kevin Conway (Sergeant Kilrain) also give performances  which are outstanding for their realism, grittiness, and historical  accuracy.  Special mention must also go to the late Richard Jordan, whose  portrayal of Confederate General Louis Armistead was consistently eloquent  and moving.<br /><br />I originally purchased \\"Gettysburg\\" in 1999, when it was available only in VHS format. Over the past fifteen years, it has also been released in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. The Blu-ray version is the first to contain the entire film, uninterrupted,  on one disc. It corrects most of the technical flaws found in previous releases, making it, of course, technically superior to versions found on VHS and DVD. The high definition video and audio found on the Blu-ray version of \\"Gettysburg\\" are not what I would call reference quality, but are nevertheless excellent.<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" is a long movie; it runs to just over  four hours.  Still, it held me spellbound from start to finish, mainly due  to its dramatic intensity and realistic battle scenes.  I highly recommend  this outstanding film not only to Civil War enthusiasts, but for anyone who  loves a sumptuously produced and well acted war film.f course, technically superior to versions found on VHS and DVD.

B00000ILDF|1.0|...When I saw the previews for this in Dec 1991, I was VERYhappy to see a new Alien movie coming out.  When I went to a drive in to see it, I had bad sound, so I figured I should give it another chance. HOW WRONG I WAS. I went to a theater and saw it again. It just plain sucks.<br />There are NO weapons. None. Oh wait... fire. Oh yeah. That rocks.  Very little action. The most action I can remember seeing is when the dog alien is chasing the prisoners around. Yay. You only see the alien very few times throughout the movie.<br />I have seen worse than this, but this is pretty bad... Resurrection is just ok, and the gore is to the extreme, so for that I don't really think it should be condemned.<br />Still, I have few good things to say about this one. If you are a die-hard Aliens fan, and must see/own them all, then by all means, get this one.<br />If your not, your money is better spent elsewhere. I can live with the fact that there is only one alien (same as in the first movie), and that there is very little action. But NO weapons? What's up with that? I heard a rumor that before Sigourney started shooting this, she said she would only do it if there were no weapons. True or not, I don't know.<br />I could go on for hours, but I think I've said my part. This is definitely the least watched.<br />Bad directing, horrible waste of a script, bad acting, no decent plot, and NO WEAPONS (did I mention that?).<br />Pros: There is an alien in it. Cons: Far too numerous to list.<br />If you disagree, then watch the movie.  END
B000002UA0|5.0|Ok, so I fudged my Saucerful of Secrets review. I cheerfully withdraw the statement,&quot;this is the best album they've ever done..blah, blah,  blah.&quot; And insert it here.  I DID have the album at the time however,  I failed to see the utter genius it contained.<br />These amazing songs range  from whimsically elegant to pure acid-fueled, psychedelic freak-out.  This  album is (in MY eyes) perfect in every way.  No filler or even sub-par  songs (Take up thy Stethoscope and Walk comes close, but the freak-out at  the end saves it.) Also, try listening to the album through head-phones,  the stero-panning at the end of Interstellar Overdrive is mind-numbingly  delightful.<br />So, will you suffer eternal damnation if you don't buy this  album?  No, I should think not.  You will however, put money in Syd  Barrett's pocket and show him how many people truly enjoy his wonderful  music.  And i can't think of a better reason for buying it than that.  Can  you?
B000001ESF|4.0|I have never liked Prog Rock, not even while it was popular.  But I liked Rush.  That's a testament to how good they are.<br />As you already know if  you like Rush, the best song on this album is the title track.  The theme  isn't particularly sophisticated (The Individual vs. the Corrupt and  Oppressive Group), and I can understand how some might find it sophomoric.   <br />But the songwriting and musicianship more than make up for that.  At a  time when other Prog Rockers were stuck in endless, twiddling,  self-indulgent solos, Rush were making their music hang together.  They  used their individual virtuosity to ornament the music, rather than trying  to construct their works around solos.<br />Whatever complaints you have with  Prog Rock, or Seventies rock in general, don't hold them against Rush.   These guys are solid and worth a listen!
B00001OH7Y|3.0|I don't know why I don't like this one as much as most people do.  When I  think about all the songs on it, there are none that I really don't like.   Yet, I don't like to listen to it much.  With the exception of Ashes to  Ashes and Teenage Wildlife, there are no real standouts on this album.   Actually, scary Monsters is pretty good too.
B00000JG41|4.0|I took the leap of faith to Mr Bungle from my love of Faith No More (like  so many others) and my first response was to jump straight back. But my  habit of trying to find music that no one else will listen to or has ever  heard (well, not my friends anyway) kept the CD in my collection. Then when  the mood was right nothing quite hit the spot like `The Air Conditioned  Nightmare' which became a regular visitor to my CD player. Something about  the unpredictable but easy-listening funk styled wackiness was just candy  to my ears and I soon found myself flicking through the tracks till the Mr  Bungle bug bit me.<br />I'm hardly a source of major knowledge when it comes  to experimental/funk music but I know its a road I'm slowly going down at  increasing speed  - I find the weird and eccentric Mr Bungle such a joy to  listen to and it all sounds so fresh. Jumping from genre to genre Mr Bungle  explores and breaks all the rules that define and categorise music - that's  the way it should be. If I had to pick a favourite tune from this CD now it  would have to be `Golem II: The Bionic Vapour Boy', the concept of the song  is fantastic. Creativity with no boundaries, no rules and no commercial  restrictions.<br />From what I've listened to and know similar to this I would  recommend the Incubus albums `SCIENCE' and `Enjoy Incubus' as a `run up'  before making the jump straight to Mr Bungle. Oh, and Faith No More of  course.<br />Talk about sticking two fingers up to commercial music, I love  this album! Now I need to brave the earlier two releases...

B000002NG7|5.0|My attention was first brought to Faith No More on the release of this  album and much due to a friends persistence that I listen to it. It was the  album which begun my whole fascination with the world of alternative  music.<br />Standing the test of time ?Stripsearch', ?Last Cup of Sorrow',  ?Mouth to Mouth', ?Ashes to Ashes' and ?She Loves Me Not' are the tracks I  keep coming back to. The album is typically diverse, ?Collision' opening as  a heavy speed-based affair followed by ?Stripsearch' which immediately  contradicts the mood (FNM fashion) and mellows out, some great keyboard  work too. ?Ashes to Ashes' is an inspiring piece of work , an uplifting and  very powerful chorus which send shivers down my spine. It took time for  ?Pristina' to grab my attention but the one and only track which still  fails to jump out at me is ?Home Sick Home', but I'm still trying to  convince myself it's because I haven't given it a chance. I guess I just  can't accept the fact there might be a Faith No More song I don't  like...<br />The fresh funk that was the core of Faith No More still shines  through(ie: ?Mouth to Mouth')  but tucked in between darker moodier ?Angel  Dust' styled tracks. Taking the best of Faith No More, the dark side (Angel  Dust) and the light side (Real Thing), ?Album of the Year' is the perfect  summary of a  creative and unique band whose music knew no limits.
1573221562|4.0|After being entirely pleased with TIPPING THE VELVET, I was eager to read  Affinity. Waters widened my scope of appreciation for stories like Affinity  because although it evoked immense sadness and haunting disappointment, I  found myself enamored with, and awed by its delivery. I was compelled to  know more about its heart, and read into the late, late hours of night,  which hasn't happened in a long time.

Sedaris has a unique ability to poke fun at  himself and his family, and it was fun going on this ride with him.  This  was a selection in a book club I'm in, and all of us got a kick out of it.   Favorite chapter - The Rooster - totally killing me!
B000002A3T|5.0|This is a must for any music fan, it doesn't get any better then this. I  think it is completely incredible.  Most reviewers didn't like it, but I  think it's one of the top ten greatest albums of all time.  It is so  indulging, the music draws you in, it is so, hard to explain, but it is so  incredible to me.  Songs like Marooned and High Hopes are so incredible, as  well as Keep Talking, the whole album is amazing, David Gilmour is an  absolutely incredible musician, who can play the guitar so beautifully,  it's incredible.  I personally think that this is a must for any music fan  who likes rock even in the slightest, this album is a landmark.  What more  can I say, get it as soon as you can
1878424432|5.0|I've read my share of self help/new age/pop psychology/spiritual tradition  books over the years - but this really stood out.  The magic is in the  simplicity of the laws of honest living that he suggests.  I'm going to  reread this I'm sure many times in the future.  Now the trick is to  encorporate these basic, timeless rules for living into a personal  practice.  That'll be easy, right?
B00000J7S8|5.0|I had wrongly dismissed Diana as 'another one of those' jazz singers  looking to carve out a Michael Franks-type niche in the CD market until I  had the great pleasure of seeing and hearing her perform 'A Case of You' on  the TNT Joni Mitchell Tribute.  I ran out and bought this CD soon after and  never looked back.<br />There's not a lot I can say to improve upon the  eloquent reviews preceding my own.  I love Mandel's arrangements, and  Diana's phrasing hooks my ear.  Any jazz fan, or romantic for that matter,  will want this CD in his/her collection.  It has that breadth of  appeal.<br />This is no flavor of the moment. Krall will be around for awhile.   I do hope she gets more brave in her choice of interpretations, but with  her youth and beauty, she has plenty of time to slowly unveil her gifts.
B000006OAM|5.0|I bought Natalie Merchant's Ophelia as soon as it came out, and I'm glad I  did.  While many people are right and this CD is not exactly  radio-friendly, it is extremely emotional and memorable.  I can't tell you  how many times I have cought myself humming the ending instrumentals from  the title track &quot;Ophelia&quot;.  In my opinion, the album only has 2  flaws:  1. It doesn't include the lyrics, and 2. I'm not to crazy over the  Tibetan part of &quot;Effigy&quot;.  However, no matter what you taste in  music is, I highly recommend you buying this album.  You won't be  disappointed!
B00004TH6O|5.0|I thought I was going to have to wait untill Radiohead's album came out to  be able to say I found a solid album.  This one hasn't left my deck for 10  days now.  I don't usually find consistently good albums, but this is one.   Arcwelder meets Bowie while hanging out with Bush, maybe?
B000002OOY|5.0|Throughout the past thirty years of film, there has always been 1  constant, one thing that everyone can agree upon, John Williams is the  greatest musical composer film has ever heard. His light hearted melodies  and fast paced action sequences allow the audience to be enthralled in the  movie they are viewing. There are no musical themes in history that are as  memorable and easily recognizable as Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Indiana  Jones, and Jaws. His ingenuity has changed history, and also the way in  which we enjoy movies. The score to Jurassic Park is a masterpiece that no  John Williams fan should be without.
B00004T9UF|5.0|... HANDS DOWN EMINEM IS THE BEST LYRICIST RAPPING  TODAY.  THIS ALBUM IS UNBELIEVABLE AND WILL BE TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS TO  COME!  THERE ARE ONLY TWO SONGS ON THIS ALBUM THAT I FELT COULD HAVE BEEN  LEFT OFF AND THOSE ARE &quot;REMEMBER ME&quot; AND &quot;AMITYVILLE.&quot;   SONGS LIKE &quot;STAN&quot; AND &quot;THE WAY I AM&quot; ARE TWO OF THE  GREATEST RAP SONGS OF ALL TIME.  &quot;KILL YOU, CRIMINAL, AND KIM&quot;  ARE GREAT SONGS ALSO BECAUSE HE IS TELLING US HOW HE FEELS AND HE DOESN'T  HOLD ANYTHING BACK.  &quot;WHO KNEW, THE REAL SLIM SHADY, I'M BACK, AND  DRUG BALLAD&quot; ARE THE MORE UPBEAT SONGS AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD IN THERE  OWN RIGHT.  ALSO, &quot;B PLEASE 2&quot; IS A GREAT COLLABORATION!  AGAIN  THIS IS AN AMAZING CD AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET YOU ARE MISSING OUT!
B00003XB8K|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this cd since I had no previous  Enigma cds, but after listening to it all the way through I was taken back.  Each song brings about a different emotion that get under the skin leaving  you wanting more.  The sensual and breathtaking voice of Olive creates a  mood like no other. With the combination of world-music influence along  with the unique beat patterns, I was left saying &quot;Why didn't I hear  about them before?!&quot; This cd  has a bit of trance, trip-hop, and New  Age comfortably molded together creating a sound that will tweak your  senses.  I love it!! This is definitely one of my favorite cds.
B00000IGGA|5.0|My first exposure to Tom was Swordfishtrombone... from that day on, I  never look back.. I got hold of everything he ever released.. what can I  say. I'm a die-hard Tom Waits fan. However, the irony of his music is that  while it often sound and feel bleak, it never fail to wake me up to the  reality of the world we are living in. House where nobody lives.. haunting  but real.. I cannot say that there is a bad Tom Waits album and till now  cannot decide which is his best.<br />Spend some time with him.. he is now top  in my listening order ..ahead of Dylan, Browne, Springsteen, Hiatt and many  many more.<br />Someone use to say.. you have 1500+ CDs.. how come we only get  to hear a few.. and the few that I always go back to is Waits..
B000002HIK|5.0|This is no album to be direspected in the manner in which some reviwers  have put down. Can't you see what a work of art this album is? Maybe you  should study classical music, then you'll see the genius that lies in this  album. <br />In my opinion, RDJ album is very good, but does not compare in  greatness to this one. 'I Care....' may be hard to digest (for those  looking for simple latter-aphex music), but it is this one that captures  the essence of what experimental music is all about.<br />This album does not  contain his drill n bass sound (what most people here are after), but it  does have some of the best sound ever created electronically. Proof? Listen  to &quot;alberto balsalm&quot;, 'MooKid&quot;, &quot;The Waxenpith&quot;,  etc. Every track here is perfect, in that it captures entirely different  moods than their counterparts. They are all brilliantly structured. It's no  wonder Richard D. James is being hailed one of the greatest composers of  our century.<br />I am not saying this is the best 'Aphex' release. I just  think it is a completely 'well-done' album. It is definitely one of my  favourites of his. I think some reviewers are saying this album is  utter-nonsense, when they really mean to say &quot;It's good, but it's not  for me&quot;. It is impossible to call something of this genius 'a bad  record'. I just don't see it!
0553573403|5.0|Skip this review, stop reading right now.  Scroll to the top of the page  and press the order button now.<br />Still here? Okay, I understand the need  for a little explanation.  I love fantasy.  I read Tolkien's Lord of the  Rings soon after the American Version was published (don't start counting  years on me) and I've read a greet deal of the genre since.  I enjoy the  epics (Sword of Truth, Wheel of Time) and the classics but I know that they  seldom are the same.  This one is an epic that will, without a doubt, be a  classic.<br />Okay, why?  Reason 1: Characters.  Characters so real that they  make your friends and neighbors seem like pale shadows of reality.  But  these are not the trite characters acting out predictable paths so often  seen in fantasy.  Martin knows that heroes are not always sterling  exemplars and villains are not always totally evil.  In this series I  guarantee you will find yourself, at one point, cheering on a member of the  &quot;evil&quot; family in his struggles.  When is the last time you did  that?<br />Reason 2:  This is as close to reality as a fantasy can get. In  real life heroes sometimes die or commit murder in a rage.  Villains  sometimes win.  Nothing is guaranteed and if a happy ending emerges at the  end it will not be the happy ending you imagined.  One reviewer criticized  the book because the plot didn't go in the direction he expected.  I praise  the book for the same reason.<br />Reason 3: Writing.  Johnny B Good played so  well that it was like he &quot;was ringing a bell.&quot;  Martin writes  that well.  It all seems to flow out of him.  Most interestingly, he chose  to write the entire series in the first person - but that person changes  each chapter.  Normally I would find that disruptive.  But in the hands of  a master it adds a depth that has to be read to believe.  Most importantly,  it assures an identification with characters whose future is not assured.  You will read chapters with bated breath as a hero describes, in first  person, his or her life or death struggles.  In the next chapter you will  read the account of one of those who attends the hero's funeral.<br />Okay,  enough.  Order the book already.o describes, in first  person, his or her life or death struggles.

B00004U30D|5.0|First, I want to make something sure: I love America! It's a wonderful country with wonderful people, but I think, Americans can't criticize this  movie correctly, 'cause it expresses very hard and evil things about this  country. And may be you lose your opjectiv opion. (By the way: Please  excuse my English, which is not perfect...) In fact, this movie is simply  fantastic! Don't forget, there are a lot of brilliant and superb actors,  like Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening or Chris Cooper. They all show an  incredible performance! Then there is a script, the world has never seen  before. It's magnificent and full of ingenius dialogues, may be no movie  had before. And finally there is a director named Sam Mendes, who combined  all this features to one great movie! Think so or don't think so: I love  this movie and I want to recommend it to everybody!  It's cinema of its  greatest kind!

6305358567|5.0|Mary Tudor, the Catholic queen of England, is ailing of cancer, and is close to death. She fears that her more popular Protestant sister Elizabeth  will take her place as queen once she has died. Mary's fears were right,  and soon after her death, leaving no male heirs, her sister is put on the  throne. Elizabeth is first portrayed as a somewhat immature inexperienced  queen who is in love with the passionate, yet married, Robert Dudley, but  as the film continues, you see her develop into a witty, animated, and  appealing queen. Mary did not die without supporters, and Elizabeth's life  was constantly in danger. With the help of her most trusted advisor,  Walsingham, she outwits all of her would-be assasins, and gets to them  first. Despite many suitors presented before her, she refuses all of them,  at the end saying that she is &quot;married to the kingdom of  England&quot;. This movie is full of schemes, character development, and  suspense. Wonderful scenery and costumes. An excellent and accurate  portrayal of 16th century England, in the age that was named after  England's beloved queen...the Elizabethan Age.
B00000K3CR|4.0|A story of a young boy who has the chance to do what most of us all wish we could do - be a grown-up for a day.  As a grown-up, you can do all sorts  of cool stuff - like go to a baseball game anytime, drink beer or even buy  playboy magazine. How fun it would be to be a grown up.<br />In Big we see the  real bond of two young boys and how wonderful it is to be a child and have  a best friend. It's heart-touching and lots of fun, too. Living the high  life of making toys and having secretaries takes a toll on the best of  friends. Oh how we know a busy grown-up schedule pulls us apart from the  people we love - mom, dad, friends...<br />Business success can beat you up,  too. Tom Hanks shows us what's really important in life and it's not the  size of your body.
6305372411|5.0|From the Earth to The Moon is -- just like most of Tom Hanks's productions -- top-notch!  Anyone who is even remotely interested in space should see  this.  A great depiction of the Mercury thru Apollo programs.  There are 12  1-hour episodes. These episodes include Apollo 13 (of course) &amp; what I  found even more compelling, things that you would never even think about.   A real behind-the-scenes look.  Each episode is extremely interesting and  gave me new insight on just what it took &amp; what an amazing adventure it  was for us &quot;to go From the earth to the Moon&quot;.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Words cannot express the thanks I have to the people who made this &quot;Directors Cut&quot; happen.  I have waited a long 12 years for this.  When this film first came out in 1988 I believe I saw it 7 times on the big  screen having fallen in love with everything about it.  As a writer and  actor my own imagination was brought forth ten fold by beautiful visuals  and characterizations and I felt displaced into another world visually,  emotionally and also spiritually. Which to me is the way a film should make  one feel.  Luc Besson has created his masterpiece and should be seen as it  was originally created.  I hope he is still as happy with his film as I am  with it 12 years later.  Jean-Marc Barr is perfect in this defining lead  role.  I have always felt him an under appreciated actor and wish there was  more of him on film. He is exciting to watch. His eyes tell more than any  words can say and I think the director realized this and used it to the  max.  Rosanna Arquette is a little miscast (but fun) and the rest of the  cast is perfect and keeps the story on line.  I don't like to give away the  story so I will not talk about it.  I just want to say to anyone who has  not seen this film. SEE IT! You'll love it and if you do not understand it  or like it then I'm sorry for those who don't. This is a story that goes  deep into the heart and soul of a man and reveals to us the beauty that can  come from those who see beyond our own world.  It also reminds us how  precious and beautiful the sea is and that it should be respected and  protected always. A week before this special directors cut was released on  DVD the film was shown on the big screen in Los Angeles and I was there.  Feeling the same emotional feelings I remembered from the first time I saw  this film.  BRAVO to Luc Besson!...
B000003BF4|5.0|As a kid, my brother and I wore out two or three copies of thisrecord, playing it real loud in our basement while jumping around pretending we were professional wrestlers. <br />Ya-Ya's, along with Live At Leeds (The Who) and Live Dead, rank among the best live records of the rock era (and I probably neglected a few others as well), but.... Ya-Ya's captures the Stones at the absolute peak - on their best tour, musically. The contention that it is sloppy is just plain incorrect. <br />The standard line is that none of the performances on Ya-Ya's is the equivalent of the studio version.  HOGWASH!  First off, why compare: live is live and the studio is the studio.  And contrary to the critical line...,the live experience IS what rock music is all about, not hit singles.  <br />Highlights of this record/cd include a Sympathy For The Devil, boasting a superior guitar solo than its studio companion.  The performance is far less stilted as well, which can also be said for the great version of Midnight Rambler.  I also love the slide gaiter part on Love In Vain, it is just so soulful.
B00002E233|5.0|Was the plot a little thin? Was the story implausable? Was some of the dialouge cringe-worthy. Yeah, sure I suppose so, but in the end it dosen't  really matter. It's an action movie, and it sure delivers on that front.  Particularly surprising was ultra-stud muffin Thomas Jane(who I'd never  even heard of previously), who comes off as something of a cross between  Bruce Willis in Die Hard mode, Harrison Ford during the Star Wars/Indiana  Jones era and Kevin Costner with his ever present tough sensativity. I dig  Thomas Janes, can you tell? He makes one heck of a hero. Saffron Burrows  was another pleasnt surprise. She actually is trying to give depth to a  character that the entire movie is, somewhat unfairly, against. Looking and  sounding like the flesh and blood incarnate of Tomb Raider's Lara Croft,  she was wholly believable, in my humble opinion, in what little she got to  do. Samuel Jackson. What can I say? Awesome as always, and certainly the  biggest surprise of the movie comes from a scene with his character. The  writing wasn't entirely bad(I've seen worse in movies that got critical  praise) and provided a few genuine laughs and thrills. The action is  astounding and mesmerising as one would expect from Renny Harlin. The DVD  version is excellent, with Sam Jackson's commentary often times becoming  laugh out loud funny. The deleted scenes were nice and left me wishing  they'd been re-edited back into the movie as they would have really served  to flesh out some of the characters. Plus I love the smoldering look  Carter(Jane) gives Susan(Burrows) during her birthday speech. That right  there: worth the price of the DVD. Yeah sure, the 'God against the devil  sharks' was really lame, but it didn't ruin it for me. I wanted fun,  mindless thrills and that's what I got. What more could I ask for?
B00003CX6P|1.0|Bad movie.  Not even worth the five bucks to rent.  I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing -- hoping for some redeeming quality to come  forth.  Very disappointing.  Story line is shaky, at best.
B000021Y77|5.0|Tom Tykwer's \\"Run Lola Run\\" is an extremely exciting, entertaining film to watch.  I first saw the film 7 years ago, and it's now a lot of fun to re-watch it and see how much of the German I can understand.  This film stands out not only as a great foreign film, but as an excellent action/adventure film as well.  If you have any friends that you want to introduce to foreign films, this would be a great one for them to start with, even if they are a little resistant to the idea of reading a film. Besides the brilliant and highly athletic performance from Franka Potente, who has since gone one to make many well-known films in the U.S., \\"Run Lola Run\\" also boasts excellent editing, a great visual style and of course, a really catchy German techno soundtrack.  I just read a review on here that suggested there should be an American version made, and I'm all for that, if it's done well.  I would agree with having Scarlett Johansen play Lola, too. I've made \\"Run Lola Run\\" part of my personal DVD collection, and you would be wise to make it part of yours as well.
B000000993|5.0|If Your gunna get a cd, get this one. it has juice like none of the other  two do, it has stuff thats great! Bottom line: its the wrench of cds with  stuff!
0783225970|5.0|dont listen to anyone who reviewed this, a few of them are idiots. if you liked gangster movies, this is THE gangster movie to own. if u dont like  them, then buzz off, you shouldnt be here reading this review anyways. the  only people who rated this movie low, are the people who dont like this  genre. Al Pacino is great, as usual. This movie is a classic, and many  other movies and t.v shows have used numerous quotes from this masterpiece.

0783235607|5.0|Often parodied but never equalled, &quot;Psycho&quot; is one of the greatest films of all time.  In terms of mystery, suspense, nailbiting  finishes, and terror beyond your wildest dreams, this film has the lot.  It  stood alone as the best horror/suspense film ever made until 1991, when  &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was released.  It is a certainty that  &quot;Psycho&quot; will leave you breathless with horror, spellbound with  terror, and agog with suspense!  There is also another certainty - you'll  think twice before taking your next shower!
6301390725|5.0|Equally as excellent as MARY POPPINS, this fantastic part live, part animated film is made memroable by both performances and magnificent visual  effects. Superb from beginning to end this is another in a huge line of  Disney classics thats ageless in appeal.
B00004SCX6|2.0|The title track's rather weak, in my opinion. The other songs are almost equally forgettable. The redeeming songs are 'Stronger' and 'Lucky,' and  they'd be even better if it wasn't Britney singing them. Currently she has  a vocal range of about three notes, and all the moaning and groaning  doesn't help much either. I read somewhere that we're being sold pure hype,  and that's pretty much how I feel. I only hope that, in the event that  she'll put out another album, someone will take the time to teach her how  to sing an entire octave.
6303540082|5.0|A fascinating backstage documentary of Madonnas following her through her exhausting 1990 world tour, titled Blonde Ambition. Shot in black and white  with concert footage in colour, this is often funny and often moving and  you feel you get to know just a little bit about Madonna after watching  this film. One of the funniest or most outrageous scenes is where Madonna  and her group of back up vocalists and dancers are seen playing truth or  dare. All in all this is a surprisingly good insight at one of the worlds  biggest talents and fans will lap it up!
B000002ULO|4.0|I decided to buy &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; after watching the video for the  song &quot;The World Tonight&quot;, and can say that I am not disappointed.  Overall, it is a satisfying collection with many strong numbers.<br />The  album opens with a nostalgic look into the past presented by &quot;The  Songs We Were Singing,&quot; in which Paul reflects on his youth. This  thoughtful and introspective mood is sustained throughout in such ballads  as &quot;Heaven on a Sunday,&quot; &quot;Somedays,&quot; &quot;Little  Willow,&quot; and even the very memorable and enjoyable &quot;Young  Boy,&quot; whose seemingly fun style almost completely masks a hint of  melancholy. Elsewhere on the album we find several rockers distinguished by  their strong rhythm and beat: &quot;The World Tonight,&quot; &quot;If You  Wanna,&quot; and &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; (the title track), with the former  being my favorite.<br />Why four stars instead of five? It seems to me the  album has a few minor weaknesses -- and, depending on your tastes, they may  not be weaknesses at all. First, it ends with several mediocre numbers,  some of them throwaways (e.g. &quot;Really Love You,&quot; &quot;Great  Day&quot;). Second, it lacks a consistent theme: there are a great many  arrangements, instruments, and styles, and the songs are not very well tied  together lyrically or musically. And third, I would have preferred to hear  more of energetic, fast-beat songs; the album's focus is on slower  music.<br />Still, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is very commendable. And if Paul  says in &quot;Somedays&quot; that &quot;inside each one of us is  love,&quot; I believe him.
6302250269|5.0|This has to be the most entertaining road movie since theclassic, Bonnie and Clyde! The plot is of Thelma (GEENA DAVIS), a bored housewife and Louise (SUSAN SARANDON) who is a waitress at a coffee shop. Together they sneak off in a 66 T-Bird convertable for a three day fishing trip. However along their travels they decide to stop off at a nightclub and encounter a drunken, foul mouthed rapist who Louise shoots. It is subsequently revealed that Louise was raped and is the reason why she shot him. This plunges them into a cross country escape from the police as they head for Mexico to begin a new life. The performances are all beleavable and likeable and as well as the fabulous two leading stars, this movie features an early role for Brad Pitt and also Harvey Kietel.The dialogue is sharp and witty and sometimes quite sad giving the characters the depth to make this as realistic as possible which they certainly manage to achieve. Tears and laughter are the ingredients to this now classic movie and the ending is sure to get a lump in your throat! There are also some magnificent shots of the Grand Canyon. EXCELLENT!

I can't beleive it wasn't until they got to  their destination until they realized that a male and another male rabbit  can't make babies. this book is dumb. the author is ignorant, and the  people that like this book insult those of us that don't like this book!  skip this ship. If you like talking animals, read redwall, or one of those  other silly animal talk books.

6304143184|5.0|Steven Speilberg takes the utterley commonplace story of a lonley child befriending an alien from outer space. Despite the theme being somewhat  tried and tested several times before this does emerge as a unique and  absolutley fantastic fantasy movie with still very stunning visual effects  and wonderful performances. Alongside, THE WIZARD OF OZ, this possibly has  to be the greatest child fantasy film of all time!  Its blend of humour  and sometimes highly emotional scenes add to the greatness of this film and  the ending is sure to get a lump in even adults throats. An excellent  classic!
B00003W8NM|5.0|the movie itself was very good, the movie alone I would probabally give 4 stars. But this dvd has so many extras it is worth a star of its own. This  is the reason why DVDs are so fun to own, and I hope future releases follow  a similiar suit.    AS for the movie the acting is superb, the one  negative, is there is way to much preaching going on for my taste, its ok  to have a message to send, but preaching is a bit to much for me.. For sure  not finchers best.. but fincher definatly will have me hooked for what I  hope is a long and succesful career.
B00000IFWE|5.0|\\"Room at the Top\\" quickly sets a plaintive tone on  \\"Echoes.\\" It's a simple, sincere song where Tom Petty sounds at peace with himself and reflective. While these emotions don't last the entire way through, it's a special start to a great album.<br /><br />Petty hails from Florida and now lives in California, but \\"Echoes\\" has a Midwestern feel, an aura that is real and down to earth. A common theme throughout this CD is Petty's usual tale of being down on his luck and bouncing back with gusto, which, truth be told, never gets old to listen to. Petty and his Heartbreakers don't exactly start \\"Echoes\\" off with a sonic boom. Save for the familiar jangle of \\"Free Girl Now,\\" the songs begin sparse and laid back, not at all a bad thing. However, if you're looking for standard Petty rock and roll, give \\"Echoes\\" some time; there's some killer material here, starting with \\"Swingin'\\" on down. \\"Swingin'\\" is a harmonica-laden tune with that aforementioned never-say-die attitude, reminiscent of Petty's \\"Won't Back Down\\" days. The song comes off as a bar-stomping ode to all the fighters of the world, complete with a memorable name-check of famous past musicians who never gave up, despite their hardships in life.<br /><br />Some of these songs contain Petty's brand of old-fashioned sounds and themes, like \\"Accused of Love\\" and the title track. Others rock out splendidly -- \\"Won't Last Long\\" being a prime example. \\"I'm down but it won't last long!\\" Petty cries faithfully on the song, sounding both retro and new at the same time. \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" is a spark plug of a tune, surprisingly sung by Mike Campbell, a virtual clone of Petty's voice. It turns out to be one of the CD's best tracks.<br /><br />As \\"Echoes\\" moves along, you begin to appreciate the no frills attitude of the Heartbreakers. \\"No More\\" is a simple and plaintive track, resigned, but also hopeful and optimistic; it's a quiet song about staying true to your ideals. By comparison, \\"About to Give Out\\" is a good-time rocker, a rollicking tune that captures resignation in a different sense. \\"Rhino Skin\\" is an eloquent track about staying tough in a world full of pressure, a theme Petty knows and sings about well. The album's closer, \\"One More Day, One More Night,\\" ends \\"Echoes\\" dramatically, and like the start of the CD, it's mostly quiet and simple, yet not as much at peace as the leadoff gem.<br /><br />Bravo to Petty and his Heartbreaker for their musical integrity and talent. This CD is one of the band's best.tune that captures resignation in a different sense. \\"Rhino Skin\\" is an eloquent track about staying tough in a world full of pressure, a theme Petty knows and sings about well.

I've had this album for six  years and it never makes it out of the CD bin.  I think that kinda says it  all.  I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this CD but I  certainly never found it.  Please if you are still set on purchasing this  CD may I suggest a used outlet first. I'd hate to see someone spend the  full price on this.

B000002WPI|5.0|I had been reluctant to listen to hip hop before I listen to this  record,so I can't say very much about the impact this record made on the  hip hop world. But anyway,this changed me thoroughly as it did to the  entire pop music scene of America.It was a fatal blow to conservative  ears.80's-style-musicians were wiped out of the scene completely.This made  them obsolete.Everyone who listened to  this could be a witness to the  historical turning point.<br />Well...it may be just an old history.It's 2000  now.Another story is happening.But this was the record which persuaded many  reluctant ears.It is still powerfull!  I'm not an African American,I'm  Japanese,but it doesn't matter.It moves me especially with the song like  C.R.E.A.M.And the sound!It is addictive!<br />Try this ten times and you can't  get away from it .

And one night it was on t.v.! So I wanted to watch it.. and I really did enjoy the beginning.. just watch it and see.. Liza Minnelli is a wonderful actress and her voice is beautiful.. and I enjoyed Robert De Niro's performance even though I wanted to kill his role lol.. (just watch it and see) I did like this movie.. but soon I began to lose intrest.. possibly because the beginning was very exciting.. that some how i wanted more of that excitement throughout the movie.. But the acting is wonderful.. and Martin Scorsese's directing was also wonderful..  I would of enjoyed it more if I might of had a greater intrest to watch it.. But this film is worth your time.. and maybe you may have full intrest through out this movie.. it doesn't hurt to get confy, and watch it!  END

B00003CX6P|1.0|So many positive reviews for this film. it was one of the worstmovies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing, Matt Damon ... did  an ok acting job. thats as far as the positives goes.. The plot is just  ridulas everyone else looked more like fools trying to act. by the way did  I mention how Horribal that Plot was.. Normally I'd say rent this movie  before buying it, But dont even bother, its not worth the 4 bucks for one  viewing let alone multiple ones.
B00003CX5A|5.0|This film is just what you want on DVD- a visual work of art with a good story.  It's a Tim Burton film so it's very stylized- a type of film making  which not everyone appreciates. Here, however, Burton evokes the haunting  atmosphere of classic black and white, sound stage horror films and,  generally tends much more toward beautiful imagery than in his other films-  picturesque gothic settings, the porcelain skin on Depp, Ricci and  Richardson etc. This makes this film likely more accessible to people who  are not Burton fans. (There's plenty of weird stuff, too- the Hogarth-like  town fathers and Icabod Crane's grotesque homemade scientific instruments.)  <br />The story itself expands wildly upon the original Washington Irving  tale, departing from it totally at some points. It becomes the story of  rationalistic Crane's confrontation with both the unreason of supernatural  horror in the form of a marauding headless horseman and with his own  emotions. It's a pretty good, intelligent yarn and, although the visuals  tend to dominate, strong enough to make the film more than just  &quot;pretty pictures&quot;. The use of visuals that both horrify and  attract supports the story and its themes well.  The weak point comes when  the film falls into more conventional action sequences near the end- parts  seemed to me more appropriate to Westerns than Horror.  Still, it's all set  in the same darkly enchanted environment and isn't too far out of  place.<br />The DVD has a full array of features- including a behind the  scenes documentary, cast interviews AND scene by scene commentary by  Burton.  Burton chuckles over whimsical features of his work in the  commentary but also explains how he made casting choices (Christopher Lee,  Martin Landau) to evoke horror classics and even used a cinematographer  from &quot;Outer Limits&quot;.  The behind the scenes material, of course,  explains special effects and how they built the town of Sleepy Hollow on  location for the film.  Standouts there tho were the use of a  forty-year-old incredibly realistic mechanical horse from NATIONAL VELVET  for some of the horseman's stunts and a view of the stage where much of the  film was shot revealing a skylit ceiling which allowed both natural  lighting and control of special effects.<br />I wouldn't advise anyone to buy  a DVD of a film they've never seen but this beautiful film is a good title  to explore as a possible addition to any collection.
0399143904|2.0|As a reader of all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books, I find Rainbow Six to be  the latest in declining quality.  The storyline was not creative and seemed  to be an extension and rehash of the ebola storyline of the past.  The  overall research was fair and not up to the high quality of some of the  first books, i.e., Hunt For Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and  Without Remorse.  Troubling were the seemingly unprofessionalism  idiosycncrocies of both the good guys and the bad guy.  This book was  definitely not up to the standards of Clancy's earlier books.  I hope the  next is back to his excellent researched and plotted books of the past.
B000021Y74|5.0|&quot;Most German film critics did not valorize as a fresh idea the concept that the decisions we make in life, no matter how minute, have  snowball effects on the rest of our lives (and on the lives of those  crossing our path).&quot; (Unknown) Though I wish I had said this line it  is not mine, but what a way to express the underlying theme of this film.    On top of that, it is wildly entertaining showing the hot fashion and music  of this Berlin crowd.   So while we may not have the opportunity to replay  situations in our own lives, it should be remembered that every action we  take can drastically effect the next and the next and the next...
0553212737|4.0|Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may  be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few  authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee.  Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment  than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's.  The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader  wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we  care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that  we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In  fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting  character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very  little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and  Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They  are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when  they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr  Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without  difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't  get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it.

0812523334|2.0|I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to  cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly  you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's  lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across  as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot?  However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge  to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while  reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on  and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that  the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried. I thought  about giving this book a solid three stars but that would have been too  generous. It is regarded as a classic but to me it was a sentimental piece  of rubbish. 2 generous stars
630575067X|1.0|The only thing I can say about Star Wars, Episode 1 is &quot;What happened?&quot;  I finally gave in and used a free rental to see the movie  and was shocked at how a film so awful made so much money.   The acting was  terrible, the special effects average (too many computer generated images)  and the plot lacking emotion and substance.  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman  and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through their roles and Jake Lloyd shows how  one individual can single handedly ruin a franchise.<br />To make matters  worse, the script is full of dumb plot twists and bad dialogue that weighs  down the movie and neglects to provide any depth to the characters.  The  climactic battle between the Jedi's and Darth Maul is too short and wastes  the use of a great villain.<br />The one positive thing about the movie is  that we won't have to see Jake Lloyd in any future roles.  Too bad we can't  say this about the other actors.<br />Keeping with the tradition of present  day Hollywood, Episode 1 is another example of a film that uses special  effects to disguise a weak plot and sub par acting.  As Jar Jar would say  &quot;Mr. Lucas big screw up time but him no care since money he want so  badly.&quot;
6304504012|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think about a Hollywood version of Evita staring what I thought was probably the dubious casting of Madonna as Eva Peron.   After recently seeing a wonderful staged version of Evita, I decided to  purchase this video.  Whereas it is true that the video is nothing like  seeing a live version, uh duh, what do you expect?  However, it its own  way, this video is quite charming and I think that most people that enjoy  dramatic, historic movies or musicals would probably enjoy it.<br />Madonna  does not sing nearly as well as Patti LuPone.  If you are a diehard fan of  the original Broadway production of Evita, her voice and rendition of Eva  will certainly disappoint you.  I think everyone else will enjoy her  performance, which is generally well done and moving.  Madonna does not  look anything like Eva Peron, but I cannot imagine any other star able to  carry off the role as well as she does.<br />Antonio Banderas does not sing  well at all but still carries off his role as Che rather well.  Unless you  cannot stand the fact that he does not interpret his role in at the same  way as Mandy Patinkin in the original Broadway version, you will surely  enjoy him in this role...especially if you are a woman.  He practically  smolders off the screen.<br />The video generally follows Webber and Rice's  original Broadway production, with some obvious changes that I did not feel  harmed the enjoyment of the musical.  The music is repetitive, but I think  Webber was writing for the masses.  If you have a normal understanding of  music and are not a professional musician or an afictionado of musicals,  you will probably love the music and lyrics and find this a moving  portrayal of the life of Eva Peron.<br />One thing that I particularly like  about Evita is that, keeping in mind that this is no documentary, it does  more or less follow her life.  You can watch this video and have a feel for  what sort of person she was and know the basics about her life, keeping in  mind that many of the &quot;facts&quot; regarding her real life are in  dispute.<br />To sum, if you are looking for an exact replica of Evita as it  is performed on stage, this is not it.  This is the musical with some of  the staging and music altered to bring it to the big screen.  If you are  looking for first class singing, you would be better off to purchase the  recordings of Patti LuPone, Mandy Patinkin, and cast done of the original  Broadway production of Evita.  If you want to see a musical version of  Evita brought to the big screen with beautiful scenery, costumes, and  excellent acting, you will probably enjoy this version of Evita.
0425170349|5.0|Rainbow Six is a book that summarizes what all of us fear but none  actually realizes that it can really happen.  Tom Clancy has written a  fabulous book.  The technical descriptions of this book could make even a  techno nerd go wild.  Although there are some gory details, it is metered  out through the rest of the book.  The juxtaposition of the incongruous  characters (those being the terrorists ans the rainbow team members) evoke  a sense of irony also.  This has to be one of Tom Clancy's best novels  ever.
B00004THAY|5.0|There are musicians that have nothing let to prove except the fact that  they can still make great records    after all those years. That is the  case of Eric Clapton and BB King, who have finally released a joint                         studio album, properly entitled &quot;Riding With The  King&quot; <br />  Eric Clapton, who is almost sixty years of age himself,  co-produced this album with utmost respect his   partnership with the  septuagenarian BB King. Both have been longtime friends, and after a long  time of     planning, they figured this would be a perfect timing for a  joint album. After all, both of them have         consolidated careers and  no longer have to ask the record industry executives what to do. <br /> The  record's cover itself is an invitation to pleasure. Eric Clapton at the  Cadillac's wheel next to his Strat,              and BB in the back with  his inseparable Lucille. What can you expect more? <br /> For the first time,  the king of the blues and the god of guitar have made a full studio  collaboration. Those    who expect a landmark in blues history will surely  be disappointed, for the goal of the album is not to       make a  statement, but simply to document two living guitar legends having a ball  in the studio. <br />  The title track, &quot;Riding With the King&quot;,  shoes where the album is heading to. However, considering the                              other tracks, the song is almost dismissable. <br />   The other  tracks are a ride through King's stage repertoire plus a few gems. The  attentive listener will        quickly distinguish Clapton's  &quot;slowhand&quot; sound and BB's economical, conversational riffs. <br />    In my view, the album's best tracks are &quot;Ten Long Years&quot;(one of  King's earliest hits, recorded in the   fifties), &quot;Help The  Poor&quot;, &quot;Three O'Clock Blues&quot;, and the ultra-standard  &quot;Come Rain Or Come Shine&quot;,                    which was also  recorded by FrankSinatra in his &quot;Duets&quot;album. <br /> The latter is  augmented by a beautiful string arrangement conducted by legendary R&amp;B  producer/arranger    Arif Mardin, known for his work with Aretha Franklin  and also for the horn arrangement in Queen's               &quot;Staying  Power&quot;(one of the few decent tracks on their &quot;Hot Space&quot;  album. <br /> &quot;Riding With The King&quot; is incredibly soothing to hear,  and it is not at all bring. Leave your CD player on                                   the repeat mode and party on!!!

I'll never understand why someone always has to be called &quot;Johnny&quot; in these movies, and all of Swayze's compadres offer nothing but distracting cannon fodder, but there are some really enjoyable moments: (1) Keanu doing his impression of himself as Ted Logan w/ surfboard in hand, (2) all the heros' interactions with the uptight FBI AIC:;, and (3) the still-waters-run-deep eruption into anger when Keanu realizes his girlfriend is in trouble &amp; he can't help it (see the same look on his face as when Dennis Hopper has Sandra Bullock wired with explosives in &quot;Speed&quot;).  There are also quintessential iterations of tried-and-true movie formulas (1) the not unmoving Florence Nightingale scene (Lori Petty swabbing Keanu's beaten brow), (2) the nobly injured hero a la every Mel Gibson movie (Keanu's messed-up knee), (3) the hero chasing moving cars on foot (again a favorite of Gibson), (4) classic dialogue about &quot;adrenaline&quot;, (5) dumb euphemisms for &quot;I love you.&quot; In all, it's a great, beachy, fun film, and Keanu and Swayze are both plenty hot to keep it interesting.

B000002H97|5.0|Wow. <br />Stunning.<br />Amazing.<br />This album, self titled  &quot;Metallica&quot; and nicknamed &quot;The Black Album&quot;, is  Metallica's best album. Let me tell you some stuff about it.<br />Right when  you start playing &quot;Metallica&quot;, you will suddenly become fixed  into &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, track 1. The music spooks you out, gets you  all hyper, or makes you wonder how it's so great. Then, at the one minute  and ten seconds mark when James Hetfield's vocals start blasting, you'll be  blasting too. <br />Hetfield does an amazing part on all of the lyrics, as he  yells &quot;Exit Light...Enter Night...take my hand...off to never, never  land&quot; he does do perfectly. Amazing song.<br />&quot;Sad But True&quot;  is another great song. James once again used his vocals wonderfully for  this song.<br />&quot;The Unforgiven&quot;. This song is a masterpiece,  nothing else said.<br />&quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;...a softer song, but  has an attitude, a charisma that's sure as hell not soft.<br />&quot;The  Struggle Within&quot; every band member does something perfect here. Great  song.<br />&quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot;...as James bellows out &quot;Shape  Shift...nose to the wind&quot; you will be surprised at his vocals and the  guitar/bass/drum work.<br />Those are only a few of my favorites on this  album. This is a MUST BUY FOR ALL METALLICA/HEAVY METAL/ROCK/COOL STUFF  music fans.<br />Inspiring.<br />Worth the money.<br />Perfect.
B000002H7I|5.0|Tracy's voice is wonderful, soulful and honest...but what is really  amazing is her song-writing skill.  Her lyrics always make you think about  yourself and the world in which you live-- actually, quite a few of these  songs have helped me out of dark times and given me hope that I thought I'd  lost (specifically &quot;All That You Have is Your Soul&quot; --the final  track on the disk).  Some of her recent work cannot compare to this early  album.<br />Track #3, &quot;Freedom Now,&quot; and &quot;Born to Fight&quot;  (track #7) are reasons enough to buy this CD.  The lyrics are inspiring and  the melodies are complex, but simple at the same time.  If you like Tracy's  later work, then you'll love this disk.  The songs have the same deep feel,  but they're presented in a much more positive way--the beat is up tempo and  not as sleepy as her later works.<br />Buy this CD, you'll love it for sure.
0061003697|4.0|A local bookstore recently had a huge sale of budget Agatha Christie  novels, so, being the mystery lover that I am(how many people do you know  have read all the Sherlock Holmes stories?) , I promptly purchased a number  of them <br />By far my favorite(so far-she wrote over sixty books and I have  only read fourteen) one has been Death On The Nile. <br />Differently from  most death investigation books, the victim is alive and well through a good  half of the book, which mades its reading a bit dull at first. All of a  sudden, someone is murdered and Hercule Poirot, who is fortunately on  vacation in Egypt at the time, takes the helm and then the bodies start  piling up. <br />The novel was one of Agatha Christie's early ones, written  around 1934(barely six years after Mysterious Affair at Styles, her first  effort and first appearance of the detective). <br />In reading the book, one  feels that the author had finally found her style by then - before that,  Poirot seemed to be merely a parody of Doyle's creation - which had become  a tradition at the time. <br />Colonel Hastings is not present, and this time  the story is told in a third-person point of view, which in my opinion  enriches the plot and gives the author more independence into the  characters' minds. <br />After I finished it, I found myself reading another  Christie book, &quot;Lord Edgeware Dies&quot;, which as the book written  immediately before &quot;Death on The Nile&quot;. It is obvious that Mrs  Christie used the same technique there, and I wound up finding out the  murderer before its ending, since &quot;Death on The Nile&quot; is so much  cleverly written. <br />A must read, especially for anyone who loves Agatha  Christie
B000001GXI|4.0|This is arguably the best-conducted version of Mozart's masterpiece.  Böhm  chooses leisurely tempi, but they are never sluggish and seem exactly right  for the piece.  His direction conjures up a magical atmosphere that is only  found elsewhere on Karajan's EMI recording.  Böhm gets radiant playing from  the Berlin Philharmonic in superb form, and the RIAS Kammmer-Chor is simply  unbelievable: the best chorus I have ever heard.  They must be heard to be  believed.<br />Sadly, Böhm's cast is not on this level, with exception of  three singers: Wunderlich, Hotter and Fischer-Dieskau.  Wunderlich is a  superb Tamino, intelligently characterized and gorgeously sung, and is only  surpassed by Anton Dermota (and only by a small margin).  Fischer-Dieskau  sings Papageno clearly and beautifully, but also paints an endearing  portrait of this loveable but hopelessly goofy birdcatcher.  Hans Hotter is  a magnificent Speaker; his only scene, with Wunderlich, is the best  performance of the scene on disc.  Evelyn Lear, though, is strained by  Pamina's part, particularly in &quot;Ach, ich fühl's.&quot;  Roberta Peters  is shrill in the upper register, and Franz Crass is a coarse Sarastro.  The  sound is excellent, though and this recording also includes an abridged  form of the dramatically essential dialogue.<br />My recommendation for  Flute-seekers is to get two recordings - this one and Karajan's 1950 EMI  account.  Karajan's is a superior performance but does not include dialogue  and is in mono sound.  If you only want to get one, I would lean towards  Karajan because of the magnificent singing, combined with conducting at  least as good as Böhm's.
B00004WGC4|5.0|It suprises many people to know that there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and that the first was made in 1974 and the second in 1979. This  giftset captures all 12 magical episodes that explore the hilarious  character of Basil Fawlty, owner of a hotel on the South coast of England.  <br />Basil is desperatly trying to be middle-class which often leads to him  offending the &quot;riff-raff&quot; that stop at the hotel. You see Basil  wants his hotel to have only the finest guests, it's just that when this  class of guest stays, which is rare, he always manages to offend them as  well. <br />Aided by his stone-faced wife, a confused Spanish waiter and a  drunken-Chef, this makes for the most famous and celebrated hotel in  British television history. <br />Featuring classic episodes that get better  with viewing, such as The German's and Gourmet Night. The complete giftset  runs in at over 450 minutes, if it's like the European version then it  should contain a thirty minute exclusive interview with John Cleese on each  tape!

B00003CWTH|5.0|Thanks to everyone who's been writing reviews.  I just watched this video last weekend, Saturday night and again Sunday afternoon.  What a powerful,  powerful film. If you haven't seen it yet, hold on, give it time, stay with  it. The connections of characters, themes, cuts, and music are all perfect.   One Amazon reviewer called the film of biblical proportions--and the scene  of the second plague of frogs on LA-Egypt certainly clinched that image.   Besides, health, or lack thereof, of frogs is an indicator of the human  condition, and if this movie is about anything it is about the &quot;human  heart in conflict with itself&quot;--while dwelling in the Promised Land of  the US of A, LA. Who couldn't be moved by the themes and images of love,  regret, fate (timing?), rage, compassion, knowledge, immoralities?    ...Like  Leonard Cohen's powerful song &quot;Future&quot; -- only in the  film many of the characters do give us cause to hope, especially by the end  of the day (and what a day it had been! ):  the emotionally battered/used  child who knew &quot;frogs happen&quot; and his dad should treat him  better; the cokehead daughter who smiles at the very end of the film when  her new friend tells her all the things the Cruise-character told guys to  lie about to women but the policeman is sincere; the mother who finally  confronts her husband and affirms her daughter's years of molestation by  her father; the Cruise-character who walks towards his father's widow's  hospital room;  the nurse who feels the pain of everyone he genuinely tries  to help.  I need to watch the film again.  It has been vastly UNDERrated!  What a gem.  The cuts, the characters, the music, the themes:  &quot;Get it  right for yourself and give a hand to those around you. Face death and  live.&quot; Yeah, &quot;American Karma&quot;: those characters were trying  to work it out, living it, making mistakes, sometimes getting it right--and  as the Jason Robards character finally says, it's allabout loving.  Just  know, this movie is worth your time;  it's a work of art and the music is  sheer perfection. Not only am I much moved by the music and plan to buy the  soundtrack, but I would like a copy of the script--it's modern poetry,  beginning with the title.
B00000IQC8|5.0|With Clerks, Kevin Smith introduced himself to the world, with a wonderful concept, script, and a lot of friends as actors.  I must mention Jeff  Anderson for his completely natural performance as Randal, and of course,  Mewes.  The DVD has a music video by soul asylum, which if you want to be a  cpmpletist, you should see, as it contains a little extra footage before  the hockey game, and was filmed with the cast, much like the &quot;Build Me  Up Buttercup&quot; song on the Mallrats DVD. The DVD also contains the  Alternate Ending. However, The original ending is much better. The DVD also  contains many deleted scenes, some excellent, including another Navy Seals  joke. Apart from a bit of distortion, this is as close to a perfect edition  of Clerks as is possible. Wonderful.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Grease has got to be the best musical that was ever made. Or maybe I think that because I haven't seen many musicals. Nah, it's the best. I would go  on and say how I liked the characterization, acting, and all else, but all  of that will fit into four words - It's Just the Best. Casting couldn't  have been better, neither could have the cast did the parts better.  Everything in this movie was perfect! And the performances of the songs  were great! I'm in a production of Grease right now, as Kenickie, and I'm  having a great time! Everything that revolves around this movie is  just...the best!

6300183971|4.0|I don't think anyone could have ever faithfully crossed Dune from Novel to movie, unless the movie was over 10 hours long with a budget well over $200  million.  The biggest problem was that this movie was not long and detailed  enough to satisfy the real Dune fans, and too long and detailed for the  mainstream.    Yet this movie did well all things considered.  The acting  and screenplay are true to what I felt the characters would be.  Even  Herbert said he was impressed with the vision of the film.  Kyle  MacLachlan's portayal of Paul Atreides is masterfully performed for someone  of his then young age.    Lynch's strange and alien choices for design only  serve to heighten the film.  His strange yet subtle use of osmotic fluid  visuals to describe hyperspace and omniscience are unearthly and almost  spiritual for those few who understood it. (While everyone was just trying  to figure out what was happening).   I only wished this movie showed the  entire novel, focusing even more on the convoluted details, mysteries,  religions and cultures (which would've wierded out the mainstream audience  even more than the original film did!)    If you're a hardcore Dune fan,  you might be turned off by the relatively short length (over 2 hours), but  consider that this movie was made trying to at least break even to the  mainstream audience..which was required to pay for its budget.      If  you're looking for a thought provoking, complex and almost spiritual  film..this is it.  If you're looking a fun, shoot em up sci fi you'll be  very dissapointed.
B00003CXDG|5.0|If you like action, don't pass on this DVD.  It is a must for all Tom Cruise fans.

078062999X|3.0|First off, there's much to admire here.  Branagh, who usually considerably edits his film versions of Shakespeare's plays, presents us with the full  manuscript; the result is a four-hour film--quite a feat in today's  short-attention-span world.  Also, I like the chances Branagh took with the  LOOK of this film.  Too often, film adaptations of Hamlet are dark and  gloomy and all the scenes are shot inside dank, shadowy castle walls.  How  marvellous that Branagh has instead filmed Hamlet in bright wintry colors!   Likewise, Branagh has added color to Hamlet himself--blond hair, blue eyes!   I love it.<br />It's interesting to note that although this film received  heaps of praise in the U.S., it was largely lambasted in Britain, and the  problems with this version are the typical ones Branagh has made in most of  his Shakespeare adaptations.  First, although Branagh is arguably the most  powerful Shakespeare-in-film actor/director since Olivier, Branagh has a  problem hamming it up and getting ridiculously smarmy with his acting.   This is entirely digestible in a comedy like Much Ado About Nothing, but in  Hamlet he goes a bit too far over the top.  It's as if Branagh is forever  aware that the camera is on him and he's determined to milk it for all it's  worth.  This is, of course, a difference in interpretation perhaps.  I've  always viewed Hamlet as a sad and screwed-up guy and not as a borderline  lunatic.<br />More disappointing however (yet it's equally been a problem in  other Branagh films) are the artistic concessions made.  Why go through the  fuss of making an authentic four-hour film of Hamlet if you're going to  cheapen the authenticity with pure Hollywood.  In particular, Hamlet's  encounter with the ghost of his father and Hamlet's swashbuckling swordplay  at the film's close are both completely laughable.  It's as if Branagh were  trying to compete with, oh, I don't know, some special-effects driven  action flick.<br />Still, for fans of Hamlet this adaptation is worth  watching.  The cinematography, costumes and mood of the film make it worth  at least a rental.
B00002RAOU|2.0|This is one of the first gory slasher films from the early seventies, which inspired the many films of this type in the eighties. It's a tale of  a group of people after a precious land development in a bay, who kill one  another for control of it. There are some good effects from that era,  especially an axe in a face scene. The ending is surprising, and the film  generally has a unique feel to it. The DVD is below average. The picture is  not good, and the extras are just factoids on the film. A good horror film  with an below average DVD transfer, but it is fairly cheap.
0790729652|5.0|If only the fifth could get back to where this thing started. Micheal Keaton IS Batman. Nothing against Val, a little something against Clooney  (in this role anyway), but these guys just could not pull off both sides of  the bat as well as Keaton. As far as Nicholson goes, just forget it! No  other villian is going to beat that performance. These movies went downhill  after this. I can suffer through &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, but it stops  there. I almost deny the existance of the third and fourth installments.  Batman is the Dark Knight, and not some campy superhero. If your in  jeopardy of forgetting this, GET THIS DVD, before it's too late. Tim Burton  is a master of the dark vibe. If only they can get him back. The action  sequences and the story combine to make a win-win scenario that can't be  beat.
B000002JST|5.0|Wow, this is a fast paced album. Phil's drumming, Angus's soloing,  Malcolm's strumming, Mark's slapping, and of course Bon's singing. This is  truely a great AC/DC album. With songs like &quot;Go Down, Dog Eat Dog, Let  There Be Rock, Problem Child, and of course Whole Lotta Roise&quot;, no  wonder Angus's amp smoked at the end of the recording process. Setting the  standard for early metal bands, and having good old fashioned rock and  roll, this is a must album to buy for any AC/DC fan.
B000001E29|4.0|I had the Great pleasure of seeing the english language premiere of this  Avant-garde Opera at the Edmonton '98 Fringe Festival (the biggest fringe  theater festival in North America). It was a sheer fun! This Same  Production (though completely transformed) went on to win Best Directtion  at the '99 New York fringe and became &quot;the best selling show at the NY  fringe ever&quot;. It returned this year, 2000, to Edmonton. This new  production Totally emobodied the Music of Tom Waits version of the  &quot;Black Rider&quot;. Preformed as Somthing Tim Burton might have  directed, the musical is pure insanity. The Music is extremely Bizzare and  at times hard to listen to. It seems to be inspired by Carnival music  adding to the insanity of the story. The Lyrics, with the exception of a  few songs, are simple and rarely profound but they do effectivly tell the  story none the less. This recording of the Show is however very poorly  preformed. Where there should be at least 8 persons in the cast this  recording simply fetures, to my knowledge, Tom Waits struggling through the  songs with is graspy voice. Now this IS effective at times, but more often  than not it's just annoying. Also because this is just one man you don't  get to hear the beautiful harmonies in some of the songs. I do understand  that this is only a concept album, but still. Well, in short this is a  Brilliant show but this recording simply doesn't do it justice.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|The Evil Dead is one of the best low budget horror films of the early eighties, and was notorious, being included on the video nasties list. It's  the tale of a group of young folks who go into the countryside and find a  book of the dead, and unleash its supernatural powers. The special effects  are good, and it is kinda funny too. The DVD is great. The picture is very  good, nice and clear, and the sound is remastered into Dolby digital  surround; the best sound sequences are when the unseen force is moving  quickly, accompanied by the eerie noise. Both commentries are excellent and  funny, and there is 150 photos and some unseen footage. All in all, a great  film and DVD.
B00003CWOL|4.0|This really should be 4.5 stars. My only trouble is the strange audio. The spoken audio was too soft and thus all the action was far too loud when it popped in and surprised me. I ended up changing my center channel volume to avoid it, but it could have been better. As far as the content, this is one of the greatest movies that has come out lately in the comedy arena. The casting was very well done, adding to the appeal of the movie. Jay and Silent Bob finally get the screen time that they are worthy of! Boo-Yah! As always, Smith is loyal to the actors that got him where he is, and that quality just adds a little something to his movies. The story presented is just a knock-out that provides an endless opportunity for comedy, and it's used to the fullest. Some people don't care for religous humor, but this movie isn't for those people. You can't go wrong with this movie if you are a true comedy afficienado.
B00000JJQK|4.0|yes it is all the good things everyone says and tied with Sgt Pepper for  my favorite of all time but still doesn't sound as good as the vinyl, is it  just me?
B00003CXGG|2.0|First things first.  Jet Li is awesome.  Hong Kong action fans know that from his great debut in Shaolin Temple or his great Once Upon a Time in  China series.  Americans know his skills from his great performance in the  awesome Lethal Weapon 4.  So we all know Jet Li is the real deal.<br />Lets  also give props to Aaliyah.  She is great in the film.  She played her part  really well.  She made a great film debut.<br />With that said, despite some  good action scenes the film itself is too long and drawn out at times.   Simply, there is not enough action.  Too many streches of the film are  boring.  Plain and simple.<br />Should you rent this film.  Sure, give it a  try.  But despite Jet Li's talent and Aaliyah's great debut the film is not  great.  This is not a film you will want to own or watch over again.  My  advice: check out some of Jet Li's older stuff or get Lethal Weapon 4.  But  Romeo must die is not a DVD to own.<br />I am glad the film was financially  successful so hopefully Jet Li will come out with a better movie to  showcase his talents.<br />Martial arts fans need to check out Jackie Chan's  Project A now on DVD.  That is a great Kung Fu film.
0790744295|5.0|This is an excellent collection of five creepy tales from zombie maestro George A. Romero. Based on the tales of Stephen King (who also appears in  one of the stories) it features a good cast. The DVD is good. The picture  is very clear and the sound in Dolby stereo is a massive improvement over  the mono video version. The title sequence at the beginning is awesome,  with many thunderclaps in the surround channel. The extras are just a  trailer. It would have been good to see more, especially a commentary from  Romero &amp; King; but it's still an excellant film and DVD.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Nothing against the original, but Aliens is so good I can't stop watching it every time I see it on TV. I had to get the DVD. There are 17 extra  minutes in this release, and it's so good I don't even know where they  are.<br />Weaver, Biehn, Paxton, et al, do teriffic jobs in their roles.  Cameron, as usual, does grade A work in the director's chair to churn out  one of the best movies you can buy. The bonus features on this DVD increase  it's value even more. The behind the scenes footage is a wonderful  addition, as well as the still photos. Even the interactive menu is well  thought out and very cool.  Aliens is a worthy purchase to add to, or  upgrade your collection.
B000002ADT|5.0|for the kenny g, najee,  and george howard smooth jazz idiots, listening to this cd is like the ali's rumble in the jungle, jordan droppin 63 on the  celtics, or tiger winning the masters...you can never look at the genre the  same after experiencing this.<br />i must've bought about 10 copies of this cd  for my friends that tell me that jazz can't get better than dave koz...all  are now converted.
076790382X|3.0|This is the first of Bryson's books that I've read. He is unquestionably  observant and trenchant, and that makes the book very readable. But the  pressures of a regular deadline seem to have rendered some of his essays  perfunctory. Many of the the pieces echo each other in tone and topic,  which detracts from the book's overall impact. Still, I'm eager to read  more from this man, who at his best is laugh-out-loud funny.
6305363668|5.0|The video quality of Blade Runner is stunning. By far the best picture quality I have ever seen on VHS. I'm sure the DVD is even better, certainly  more durable. The scenery and dark theme match well to create the mood of  the movie, set in a dark, seemingly run down, futuristic Earth.<br />Harrison  plays a retired Blade Runner who is sucked back into service to stop  renegade replicants. Even with the movie's age nearing twenty years, Blade  Runner is a solid movie even today. The Director's cut forgoes some  voiceover work that bridged a few gaps for viewers that had trouble keeping  up, as well as adding some cut footage.<br />Rutger Hauer does a commendable  job as the leader of the band of replicants, who are gaining too much free  will to remain docile. This is a classic movie that should be a definate  addition to the collection of any Harrison fans, or Rutger fans for that  matter.<br />No to be missed. Make sure to go for the DVD version to get the  Dolby 5.1 surround that would &quot;put the icing on the gravy&quot; for  all cinematic audiophiles out there.
0140277447|5.0|It's sad that we are still arguing over the history here. As a Chinese who  married to a Japanese husband, I really feel sad for both Chinese and  Japanese. My husband who is a very well educated Japanese (Japanese  university graduate) bought this book for trying to get more information on  what Japanese army did to China during WWII because he told me that  Japanese students are not taught about what Japanese army tortured innocent  people in Asia. Unfortunately, he didn't finish reading it...obviously, he  simply gave up reading by seeing those pictures. The purpose of this book,  I belive, is to let readers know what had happeded in Naking and to moan  for those victims. Hopefully, the history won't repeat itself. As time  slips, younger generations do not have any impression about the war. We are  living in an era that is quite different from WWII. Sometimes, I try to  discuss histroy with my husband, but he always told me: &quot;it was war,  nobody could control it&quot;, &quot;I am sorry, but I didn't do  it&quot;...etc. I think it more or less reflect the Japanese young  generation's attitude. Everyone loves his/her home country. It's  understandable for Japanese to defend Japan. But please, at least, try to  understand why many Asian countries demanding a formal and sincere apology  from Japanese government. We study history is to learn some lessons from  it, not to create conflicts or hatred.
B00004TWZG|4.0|The edited version of this film was a winner, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with the Director's cut. The extra time dives a little deeper into  the relationship between Matilda and Leon. While there are a couple slow  spots, they are not enough to make you lose interst and they add to the  story. Luc Besson once again proves himself as one of the greats in the  action genre and can rightfully put another notch in his belt. (La Femme  Nakita, The Fifth Element, The Messenger) If your a fan of good action and  like to see a good plot along with it, don't miss this one.
B000001FDI|5.0|I REMEMBER HAVING TO BE ON A WAITING LIST FOR AN 8TRACK FOR WEEKS IN 1969. PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KILLED FOR THIS 8TRACK. EVERYONE'S FAVORITE (CONTRARY TO  WHAT SOME REVIEWERS THINK) WAS &quot;DO WHAT YOU LIKE&quot;. IT WAS A TIME  OF HOT CARS,DRAFT CARD AND BRA BURNING, AND DRUGS. IT WAS A PERFECT FIT FOR  THAT TIME..
079284632X|2.0|I thought that this movies was a slight mockery to the true crime that happened.  From the cheesey music to the two idiot Police officers the  movies seemed like it was suppose to be some kind of comedy.  I don't think  it really depicted the true crime.
B00004R997|4.0|My young kids enjoy Saludos Amigos just as much as any other Disney offering.  Indeed, its format of short animations loosely linked by live  footing describing the Disney team's ventures in South America is well  suited to them in not requireing a full hour's sustained  attention.<br />Speaking for myself, I find it extremely interesting, over and  above its entertainment value.  There are lots of small incidental details  that illustrate the difference between life in the mid-twentieth and early  twentyfirst century, one of the first being when they mentioned their three  day flight from the US to Rio.<br />Visually and aurally, given the age of the  feature, the quality is excellent.  The restoration team have done an  outstanding job, particularly on the animated sections.  José Karioka is a  particularly vibrant character visually and Donald Duck sounds great.   However, in this day of Dolby Surround Sound with everything, the mono  soundtrack is very noticeable (but you can't change history).<br />There are  at least some extras.  In this area Disney is (slowly) improving but I  guess we'll have to wait for a 'Collector's Edition' before we really get  the extras we want (i.e. a selection of such background material as is  still available, such as discarded clips, interviews, early artwork etc.).   But for a relatively minor feature such as this that could be many years  away.<br />Overall?  Well it's not in the same league as contemporaries such  as its predecessor Bambi but is certainly the match of anything  subsequently released in the forties.  The animation has more in common  with Disney's shorts than his films.  It's different and that alone makes  it worth checking out.
B000001FN3|5.0|The 1987 CD re-release in no way diminished this work as a classic, but  the changes made to the original were a mixed bag.  Orson Welles'  incredible voice (Why was it left off the original?!) would improve  practically anything, but the new guitar solos by Ian Bairnson were  unnecessary and somewhat distracting, with the synth additions by Parsons  and Eric Woolfson making only a minor difference.  All the tracks shine,  but a special mention should be made of Andrew Powell's beautiful  instrumentals for &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, especially the  Pavane.  Incidentally, anyone who especially values this as a  &quot;theme&quot; album should also check out Woolfson's amazing  &quot;Freudiana&quot;, which even more &quot;mystery and imagination&quot;  than this did.  It's an import, and somewhat pricey, but well worth it.
6300184064|4.0|This is a brilliant film.  Unfortunately, the second half can seem slow.  If one so desires to sit through it, he/she may fall in love with it the  same way I did.  Beautiful climax!

B00004T9UF|5.0|Not a long time Eminem fan, I was hesitant at first to buy this CD. I  really liked his first album, the Slim Shady LP, but like so many other  rappers, I was afraid Em would fall victim to the &quot;second album  curse.&quot;  Nothing could be farther from the truth. I consider myself to  be more into jam bands than hip-hop and rap, yet this CD has seen more  play-time in my stereo than any album I've ever purchased. To any and all  naysayers, I say listen to the whole album all the way through before  passing judgement. You won't be disappointed. By far one of the best all  around albums in my entire collection!
B000002GWJ|5.0|I've only started listening to Tom recently and I bought 'Mule Variations', 'Franks Wild Years', 'Small Change' and 'Blue Valentine' on  the weekend (they're only $10 each - God bless Australia!) 'Mule  Variations' I brought straight back, I'm not to fond of his  croaky-voodoo-shaman persona, although I like 'Franks...' for the track  'Temptation'. Anyway I'm detracting from the point. Of them all, 'Blue  Valentine' is my favourite. The cover is extremely cheesy, but the tracks  are first class.  'Red Shoes..' has very eerie lyrics whispered over a  hypnotioc tribal beat, and 'Pretty Little Bullet..' (my personal fave) and  'Romeo Is Bleeding' are both upbeat jazz tunes with hummable basslines that  are more fleshed out than the sparse piano arrangements on 'Small Change'.  I hope this review proves helpful to someone, as I know how tricky it is to  try and buy a quality album from an artist like Tom, who has so many, and  so varied, albums.
B000002UAR|5.0|Yes, this *is* one of the ten best albums of all time. I don't really need  to go into why this album is so great, everyone else has already said  everything there needs to be said. <br />This is the album that basically made  rock and roll the institution that it is. Which means it would be the  perfect starting point for any rock collection.<br />Look at the CDs in your  collection, throw out all the hair bands, all the teen pop, all the hits of  the 70's and 80's compilations, and all the soundtracks. Then buy this and  start a legitimate rock collection. I used to like bands like Soft Cell  too, but after being exposed to good music (the kind you may think only the  critics like), I turned 180 degrees. Now I can't stand Soft Cell.<br />Why  even mention a band like Soft Cell in a Revolver review? Because the people  that have solid music collections already own this album. The only people  that would now be considering whether or not to buy this would be people  with a frazzled CD collection with filler CDs like Soft Cell.
B00003CWNR|4.0|A good attempt, decidedly so, but no comparison to the depth and enjoyment the book gave. Even though John Irving wrote both the movie script and the  book from which the script was adapted, it has once again been proven that  &quot;Hollywood&quot; can't begin to compare to the written work.  Even  though many of the relationships of the written story were missing from the  movie, the main story was told. Casting was well done, closely adhering to  the characters in the book.<br />If you want to enjoy an adventure that will  leave you wanting more, read the book.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul's one of the very first records that started challenging  artists to make proper, full length statements that helped usher in the  album era. And it did so because the songs were all of a higher caliber  (aside for What Goes On) compared to everyone else's regular album tracks.  Six tracks even wound up on the Red Album, and the 11th track (In My Life)  was just voted the greatest song of all time in Mojo magazine. One of the  people that put it at #1 was Brian Wilson, someone who adored this album.  That should account for something.<br />So is this essential? Easily. This is  not only an essential Beatle album, but an essential rock and roll album.  <br />Although I will say this, the Beatles' run of classics (Revolver through  Abbey Road) all trounce this. This is a classic album, and it is deserving  of a 5 star mark, but this is not a run away classic like the other Beatle  albums. So don't expect that. <br />It might be a good starting point for a  Beatles collection, it's got a lot of the sophisticated music of their  later years (Nowhere Man, In My Life) while still harking back to their  Beatlemania (The Word, Run For Your Life) days.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Everything Sarah Brightman creates is profound. &quot;Eden&quot; is  another exquisite recording. The track EDEN is actually a cover of the  Hooverphonic song, Sarah's version is so much more emotional and moving.  She has some classical opera selections in this recording, some are  contemporized and some are performed traditionally, both are enthralling  and perfect as are all of the other selections.
B00000I8BX|5.0|I was never really into Fear Factory until a friend introduced me to this  album.  I noticed how Obsolete was more melodic than pure heaviness, like  Soul was, and it featured much more sampling and sound effects as well.   Well I personally think Fear's conducted experiment in sounds was a  success, I thought it was awesome.  I was literally jumping to the heavy  beats of songs like Shock, Edgecrusher, and Messiah.  And Resurrection was  such a powerful, soaring track, it almost made me cry (seriously!).  And  the theme was really deep, I loved the story they put the album to. So  basically, it was all incredible.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the Best Megadeth album. If u like Metal Music, u can give this  album. I am an Argentinian Megadeth fan, and the number 1 on my country. My  favourites songs are Holy Wars, Tornado of Souls and Hangar 18. If u love  Megadeth, u love Rust in Peace.
0871359448|5.0|Oops, half the universe's population just disappeared! Doctor Doom on the  same side as the Avengers? Where is the Fantastic Four? All this and more  in one of the best graphic novels I have ever bought. It contains all the  Infinity Gauntlet issues and even the covers.
6302797586|5.0|I remember watching this on TV with my dad, now long passed away. At first I didn't know what to make of Anthony Hopkins, but by the time the last  installment ended, he totally blew me away. I've been his devoted fan ever  since, never disappointed. I'd like a copy of QB VII. The studio should  re-release it at a reasonable price. They'd make a bundle. This was one of  the greatest dramas ever to appear on TV.
B000001FI7|4.0|When I first listened to Portishead, I was totally enticed by the sound,  Beth Gibbons' vocal, the arrangement, it sounds much creepier than Massive  Attack. So, that was called 'Trip-Hop', the term was not even invented at  that time I suppose, it wasn't until Tricky got famous, correct me if I am  wrong. All have been said by the rest of reviewers, I dont want to make  this a long review. Just slip this into your CD player and you will find  yourself cannot live without it.
0380730405|5.0|This is definetly one of the best books I've ever read. I just couldn't  put it down. I'm usually not the fastest reader, but I finished this in  less than 3 days! If you like romance and suspense, you should definetly  read this classic.
B000003S5H|4.0|I enjoy listening to this, although this is just electronic music, no big  deal. This is enjoyable, realy! I love listening to this, yeah,although I  am the only one who thinks 'Virgin Suicide'is better than this one, this is  music you can listen to days and nights without getting sick of it.  Actually, only a few albums managed to do that to me, Portishead's 'Dummy',  Dimitri From Paris' 'Sacred Bleu', Morcheeba's 'Big Calm' 'Fantastic  Plastic Machine' and all the albums from Cocteau Twins, of course, with the  exception of Portishead and Cocteau Twins, the rest are in no way  considered as classics. However, they are candy to the ears, that's why I  like them.
6301543408|5.0|This is one of my favorite Trek films, second only to The Motion Picture. Everyone thought it has really cheap effects, but this film was released in  the summer of '89, in which more films were squeezed into theatres than  ever before, which meant ILM had tons of films to give special effects to,  and they couldn't be first rate for Star Trek V. So, they had to recycle  effects shots from the other 4 films as much as possible. Shatner still did  a superb job directing it. It has a great plot, and he made the film very  reminiscent to the series, such as Spock, Bones, and Kirk going down to  investigate the planet they are orbiting, in this case, Sha Ka Ree.
B00003Q43A|4.0|&quot;Citizen Cane&quot; its not! The acting ranges from good to Good God! It would take a crane to suspend enough disbelief to buy the story line and  the corny ultra patriotism was a bit much at times.....but.......I really  liked it! It is big, loud, flashy and designed to appeal to the part of our  brains that love Big Macs and ice cream. It is not an art film, there is  nothing subtle or understated about it. It hits you right in the face from  the first minuet and never slows down. So take off your suit and tie,  butter a BIG sack of popcorn and just let it wash over you.
0679882820|5.0|Like many Seuss books, this &quot;Mr Brown Can Moo ...&quot; is pretty fun.  The illustrations are very basic, which is great because it lets you  -- and eventually your child -- focus on making the many sounds Mr Brown  can do.  At the end of the book is a &quot;review&quot; page.  Because the  sounds are in different colors and fonts, your child can easily identify  which one he/she wants you to say.<br />Also recommended are &quot;The Shape  of Me and Other Stuff [...]&quot; for the visual representation and  &quot;One Fish, Two Fish&quot; because it's got a wide variety of cute  stories you and your child will enjoy.
B000009EAD|4.0|It's obvious it's time for metal to grow.  The NWOBHM albums of the  eighties, although incredible, sound dated today with their fuzzy guitar  sounds.  The thrash acts like Slayer and Anthrax introduced us to crushing  distortion and thundering bass.  However, the thrash genre has grown into  death and black metal, which, simply put, will never become the music that  fills arenas.  It's too extreme.  What Iced Earth has finally accomplished  is taking the brutal guitar sound and meshing melodic vocals with it.  They  aren't the most talented or creative, but they've created a sound that all  metalheads can get into and will be the defining band of the next wave of  metal.  The songs on the album are good, but the striking thing is that  they are crushing and sweetly melodic at the same time, something that  bands like Morbid Angel will never do.  If you're wanting something that  gives new life to heavy metal, get this album.  It surely will not  disappoint.  All we need is a Glenn-and-KK quality guitar team, and metal  will own the next decade.
0671034065|5.0|I picked up Linda Howard's Mr. Perfect, because the title of the book  caught my eye.  Having been a fan of the mystery genre for quite some time  now, I was looking for a new author to discover.  Mr. Perfect combines the  three elements that I like in a novel:  comedy, suspense and a love  interest.  I had never read any of Ms. Howard's novels before but I intend  to go back and discover this author. I liked the chemistry between Sam and  Jaine.  I particularly liked Sam's character:  roughneck but very caring  and sensitive.  Jaine reminds me a lot of myself.  I often have to put a  quarter in the cuss can at work for swearing. As for the plot of the story  I couldn't decide whether I wanted to read more about Sam and Jaine or find  out who the killer was.  I found myself taking Mr. Perfect to the bathroom,  to the kitchen and even got caught reading it while I was supposed to be  working.  I couldn't put the book down.  I hope to see more of Sam and  Jaine in the future and look forward to reading more Linda Howard.
B0000025YM|4.0|For some reason, I posted in my earlier review that this album is less than phenomenal.  Please forgive me.  If you take this album and spin in a good stereo (which I did not have at the time) and crank the volume WAY the  heck up, this album is a thundering metal masterpiece!  The first 4 tracks  will drive you into oblivion!  Almost all the songs on this album are metal classics.  I don't much care for &quot;Some Heads are Gonna  Roll&quot; or &quot;Heavy Duty.&quot;  However, they are still good songs,  just not much my cup of tea.  Let me put it simply:  if you don't own this  album, you're NOT a heavy metal fan.
B000002AH7|5.0|though music now days seems to focus much more on the artist and the  persona of the artist as opposed to the art that they are producing (or, as  is the case with so many musicians today the art they should be producing),  i think it is very heartening to know that it has not always been like  this.  example number one would be miles davis. example number one of miles  davis' art would have to be 'sketches'. listening to this music late at  night in a dark room with headphones on as the street outside slowly lets  cars pass through its streetlights with the trees blowing in the wind as  miles hits his marks so many times on this ablum, you really find out fast  what true music is supposed to be about.  this is true music.
6305949638|3.0|This movie has so many bad messages that I don't know where to start. So I guess I'll start at it's worst one. Abortion.     This movie was the  perfect chance to show how bad it is. But it is glorified instead. And it  doesn't end there. Premarital sex, lies, and incest also ruin this film. It  should have been rated R for a scene of sexuality. The only reason it has  three stars is because of the quality of the film.
0783117388|5.0|Brilliant writing, brilliant acting, have watched all three tapes about thirty times and still find new laughs. Buy this set.
B00004THAY|5.0|This CD is so wonderful... I just started working in a record store when  it came out, and after we played it in the store for the first time I knew  I had to have it... I have been lucky enough to experince B.B. King in  concert here in Denmark when he played a &quot;Rock Legends&quot; concert  with Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. This man is amazing,  totally cool. It like Eric Clapton to, but the King is the King... The CD  should be in every collection, take it out when you just want to chill to  some great music. It will blow you away...
6305075379|5.0|Considering Mad Max was only both Mel Gibson and the director/producer team of George Miller and (the late)Byron Kennedy's second movie this is  truely a modern classic. Filmed on a shoestring budget this movie became  the most profitable movie ever at the time,check The Guiness Book of  Records. Not much diologue but plenty of action means that you will be  engrossed in the movie.All I can say is if you live in the US try and get  old of an old laser disc copy,which the original Aussie dialogue,get a VHS  copy from Australia or wait and see if MGM releases the original version in  the States later this year! I hear an undubbed version is doing the rounds  at selected cinemas in the US now. Go check it out!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I really enjoy this CD. It is so much better than the Baby one more time CD. Dont get me wrong, I loved the first CD, but I just like this one  better. Its much more upbeat, the lyrics are better and you can tell that  Britney has grown. I love Britney, I think she is great and I will continue  to enjoy her music. But dont listen to me or anyone else, check it out  yourself... There are SO many different oppinions on Britney, so you can  only really trust your own...
B00004YA66|5.0|Like I said, &quot;Frequency&quot; has it all: suspense, action, drama, an overall good plot, and great acting. It's great for anyone who likes movies  that you have to follow start to finish, and it'll definitely keep your  interest!~ So, in closing, I urge of you: Watch this movie! That is all...  :)
B000002J6H|5.0|How on earth can anybody justify saying that Stephen Stills in not  accomplished?  That just plain does not add up.<br />Stephen Stills is a  composer/singer/guitarist of extraordinarily high caliber and I sure hope  CSN do a concert in my town.  I have seen them twice in concert and believe  me, they do not disappoint.  The rich harmonies, the beautiful blending of  voices and gentle guitar -- I just can't understand how on earth anyone  could say Stephen Stills is not accomplished.  I honestly believe this trio  is nonpareil, in a class by themselves marked by their excellence in  performance.  I defy ANYBODY to just try listening to &quot;Churc&quot; and  &quot;Cherokee&quot; and not liking these beautiful songs.  Stephen Stills  sounds great solo and he sounds great as one third of the world's best  band.  Nobody has a voice to match Stephen Stills!  He is wonderful!<br />I  LOVE CROSBY, STILLS &amp; NASH!  THEY ARE MY FAVORITES!
B00003CXFU|5.0|Julia Roberts certainly made this film her own in the title role, but Albert Finney should not be overlooked in his excellent supporting role as  Ed Masry.<br />Interestingly, while the film centers on a major lawsuit, there  are no courtroom scenes presented in connection with it.  All of that is  carried out through interpersonal relations, and carried out well, indeed.   For me, that was a refreshing touch.  As a federal judge, I appreciate not  having to take a bussman's holiday.  Plus, I often have problems with  courtroom scenes, and not infrequently find myself shouting at the screen,  &quot;Object you dummy, he's leading the witness!&quot;<br />Instead, this  film, through the Julia Roberts character, presents the very human side of  this legal controversy, which, unfortunately, may sometimes be missed by  those of us on the other side of the bench.<br />Score this film very high on  the &quot;feel-good&quot; scale.
6304258984|5.0|This movie is 1 of my favorites of all time!  It's great &amp; it has a good plot, which can sometimes be hard to find in action movies.  All the  actors do a great job!  The action is top notch!  Nicolas Cage was awesome  &amp; amazing in this movie.  They could have made him a normal guy whos  caught in a situation.  But instead the made him a loser, who happens to  win.  I say that because you could tell he wasn't a tough guy.  Nicolas  Cage was a bit of a wimp in this 1.  Which was very entertaining to watch.   I loved his character!  Sean Connery is very true to the role of John  Mason.  There was a lota chemistry amounst the characters, especially  between Cage &amp; Connery.  They played off each other very well.  Don't  get me wrong, the rest of the cast does an extremly great job.  This is a  movie I'd definitly recommend to everyone!

0780626494|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be a straight-up comedy along the lines of ENCINO MAN.  I had no idea it had any romantic themes running through it.   This movie was different than I was expecting, but it also exceeded my  expectations.<br />Brendan Fraser as Adam, a man entering the &quot;real  world&quot; for the first time after being born in a bomb shelter and  living there for 35 years, pulls off a brilliant performance.  Christopher  Walken (who happens to be extremely underexposed, IMHO) does a great job as  his dad.  Then there's Alicia Silverstone.  I think this is the best  performance she's ever given.  The onscreen chemistry between her and  Fraser is just great.<br />Yes, this movie was a bit predictable in places,  but the scenes were so well done that it didn't ruin them.  They took an  idea that seemed kind of formulaic and made it into something that is very  fun to watch.  If you're looking for a good romantic comedy, this is it!
B0000025H4|5.0|This was Priest in their glory years, a virtual live &quot;best of&quot;  document covering material from Sad Wings through Hell Bent For Leather.  Power, precision and sheer heaviness made them the best metal act of the  mid to late 70's. Many of these live renditions outdo the original studio  versions. Priest showed everyone how it was done, awesome, duling lead  guitar and Rob Halford THE metal vocalist.My only dissapointment is that  they have yet to re-master this and include (domestically) the extra cuts  that appeared on the original Japanese vinyl version.
0767903854|5.0|This is the first Bryson book I've ever read, and I don't see any evidence  of this author getting too big for his britches. If you want to see an  example of ego run rampant, read one of Robert Hughes latest works -  &quot;Return to the Fatal Shore&quot;.<br />Anyway, Bryson seems to be  emphasising parts of Australia that even we Aussies have never heard of  before. What's amazing is how Bryson can visit places and sights we take  for granted, and make them seem so interesting. <br />His sense of humour  seems to be a cross between Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams. He does give  a fair amount of attention to the plight of our indigeneous Aboriginal  Australians, not to mention the racism and prejudice that still exist  today. Witness his disturbing encounter with an elderly gentleman on board  an express train. He also gives a (mercifully) brief mention to Pauline  Hanson, which he describes as &quot;cerebrally challenged&quot;. I couldn't  agree more! Although I think the Northern Territory has superseded  Queensland as being &quot;madder than cut snakes&quot;!<br />My only regret is  that he didn't have enough time to visit Tasmania. I was born in Tassie,  and I think he would've been absolutely stunned at the huge difference  between the mainland's dry outback, and Tasmania's lush, cool forest  (what's left of it, anyway). I think Tassie is the world's best kept  secret. Whether he would've enjoyed the laidback, uneventful lifestyle is  another matter.<br />I've noticed that some have accused him of favouritism,  that his affection for our country has coloured his judgement. The answer I  give is, if he likes to visit a country, why shouldn't he be allowed to say  so?
B000002AGB|3.0|I'm going to have to agree with those who say that this is no &quot;Live  at Leeds.&quot;  Pete Townshend's guitar, after &quot;Young Man's  Blues,&quot; starts sounding puny, and although he's never been known as a  great lead guitarist, his playing here is extremely choppy.  John  Entwhistle and Keith Moon are enjoyable throughout, though, and Roger  Daltrey sounds fine.  Generally speaking, though, the whole band meanders  and doesn't seem to quite have it together.  The first three songs are  still incredible, though, and you get to here how they pulled  &quot;Tommy&quot; off in person.  If you're a Who fan, get it, but don't be  without &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; to hear the REAL deal.
B00000IMCW|5.0|I'm sure those who enjoy &quot;modern&quot; horror movies had a hard time understanding this picture. It didn't have a bunch of Dawson's Creek pretty  boys or Buffy babes, an impossible to kill psycho with a white mask, a plot  that could be understood inbetween making out with your girlfriend and a  dozen trips to the bathroom, and it certainly doesn't have a stupid,  irrational plot twist at the end that makes the film unenjoyable after more  than one viewing! When you think about the premace of this film, you must  consider the extreme survival conditions the four fugitives had to overcome  and the moral judgements they made such as stealing the chopper, breaking  into the mall, and considering aborting a baby. The personal conflicts  between the characters mixed with the terror of a world filled with flesh  eating zombies creates a tense, horrific, and in some ways realistic, end  of the world scenario. This film is graphic and for it's time, it was well  done. I'd take this film over any of the so-called &quot;modern&quot;  horror films of the 90's. If you want brainless babes and beach boys  running from a GQ model in a cheap costume, this isn't the film for you!
B000002I57|5.0|Milt Jackson and John Coltrane are two great players with different  styles.  Coltrane's harsh attacking sound and Milt's mellow groove are in  perfect sync on the recording.  This record shows that two completely  different players can play together and make great music.
6300214710|5.0|John Hughes wrote this story about Andie (Molly Ringwald), the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who has two admires - her best friend, and a  rich guy. She does not exactly fit in with the guy of her dreams or his  popular, rich crowd. And the guy who admires her most, her best friend  who's in the same clique as she, is not the one she wants. Her father  cannot find a job and is still holding onto the memory of her mother, who  left when she was fourteen. Life seems horrible, and she is deeply  confused. She wants the guy she likes, but she doesn't want to loose her  best friend in the process. The fact that she is being harassed by the  popular girls because she is not rich enough makes life worse. But soon she  comes to realize that everything works itself out in time.
B00003CXIY|5.0|If you Notice in the list of actors at the top there is no Tom Green.  Tom Green is the main reason many people went to the theaters and paid $8.50 a  person six times to see the movie.  Any movie with Tom Green is going to be  an excellent movie and this is no exception.  Anything that could happen to  these guys trying to save their friend from letting his girlfriend, who  lives over a thousand miles away, see a sex tape he made with another girl.   It really is a great movie.  Just do not forget about Tom.
B00000JYGX|5.0|WOW!!!!   This soundtrack is truly amazing.  I spent Spring semester  studying in Paris and was lucky enough to see this musical performed live  in all its glory.  I go to the theater often, and I can honestly say that  this is the best show I've ever seen.  Of course, I love the french  language, and these songs not only use beautiful french, but they also  portray a story that is hauntingly familiar. A more perfect cast could not  have been picked for this show--from Helene Segara to Bruno Pelletier (my  personal favorite), these characters are imbued with deep feelings that  come across in the music.  Both the lyrics and the instrumental  compositions are genius! What's also great is that the 2 cds come with a  booklet that shows pictures from the performance.  You don't even need to  see the show to appreciate it!! ---by the way---for those who are  interested, the english version doesn't even compare.  I know that the show  was playing in english in Las Vegas at the Paris hotel, but once you've  heard the origianl soundtrack, seeing the translated version isn't worth  the time!
B000000H5K|5.0|The music on this CD defies categorization - of course, it is metal, but  it is also so much more! Tell me, dear friend, have you ever heard another  album of such primal heaviness, such stunning virtuosity? I didn't think  so. I never thought that Sepultura could ever create another album to match  Arise, but Roots is every bit the equal of Arise and perhaps even more. The  fusion of indigenous Brazilian music and metal works beautifully. I don't  even want to mention individual songs - suffice it to say, that most of the  songs on this CD are masterpieces. As always, the brothers Cavalera deliver  virtuoso performances - Igor's drums have never sounded better. That  Sepultura could have reached their creative peak with Roots, then have Max  leave the band soon thereafter, was more than many could bear. Loyal  Sepultura fans can only hope that Max and the band will someday resolve  their differences. Until then, at least we have Roots and all that came  before it.
1559408898|4.0|It was a pleasure re-discovering Robocop on DVD.  Okay, some of the special effects are a little creaky by today's standards, but that's not  important.  As I felt when I originally saw the movie in theaters back in  '87, the film effectively combines knowing, cynical humor (usually directed  at the structures of modern society) with a terrific adventure story.  Later films by Paul Verhoeven didn't achieve quite as successful a balance  between satire and good story-telling (I'm thinking of how the director  dressed Neil Patrick Harris, one of the GOOD GUYS in Starship Troopers, in  a Nazi-like uniform at the end of that film, effectively confusing or  depressing the entire audience), but all the various layers co-mingle  nicely in Robocop.  The social commentary and satiric asides are firmly in  place for those who want to see them, but they never undercut a gripping,  involving (and, yes, at times very violent) good guys/bad guys story.  The  musical score by Basil Poledouris is wonderful, too: there's a memorable  main heroic theme, but also several moody and complex sub-themes that  illuminate the complexities of the main character.  The Criterion DVD is  loaded with extras, including a long, detailed article about all aspects of  the films's production.  It may be going a little far to call Robocop the  &quot;greatest science fiction film since Metropolis&quot;, as Ken Russell  is quoted as saying on the back of the box, but the movie IS undeniably in  the upper reaches of the genre.  And damned fun to watch, too.
0316777722|5.0|I have always been an avid reader of David Sedaris since I first went to a  live reading of his at my University auditorium. His true-to-life stories  always make me chuckle; his poignant and descriptive narrative is very  relative to what my peers and I experienced growing up in the 80's. I  highly recommend the text to any new reader of Sedaris' work. The chapters  are short and always keep your attention. Enjoy! and T'amuse bien! (have  fun!)
6305537313|5.0|I was surprised at the number of reviews that state that this is a lighthearted, airy, feel-good comedy.  I actually found it very dark.   Peeling away the layers of the airiness of the feel (remember, this was  written by Truman Capote), you actually get a very complex story and  commentary on the emptiness of life.  This is one of my favorite movies for  that very reason.
B00000JMQC|5.0|a line not unknown to those who have seen the movie.  This is what Oz should have been in the first movie, grim, creepy and still an enchanting  place you'd love to visit. It certainly clashes with the first movie and  most, if not all, of the cartoon-series made about the wonderfull land of  Oz.<br />This movie was ignored when it first came out, people complained it  was too dark and too depressing to be an Oz-movie. Oz symbolised a whole  world made for little children who could smile while watching a happy,  colorfull, world in which animals could talk and fairies and witches ruled  the corners, a world in which only happy things could happen. Not the  gloomy realistic and almost nightmarish world presented in this  sequal...<br />A pity, because the acting is done superb, Fairuza Balk showed  that even as a ten-year old girl she had what it took to become a serious  actress. She is the perfect Dorothy Gale, young and innocent and most of  all, convincing. Her magical friends are funny and you actually feel sorry  for poor Jack Pumpkinhead when seeing him. The villains are creepy and just  plain evil.  The really young children might even have nightmares after  seeing the evil princess Mombi and her rather unusual collection, or the  Gnome King and his evil plans for Oz.  The special effex might not be  computer-animated, state of the art special effect we are used to seeing  nowadays, they are still enchanting enough to have you stuck to the screen  begging for more. <br />This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen,  it might not be what you expect from an Oz movie, but it will certainly  leave an impression on you.  This is how Oz was meant to be in the first  place.
6305066345|4.0|He's Got Game was a good movie.  Powerful storyline about a strained Father/Son relationship.  The only problem I had with it were the sex  scenes, which I feel were completely unnecessary.  And too much cursing was  going on.<br />Otherwise, it nearly brought me to tears, and the actors were  wonderful.  Denzel is so good at immersing himself completely into his  characters.  Good job!
B00003CWNR|4.0|THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a movie that could have been made in the 1940s, starring Gene Tierney and Montgomery Clift.  I found it fascinating that  Hollywood would turn out a movie like this these days--an absorbing  character study of several complex personalities in an unusual setting.   Unlike the reviewers who have written their reviews before me, I think the  &quot;abortion&quot; issue was extremely well done because it was not used  for preachiness but for character development.  Except for a few moments  when the movie lagged a bit, it was certainly one of the most  &quot;absorbing&quot; movies lately released, and that's why it has that  relentless drive of the better movies of the 1940s.  I bought this DVD  because Leonard Maltin gave it four stars, and whenever he gives four stars  to any movie, I've never ever been disappointed when I viewed it.  I don't  really agree with Maltin that this is one of the greatest movies ever made  (which is the category I keep for my own five star reviews on Amazon), but  it is certainly a beautiful blend of story, cinematography, setting,  character development, superb ensemble acting, a sure hand at the  directorial chair, a good score, wonderful story development through the  titles (a sure sign of a careful film!), and almost, but not quite, superb  editing.  And welcome back, Michael Caine and Kate Nelligan--two of the  greatest actors of our era, still going strong in roles that are wonderful  for them!  Bottom line: you will like it and maybe even treasure it.
B00004TWZG|4.0|I love this movie and own both The Professional and Leon - The Professional (Uncut International Version) on DVD.  In comparison, the  added 24 minutes was well worth it.   Only one problem with the DVD uncut  version.  The rear speakers when using DD 5.1 is muted or close to  non-existent.  The Dolby Pro-logic works fine though.  The 1st DVD  &quot;The Professional&quot; Cut version actually works fine using DD  5.1.<br />Many other people on forums and newsgroups have reported this and is  most likely an error during the mastering of the DVD.<br />Other than the  sound problem on the uncut version, it's a great movie.
0451160916|4.0|I had been putting off reading this novel along with The Dead Zone and Carrie mainly because I've seen the movies, but also because I realize King  was at his peak during the 70's and early 80's, and I was in essence  rationing them the same way a man in a desert might save the last few drops  of water in his canteen.<br />Last year was The Dead Zone, and now I just  finished The Shining.  As familiar as I was with the story -- from the two  filmed versions -- the book was still entertaining, as I knew it would be.   However, as a lifelong King fan (having read Salem's Lot twenty years ago  at age 13), I have to finally admit that King is definitely a racist, at  least when he writes.  A black person in his books is constantly referred  to as N----, you know the word.  This would be fine if the story were about  prejudice or something, but he seems to merely use it as characterization.   Admittedly, the black cook Halloran is the most likeable character in this  book, and I realize King created that character, but he's likable in spite  of the n-word references not because of them.  As for the Wendy  character....god, was I the only one who wanted to see Jack get her with  the mallet?  A constant whiner.<br />It took the book about 200 pages to  finally get moving (I shouldn't complain; if he wrote this book today it  would be well over 800 pages), but the last 250 pages zipped along and  there were several spooky scenes, many involving the hedge creatures  featured in the TV miniseries, but not the movie.  Speaking of the  miniseries, I was hoping -- expecting, actually -- that since it was  reportedly a much closer adaption to the book than Kubrick's film, it would  have Jack fighting off the force that was controlling him and making sure  the boiler blew up.  But Jack was already gone by then, possessed by the  hotel, and I felt kind of cheated by this.  I liked the miniseries ending  much more, since the Jack Torrance character didn't simply disappear as he  didin the book.<br />This books seems to be not as well written as King's  others in the sense of grammar, etc. although not storytelling.  One  clunker sentence really caught my attention:  &quot;A nightmare flood of  thoughts flooding through his mind in a split second.&quot;  Still, this  was King during his heyday, and now I have only one drop of water left --  Carrie.  And when I eventually swallow it, what then...?
B000000OAH|4.0|Let's face it, nothing by Queen deserves under four stars, and this album  is no exception. While not the shining crown jewel of their collection,  it's still not one that any Queen collection should lack. Highlights are  Mustapha, Fat Bottomed Girls, Jealousy, Bicycle Race, If You Can't Beat  Them, Let Me Entertain you, In Only Seven Days, Fun It, and Don't Stop Me  Now. Ok, I know that I just named all but four songs on the entire album,  but hey, what can I say? :) So none of the songs ever really became  mega-hits, but they are in  no way substandard. <br />If you want love songs,  Jealousy is a soft, sweet song with flawless vocals from Freddie. If you  want rock, pick either Let Me Entertain you, a saucy song that is quite  perfect, because Queen were the ultimate entertainers, or Don't Stop Me  Now, a fast-paced song that is basically about a fast-paced life. For one  of Queen's first ventures into funk, go for Fun It, with a groove like no  other song on the album. For camp of a kind that only Queen can produce,  tune your ears to Fat Bottomed Girls or Bicycle Race, which are almost pure  camp. And of course, if you want something to sort of uplift you, try  heading for If You Can't Beat Them. It doesn't exactly have the most  uplifting message in the world, but the pure song will uplift you on it's  own. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's got a lot of different  variaties of music, and is good for just about any mood you might have.
6304578458|4.0|A refreshing delight. Excellent writing and even better casting make this an enjoyable cinematic experience. If you like quirky, different movies,  than check this one out. You'll be glad you did.
B000000OA6|5.0|Who can find words to describe this album?!? I can only find one:  perfection. Of course, that's a word that can describe everything Queen  ever did at any time period, but it applies even more to this album. I was  four years old when this album came out. More than anything, I wish I could  have seen them live, but they had already stopped touring for good when I  was born. I didn't actually give a single hoot about Freddie when he died.  I was annoyed to death with Queen at that point, but what can I say? I  understood about zip of their music. However, unbeknowest to me, they have  set the soundtrack for my entire life.<br />Anyway, back to Innuendo.  Tear-jerkers and insanity and hard-rockers and songs that I can't  catoragise fill Innuendo to the brim. It includes some of Queen's finest  work ever. No one who calls themself a Queen fan should live without this  album in their possession. It would be simply criminal.
B00003CWN2|4.0|If you are faint of heart or only think movies should have pat and happy endings, then stay the hell away from &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;<br />If  you're up for something a little darker and more realistic, you will be  awed and humbled by this movie. Like a great greek tragedy,  &quot;Boys&quot; isn't a happy movie, but one that will stick with you for  a long time!
0140288503|5.0|A brilliant telling of a one-day battle where our UN soldiers in Africa  are pitted against the unspeakably evil factions that rule poverty-stricken  Mogadishu, Somalia.  Author Bowden manages to embrace and hold a multitude  of terrifying moments that ultimately merge and grow into hours of  fighting.   It is the result of a small-scale action that unexpectedly  erupts into violence by the slimmest of margins.  An action that grows to a  full-scale battle that rapidly expands to one of impossible odds against  our tiny forces. <br />The battle's progress is poignantly shaped by the  unwillingness of the American soldiers to fire into the developing threat  areas for fear of hitting women and children.  However, the opposing tribal  soldiers show no qualms at all against using Mogadishu's innocent citizens  as shields and decoys as they attempt to close on the tiny handful of  defenders.  That unwillingness to hurt the innocent, cost the lives of some  of the defenders.  This work, vivid and forceful, is an unrelenting  cliffhanger. <br /> In writing this account, Bowden insists on the need for  unflagging accuracy, resulting in a milestone work, --- a cogent and  forceful lesson for all.  It is a close-up zoom into the lives of a people  that are poor, where existence is their only priority.  It is also must  reading for the politicians who insist on solving all world problems by  imposing the American way. <br />But, most of all, it is a stirring and  resounding tribute, a salute to our superb Rangers and supremely skilled  Delta and Seal teams.<br />This is journalism at its very best.
0375703764|5.0|I am still asking myself what the heck this book is about. In the almost two months since actually reading it, whenever I happen to glance at it on  my bookshelf I feel this urge to pick it up, open it, and flip through  it.<br />Just to see if anything has changed.<br />I don't usually critique  something from a personal standpoint, but House of Leaves is, well, a  personal story. Everyone I have spoken with about it, felt that it touched  something deep within them, and yet they cannot quite figure out what that  is.<br />How to describe House of Leaves? I don't even know the genre. It's a  mix of horror and mystery, and some sort of strange hybrid of accadamia.  House of Leaves is narrated by a guy named Johnny Truant, living in LA,  working in a tattoo parlor, just doing his thing, like the rest of us. He  finds a book, (I won't go into all the details of how he finds it), called  the Navidson Record, which is an academic critisism of a film of the same  name. The film, a documantary shot on film and video in black and white, is  the chronicle of Will Navidson and his family's move to a North Carolina  house. Navidson, a Pulitzer prize winning photo-journalist decides to  document the move by setting up cameras all over the house. <br />At first  everything seems fine, but....hey, where did that door come from? Yes, one  morning, Will discoveres a door where there was no door the day before. It  should lead outside, but it does not. Instead it leads into a labrynth, a  maze of endless corridors and spiral staircases, and one really scary  howl.<br />Not too mention, the house is about an eight of an inch longer  inside than it is outside.<br />Now, if this novel was written by Stephen King  or any of his ilk, it may have been a good old fashioned scare-fest. It  would have kept you up at night and got you to turning the pages faster and  faster. But....House of Leaves is not Stephen King. Or should I say it is,  run through a shreader and then taped back together, just a bit out of  order. Much of the novel is straitforward, and much is itself a maze of  words that run backwards or upside down on the page. Some pages have only  one or two lines which run diaganol or in a spiral. Then there are  footnotes, some are interesting, adding new pieces of information to the  already complex story. Others, are unnecessary to actually read, but add  flavor to the novel. In addition, this is a book within a book. We read the  Navidson Record, just as Johnny does, but also see and hear and read is  reactions to it. Through his own footnotes we get a glimpse into his story,  his life. (Wait til you get to the Pekinese, it'll absolutely devestate  you).<br />All this might sound as if it is mearly for effect. It is. And it  works. Somehow, it got to me. And on an extremely personal level. The novel  haunted me. Even the boring parts, and there are plenty of those, got to  me. There is a method in Mark Z. Danielewski's style which you don't quite  understand until the book is over.<br />So what is this book about? Really? I  don't know. I may have to read it again. I think it is about change, the  mercurial quality of life. The fact that sometimes things happen and you  cannot understand why or how or what will happen.<br />One night, I called a  friend and we discussed the book. We started noticing things. I would say,  &quot;Look on page 321, now look at 253, look at how that's written here  and here.&quot; And we'd figure something else out. It was as if the author  had presented us the case, and now we were finding our own clues that had  been hidden, strewn, throughout the novel.<br />One last note. My copy of  House of Leaves has started falling apart. It has changed much like the  house that the Navidson's moved into changed. I told my friend. He said  that his book was falling apart in the same way. And his friend's book too.  And so on. Creepy ain't it?
0449227421|3.0|His earlier books are much better.  Read &quot;Man from St.  Petersburg&quot; or the &quot;Key to Rebecca&quot;.  This book was a  departure from Follett's other espionage books in that he went into all the  modern biotechnology.  This book was decent, but a lot of it was definitely  spoiled for me by the fact that I had seen the X-Files episode  &quot;Eve&quot;, which predated this book.  Concept didn't really didn't  seem that ingenious to me then.<br />I have yet to read any of Follett's epics  yet, such as &quot;A Place Called Freedom&quot; or &quot;Dangerous  Fortunes&quot; but I am willing to give them a try.  Hope he tackles those  well.
0894803123|5.0|This is an excellent book with many simple to follow recipes. Wonderful  for cooks without much time. All the basics and lots of variations  too.<br />There isn't much on technique/troubleshooting or background, go to   Ice Cream! The Whole Scoop by Gail Damerow for that, but it does contain a  LARGE assortment of &quot;everyday&quot; recipes that you'll use again and  again.  Their fresh Cantaloupe Ice Cream, Mocha and Health Bar Crunch are  just a few of our favorites. <br />Definitely one of the best practical  cookbooks on ice cream.

B000001DYD|5.0|When I bought this album a couple of months ago, I could easily see why  some people--even die-hard PJ fans--didn't like it. It has an experimental  feel to it, strikes tons of discordant notes, and overall gives the  listener a headache. I listened to it a few times, decided I liked it (but  more or less just because it was PJ), then put it up. Less than 24 hours  ago, I stumbled across a website that had all the lyrics to all PJ's songs  posted, so I read the lyrics for the songs on Rid of Me. Since then, I've  realized this album is brilliant. The reason I didn't care for it as much  as her others was because I couldn't figure out what the heck she was  saying, and it's always been her lyrics that drew me in most (who could not  be affected by lines like &quot;God is the sweat running down his back/the  water soaked her blond hair black&quot; or &quot;Til the light shines on  me/I damn to hell every second you breathe&quot;?). I've been listening to  Rid of Me non-stop since then, and wow, I'm impressed. There's a raw edge  to these tracks that has been blunted (slightly) in the last two albums,  and an intensity and fire that the lyrics really bring home.  &quot;Me-Jane,&quot; &quot;Man-Size,&quot; &quot;50 Ft. Queenie,&quot;  &quot;Snake,&quot; all the songs really, blazed to brilliance once I  understood what was being sung. Rid of Me is rapidly becoming my favorite  PJ album because of it. It still feels experimental and it still strikes  discordant notes, but all that seems to make more sense now. It still gives  me a headache, too, but I'd rather have a PJ-induced headache than live  pain free.
B000009ED0|4.0|Kid Rock has done something that I would never have thought possible-he  got me into country music (I mostly listen to metal.) Several reviews on  here say that Kid Rock isn't as good as Limp Bizkit or Korn, but that isn't  fair, as he is not comparable to either. The only thing these bands have in  common is the use of hip-hop in their music. Kid Rock blends in country,  which runs rampant throughout the whole cd, but is especially noticeable on  Only God Knows Why and Cowboy. Metal is also a common theme. The extremes  in this case are Fists of Rage and I am the Bullgod. The latter is  a nice  example of a metal anthem. Wastin' Time is probably my favorite on here, as  it blends in blues, country, rap, and metal. Kid Rock also gives an amazing  performance of this song live. This is probably one of my favorite cd's,  and I have hundreds, so that is saying a lot. Also, if you like any music  at all, you should go out and buy Snot's Get Some. They are similar to Kid  Rock, as they also blend many styles of music but somehow come out with an  original sound.
0894803123|5.0|This is a great ice cream book, full of simple no cook - no wait recipes  with ample illustrations to keep your mind alert. The author's sense of  humor makes it a very enjoyable read, but the recepes themselves are the  stars. They share such favorites as Cherry Garcia, Mocha, Health Bar  Crunch, Orange Cream, Kiwi Sorbet, Cantaloupe and Oreo Vanilla.<br />My only  problem with this book is because it was written awhile ago, they are still  using raw eggs in their most popular/recommended ice cream base. Substitute  with a pasterized egg product (Egg Beaters/Better N Eggs) if you aren't  sure of the freshness/safeness of your eggs.
0375501851|4.0|Only another rave review of a remarkable debut. I find it fascinating that  in your review section this book received both high praise and strong  complaints from readers. There is no doubt that Smith is one of the most  talented authors published in many many a year. However, for me, it was at  times a little difficult to wade through all the digressions to get back to  the plot, and the plot was more a slice-of-life type than one with a  resolution. Well, that's life! I found author a mite removed emotionally  from characters although understanding them well. Her humor makes you laugh  when you might rather be crying. I think your first reviewer is correct.  Buy an extra copy to save because this will be a valuable book some day!!!  We readers can hardly wait for your next book, Miss Smith!!
B00004U45G|5.0|To those of you Led Zeppelin fans who were born too late to see them live,  this is a great way to experience the magic of it all.  I was pleased to  find many of the newer, lesser-known hits such as &quot;In my time of  dying,&quot; and &quot;Ten Years Gone,&quot; included in the mix.  As Led  Zeppelin progressed they began to emphasize the blues element that was  already present in their music.  The fact that these songs were chosen  worked out great because Chris Robinson and the Crowes' music is drenched  with a heavy southern blues vibe.  Robinson is just as incoherent as the  infamous Plant, which provides a sense of realism to the experience.  One  thing I missed was conversation in between songs.  The music is great, but  its fun to hear them introduce songs, or explain how the tune came about.   Even so, its a great CD.  Pick it up as soon as you can.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is the best CD I have listened to in a long time.From Drowned World/Substitute For Love to MerGirl, it is Madonna's most ambitious  recording to date. The electronica music I have heard before was bland but  this isn't. It is rich and the way producer William Orbit layered the music  is superb.I strongly recommend this CD. If you are a real Madonna fan,  check out the Video Collection 93:99. It includes videos from the Erotica  album through Ray of Light. It is interesting to see how much Madonna  changed in between.Especially in 'The Power of Goodbye' video. You can  really see a different Madonna shine through. I know she changes her look  periodically but there is an inner change as well (brought on by the birth  of Lourdes,no doubt).
B00000IL1K|5.0|I thought that after &quot;Time to say Goodbye&quot;, there wouldn't be a  better Sarah Brightman CD. But I was WRONG.  I have listened to Eden  countless times, especially at work, and it is exquisite, peaceful and  entertaining all in one.  I don't even care for Sarah's voice that much,  but I adore, adore, adore her style, interpretation and choice of songs.
0671034065|4.0|this is not Linda Howard at her best.  It's a cute book and better than  her last several hardbacks, but this is not up to par with her earlier  books.
B000002VMD|4.0|Whitney impressive vocals and sleek beauty compensate for the fact that  she is a rotten actress.  &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;I  Have Nothing&quot; are two soul-stirring ballads, especially the latter,  which I feel is superior to the former.  David Foster is a producer of some  merit, and knows how to showcase Houston's superb singing with dramatic,  over the top orchestration.  The dance tracks produced by Babyface are  passable, but nothing more.  The non-Houston songs are less than memorable,  and the less said about them, the better.
0393317552|5.0|A book to enjoy, learn, and love. A fascinating book, I read it in one  sit, if you start it you can't live it until you finish it. An excellent  and well documented thesis, with a huge of well founded examples and data.  About the style of writing, it's hard to distinguish if it's a fascinating  novel or a scientific tome, Jared makes feel rigorous history as a tale.  Recomended to everyone, newcomers or scholars.

6305807043|4.0|The first time, I watched this video with my husband.  We had high expectations after hearing the buzz about this movie.  Surprisingly,  neither of us liked it very much.  I'd liked bits and pieces, the puppets  and John Malkovich himself, but I found a lot of the other characters not  likable, especially the Cusack, Diaz and Keenar ones.  I waited two months  and then recently saw it again, this time alone.  It was much improved for  me on this second viewing.  Perhaps being prepared to not like the leads  helped me.  This time, I felt you weren't supposed to particularly like  them, especially Keenar and Cusack.<br /><br />The puppets and puppeteering were  still magnificent; John Malkovich himself was a howl; some bit parts were  very funny, such as the lecherous Orson Bean and the sexually carnivorous  Charlie Sheen, playing himself. The idea itself, of being inside John  Malkovich for fifteen minutes at a time, before being hurled out of him and  onto the New Jersey roadside, was original and brilliant. I really don't  know whether this should be 4 stars or 5 stars.  I guess the fact that some  of you might find three lead characters not likable throughout the movie  makes me keep it down to a 4 as a caution.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0140282033|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book which I had originally purchased  for my wife. She praised it highly, so I thought that I'd read it also. I'm  very happy that I did. The author weaves magic and chocolate into a brew of  life in a small French town, and the reaction of the population to the  arrival of a stranger and her young daughter. Soon a chocolate shop is  opened, and thus begins a silent but none the less deadly war between the  heroine and the local vicar, who is painted as not a very nice person. It's  well done, and has a satisfying ending, with just the right blend to be  called bittersweet. Read it, you'll like it!
B00000IAU3|5.0|All I can say is Dido is an amazing singer! This CD is a definate buy. I  found every song on there to be excellent. I hope she continues with her  career because she has an great voice. This is the most played cd at my  house. I first discovered Dido from her song &quot;Here with Me&quot; on  the show Roswell. After much searching I discovered she sang the song and  immediately ran out to get a copy. I have owned it for about 6months now  and still play it everyday.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone.
1558908846|4.0|I thought it was typical stallone, as one who never really read the comic strip but did play the role playing game (a lot), I thought that the feel  of the world was fairly well captured.  The movie was not as dark as the  role playing game or the little I've seen of the comic strip.  This is  obviously far in the past of the world that the roleplaying game takes  place in as the judges are still human and not yet genetically manipulated  and the weapons and other goodies were not quite as advanced.  I liked the  movie very much and I only wish they had made more than one movie.

6300274195|5.0|Everybody loves Dumbo for all the right reasons - great story with humor and pathos, wonderful music, and delightful animation.  However, no one  seems to have noticed the underlying racial themes that fuel the plot.   Dumbo's mom, and the other female elephants she lives and works with, are  all Indian elephants (small ears).  Dumbo's dad (Jumbo), from whom he must  have inherited his big ears, must have been African.  Dumbo (and his  mother) were mocked and ultimately ostracized from decent elephant society  because he was the product of a mixed marriage.   Only after he learns  (with the help of those zoot-suited, jive-talkin' crows)  to use his  physical &quot;defect&quot; to excel at something (flying) is he accepted  back into the circus.  While &quot;Dumbo&quot; teaches us that we're all  &quot;special,&quot; it also paints a rather darker picture of society  being intolerant of differences unless or until those differences can  benefit that society.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This pretentious trash is horrible. It is THE worst movie of 1999, hands down. Even with the great cast they had, P.T. Anderson must have been drunk  through the entire directing process. My god... why did he do this to me?  Why Paul, why? Fear this movie, but if you like spending three hours  watching a bunch of whiny adults feel sorry about themselves and and try  and redeem themselves by whining more about how dumb and whiny they are,  you will love this movie. Ugh....
6305910103|4.0|This is the movie that should have inaugurated the Star Trek movie franchise. The elevator scene with Kirk and Saavik are different in the  pan-and-scan version as opposed to this widescreen version. Unfortunately,  there was only one thing missing. When this film was aired on television,  there were several deleted scenes added, a few of which were necessary in  the telling of the story as they plugged holes and gave explanations where  explanations were needed. One of the many reasons for DVD over VHS is the  incorporation of deleted scenes and well as a &quot;making of&quot;  featurette. This would have given Star Trek fans what they love --  information. Paramount -- get with the program!
B00000BKE1|1.0|Dear comrades: with the release of the Maidenn great recent album ,  &quot;BRAVE NEW WORLD&quot;, I think it will be plain clear to everybody  that almost everything Maiden released in the nineties was pure garbage,  well below their standards. Thats why Bruce Dickinson left the boat ( to  produce great solo albuns ). This &quot; FEAR OF THE DARK &quot; shows  Maiden reaching the lowest part of their career, producing unbeliavable  horrible rock songs like &quot; THE APPARITION &quot; and &quot; WEEKEND  WARRIOR &quot;. Its honorable the fact that the great MAIDEN survived  through sheer determination while other bands falled along the nineties.  But to say this is a great Maiden album is a total lie.
B000021Y77|5.0|I first saw this film when I rented it with a &quot;buy one get one rental free&quot; coupon, so I obviously didn't expect much from it. I saw the  fancy cover art and thought it would be a short, inane film that wouldn't  hold my interest. I was so incredibly wrong, and after I finished the film,  I couldn't wait to go out and buy it. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is sheer  brilliance from start to finish, never letting your attention drift from  the action on the screen. From the pounding techno soundtrack to the  incredible camera angles and effects, the film is a wild ride to say the  least. <br />The plot involves the loss of 100,000 marks by a scatterbrained  wanna-be crook named Manni who also happens to be the boyfriend of Lola. If  Manni does not deliver the 100,000 marks to his gangster boss, Ronnie, in  20 minutes, Manni will be squashed like a bug. From here, the action  begins. Lola frantically tries to replace the money for Manni, and she  encounters many obstacles along the way. The most mind-blowing part of the  movie is the alternate endings that show the various ways Lola must try to  come up with the money. <br />I was wondering how the filmmakers would stretch  this film out to feature length, considering the plot begins and ends in 20  minutes, but they have done a masterful job of it. Simply put, &quot;Run  Lola Run&quot; is not to be missed, it is one of the best foreign films you  will ever see!
B00000BKE0|1.0|After &quot; SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON&quot;, guitarrist Adrian SMith  left the band due to musical differences. He believed that Maiden should  continue evolving their sound, but Harris thought not. So he left, and the  path was open for the creation of four consecutive disgraceful albuns  released by Maiden in the 90s. The band only found its way again when  Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned in 1999. In this &quot;NO  PRAYER&quot;, we have lousy songs, that were seldom ( or never) performed  by the band live again after the tour.
B00003CXGP|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this movie, like champagne, is an aquired &quot;taste&quot;. No, this movie isn't for everybody. Many people would  probably find this movie stupid and pointless and that's okay. I can't  blame you. The movie is based on the controversial novel by Bret Easton  Ellis about a group of yound men working on wall street in the eighties.  The story focusses mainly, though, on one of the men. Patrick Bateman. On  the outside, Patrick seems to be a handsome, charming young man, but on the  inside...he has a dark, dark secret. He is a sadistic serial killer. Now,  when I read the book, I did not particularly love the charecter Patrick  Bateman. But believe me, the book is great but also very graphic and far  more violent and graphic than this film. Patrick Bateman is much crueler at  times in the book (those who read it will remember the terrible Zoo  chapter). But when I saw the movie...I instantly fell in love with the  charecter. Many of you won't I'm sure. He is beautifully portrayed by  Christian Bale. Some scenes of the movie are absolutely hillarious like his  dinner with Paul Allen. I know what you are thinking. &quot;How can this  person think that the movie is funny&quot; well it is really supposed to  be. It is a satire on the eighties and has dark comedy hidden all over the  place. The DVD edition with it's special features and I suggest you check  them out. So remember, this isn't a movie for everyone but give it a try  anyway because it truly is an instant classic!
B000021Y75|5.0|The theme of this movie is primarily philosophical. Don't be put off, it isn't at all hard to understand and its far from boring. The idea is like  the butterfly effect. One miniscule change will gernerally lead to huge  differences. This may remind you of &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, a movie  which took the same theme and portrayed it in a very different way which I  found rather disapointing. <br /> The other theme is the techno music and  action (running) which makes this come off a bit like a music video. I  found the music very good and the vocals complemented it nicely. The  important thing is how well it works with the visual imagery and I found it  did that very well. In fact, if I had a treadmill I'd buy the soundtrack to  this movie and run to it. Someone told me the actress who played Lola and  the director wrote and sang all the music together. I can't confirm this,  its just something I heard. If so, wow. Muchos kudos and afterlife points  to them.<br /> The final theme is the plot, which keeps you interested. Its a  simple plot. Lola must come up with 100 thousand marks and get it to her  boyfriend in 20 minutes.<br /> While it would seem action techno and  philosophy are quite different, they are put together with amazing success  in this film from Germany. I recommend this movie to people who like  unique, thought provoking, fun filled movies.<br /> Oh one final warning: if  you can't read, you may have trouble understanding this film, unless you  speak German. Let all those who can't read be forwarned.
1881273156|5.0|I honestly attribute the saving of my marriage to this book (placed into  my hands at a time when I was humble enough to heed it's wisdom).  The  tragedy of many relationships today is that they fall apart not for the  lack of love, but for the lack of understanding of how to express the love  we feel to our mate.  Ignorance of the five love languages is really  devastating, as I can attest.  However, since learning that I should be  focusing my efforts to love my spouse in one specific area (in her case  quality time is her love language) my marriage has truly taken a 180° turn  from the brink of divorce to marital bliss (okay, not completely!).<br />This  is a valuable lesson for all to learn and to incorporate into their marital  relationships.  By the way, recognize that your children have love  languages, also, and we must learn each one's love language so that they  too will feel loved and honored and cherished.
6305949980|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. The story and animation are superb, and Danny Elfman's soundtrack stands on its own. We watched this  over and over and know all the songs by heart and quote the best lines from  the movie. Every Halloween since it came out, I started the tradition of  projecting this DVD on a sheet across our garage door. Everyone loves it,  kids and adults alike!
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin III's many acoustic songs were perfected by Jimmy Page's  shimmering acoustic guitar, the album's most easily celebrated hero.  Despite their format these songs are every bit as exciting and intoxicating  as the last two album's psychedelic electric rockers and fittingly show  more lyrical sophistication. This album is a mammoth of melody, musical  attraction and lyrically set sense paranoia. My favorite Led Zeppelin  album.
B000002GWJ|5.0|Waits is an American treasure. He has an awful voice, but that is actualy part of his charm.This is one of his best efforts from his Beatnik/Lounge Lizard period. His mastery of the English language and flair for melody are incredible. He spins yarns about the down and out with a keen eye for detail and a compassionate wit that recall Mark Twain. Much of his material is either howlingly hilarious or enough to bring tears to the most hard hearted. On this release he's much more hard edged in his story telling. &quot;The Wrong Side Of The Road&quot; is a great example of his black humor. There are many fans who seem to like one period of his work over another. I find nearly all of his work downright brilliant
B000002C1V|2.0|If you listen to Pink Floyd for Roger Waters' cynical lyrical commentary,  then this album is for you. It features some of his highest poetry  showcasing the futility of war and frustrations of society's more  disgruntled members. However if you are more interested in playing air  guitar to Have a Cigar, than you likely find this album to be a complete  drag. Musically, it's rather bland and pasted together with none of the  intricate radiance heard best on Wish You Were Here, probably due to the  details of Waters' expulsion Wright and intolerance of influence from  Gilmour or Mason on this work. I also agree that this was the first Waters  solo album in everything but name. This album is not, in my opinion, Pink  Floyd but a side factor of the band's existance and thus not as good.
B00004YA66|5.0|Changing the past to affect the future may not be a new concept in film, but &quot;Frequency&quot; handles it deftly and with heart. The acting is  superb, and as far as I can tell the plot is nearly airtight. It keeps you  on your toes as the story twists in what feels like six directions at once  and keeps you in emotional sync with the characters. The past/present  connections are stirring and intriguing, especially the single-flash cuts  at pivotal moments. This is one of the few movies about which I can  honestly say, &quot;I laughed, I cried, I was scared stupid.&quot; Truly  the only good movie so far this year. So buy this DVD you won't be sorry.
6305910103|3.0|I'm not a Trekkie I'm a movie buff and StarTrek II is one of my favorite movies, however this DVD release is very disappointing.  Not because of  such things as picture quality and sound (which were great) but because  scenes were deleted from the DVD release that were in the VHS version,  let's not even talk about the ABC footage.  With the DVD format one can  expect extra features such as director commentary, film trailers, 3  versions of a movie (as is the case with the newly released Terminator II)  , even scenes that did not appear in the original theatrical release but  one does not expect scenes to be cut from the movie.<br />I will be sending  Paramount this DVD back for a refund because when I buy a movie I expect  the whole movie.

B000005HO0|4.0|...As someone who tends to be a bit too picky about sound quality, myself, it amazes me that the quality of  this recording doesn't bother me at all, especially considering how many  negative comments there are about the sound quality in the other reviews  here. The rawness of this recording serves this music quite well... After  the negative reviews I read about this album, I never would've bought it if  I hadn't heard this recording of \\"Necrolust\\" on CM's Firestarter  sampler, and thought, \\"Hey, this isn't half bad.\\" Actually, it  seems to me that this is what a live recording of \\"extreme metal\\"  really should sound like.<br />I'm not into the whole BM scene. I'm really  just an \\"old\\" metal fan who started checking out this music like  someone rubbernecking a train wreck, but this album is really quite  amazing. Dead's tortured cries on this album  really do \\"make\\" this music. If you are skeptical about this  fact, you really should hear this album. Here is your chance to hear the  Deathcrush songs and the best songs from De Mysteriis, in a more suitable  voice than that whining windbag, \\"Maniac,\\" and the uninteligible  ghoulish grunts of grim Attila. Attila did a decent job on \\"De  Mysteriis\\" but this album is a convincing reminder the songs on De  Mysteriis were really intended for Dead. \\"The Freezing Moon,\\" has  a powerful atmosphere, emerging from the nebular late night mist as perhaps  my favorite BM song, and the recording of it on Live in Leipzig is the  definitive version of it: it is utterly haunted by the late Euronymous'  atmospheric riffs and arcane solo; and the departed Dead's baleful vocals.    <br />Even though the recording quality on Mediolanum Capta Est is more  polished, I would not hesitate to recommend Live in Leipzig, which has a  more powerful atmosphere, over the more recent album. I was surprised to  find that Dead's voice seems like a revelation compared to the whining  squeal and arrogant posturing of Maniac, whose greatest \\"talent\\"  seems to be his ability to carve his \\"initial\\" into himself. The  difference between \\"Leipzig\\" and \\"Mediolanum\\" could be  described as being like the difference between watching the original  black-and-white version of an old horror flick and the lame colorized  version. I agree that this is an album that might be enjoyed by any metal  fan who doesn't mind extreme metal, and doesn't insist on \\"clean  vocals;\\" and while it's difficult to recommend just one album in any  genre, this wouldn't be a bad choice for a collector who's insisting on  owning just one \\"authentic\\" BM album (Emperor's, IX Equilibrium,  is a good choice, too, for some different reasons). If you are an  audiophile you may not be able to hang with the sound quality on Live in  Leipzig, but then again, most audiophiles probably don't listen to much  Black Metal.
B00004Y7GI|5.0|Compared to the 40's version, this TV movie is very faithful to the book. George Scott is excellent for Rochester,and Miss York is just born to be  Jane Eyre. She makes Jane a spirited, intelligent, independent young lady,  which you can't found in Fontaine's performance.  The music in the movie is  so wonderful.It captures the essence of the story, exceptionally evocative  and touching. I highly recommended this version to anyone who loved  Charlotte Bronte's novel.It is well worth tracking down.
0060273224|5.0|If you apreciate a less direct approach and a more open endedstyle of writing, then Garth Nix has got something for you.  _Sabriel_ is an excelently crafted work that lets the reader create as much as the author.  Nix's characters are all deeper than they appear, with attributes that surface in the narrative only when the need arises. ... The plot is typical fantasy fare (young hero(ine) taken from home, forced on long journey, yadda yadda yadda) but rather than a tired repeat, the gradual unfolding of the characters, whether it is the shamed Touchstone or the recalcitrant Mogget, pulls you along almost to the point of forgetting the purpose behind their travels. These characters are three dimensional as opposed to &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; warriors and wizards one might find in some of the more popular fare.  These characters, coupled with the sheer creativeness of Nix's necromantic world,will satisfy the more refined reader of Fantastic literature. ...
B000005H40|5.0|This album is amazing! I will highly suggest you buy it. You of course  have the excellent work by Coltrane but then you add the amazing trumpet  action by Lee Morgan and great trombone work by Curtis Fuller. The first  time I heard this cd I thought &quot;WOW!&quot;. And come to think about  it, I still think &quot;WOW!&quot; and I've listened to it many times. BUY  THIS CD!
B000002LQD|5.0|This is one of two albums that I bought because of a magazine article.  I've always been a Lou Reed fan, but in 1992, I discovered what was to  become one of my favorite albums of all time -- Magic and Loss. What an  emotionally beautiful album! It was inspired by the death of two of his  friends in one year due to cancer. His sparse but impassioned arrangements  know no equal. Even better, I was introduced to my favorite singer through  his backing vocals on this album -- Jimmy Scott. Lou Reed is one of those  rare performers who are artists because of his innate ability to convey  emotion by his cracked and strained voice. You'll not find him singing  opera anywhere, but he is a consummate artist, nonetheless.
B000002UR7|5.0|It's amazing to think how much Radiohead have progressed from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; to &quot;OK Computer.&quot; I can't see how people can slam this album. Just goes to show the true nature of all snobby ...  intellectual music fans who praised &quot;OK Computer.&quot; I think you  could describe &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as bittersweet. It's depressing but  hopeful at the same time. <br />It starts out with the killer musically and  lyrically opening track &quot;You&quot; followed up the famous  &quot;Creep&quot; which was reuined by too much radio play and the world  marking Radiohead as a one-hit wonder. I see how Radiohead could regret  writing it but it's still an amazing song and speaks with real honesty.  &quot;How Do You?&quot; is a fast paced post-punk rock song about a  betrayal. The next two songs are my favorite on the album. &quot;Stop  Whispering&quot; has a great catchy guitar riff with light drumming in the  background that starts out slowly and rises along with Thom Yorke's vocals.  It may not be fancy or really creative but it does something to me inside.  &quot;Thinking About You&quot; is a beautiful light acoustic song. The  lyrics are about questioning a relationship and weather to pursuit it or  not. &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; is one of Radiohead's most  uplifting tunes. It has an under surface message that really you can do  anything in life. It also brings up a funny image of Thom Yorke as Jim  Morrison. &quot;Ripcord&quot; has an average silent than loud rock sound.  &quot;Vegetable&quot; has a beautiful guitar chord going through while Thom  Yorke silently sings. &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; has a great message and  really spoke to me when I first heard it. &quot;I Can't&quot; is much like  the other songs on the album. &quot;Lurgee&quot; and &quot;Blow Out&quot;  put a nice touch to the ending of the album. My only thing I have to say  is..what the heck is an edited version of Creep doing at the end as a  hidden track? Oh well<br />Ihate to sound cheesy but this is an album that  has helped me through the hard times and it is as grand and sincere as  &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer.&quot;
0312954468|5.0|River God is a marvelous story of ancient Egypt whichencompasses perhaps a thirty year period, approximately 4000 years ago. The central character is very unusual; a eunuch slave, who narrates this first-person novel. It is his story, and also that of the lovers; Lostris, Queen of Egypt and Regent for her son; and Tanus, a magnificent warrior. It is also the story of Egypt when this nation was divided into upper and lower Egypt, with separate rulers. <br />Although fictional license always prompts departures from precise facts, Smith does keep his story within general historical facts and dates; and the picture he paints of Egyptian life is mesmerizing and unforgettable.<br />As with any first-person tale, it plods in places, but the irrepressible slave Taita sweeps you along with his magnificent tale, and although it's not my favorite Wilbur Smith novel, Taita is certainly his most unforgettable and beloved character.<br />Smith departs from the norm in several respects in this bold novel. He explores the depths of total love; irrespective of sex and lust and manhood. His character is more of a &quot;man&quot; in his thoughts and deeds and his love for his mistress than any other hero we might imagine. He is a remarkable character.<br />He is a true genius, and his preoccupation with his own qualities is done superbly and with humor; as an engaging example of how those who write about their own place in history hate to ignore their own special values. <br />This book has everything. The introduction of the wheel to ancient Egypt, and its importance in battle and life. Slavery and brutality; and the mindset of a people so civilized but so ancient in their beliefs and knowledge. Taita is such a magnificent character that his presence continues in the present-day sequel to this book, The Seventh Scroll. This book thrills you and makes you sad; again and again, tells a story which is unforgettable; told by a man who is equally so.<br />I can't recommend it highly enough.
068484267X|5.0|I found this memorior very wonderful.  Your heart gets wrapped up in this  mans childhood.  You find yourself engrossed in his heart-wrenching tale of  his personal experiences.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered!!!! It was a  wonderful way to spend the day because that's how long it took me to read  it.
0385484518|5.0|After seeing the Made-For-TV movie, my wife purchased this book for me.   It was a pure pleasure to read and I highly suggest that everyone read and  heed the message that it contains.  I will read it again and again.
6305949638|5.0|In 1985, John Irving penned an American classic about a young man's quest for belonging in the world besieged by World War II and self-doubt. The  first script adaptations of the novel would have made for a nine-hour movie  but being a daring writer, Irving trimmed it down to two hours of human  heart and true nature. The result was one of 1999's biggest hits and a Best  Picture Oscar nominee. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, the central  character, who has been reared in an orphanage in rural Maine from infancy  by a caring doctor named Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine in his superb  Oscar-winning performance). For years, Homer has watched and studied the  practices of Dr. Larch on pregnant women who either wanted an abortion or  refused their babies. When he sees a chance to leave and explore the world  on his own, he takes it and begins a self-quest for his true place in the  world. Where he finds it is in the last place one would think, but it makes  perfect sense once he discovers the true nature behind it. This touching  film made me cry in the theater and it's  a shame that not more people were  willing to see this picture. It only stayed in theaters for about two weeks  at a time. The children will steal your hearts and it is the loving  performance from Caine that drives the film to its tearful and redeeming  finale. Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander are well-cast as the nurses at the  orphanage who stand by Dr. Larch no matter how hard things can get for him  and his illegal practices. The film does not promote or demote the act of  abortion but rather treats it as just a part of the story...and as a fact  of life, that it is a woman's choice. Rachel Portman's beautiful and  touching music score will move you to tears. Even though it was nominated  for an Oscar, it still should have won. The heart of a film can be in its  music and that applies here in every way possible. Caine received a  standing ovation at the Oscar show when he won for Best Supporting Actorand spent over half his speech time acknowledging the work of his fellow  nominees. John Irving also won for his screenplay adaptation of his own  novel, the first time a novelist had ever won for adapting his own work for  the silver screen since &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; won for 1990.  Outstanding on every level, this film is the pinnacle of the moviemaking  industry for the 20th century, as if to offer hope on life and love and the  lessons we need for the future, which would start with the 21st century.  Don't pass up on this film. It is one of the greatest achievements from  Hollywood in recent years.
B00000JCOV|1.0|THIS BAND IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW COMMERICALIZATION CAN TURN A  TALENTLESS BAND POPULAR. This band is just a show from RoadRunner for them  to make money. They have basically no talent other than the drummer and  they dont care at all about the music. They obiviosly cannot play guitar at  all. A 12 year old can cover their guitar riffs to perfection. If the DJ  was any good at all he would be doing the sampling too. And the masks sadly  enough is far far from orginal. If you think this is heavy, that is really  sad. This isnt metal at all, its just a step up from Limp Bizkit.  Slipknot.... coming to TRL soon.
0320037800|5.0|This is one of the best books I have EVER read in my life!  Harry Potter  thinks that he is normal, but untill some strange things happen, and some  sort of giant walks in his &quot;hotel&quot; room, Harry Potter realizes  that he is not normal, he is a wizard. He finds out what and who really  kills his parents, and finds some new friends at his new school.  But then,  they discover something is hidden at Hogwarts-his school-and tries to  fugure it out, before time runs out.  This book has it all, it is funny,  full of mystery, and smart writing.  It is so good, you feel just like you  are there standing next to Harry Potter!

B000003S0R|5.0|This is one of the most obscure albums I own. Brian's voice sounds great  and the music is beautifully odd. The title of the album is rather  intriguing. Just how strategic is the music? And for what purpose?...very  thought provoking. There are many fine melodies on here. The notable ones  are &quot;Burning Airlines Give You So Much More&quot;, &quot;Mother Whale  Eyeless&quot;, &quot;The True Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Taking Tiger  Mountain&quot;. &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless&quot; and &quot;Taking Tiger  Mountain&quot; are my personal favorites on here. This is something to get  if you enjoyed Another Green World (one of the best albums I own) or Before  and After Science. Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is a very thoughtful  album and a classic work by Brian Eno. A definate must-have!
B00003CXDG|3.0|I tried to avoid being caught up in the hype for MI2, but was still disappointed.  The love interest seemed very out of character for the Ethan  Hunt we saw in the original MI, and left me somewhat cold.  The amount of  face changing going on made me think the movie should have been Face/Off 2,  not MI2.  And Woo's directing trademarks had a habit of distracting me from  the movie, leaving me thinking 'oh yes, another Woo set piece'.  For me the  movie was a great disappointment, but I'm sure many people will love it.
B00004TDRD|5.0|This movie is absolutely spectacular!  When I was 10 years old I first watched it and I loved it since then!  I got this special VHS edition of it  and it is excellent.

B000000OQF|5.0|I feel it is a true honor to be the 183rd reviewer of this masterpiece.   The very fact that 182 other people would take time out of their busy lives  to write about this album  reflects the impact it has had on the music  world.  It is the year 2000, and I have yet to hear another hard rock album  that comes close to the razor-sharp beauty that  Appetite offers. <br /> If  you are reading this review, chances are you are just like me, in that you  are bored and have decided to see what GN'R albums Amazon.com offers.  If   you don't own this album already, it is a must-own. <br /> There.  I have  wasted enough of your time.  Now you can get back to searching the web for  more useless  information.
B00000634B|5.0|Somehow it wasn't all that cool to listen to the Stray Cats when they were  popular in the early 80's. Now there is a renaissance of appreciation for  them due to Brian Setzer's resurgence as a swing band leader. In many  respects the Stray Cats are superior to anything Brian has done as a solo  act. He wasn't as accomplished or as slick vocally, but his raw guitar  playing was better showcased in this trio.<br />Most of their songs were  highly derivative, but they have worn well and sound as good as they did 20  years ago. This is a fine introduction to their music and encompasses all  of their great songs.

0140186409|5.0|At 42 years of age, I read the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;.  I was so  moved by this book that I can't quit thinking about it.  The magnitude of  unconditional love which Mrs. Joad displayed for her family was second to  none.  The world would be a better place if all women were as good as she.  This book leaves a lasting impression on its reader.  A &quot;Classic&quot;  it is!
B000002OX3|3.0|Ah..1967.  I have many fond memories of that  summer.  One of the best was crusing around town in my parents' car with my pal, Freddy R.  and  listening to the radio.  Whenever `Happy Jack' by The Who came on, it was  mandatory to crank up the volume to the max!  So naturally, I bought the  album which I listened to often.  Now I got the CD with bonus tracks, but  since the song, `Happy Jack' was not on the original British album it is  not on this release!  What kind of a deal is that?  (`Heatwave' which is  included on the CD was on the British album instead of `Happy Jack') There  is a previously unreleased accoustical version of `Happy Jack' which is not  the same.  It kind of makes me feel ripped off.
B00001NFCY|4.0|'Human Clay' is one of last year's best rock albums. It is instantly  gripping thanks to haunting melodies, great guitar work, a dark , moody  atmosphere and reflective (though religious) lyrics. However, listening to  'Human Clay' reminds me of another band, which started out back in the  early ninties. You got that right - this band might be Pearl Jam. Scott  Stapp is an Eddie Vedder soundalike, and the guitar sound and overall feel  are plain and simple Pearl Jam of the 'Ten' era.  If Pearl Jam had wanted  to continue cashing in on the success of their early work, their recent  albums would have probably sounded EXACTLY like this one. They did not do  that.  The result: Pearl Jam's recent efforts get little attention, while  Creed sell millions. This makes me feel a little sorry for Eddie and the  guys, who deserve the credit for the success of THIS albums.

0618001905|3.0|Adam Hochschild's book is well written and engaging. It bluntly tells the tale of a horrific period in human history. What the book does well, in  addition to describing Leopold's imperial activities, is paint character  portraits of the major actors on the stage: Leopold and Stanley in  particular, as well as some lesser known opponents of imperialism. It is a  great, if disturbing, read that doesn't break new ground for people familar  with the time period.<br />The most obnoxious quality of the book is  Hochschild's need to insert his morals into the book. All too often, while  reading about gross abuses in the Congo or ideas current in the late 19thC  but not popular now, Hochschild has to remind the reader that he, of  course, does not approve of certain actions or thoughts. This tendency will  gate on your nerves after a point as the &quot;reminders&quot; are hardly  needed given the vividness about the crimes he writes about.<br />Where the  books fails is in it's scope. Hochschild's book leads to the perception  that African imperialism was a money making venuture or resource bonanza  that generated vast wealth. While true for Leopold and other individuals  (Cecil Rhodes is another) imperialism, for the nations involved, was a  finacial disaster. Hochschild peers into the Belgian side of the Congo  venture infrequently and misses the money loser the Congo was for them- it  is easy to make a profit when someone else pays for the infrastructure. The  German colony in Togo was considered a marvel because it broke even one  year. Leopold's venture and his personal results differ greatly from the  experience of European state in the Scramble for Africa.
B000001U3K|5.0|What is truly remarkable about this exceptional record is that you can fly  to any city in the continental US, deplane and review the FM band for 8  hours and you will not here this music.  What in god's name has been  released since that is as compelling as this?  The whole  Reed/Velvets/Bowie/Roxy/Eno period squeezed into what, the first half of  the seventies, is such a significant high water mark, during the most  unlikely of times.  I just got this on disc for the first time ever this  week, and my vinyl copy has been in someone's basement for 10 years.  I  fell so hard for this record in, like, '86.  And why not-it's the  ginchiest.

I know it is hard to find, but  if you look hard enough you can find a copy, I know you can because I did.   But if you have no luck at all you can buy the book which I think is very  good as well, plus if you e-mail me (bridawg@home.com) I can send you some  mp3's of the movie that I put together. If they were to make this movie on  DVD that would be the greatest thing since...the Computer, wow, that would  be great.
B00000JPH5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever made.  I am so glad that they re-released it last september.  I especially like the little blue worm.  &quot;come inside--meet the mrs.&quot; who couldn't love this movie--it  even has several small lessons that everyone should know-- life isnt always  fair, and it also shows that even when you mature as sarah does throughout  the movie--you still need to return to your childhood and memories every  now and then because its part of who you are. actually i can think of a lot  more--me and my roomie back in college analyzed this movie once.  i have  watched this movie at least 100 times, sand still never get sick of it.  I  must say--a world without Labrynth just wouldnt be quite as awesome. almost  as awesome, but not quite.
6305603847|5.0|I remember going to the movies years ago to see this film.  I was much younger and all my friends told me it was the movie to go see in an  alternate state-of-mind, if you know what I mean.  Seeing this movie again  on a wide screen TV with surround sound and all the lights turned out does  more justice for this film than the theater I first saw it in did.  If you  have only seen the VHS version of this film, then you have never truly  seen, or heard this movie.  Buy it, watch it, and watch it again.  You  won't be disappointed.

B00004THAY|2.0|I was thrilled when I heard B.B. King and Eric Clapton were doing an album  together.  I went out and picked it up the day it was released.  I brought  it home, gave it a couple listens, and now it is collecting dust, and  probably will so until I sell it to a used CD store.<br />I worship B.B. King.   I see him live every chance I get (9 so far).  He is THE greatest male  blues vocalist, and his style of guitar playing is a national treasure.  He  is also one of the best showmen I have ever seen.  Eric Clapton is no  slouch either, though he is much better at rock and pop than blues.<br />So  imagine my disappointment when I heard this.  This is not blues, this is a  pop incarnation of blues.  It is waaaaay overproduced.  Do you really need  four guitars on every track?  Every classic blues tune they turn out here  is far from being the definitive version.  Blues is supposed to be  spontaneous.  It is jam music, honest, loose, and full of life.  This album  is so polished, preened and packed with too many unnecessary side  musicians, it practically chokes the life out of the music.  I won't even  go into the inclusion of the tracks Come Rain or Come Shine, or Riding with  the King.<br />This is FAR from the best work that either man has done.  If  you want to hear Eric Clapton belt out great blues with searing guitar  solos, get Crossroads II Live in the Seventies.  If you want to hear B.B.  King at his peak powers, get Live at the Regal, Live at Cook County Jail  and/or Live in Japan.  If you want to hear smoking blues duets, get B.B.'s  masterful Blues Summit (stay away from Deuces Wild).  If you want to see  B.B. and Eric have a real duel of great guitar licks, get the video B.B.  King and Friends.  Their bout on Thrill is Gone is amazing.  Nevertheless,  do not get this album.  It can not hold a candle, much less a match to  their great legacies.
B000009EAD|2.0|First off, I would like to say I used to LOVE Iced Earth. I have all of their albums, and I used to think they were the best thing ever to happen to metal music. Now, I can't even stand listening to them. Their style of  old Maiden/Metallica really gets boring after a while. Don't get me  wrong... I LOVE Maiden and old Metallica. <br />Good metal doesn't have to be  technical to be good. BUT...in this case, the songs suffer because of the  simplicity. For the style these guys play, it seems that the songs could  greatly benifit from a little more techincal skill and/or music theory. For  example: Consequences (the song)...The first chord progression in the very  beginning of the song is like Em GM DM...how simple is that? If your a  guitarist (like me) you'll know what I mean, but if you aren't, that  probably made NO sense. Those are the simplist chords ever. Boring? YES!  <br />This whole album is very repetative. The pre chorus to Stand Alone has  almost the EXACT riff as the intro to Burning Times. Almost all the chords  on the album are: ...power chords...just like on EVERY  Iced Earth album. I'm not saying power chords are bad...in fact, they are  the best chord for metal... I use them alot. BUT, when thats all they play,  the songs get boring, repetative, and recylced (using riffs from other  songs to put together filler songs). <br />I LOVE metal. Don't think I don't.  I'm a very metal person. Thats all I listen to. I've been a  &quot;metal-head&quot; since I was 9 years old, so I know just about  everything thats out there. I have well over 250 cd's. I have everything  from AC/DC to W.A.S.P. So I know who's who in the metal world...and Iced  Earth are nothing more than a cheap power metal imposter trying to bring  back metal. And the thing is, they aren't trying hard enough. The music is  weak, boring, and stolen from bands like Metallica, Maiden, a maybe a  little Slayer. <br />Hey, if you want some REAL metal, check out...<br />Slayer  Iron Maiden In Flames<br />Testament Death Queensryche<br />Think for yourselves.  Just because the Iced Earth saying is &quot;a revolution is coming&quot;  doesn't mean you have to follow it. If you want to listen to Iced Earth,  chances are you already have enough Metallica and Maiden in your CD  collection to fill in for them because thats all they are.
006016848X|5.0|Growing up and on into adulthood men learn that &quot;women&quot; are  different through jokes, looks and innuendo, but...WOW!  Many places in  this book were beyond belief.  In fact, I was so sure of the inaccuracies  that I confirmed each area with my two sisters. (And again recently with my  wife) All three of us read the book simultaneously and confirmed with each  other the extremes to which our minds work so differently.  It is amazing  that men and women EVER end up together.  Our communications are like ships  passing in the night.  John Gray is able to relate this information in an  easily digested, informative, sometimes hilarious manner that sticks with  you long after you've put the book down.  I applaud his recognition and  capture of the female perspective and his ability to articulate it in such  a manner that &quot;us Martians&quot; (men) can clearly understand.   Hopefully he has been able to relay that same clarity to the Venusians, out  there. Bravo!
6305603847|5.0|I remember going to the movies years ago to see this film.  I was much younger and all my friends told me it was the movie to go see in an  alternate state-of-mind, if you know what I mean.  Seeing this movie again  on a wide screen TV with surround sound and all the lights turned out does  more justice for this film than the theater I first saw it in did.  If you  have only seen the VHS version of this film, then you have never truly  seen, or heard this movie.  Buy it, watch it, and watch it again.  You  won't be disappointed.
0553573403|5.0|first off, i hate when people give away important plot in a review, i  don't do it.  Martin has created a very beautiful, but harsh world.  These  are some of the most realistic characters ever to be put in a fantasy  novel.  well thought out, and well written, this is an excellent beginning  to what looks to be an exceptional series.  from the start it draws you in,  never letting go. just. . . WOW.  go read it, now.
630242335X|5.0|This is THE best star trek movie I have ever seen. I've seen all 9 films and Star Trek 6 is definently the greatest along with First Contact and Insurrection. It has a great plot, awesome special effects, (Note that Star  Trek 6 was made the same year &quot;Terminator 2&quot; came out, which  revolutionized on-screen effects) and excellent acting all around. The  ending action-sequence is very cool... (Maybe  should have gotten an R-rating just for that part) So if you don't have  Star Trek VI yet, I suggest you add it to your star trek movie collection  today!
052594527X|5.0|Due to family misfortunes, 16 year old Griet becomes a maid in the house  of Johannes Vermeer.  Through her eyes we see all the different people in  this family with their different agendas.<br />Through time Griet becomes, not  just a maid, but Vermeer's assistant, mixing colours for his paintings, and  eventually his model.  <br />I disagree that the ending was sad, yes it was  easily predictable, as it was shown throughout the book.  Simply Griet  needed an exit, and there was only one logical answer.  <br />I loved the  descriptions of the paintings, and found myself turning back to the front  cover of the book and studying it, time and time again.

B0000033TE|5.0|Okay, where do I start?<br />This album is 2nd all-time only to the live ELP  album, &quot;Welcome Back...&quot;. It is a synergistic anthem to a world  gone mad, with reflections on the past which led to the future's  demise.<br />One day I was reading a book on the Battle of Stalingrad while  Toccata was playing in the background. How could it fit so well? It is the  most haunting song I have ever heard with head phones on. Keith Emerson and  Carl Palmer become one in a digital blast of fury. Synthesizer percussion?  Yes, and this album is from 1973.<br />This is ELP at the studio best. If you  are looking to &quot;get into&quot; ELP, start with this CD. If you can't  stomach it after the fifth play, you will never, ever appreciate ELP and  their music. Nothing, even from the band Yes, even comes close to much of  what ELP did. And this album is their signature piece.
B000002LLC|5.0|It's probably my favourite, after having improved her voice, she finally  showed the world what she could do with it. It's really amazing and I can't  believe that so many people ignored this beautiful album. If you don't like  her new cold &quot;synthetizer-style&quot;, buy &quot;I'm breathless&quot;,  you'll really enjoy it!!
0783226063|1.0|I understand that no movie is ever just like the book. However, the movie shouldn't casually discard key premises of the book the way this one does.  I think Lynch's decision to convert the Bene Gesserit fighting techniques  of the book into &quot;weirding modules&quot; that shoot death rays  ultimately cheapened the entire story.<br />I could live with the weird  visuals of the movie if they had been made to serve the purposes of the  book, but as it is, Lynch went too far afield.
B00004TWSX|5.0|I had to rate the CD as a 5 star disc, simply because either as a gold  plated disc or a vinyl album, this thing just rocks! I was, however;  disappointed to see that no bonus tracks had been added, nor was there very  much information about just what was being purchased on the website. I  found the production differences negligable, despite the fact that I have a  pretty good sound system. Bottom line...buy the standard disc...its' just  as good, and you can spend the extra money on other Queen CDs.
6300270424|4.0|Now, I like Led Zeppelin as much as the next girl, but this movie, from a purely technical standpoint, is hilarious in how terribly it was just  slapped together and sent to theaters.  The beginning sequence, where the  band is sent summons to perform, is choppy and makes no sense at all.   First you have Robert Plant frolicking with his family, then John Bonham is  plowing the back forty, then John Paul Jones (was that his real hair or a  wig?) is reading bedtime stories to his kids, and that whole Jimmy Page by  the lake scene?  For a second I thought I was seeing the Blair witch, but  then I realized that Jimmy just needed some Visene.<br />The concert sequences  looked like they were cut and pasted from different performances, which I  think they probably were.  You have people in different clothes RIGHT IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG! The camera operators have an annoying habit of  focusing in on the part of the musician's anatomy that has absolutely no  bearing whatsoever on what he is doing during that portion of the song, or,  worse, on a person who is not really doing anything interesting at that  particular moment in time. The sound could stand to be digitally  remastered, and the &quot;special effects&quot; are hilarious.  The dream  sequences are so weird they're great.  My favorite is the primitive  morphing of the old man on the mountain (The inspiration for Obi Wan  Kenobi? You be the judge.) into baby  Jimmy Page and back  again.<br />Technically, this movie would get a film student expelled from  college.  Musically, it's amazing.  Most people will agree that Zep does  not sound their best here, but what passes for an average show for them is  so much better than many acts' best efforts.  For people like me, who are  too young to have seen Zep live, this is as close as we'll ever get.  If  you like classic rock or cheesy special effects, see this movie.  Either  way, it will brighten you day in ways that Led Zeppelin never intended.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I like this CD, but honestly I still like the first one better. I agree with those people who said her voice is weak and blended with electronic  instruments in most of the songs. But what I'm trying to say is that why  bother spending your time just to post message telling other people how  terrible her voice is or how much you hate her, or something like that. I  mean, really. People think differently and have their own opinions. Britney  has her own way in her music, too. Some people might like it and some  people might not. But don't you think it's HER bussiness that people think  she can't sing? I do. So, just leave her alone. Anyway, I like  &quot;Oops.... I Did It Again&quot; because I think the song and the dances  totally rock!  I like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; because it is a sweet song,  but I don't like a part in &quot;Don't Go Knocking On My Door&quot; where  she sings 'Don't go knock my door'. I think it sound kinda weird. I don't  really like &quot;Lucky&quot; because in the video she doesn't dance. I  think she's the best when it comes to dancing. I like &quot;Where Are You  Now&quot;, too. The rest of the songs are okay, but if you're not her fan,  you might not like it.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is a must see film!  Colossal, dramatic battles abound ! Also reveals the inner conflict that besets a commander/leader on war's casualties. The  acting by Mel Gibson is first class and the supporting actors such as his  comrades are also very good.I have seen this film (VCD version) many times  and will continue to see it in the future.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|This low budget SciFi thriller is one of the best to be release in the last year!  The story was great!  I especially liked how the story and  characters were introduced and how the movie didn't let out all the secrets  right away.  I thought the main characters did a fantastic job.  Some plot  and story holes exist, but it doesn't take away from the movie.  It goes to  show you that you don't need to spend big bucks on a SciFi movie to make it  interesting or exciting.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I purchased Marilyn Manson's &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; in early  1997, a few months after its release. This is definitely not an album that  you pop in while driving to the movies and listen to a track here and  there... the entire album tells a story, similar to Pink Floyd's &quot;The  Wall&quot;. Be warned, however, this album is not for everyone. It's the  darkest, most depressing work of music that I've ever heard. <br />The album  starts out with some mainstream singles such as &quot;The Beautiful  People&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot;. As it goes on however, it gets  into deeply depressing, angry and disturbing songs such as  &quot;Deformography&quot;, &quot;Cryptorchild&quot;, &quot;Mister  Superstar&quot; and &quot;Kinderfeld&quot;. The most powerful track on this  CD is without a doubt &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;, a very angst-ridden  track with seemingly suicidal messages and how life isn't worth living  without risks. It ends with the very numbing &quot;Man That You Fear&quot;.  <br />Marilyn Manson's finest masterpiece to date - Mechanical Animals and  Portrait of an American Family are both excellent albums but they don't  hold a candle to ACS.
B000002TQV|5.0|I got this after OK Computer, and it blew me away. Fade Out is one of the  greatest songs I have ever heard. The Bends is a really groovy track that  will keep your head jammin. And Trees is an unbelieveable piece of music,  given that the lyrics are nothing more than abstract poetry.  A very  poetic, complex album. Black Star has the best lyrics, but the album itself  cannot even compare to anything else. A must have.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This was the first Radiohead album I heard in entirety, and it blew me  away. Paranoid Android brought about a despair that I never felt before,  and Let Down actually drew a tear. An unbelievable work of art. A must have  for fans of Floyd, STP, and classical music. But everyone must hear it at  least once, just to understand how music SHOULD be written.
0205191584|2.0|This little book approaches the craft of writing with the sort of dogmatic rigidity usually found in a backwoods cult.  Of course it is still popular  in most schools.  Many teachers, admiring its bluntness and terseness,  swear by &quot;the little book.&quot;  Students, especially if they're  competent writers to begin with, are more likely to swear _at_ it.<br />By  focusing exclusively on local concerns (grammar, word usage, and  sentence-level fluency), Strunk and White transform written argument, the  hallmark of civilized discourse, into a lexical &quot;no man's land.&quot;  They reveal alleged errors, scattered like land mines beneath the surface  of perfectly acceptable, communicative prose.  In the twisted world of  _Style_, the job of &quot;good writing&quot; is to avoid error, in the same  way that the job of a &quot;good soldier&quot; is to avoid getting shot.  Small wonder that students nursed on these precepts approach their writing  with fear and trembling -- their term papers have become suicide  missions.<br />Needless to say, most professional writers don't approach their  craft in this way.  If they do, they eventually abandon writing for a less  stressful occupation, like postal delivery or day trading.<br />I've given the  book an extra star for the final chapter on style, which attempts to  mitigate some of the damage done in earlier chapters.  This chapter is  White's principal contribution to the book, and shows that even an  excellent writer may not understand -- at least not any more than the  average joe -- how or why his prose works.
0767903854|4.0|Wonderful book.  For those of us who tend to be armchair travellers, Mr.  Bryson does all of the research AND all of the difficult travel!  And he's  funny, besides.  What could be better?<br />As I read this, I could picture  myself on the cross-country train, getting stranded in the desert, seeing  the Big Lobster, and getting stung by something I'd regret.  That, to me,  is the mark of a good travelogue -- you are there.<br />Some say they found  &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; preachy, and that this book is refreshing  in that it's not preachy.  I'll take issue with the term elsewhere; the  difference here is (as Mr. B points out) that there's no need to warn the  Australians of what they could be losing -- they do a very nice job of  conservation themselves, thank you.  Unlike us.  But that's another  story.<br />Read this book.  If you want a good laugh, if you want to go to  Australia, if you don't want to go to Australia.  It's very definitely  worth the read.
B000002LCI|5.0|A glossy and well produced full digital recording, I believe this is their  best. &quot;The Things You Said&quot; one of the best tracks on this CD,  lyrics and composition, may remind one of high school semantics.  This  album is filled with solid tracks such as the terribly dramatic and  profound &quot;Little 15&quot;. &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; &amp;  &quot;Pimpf&quot; would be next along with the great and somewhat  experimental piece &quot;Agent Orange&quot;.
6304698690|5.0|The secret garden .. I walked out of the cinema spell bound.<br />What was it which was soooo beautiful? Was it the innocence of Mary? The simplicity of  the plot? The scenery?<br />An absolutely fantabulous film. A must, although  definitely not for the shoot-em up action fan.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I have to admit when I bought this album I was seriously skeptical.  After all, what could a rich whiteboy rapper have to say?  Boy am I glad I picked  it up anyway.<br />This album is loaded with great hits.  With the exception  of the ego boasting of &quot;kill you&quot;, this is a great album.  It's  angry and its filled with all the hatred you can imagine.<br />This isn't  meant for kids. even though he says he &quot;makes albums for high school  kids&quot;.  He seethes with anger at every opportunity.<br />The anger  stems from the sudden fame and the impressions people have of him.  He may  be rich and white but he still sees the problems of the world.  Listen to  &quot;the Way I Am&quot; and you' never dismiss him again.
6304696515|5.0|John Malkovich and Glenn Close are awesome.<br />The plot focuses on the interaction of the characters and their desire to show personal control and  power over themselves and others. The 18th century aristocrat setting  supplements the inter-personal relationships.<br />The movie was redone with a  modern day scenario in the film 'Cruel Intentions'. I enjoyed the  comparison although 'Dangerous Liaisons' is definitely tops.
B00004NRWH|3.0|The cd is filled with many great songs.  The only problem is that the the cd is only 38 minutes long, even with two different versions of &quot;Leader of Men&quot; ...
B00003CWTI|4.0|I enjoyed the film...<br />Slow at times although many separate ideas and issues with extreme results were dealt with. A disturbing plague like  interference occurred during the film, which woke me up!<br />A film with  extremities and perhaps not for everyone.
6305949980|5.0|Call me crazy, but I already own this Tim Burton masterpiece on VHS, DVD, and the soundtrack on CD. Seldom would I ever consider buying a movie a  third time, but I love this film so much that I am going to shell out the  bucks again! Why? First of all, this movie is so good that it has already  become a classic. The story can be enjoyed anytime, but especially at  Halloween and Christmas. The story combines elements of both holidays ever  so cleverly. Simply, the message of the story is be a first-rate yourself  rather than a third-rate somebody else. Jack Skelington, the pumpkin king  of Halloween gets &quot;weary of the same old thing&quot; and tries his  hand at taking over Christmas from Santa (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot; as he  calls him). The results of his efforts are both hilarious and touching. The  music by Danny Elfman is outstanding and perfectly complements the story.  You'll be singing the tunes to yourself. Oh yes, the other reason I'm  buying &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; again is because this  edition will contain extra &quot;behind the scenes stuff&quot; that I love,  which was not made available on my current DVD. This is one of those rare  gems that I can recommend buying, even if you've never seen it before.  Finally, during the last 10 years there have been many wonderful animated  films made. Among my favorites are: &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;,  &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;Toy Story I &amp; II&quot;,  &quot;Antz&quot;, &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Before  Christmas&quot;. All of these masterpieces will appeal to all ages.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Kevin Spacey received a well deserved oscar for his performance.

Would you be  fooled? I was.
B000023VR6|2.0|Damn! Nothings new!  talks about how certain type of people are. Then talks about how he wants to beat them up. just like rest of his album in the past. Nothing new but the beat. &quot;beat&quot; is the only thing  keeping &quot;so called gangster rap&quot; alive and this album is a good  example. If it wasn't I guess he would have nothing to talk about and this  would be an instrumental. LoL!   songs more like fantasy stuff? Creates  his own dummy and then beats it up. &quot;this formula of Gangrap&quot; is  getting tired. this business tactic is starting to get irritating even  coming from the East coast. He is good at being a &quot;DJ,&quot; but  lyrically no.. I stole this freaking album! damn! Now I wish I didn't. I  listened to this album twenty times just find out the reason of this album.  and wasted my time finding out there is nothing! Go get this album with no  second thoughts if your a little ... wannabe gangster and like kiddish  nonsense coming from adults, or if your a DJ and don't care what the lyrics  are.. just get it for the Tight Beats. and If your a DreHead.... well I  guess I have no say in that. If your passerbyer and just curious about this  artist just wait for something better. or just go and get Eminem album.  (reason why many people got this anyway.... like me!)    I would of given  this album a one star but Eminem came of tight! so... a two. peace!
0552137030|5.0|I believe I have just finished reading this book for the eighth time.   This time I read the paperback edition because my mom felt that since I'm  now living away from home, I should have my own copy of this book.  I have  read it once or twice a year since Mom discovered the hard cover edition at  a used bookstore.  It is inconceivable for me to believe someone would  actually give this wonderful book away, but I'm glad they did because I may  never have found out about it if they hadn't.  Each time I read it, I  discover nuances I hadn't noticed earlier.  As a teenager who is still in  an educational system, I find that as I learn more in general I find more  in this book.  It is one of the wittiest and, to borrow a phrase from Adam,  brilliant books I've ever read.  It  is perhaps THE best book I'll ever  read.  I only wish there were a few more stars with which to rate this  book.  I highly recommend it!
6305127646|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times it boggles the mind. Every time I watch it I like it even more. I think The Saint was very under-rated. It  has it all. Good acting by Kilmer and Shue, as well as good effects,  stuntwork and a solid story.<br />This is what good spy movies should be like.  Granted Templar is a thief, but that's a technicallity in this movie.  Arguably the best thief in the world is working his way towards retirement  when he gets caught up in a plot, led by a Russian oil tychoon names  Tretiak, to take over the USSR.<br />Shue plays Doctor Russell who is working  on the formula for cold fusion that Templar is tasked to steal. She becomes  a partner of sorts to Templar in a quest to thwart the plans of  Tretiak.<br />Every aspect of The Saint comes together to make it a modern day  classic that can challenge the likes of Goldeneye and other great spy  movies.<br />Not only an action film, The Saint has the nice subplot of a love  story between Templar and Dr. Russell, that plays a larger role in the  ladder half of the movie as the two characters fall for each other.<br />Why  this movie didn't break out as a hit I think I may never know. At least you  now have the change to make up for what you missed in the theaters. Enjoy a  sleeper hit movie with The Saint.
B000001ELL|3.0|THE BAND: Gene Simmons (Gene Klein), Paul Stanley (Stanley Eisen), Ace Frehley (Paul Frehley), Peter Criss (Peter Crisscoula).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1979) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 39 minutes. Recorded at Electric Lady Studios (NYC). The album cover is the last to feature all 4 original member's faces together. Originally released on Casablanca Records in 1979; this remastered edition was released in 1997 on Mercury's label. Much improved sound in my book (deeper bass guitars and crisper highs). Liner notes are slim - a 2 page fold out with song titles, writing credits and times. Underneath the disc on the inside cover, there's an informative 5 paragraph history of what the band was going through at the time.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Mixed reviews on studio album #7, \\"Dynasty\\". While it does contain a suedo-disco song in \\"I Was Made For Lovin You\\" (which did hit #11 on the Billboard charts)... it found the band trying to fit in with the times. Being a KISS fan from the start, I feel the band should've never given in to the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" dance craze. They clearly lost some of their fans. Song selection is tilted to say the least - Gene sings 2 songs, Peter 1 song, Paul 3 songs and surprisingly Ace with 3 songs. Ace does a great job with a Rolling Stones remake \\"2000 Man\\", and perhaps my favorite song on the disc - \\"Hard Times\\", but the spaceman falls short on the worst song on the album \\"Save Your Love\\" (dare I say one of the band's all-time clunkers). Gene's songs - \\"Charisma\\" and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" are catchy, but not his best writing. Ace and Peter were on the verge being ousted and perhaps this is simply their last hoorah. Peter, knowing this was the end of the road, was replaced on some songs by Anton Fig. The band somehow needed to keep moving forward - especially after the successes of \\"Alive!\\", \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Rock And Roll Over\\" and \\"Love Gun\\"... not to mention mild successes with 4 solo albums. It didn't happen. Clearly, the band took a step backward with \\"Dynasty\\". Kiss had so many great albums in the 70's - and \\"Dynasty\\" is probably at the bottom of the list for the decade. Essential to the KISS catalog, but easily a middle-of-the-pack disc (3 stars).y\\". Kiss had so many great albums in the 70's - and \\"Dynasty\\" is probably at the bottom of the list for the decade.

4789004546|5.0|I had been living in Japan for about 9 months and was still having a very  difficult time with Japanese grammar.  I didn't understand enough grammar  to be able to put together my ideas and express thoughts. All I could do  was recite phrases I had memorized.  I had read through other Japanese  grammar books but I just couldn't understand the explanations.  This book  gives very concise explanations that I could understand and many very  helpfull examples that give you the proper context.  Also this book  compares and contrasts similar grammar patterns.  Before I bought this book  I couldn't talk, but by the time I was 3/4 through this book I could hold  conversations and express the ideas I had not been able to do for almost a  year and it gave me a good base to build on as I became fluent in Japanese.
B00004LN16|5.0|I purchased &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; without hearing one note of it,  and based my purchase soley on AC/DC's impressive resume of consistency. As  usual I was not let down, and as usual my expectations were blown away. I  am forever fascinated with the level of quality put forth during any  assembly of the thunder from down under. <br />Although all AC/DC albums are  in my current rotation, it had been nearly seven years since I had seen the  band live. While their sound does translate rather well to a recorded  medium, the live experience proves to re-enforce the qualities instilled in  their musicianship. In fact, one could arugue that it is these qualities  alone which allow their live performance to translate so well to the  studio.<br />Power. The sheer magnitude of their embodiement of pure  unadulterated power. A combination of the wrath of God and the wrath of  man, fused together and channeled into a single gush of  molten fury. The  dilution of explosions, electricity, thunder, earthquake, volcano, rock,  fire, and steel all concentrated into  5 vicious warriors who unleash full  frontal assault on all that is weak and all that allows itself to be  tamed.<br />When the members of AC/DC get together and pick up their  instruments, no matter the venue, situation, or circumstance, it is a  guarantee that they will deliver everything described in the above  paragraph. I apply the above description to their current masterpiece  &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, however I feel it applies cross-channel.

B000002UAU|5.0|While preceeding classics Pet Sounds and Revolver are better albums than  Sgt. Pepper, neither did as much to make rock and roll claim a dominating  presence in the social conscience. Everyone had an opinion on this, and so  should you. A lot of people consider every Beatles album to be essential,  while that may not necessarily be the case, this album *is* essential.  <br />This record gets more press than most others, and it's because of the  revolution it led through new studio techniques, and not so much because of  the songs, or message, on the album. Granted there are some absolutely  brilliant moments (A Day In The Life alone makes this album essential). But  this is not OK Computer or Exile On Main Street, so don't expect  that.<br />Even with that said, this is still superb. Within You Without You  and When I'm Sixty-Four really shouldn't be on the album (if Strawberry  Fields and Penny Lane were on here, as planned, how good would this album  be!). But the whole first half is excellent-to-classic and the last four  tracks are great-to-magical.<br />Get this.
0679721037|5.0|I thought this book was great. It tells about a bombing of a civilian city  in Japan, called Hiroshima. When the atom bomb lands, thousands of innocent  civilians are killed, and thousands of others go through pain and  suffering, and many of those eventually die. The book tells about six  individuals living in Japan, and each of them go through radiation  sickness, depression, and the sight of watching others die around them.  This book is a true story, and it lets the world know about the true  devestating consequences of bombing. Although this book may seem too  depressing, it is important to read about others who suffer, and it may  make someone think twice before using an atom bomb.
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein, being one of the only german bands on the market today they  excel in concert as well as in their cds.....Herzeleid is an excellent  example.  Great guitare riffs and awesome synthesizers back up a great drum  line and vocals.....You can go from Asche Zu Asche one of their more fast  paced songs to Seemann a more slow yet melodic song..... They have all you  want and more..
B000002UJQ|5.0|For all that's been said before, I'll keep this simple...I've yet to listen to an album that so completely engulfs me with passion, anger,  comedy and tragedy.<br />Even if you were unsure about this album, I promise  you it's worth spending $12.00 to find out something about yourself, or at  least the society we're living in. I'm not sold on the &quot;terrifying  technology,&quot; but this album is something special that I think each one  of us can relate to. <br />After all, we're using processors to communicate.
6301543408|2.0|Star Trek V is just a reaffirmation that the odd numbered Star Trek films are just bad, or off kilter. This time William Shatner is in the directors  chair as well as the Captain's chair.  Basically a bruised ego since  Leonard Nimoy took the director's chair on 2 successful rounds of Trek with  Star Trek III: The Search For Spock, and the extremely successful Star Trek  IV: The Voyage Home. I imagine that Shatner wanted to capture that same  magic for Trek V, but alas it is not to be so. Star Trek V starts off with  a hostage situation on Nimbus 3, the planet of galactic peace.  Nimbus 3 is  a shared world where the Federation, Klingon, and Romulans supposedly work  out their difference.  The hostage taker is a mysterious Vulcan with many  followers. On Earth, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are called from R&amp;R in  Yosemite National Park back to the Enterprise.  StarFleet informs Kirk of  the situation and that the Enterprise is the only ship available. (Yeah,  right.)  In viewing the hostage message that is left, Spock recognizes the  Vulcan.  Aside from the Enterprise, and Klingon Bird Of Prey is en-route to  Nimbus III to rectify the situation in a way only a Klingon knows how to  do. Captian Klaa antisipating the arrival of the Enterprise, see much honor  for himself if he can best Kirk in battle.  He quickly cloaks his vessel  and goes for the kill.  On the Enterprise, Spock notes the approaching  cloaked vessel and its intentions of attacking.  Making a trecherous  hostage situation even more dangerous, they now have to work unter a time  limit before the Klingon ship comes into striking range. After taking a  shuttle down to the planet, Kirk and company attempt to free the hostages.   Instead of rescuing the hostages, Kirk and crew are captured by the madd  Vulcan and ask Kirk to take him to the Enterprise. The Vulcan Sybok, is in  search of a legendary planet Shakar Ree, where supposedly God lives (I'm  not making this up people).  Sybok had staged the hostage situation in  order to get a vessel to come so he could hijack it to this mysterious  planet. Kirk plans a double cross on Sybok as the shuttle approaches his  ship.  He contacts Scotty, alerting him in code that he and the shuttle are  in trouble.  After a shuttle crash on the hanger deck of the Enterprise,  Spock gets the upperhand on Sybok with a gun.  As Sybok approaches Spock to  take the gun, Kirk orders Spock to shoot.  He refuses and Sybok takes the  gun. As Kirk questions Spock why, his response is...&quot;Cause he is my  brother...&quot; Want to learn more?  You'll have to see the movie. The  failure point for this film is the plot itself along with the acting and  special effects. The special effects are very strained, basically because  ILM (Industrial Light Magic)was busy with Ghostbusters 3 and Indianna Jones  And The Last Crusade.  A 3rd party effects company took over and did a  shoddy job. The plot of the film is horrible.  Search for God in the center  of the galaxy beyond a great barrier?  Oy! The televisiion show had better  plots that this?  What was Shatner thinking?  And a long in the tooth Lt.  Cmdr Uhura doing an erotic dance to distract some hostage takers?   Puleeeze! Only interesting character was Sybok, and he wasn't completely  developed enough to appreciate. One thing learned from this experience, is  that Shatner should stick to acting...or overacting.  I'd only recommend  this film for anyone looking to round out their Trek video library.
B000031WBQ|5.0|Arthur Rubinstein was a aquaintance of Sergei Rachmaninoff's, revered the  elder musician's piano performances, and admired--with some  reservations--his compositions.  Surprisingly, he recorded a very limited  repertoire of the Russian composer's works--a total of three compositions,  all represented here.<br /><br />The Concerto and Paganini Rhapsody were recorded in  1956.  The recorded sound was astonishing for its day, and remains pretty impressive now.  The performances recorded here remain of the first rank.  Rubinstein, like Rachmaninoff, had very large hands--stretches and other technical hurdles which other pianists found uncomfortable were child's play for Rubinstein.<br /><br />Rubinstein achieves an excellent balance between structure--which is usually neglected in these works--and the details of phrasing, rubato (always natural sounding), and dynamics.  Reiner, with the Chicago Symphony, do an excellent job with the orchestral  contribution.  The two artists reportedly had a rocky personal relationship  (Reiner had some tart things to say about Rubintein's technique during the  making of this recording, the result being that Rubinstein refused to work with him in the future), but they achieved fine results here.<br /><br />These recordings rank along side Rachmaninoff's own in these pieces, and in the Rhapsody almost reach the level of the Kapell/Reiner recording--still the my favorite version.<br /><br />Rubinstein's idiomatic reading of the infamous C-sharp minor Prelude was recorded several years earlier, and is in mono.  The only regret here is that Rubinstein never saw fit to record more of Rachmaninoff's music.
6304576935|5.0|Even numbered Trek films are cetainly do well here.  Number #2 for The Next Generation, or #8 in the entire run of Trek films, no matter how you  look at it, First Contact is a gem of a movie.<br />The Plot: In the 24th  Century,  Jean Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise E are finishing up  a recon mission when they get a call from Earth.  The Federation is under  attack by Star Trek's most dredded villians 'The Borg'. Upon arrival near  Earth, the crew of the Enterprise engage in a battle against the Borg ship.   The Borg, near defeat, play a final gambit at victory.  The Borg Queen  sends a small Borg ship back in time to the Earth's past.  Picard and crew  go in pursuit of the ship back to the Earth's 22nd century.  A 2nd battle  ensues, and the Enterprise destroys the Borg vessel, but not before the  Borg Queen has done some damage on Earth and not before she beams herself  on one of the decks of the Enterprise E.  Quickly like a virus, she starts  assimilating the crew.  The dilemia is two-fold.  First, stop the Borg  Queen from assimilating the entire crew.  Second, try to fix the damage  that has been done to the timeline by getting Zephram Cochrane to continue  with his warp speed spaceflights. Who gets assimilated?  Will Picard be  able to stand up against the Borg?  What of the Earth timline?   Buy this  movie and find out!<br />Interesting Trivia and sceens to watch for: <br />During  the holodeck scene, as a 1940s-era big band plays in the background,  director/costar Jonathan Frakes can be seen playing the trombone. During  the holodeck scene, Captain Picard and Lily are greeted by a hologram  played by Ethan Phillips who also plays Neelix on Star Trek: Voyager. The  deflector dish is labeled AE35, the name of a component of a satellite dish  in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The eyepieces of the Borg flash the Morse  code of the names of people associated with the production.<br />Some Greate  Quotes From The Film:<br />The Borg Queen: Brave words. I've heard them  before, from thousands of species across thousands of worlds, since long  before you were created. But, now they are all Borg.<br />Dr. Beverly Crusher:  So much for the Enterprise-E.<br />Picard: We barely knew her.<br />Dr. Beverly  Crusher: Do you think they'll make another one?<br />Picard: Plenty of letters  left in the alphabet.<br />Must buy for the Trekkie in your life!

B00000AD94|1.0|Sorry Beard fans, but the obscene-filled track &quot;Water&quot; is a  total disgrace. I am a big fan of Spock's Beard and have all of their  studio albums except this one. A friend of mine bought it and played me the  above mentioned track. Like I said, that song is a total disgrace and I am  glad to see that they have not sunk to that level since. There is no sense  in yelling F You over and over! They must have been listening to Guns  N'Roses that day or watching &quot;Scarface&quot;. If you want a Spock's  Beard cd, buy &quot;Beware Of Darkness&quot; or the new one &quot;V&quot;.  Ignore this trash!
B000002J6H|5.0|The editors comments are almost entirely nonsense. I listen to two  musicians more than anyone else - one is bob dylan and the other is Stills.  I would find it different to explain why and can only presume that he  possesses a certain brilliant edge rarely found.  He frustrates us all in  the sense that his albums are inconsistent with 2 or 3 wonderful songs on  each one surrounded by good, albeit slightly flat ones - I can never  understand this lack of constancy - But he has something - one of the best  country blues voices ever, a versatile edgy then smooth guitar style and  a  whiff of poetry that perhaps belies his perceived image. Anyway, I would  buy this album..although I already have.(!) But YOU certainly should!
B000002UA0|5.0|It's easy to forget, taking into consideration the fact the Pink Floyd's Mark II lineup of Mason/Wright/Gilmour/Waters produced some of the most  famous (and some of the most insanely boring) music of all time, that Pink  Floyd actually was an underground band when they started, and with the Soft  Machine, the darlings of the British pyschedelic movement...<br />Roger  &quot;Syd&quot; Barrett, the band's co-founder, guitarist, and primary  songwriter, was the force that made the band what it was-exciting,  unpredictable, experimental(much like Barrett himself)..his lyrics were  probing, whimsical, silly, but never dull..his guitar playing was unique,  using slide glissando styles to reach the heavens, and detuning it at will  as the muse hit..<br />Piper at the Gates of Dawn is unquestionably the most  important lp of British psychedelia..from this lp came startling beautiful  tunes of both whimsy and spiritualism (Scarecrow, Chapter 24, Mathilda  Mother, the Gnome, Bike) meahed with powerful tunes (Astronomy Domine, Take  Up thy Stethescope and Walk- Roger Waters' lone composition that Syd's  frenzied guitar playing takes to unfathomable heights).<br />The centerpiece  of the lp is the classic &quot;Interstellar Overdrive,&quot; Syd's sonic  tribute to all things space..at 7 minutes, it lacks the power of the  original 16 minute version (Find Floyd's &quot;London 66-67&quot; disc to  hear it in its full glory), but it DOES pave the way for space bands like  Hawkwind...<br />A victim of his escellating LSD use, Barrett's behavior  became erratic and he was ousted from the band unceremoniously in 1968. He  is the topic of a miriad of false rumours, (He is NOT insane! ) and the  band never remotely approached the level of experimentation after he  left...<br />Because of this, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is more important  than ever to fans of psychedelic music..it is the blueprint from which  German psychedelia ranging from Can to Ash Ra Tempel and early Tangerine  Dream took their cue and ran..and Barrett is a name commonly dropped as an  influence (Julian Cope, Robyn Hitchcock, Thurston Moore, David Bowie, Marc  Bolan, the list goes on.<br />Few lps deserve the status of  &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;indispensible listening,&quot; but this lp is  one of them..if you own only 1 psychedelic lp, let it be this one.
0553573403|5.0|While we are all waiting for the next Robert Jordan book to come out we  have something new to read.  And it is not just sub-standard fill to keep  our mind occupied, its actually good.  It takes a while to get used to  Martins writing style, (every chapter from a different character's point of  veiw) but once you figure out who is who, it is kinda refreshing.  The main  complaint I've read is that the actual plot in the story is not what they  expected from reading the beggining.  To that I say, THANK GOD!!!  I would  die happy if I never had to read another overly predictable Fantasy book.  If you are looking for another great book to put on your bookshelf beside  Jordan and Goodkind this book is it.
B00004KD1L|3.0|No matter how good this is, there are always a plethora of better stuff  out there This album is overrated anyway, it is quite a pleasant listen, I  have to say. At times it sounds like Air, Nightmare On Wax and Moby at the  same time, at times it goes to dance which is pretty nice. The single 'At  The River' is sublime, it truly deserves your attention, but not for the  whole album. Only a few tracks are good, 'Dusk You&amp;Me' is pretty cool,  so is 'Inside My Mind' among the rest, nearly half of the album is good,  but that is it. When they try to do dance, I dont think they are pretty  successful. A good chill-out album, but not great. Check out some chill-out  compilations out there, they are clearly more worthywhile.
B000005RT8|4.0|McCartney is well known by his ballads such as &quot;No more lonely  nights&quot;, &quot;My love&quot;, &quot;Once upon a long ago&quot;. <br />You  just CAN'T expect any of that in this album. This is an experimental album  which reflects his late 70's experimental home demos.<br />I really like the  bluesy &quot;On the way&quot;, the acoustic &quot;One of these days&quot;  but I also love the experiments &quot;Coming up&quot;, &quot;Temporary  secretary&quot;, &quot;Check my machine&quot;.<br />This is an album to be  played when you're in the mood for some weird stuff.<br />mAX
B00003CXAR|5.0|I just bought this DVD yesturday and I am very impressed. The picture and sound quality are unmatched. There is tons of extras that will keep you  busy for hours. The only complaint that I found was that there should have  been some more outtakes, but thats just a little gripe. The movie is a  timeless horror/thriller tale about a 25 foot hungry shark that feeds on  local swimmers on the beach. If you own a DVD this is a must to your  collection. After viewing this film you will think twice about swimming in  the ocean. Buy it now!
6302763835|4.0|It's big, hairy, ugly, and it has eight legs.  A dedicated, if slightly mad, scientist (Leo G. Carroll) experiments with &quot;gigantism&quot; in  animals as a solution to the world's finite food supply.  One of the  &quot;experiments,&quot; a tarantula the size of a large dog, escapes  during a fire in the lab, and crawls out into the desert.  Because its  enhanced size is chemically induced, the spider continues to grow, and  grow.  This is an entertaining '50's scif-fi flick that does a nice job of  building suspense.  There are a couple of &quot;cheap shots&quot; of a  person coming up off camera, and suddenly touching someone on the shoulder.   The first-time viewer is expected to jump out of his skin, I guess. A  better example of the film's scary content is the night scene showing  nervous horses pacing in their corral while frantically looking at the  nearby hill and sensing &quot;something&quot; approaching over the horizon.   When the &quot;something&quot; finally arrives, pandemonium ensues.   Another scene showing the skeletal remains of cattle amid &quot;pools&quot;  of spider venom raises the hackles.  In typical '50s fashion, conventional  handguns, shotguns, and rifles can't stop the big bug.  The Big T just  keeps coming.  The special effects are competent, if not spectacular.  The  B&amp;W photography combined with a normal sized tarantula photographically  enlarged to fantastic proportions produces some dark-tinted results that  adds to the creature's aura of shadowy mystery, especially in the frequent  night scenes.  Considering the gigantic size of the thing, it takes the  townspeople forever to realize there is something awry out there in the  spooky desert.  After the truth is learned, the usual &quot;monster  movie&quot; hysteria breaks loose.  As the Big T approaches the little  town, no doubt planning to feast on the local population, fighter jets are  seen above, and there is the smell of napalm in the morning.      <br />As  classic sci-fi/monster movies go, this film is on many viewers' short list  of the best &quot;creepy-crawlies.&quot;  It's in the same class as the  perennial favorite, &quot;Them.&quot;  Monster movie aficionados certainly  need this film as part of their personal movie collection.  It's also a  good introduction to classic sci-fi for the younger generation.  Make the  popcorn, and gather around the TV for the fun.  ;-)
B00000ILDE|5.0|Ok, I've said I love this movie before, but that's not what I'm here about.  As far as I can tell, I don't think anyone has noticed this before:  Every ship in the first two movies is named after a book or town in a  Joseph Conrad novel. The Nostromo is named after his book, called, well,  &quot;Nostromo&quot;; the Narcissus is from his book the &quot;N-----(it's  an offensive word) of the Narcissus&quot; and the Sulaco is the name of the  town from &quot;Nostromo&quot;. I guess the whole &quot;Heart of  Darkness&quot; thing parrallels with the Alien movies, but in the last two  Alien movies, the script writers were too stupid to get this. I mean,  geezus, they could have named the Auriga the &quot;Brute&quot; or  &quot;Duelist&quot; or something from Conrad, if just to keep up the  tradition.
068818071X|5.0|This is the first time I have read a Marian Keyes novel. Her writing<br />is very witty and sharp. Also, she has proven that she is perfectly<br />capable of writing a funny and compelling story about a woman whose<br />life in the fast lane abruptly comes to a halt when she is faced with<br />two choices: either attend a rehab center or die of an<br />overdose....<br />I love the comedy in the novel. I also love<br />the fact that Keyes has successfully created a heroine whose denial is<br />so acute that it managed to fool me for a moment. She has obviously<br />done her homework. I also love the romance between Rachel and her<br />boyfriend Luke. He is a great character. The supporting characters in<br />the novel are all great.  The only blemish in the novel is the<br />constant Hispanic stereotypes -- to be honest, I found it<br />grotesque. Other than that, this is a fascinating and poignant novel<br />that should be read and appreciated to the fullest. Enjoy.
B000003BDJ|5.0|In all honesty, I am not a big Rolling Stones fan. Even though I have  heard most of their CD's, I don't own any aside from this one. The reason  is that many of their songs just aren't good. But the Stones can write  amazing songs when they get inspired. The Hot Rocks 1 is a compilation of  their best songs without any of the other, (bad), songs they they have come  out with in the process. This double-CD is VERY well chosen... the songs  all rock and it is REALLY fun to drive to with friends! What sets the  Stones aside from any other group of the 60's is their ability to come up  with songs like Gimme Shelter and Wild Horses... Both of which are in Hot  Rocks. Hot Rocks 1 is the only Stones CD I own for a reason- it is their  best.
B000002J20|4.0|This is not a 35 minute Van Halen album.  This is a classic piece of Rock  Symphony.  It is long, but take the time to listen. Consider this as a very  thick novel.  &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; is wonderful.  The  other 3 tracks are just a notch below.  Sure, the original concept may be  tough to grasp but this music is something special.  I am a long time Yes  fan and I avoided this album for years because some other &quot;fans&quot;  said it was boring.  I disagree.  I think it is a classic.  I find the  Tormato LP boring.
0446310786|4.0|I missed reading this book when I was in the category 'young adult' and so  recently I purchased it and bought it. The characters are realistic and the  scenery is beautifully painted. The story really brings you back to the  time when you were 7 or 8 and really thought in such a happy, clear way. I  suggest this book for 10-14 years old.
0783232039|5.0|I have seen the first Child's play when I was 12. It was cool. Then I see parts of 2 and 3, and there are not so good. But one day, in a rotative  theater (That shows two movies at a time for 1 buck), I see this movie, and  it was great. Bride of Chucky never pass in Colombian's serious theater! .  But when I get out from the theater, I made a decition, &quot;I will have  the DVD version of this film&quot;, and when it comes out, I was amazed.  The Extras on this disc are great, come'on, this is an average movie, and  you get 2!  commentaries, a little featurette, Jeniffer's diary and so.  Also, this disc is the one of the latest Universal films that carries  spanish subtitles, I don't know why, but they want to sink us with that  crappy subtitled VHS, people, if you want to make money, put it. Otherwise  Columbia, MGM and Disney will get our bucks.
B000002ITG|3.0|All that you need to know is that this is not the best compilation of Zep's music to get. It is too expensive, the 3rd CD is useless and  obviously has no replay value since it is only interviews which all start  &quot;Hi, I'm Jimmy Page and this is led Zepplin.&quot;  The choice of  music is good but definetly not the best. THEY DIDN&quot;T CAPTURE the  SPIRIT of Led Zeppelin. They give hints to what they are about, but this is  a CD that really can't even be played loud while driving down the  interstate in a convertible.  But a different CD.
6305169187|5.0|I love this movie!  I loved it so much more the 2nd time I saw it, &amp; I already loved it the 1st time!  This movie has good action, special fx,  comedy, romance.  I actually think this is 1 of Bruce Willis' best movies!   Hes been so much better lately than he used to be!  He isn't JUST an action  star now.  This is an action movie, but not your typical one.  Bruce Willis  has been making some really good movies &amp; doin some really good roles!   This is one of them!  The rest of the cast done great also.  I especially  enjoy Steve Busemi!  He's awesome!  Its a true adventure everytime I watch  this movie!
B00000K3G8|5.0|Having watched the movie as a little kid, I missed the days of the Talking Heads by about 5 years. But that hasn't kept me from loving them! The fact  is, I have heard almost every CD that they put out... and this is my  favorite. I first owned this as a tape. But the tape broke... so I bought  the CD. And PAT McKENNA OF ALBANY STOLE IT! And so I ordered it again, and  now I can listed to the Talking Heads, live in concert on my way to work in  the morning. The best aspects of this CD is that the songs on the CD are  their best... and it is in front of a live crowd. You hear the enthusiasm  of the crowd in the background which inspired Byrne to be his most  creative! Out of all the Talking Heads CDs, this is the one I would buy  before all the others.
4893581198|5.0|Basic Kanji Book was compiled by four Japanese editors (Chieko Kano, Yuri  Shimizu, Hiroko Takenaka, and Eriko Ishii) for the purpose of teaching the  first 500 most basic kanji. These 500 kanji are divided up into 22 separate  lessons. Each lesson is thematically and grammatically organized for higher  connection rate in the learning process. Lessons include Kanji for time,  Kanji at the Zoo, Kanji for Adjectives, Kanji for Verbs, and many more. The  text is written to the goal of preparing the student for higher levels of  Kanji learning by laying out the foundations that lead to the understanding  of its inner workings. Though the text is complete in itself for  accomplishing many basic day-to-day tasks in written Japanese.<br />   The  teaching methodology includes stroke by stroke lessons, examples of each  character in compound forms, both \\"on\\" and \\"kun\\" readings, practice blanks  within the book to follow, transliteration of sentences from English to  Japanese, various writing exercises, periodic reviews, practical examples  of daily use for the characters within any given lesson, fun games to  encourage learning, and helpful illustrations for learning mnemonics.  Varied methodologies promote fuller language acquisition.<br />This book is  written for the student that has a firm understanding of both Hiragana and  Katakana though no prior knowledge of Kanji is necessary. The layout of  this book promotes effective self-study though this book could also be  effectively used as the primary classroom text for teaching Kanji.<br />   In  conclusion, few if any other Kanji learning books do as superb a job as  this one in making an otherwise difficult task both easy and fun. Quite  possibly this is the best Kanji book for high learning retention and  practical use on the market.
0425170349|4.0|Granted, the plot is out there at times, I thought the book was well  balanced between plot and action. The Rainbow concept is easy to believe  and Clancy has some great technical insight. I really enjoyed the book and  would recommend it to anyone who likes counter-terrorist action. Good fun  book.
0767903854|5.0|Together with Redmond O'Hanlon, Bill Bryson has become the top travel  writer in the world (Paul Theroux's books are a nightmare compared to Redso  and Bill).  Anyhow, what's nice about Bill is that you can imagine him  walking along as he tells you the story, and somewhere you know something  funny will happen.  In addition to having a good time, when you are done  reading you will realize that you have learned a lot on the way.  This book  is a wonderful introduction to Australia, so if you are planning on going  there, bring this book along your Fodor's or Lonely Planet.
0440234743|4.0|I enjoy John Grisham's books and this one does not disappoint. I thought  the characters were deep enough to be believeable, the plot was not beyond  pluasibility and the whole thing moves along quite nicely making it an easy  read. <br />From corporate America to deep rainforest jungles this book gives  you a great balance of dysfunctional families, action, mystery, romance and  suspence. The book was a lot of fun, but not quite as satisfying as some of  Grisham's other works. I would have gone five stars with a couple of minor  changes to the resolution of the story.
0060392584|4.0|This book is definitive proof that the Hypocrisy of our Society, &quot;teachers&quot; and religious leaders (major and minor) is scarring  humanity. Fundamentalists hate Marylin Manson....well, They Created him. I  have struggled to understand the Warped view of religion that I have seen,  throughout my life...leading me to read voraciously in areas of  Spirituality, Anthropology, etc.--and I have always been fascinated with  Musicians. Marylin Manson has proven, conclusively, that the  &quot;morals&quot; we are taught are not remotely Humanitarian in nature.  Society is based on how we present ourselves to others....not how we Truly  are, or believe. This book shows the Obsessive, Demented way in which we  are instructed to live our lives....leading to Repression, Psychosis and  all manner of weirdness. Marylin Manson simply tells it like it really IS,  instead-of lying abuot the Reality of how messed-up our Culture has become.  He does not paint a pretty picture, with white picket fences...he informs  you what goes-on in the basement, behind closed doors. This man sees that  few people are raising their children in a manner that is conducive to  creating intelligent, enlightenend human beings.... So, he is giving the  confused masses a forum to vent their frustration. I love Anthropology and  attended the Louisville, Ky concert that the locals fought against,  radically....until the camera crews left the streets. Thousands of  &quot;religious&quot; people shouted that this man would kill us, or turn  us into satanists....but, not ONE person waited to see if we survived. I  guess the camera crews didn't stay long-enough..... This book may inspire  you to study Psychology and pursue Positive Methods of raising children and  teaching children in schools, religious groups, etc. Fanatical adherence to  Dogma can create a monster.... You hate in others, what you despise in  yourself---Food for thought.
B00000IQMT|2.0|Let me start by saying how truely terrible THIS presentation of the score is.  It lacks any sort of coherence and LOTS of additional music.  While it serves as a listening experience on it own and seperate from the film, you  later watche the film and realize you've been robbed. Help is on the way!  It would seem Sony Classical came to their senses (and woke up to the fact  that they spent too much money for the rights to the score and did not move  enough copies) and announced that they will be releasing a full score in  November.  So you have a choice (a choice that I do not have anymore -  because I bought this inferior CD the day it came out) you can buy this  now,... or you can wait until a full score is released and experience the  music as it should be.
B000007PSR|4.0|Much like the REM album Dead Letter Office, Opel is the scrapings of Syd's unpublished studio career, for the good or the bad.  Songs like Opel and  the lower take of Dark Globe were more haunting than most of Cobain's later  Nirvana pieces.  Other interesting songs like Word Song (a string of  unconnected, barely rhyming words that seem perfect together), Birdie Hop  (a great sing-along song), and Milky Way are pieces of vocal mastery,  showing the range of Syd's post-sanity music.  Also, the stripped-down  version of Wined and Dined is probably Syd's best solo.  <br />But with all of  this treasure, there is a mound of trash.  Cows and Jugglers is barely  listenable (especially if Octopus is one of your favorite songs), Lanky is  like a toned down Stoned Alone from earlier PF times, and Swan Lee's Native  American story simply doesn't sound right coming out of a very British  Barrett. The rest of the songs are tolerable and enjoyable.<br />Syd is one of  my heroes, and my favorite musician, so I am a bit biased toward his  outtakes, but some of these songs were just the wrong flavour.
0060926317|4.0|This book is a beautiful insight and tribute to the Australian Aboriginal  way of life. As an Australian who currently lives in the United States, the  book enriched my pride and appreciation for the great natives of my land.  The book also provided me with feelings of sadness - sadness that this  world is so blind that it can no longer be a home for the &quot;real  people&quot;. The strongest message I derived from the book was that we are  the primitive mutants who have lost our direction in life to the forces of  busy-ness, wealth and technological advancement. And we have lost the  ability to communicate and heal and identify with our inner selves -  reading this book was in many ways a harsh awakening to the meaningless  realities of our backward society.
B00004THAY|3.0|B.B. King is &quot;the King&quot;.His voice is cool and strong and crisp  as it has ever been. Eric....Your still &quot;the man&quot; on guitar..but,  When you try too sing blues you sound like your singing through Phlem!  Eric, Play with the King but leave your voice out.
B000002UJQ|3.0|'Airbag,' 'Paranoid Android,' 'Subterranean Homesick Alien,''fitter  happier,' and 'No Surprises' are absolutely GREAT, KILLER tracks,  especially in terms of production and sound.  The rest of the album (that's  over half) is COMPLETELY MEDIOCRE and boring enough to put you to sleep.
B00000JKH2|4.0|The songs on this CD are well written and great to listen to. The only  thing I'm not sure about is why this CD is labeled as  &quot;punk.&quot; To  me, this CD is more Alt. Rock than Punk. But anyway, for any person who  goes out and looks for music instead of being told what to listen to by TV  and radio, this CD is for you.
B0000033WC|5.0|Except for 'Cool it Down' and 'Train round the Bend' which are mediocre,  the original Loaded (tracks 1 through 10 only) is a total masterpiece of  subtle, rock satire. 'Rock and Roll' and 'Sweet Jane' are the two greatest  pure rock songs ever written. The George Harrison snub of'Who Loves the  Sun' and 'New Age' are Reed's versions of Zappa's 'Broken Hearts are for  A-holes' philosophy. 'Oh Sweet Nuthin'' very subtly makes fun of people who  like to wallow in and romanticize their 'down and out' condition.  The  great thing is that, except for 'Lonesome Cowboy Bill' which is straight  satire and highly suggestive of Elton John, all the songs feature catchy  hooks that do not in any way give a clue to what is going on (in fact they  suggest the opposite). I can't fathom why this superior pop record was  unsuccessful when it was released; and word of mouth sure took a long time  to make it popular. When I was in high-school in the late '70s and 80s,  much inferior David Bowie and Stones records were everywhere, but I had no  idea that 'Loaded' existed.
6305537798|5.0|All right, I have now pegged myself as somewhat older than most who have reviewed this movie.  Yes, I graduated high school in the 80's, back when  John Hughes was making great movies that you wanted to watch over and over  to memorize the lines and marvel at the oddball main characters and even  more bizarre supporting cast.  This movie reminded me of those great teen  films.<br />I skipped &quot;10 Things&quot; in the theaters and even on video.   It sounded like another teen comedy, and they seem to come fast, furious,  and awful these days (maybe I'm getting old).  I finally saw the movie last  weekend on cable and I was stunned.  My wife wanted to check it out because  we had just seen &quot;The Patriot&quot; and Heath Ledger is just  &quot;soooo cute,&quot; so I grabbed the Sunday paper and plopped on the  couch preparing to be bored out of my skull while watching attractive kids  show their lack of acting ability in a poorly written extended music  video.<br />Needless to say, the paper stayed on the coffee table.  It didn't  take much more than the opening scenes with counselor Ms. Perky (&quot;I've  got a novel to write and deviants to see, so SCOOT!&quot;) and A/V  geek/Future MBAer outcast Michael Eckman (&quot;On your left are the  beautiful people...&quot;) introducing new student Cameron to the ins and  outs of Padua High to assure me that if this were indeed just insipid teen  movie cotton candy then it was at least cleverly written.<br />As the plot  develops, the movie gets even more interesting.  All of the characters have  that Hughes-esque &quot;quirkiness&quot; to them. Larry Miller as Kat &amp;  Bianca's Dad steals just about every scene he's in (&quot;Kissing is not  what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta&quot;), and Ms. Perky (&quot;A  bratwurst?  My, aren't we the optimist&quot;), Mr. Morgan (&quot;Some day  you're going to get b-tch slapped, and I'm not going to do a thing to stop  it!&quot;), and Mr. Chapin (played by David Leisure, theformer Joe Isuszu)  are absolutely perfect.  The one liners abound throughout (&quot;Remove  head from sphincter, then drive!&quot;; &quot;I have a d--k on my face,  don't I?&quot;) and they are delivered expertly for the most part.  Julia  Stiles and Heath Ledger are an appealing couple, and -- HEY! -- they can  actually act.  The character transformations do happen a bit too quickly to  be entirely believable and neither Patrick nor Kat really seem as awful as  their reputations, but I didn't care -- heck, any character development in  a typical high school movie should be headline news.<br />If you paid any  attention in high school English, you know exactly where this movie is  going, but the ride is so much fun, you don't care.  as Mr. Morgan points  out, &quot;Shakespeare may be a dead white guy, but he knows his  s---!&quot;<br />'10 Things&quot; could definitely be classified as a  &quot;chick flick&quot; with the cute romantic plot and the little touches  like Patrick's rendition of &quot;I want you, baby&quot; in the stadium and  Kat's climactic sonnet, but it doesn't come off sappy at all.  Even Joseph  Gordon-Levitt (the kid from 3rd Rock from the Sun) is tolerable.  I liked  the movie and have even watched it a few more times.  Great soundtrack,  too!<br />Now why did that never happen to me when I had detention...?
0446525537|1.0|I have read Nicholas Sparks &quot;Message in the Bottle&quot; and &quot;The Notebook&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed them.  When I picked up  &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; I was immediately intrigued.  This time my  version was the talking book type.  I popped the cassette into my car  stereo and after only a few minutes, the mood was set.  I immediately began  to dislike this book.  Mistake number one was that it was read by the  author, in monotone, who obviously has no professional broadcasting or  acting training.  I tried to get past that and really listened to the  story.  I couldn't believe how contrived and predictable it was.  This is  the sappiest book I have ever read.  I took a sudden dislike to wimpy  Landon Carter and the unbelievably geeky Jamie.  There is so much wrong  with this book that it makes me afraid to read the author's next novel.  If  I do get over the fact that this book was a waste of my time and venture to  read any more of this man's work, I will be sure to proceed with caution.
