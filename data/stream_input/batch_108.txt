B000J9YQOS|5|I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  He said they fit as expected, are very comfortable and are good quality.  Happy son-in-law!
B00TIU5YFE|5|Looks and feels amazing, best purchase!
B00KG712KE|5|Perfect
B00LL47E3K|4|This shipped to me in two days! I live in a rural area so it is even more amazing. I think the costume is a nice one for the money. The embroidery really makes it pretty. Yes, the fur is cheap but to get a better fur you'd pay a lot more. It's like having a huge, white dog that sheds all the time. Just keep a good lint roller handy. I do wish it had loops of some kind for the belt though. Also, you cannot wash this, dry it or even dry clean it, so I guess you have to never sweat or spill :-) I have yet to wear this but Overall I am pleased with this purchase.
B00IJ73IJQ|5|Very cute
B009SZJCZ2|3|Nice buh...
B00D68NOWE|4|And he absolutely loves it. Creepy as hell, but also hilarious. There's a slight latex smell to it, but not as bad some other reviews suggested. Nearly impossible to see out of though. Other than that, I mean it's a horse head mask. How can it not be great?
B005BP1MYM|4|This bra is very comfortable on me, I will recommend it for people and came on time too but is a little expensive for me.
B00KD6TGQK|5|Love them very comfy
B002HJ377A|5|My husband bought this t-shirt for himself after reading the overwhelmingly positive Amazon reviews.  Last night he wore the Three Wolf Moon with a cardigan over top because it was chilly outside.  As we were buying movie tickets, the ticket girl glanced up at him and said, \\"I like your t-shirt.  I see the wolf peeking out there.\\"  My husband, who is normally very reserved, glanced down at his shirt and realized only one partial wolf was showing.  He then looked deeply into her eyes and responded, \\"There's actually three of them\\"  all the while unzipping his cardigan slowly.  Now, we have been married for 15 years and I have never seen him flirt with another woman.  I was shocked, not only by the power of the Three Wolf Moon, but by the change that has come over my husband.  I'm thinking of hiding the shirt.  Or having him surveilled.  Haven't decided yet.  If Tank is reading this, this really happened.  I blame you.<br /><br />5 stars for style and power.<br />0 stars for not being family friendly.
B00FQE3YSU|5|Excellent shirt . Fits as expected. Sheds water quickly and is lightweight and comfortable.
B00JR129U2|1|Too small and thin cloth
B0043BXIVU|5|This bra is great for post breast augmentation, we ordered both colors (Black, White). They are more comfortable than a sports bra and the material is very stretchy and comfortable. They might be pricey to some, but well worth the expense.
B00171LECY|4|Ok, so maybe I should have measured my body first?  I ordered a L to start with.  I am a size 10 but have very full DD/E bust.  I could zip up the L but it was uncomfortable.  I am going to have to wear the dress a long time on Halloween, so I sent the L back and got the XL.  It fits the bust line MUCH better, but now it's big in the waist.  Oh well.  At least I can breathe!  The back two panels, alongside the zipper are stretchy fabirc which makes the fit thru the chest easier.  The arm holes are a little tight, but I am going to cut the under the arm, where no one can see.  All in all it's a very nice dress for the money.  It is long, as everyone else has said, but that's an easy fix!
B001AMZ7D2|4|I ordered this shirt for a family wedding so our 3 year old son could have one to match his dad. The shirt was soft, fit as expected and came quickly. Now he wants to wear it all the time.
B0068CJ0HS|5|Love these, very comfortable. I could not.find them in the stores after I purchased a couple pairs. I needed a few more so k came to Amazon.com and found them for the same price as stores. Best part is they were in stock and ready to ship!
B00AYD8OT2|5|These were a perfect fit.  My daughter wanted Miss Me jean shorts and I did not want to pay that much for them ... these were a perfect cheaper substitution.  They look great.
B0073WX3UC|4|She liked it and uses it often to keep her glasses in and she's in 3rd grade. Highly recommend it.
B0041OBH26|4|The plus size is very comfortable and not too tight even for more well-endowed women.  The leggings are a bit tight though if you don't have very thin legs.  The belt is flexible.  The mask is tight at first but adjustable.  The material is a bit thin so just be careful not to get snagged on anything - but one of the better costumes for fuller figured women.
B005YV0RIU|4|Great price,
B00D6DBQBK|4|This is a wonderful dress for the price. Would recommend to anyone. CC USA this was great fits perfectly. Love it
B0001YS728|5|Great bibs for the price
B00CH4OO54|5|I bought this robe for my son for the holidays, and hopefully he will enjoy it...I picked out a good-looking robe such as the one above...professional work...thank you.
B00NZ82LP6|5|Nice top.
B002JX1I4I|1|This is by far the worst \\"pleather\\" material ive ever had. Has a really strong chemical/plastic smell, feels really cheap, is far too stiff to really fold over properly. Avoid this one and get a vegan wares wallet. They are more expensive but MUCH nicer.
B00JMQ2PRE|3|Looks good
B00BCN90OQ|3|It was fine. I'm still waiting on my other products which I haven't received along with it :(
B00P4CAWX4|5|great product for price
B00FPEDAHG|3|This hat came in a small, plain box--no bag, no cushioning.  The hat itself had a large dent on the left side, the ribbon was folded over, and several threads were found dangling here and there.  I had to steam the hat, iron the ribbon and cut the those dangling threads--not a good surprise right before Christmas as this is a gift.  The hat otherwise is cute and I hope that the recipient enjoys it...
B00SZ0IYBO|5|Very cute and comfortable. I may buy another soon. Low price but great quality.
B00854N5U0|5|This shirt is exactly what you ordered with no flaws or anything different from the picture. Very much recommend.
B006SF1WQC|5|This is a fantastic nursing bra that gets better the more it's worn. The cups are stiff at first but they get much softer after a few wears. The support is great, but what I love the most is how natural the shape is - perky but no padding. I've been wearing mine in 80 degree muggy New Orleans and it has stayed so light. Great airflow to prevent thrush.
B008Q0E8FE|3|very delicate. easy to get it snagged and have it rip out. I use them as head coverings but really only work as an accent to the main scarf because they are narrow so they do not fit my entire head front to nape of neck and they are transparent unless you are using the darker ones. for other uses they are beautiful and lightweight.
B00C1329BC|3|Nice shirt. Low quality. I was expecting much better quality from the price and the shipping. Its worth about 1/2 what it cost.
B008E9Q0EE|5|Notices so much less wear and rust on the pop ups since we started covering them. This basic cover has improved the pop up's appearance and has reduced wear and tear in general on them. Good investment for not that much money.
B000MND7A0|4|Will jus get a slightly smaller size next time...
B007G0UQ5Q|1|For sure not what I thought they'd be. But they will work for Jammie's at least
B00NHU74IQ|4|such a cute newborn hat!
B00E1LAOGE|1|I ordered an XL the sent XS. Since the product comes for Japan it was not worth the hassle to send back. I politely messaged seller informing them of the error and they told me I was wrong even though the price I paid matched the price of an XL. This seller was rude and not helpful at all.  To top it off even if the shirt was the right size it looks like something made in a high school Home Economics class.
B00OXJ188M|1|Waaaay too small..
B00MPRAGWI|4|Nice underlayer for warm and comfort. This fabric is super soft so I really like them to sleep in too.
B00ER2LJR0|4|It's really soft and comfortable. The only thing is that it runs a little big. I'm almost 5'4\\", and the pants are too long on me. I usually wear size 2-4 short though so that might be why. I don't have very long legs. Otherwise, the pants fit ok. Still, even pulled over my pregnant 38 week belly, it's too long, and I don't intend to wear it like that. Once I lose the belly it'll definitely be dragging on the floor. I'll probably have to alter it. It has an elastic band and the waist size seems good and it stretches. The top also runs a little big, but I am rather petite. So, it looks a little messy and sloppy. Doesn't quite fit like it does in the picture, but my pregnancy chest size is only a small C. Once I lose the baby weight, the clothes might kind of hang on me. I do like the tank though bc the clasp is easy to do and undo with one hand and seems sturdy. It seems well made. We'll know later when I actually get a chance to wear it probably every day for a couple months. :p I love the feel of it, but it's definitely overpriced, as most maternity wear seems to be, especially because of the fit. :/
B00KCXSMC8|5|I have five of these tops and I love them all! I am 5'5&#34; measurements 34-26-36 and I got smalls in all of them. I mostly use them for workout tops and they work perfectly for that. I lounge in them at home and I use them to tuck into my skirts also. They're very versatile and the material is good, strong, cotton. I will be buying again and again!
B004ARZKJA|5|Good for everyday use -- hankies are hankies!
B00K0FBO4G|5|Very comfortable and nice heavy material
B005FVPVF8|5|Found this same dress at Macy's for a much higher price, so it was a good buy.  It was somewhat wrinkle when I received it.
B00GVMXM0Q|5|Shirt looks and fits great
B00BOWSFMI|5|great product.
B00I1AH5GS|4|Great product and great price, the only issue is that it's a bit on the snug side and won't last as long for my oldest son.
B00FJJ4BPM|5|They look just like the image, fast shipping, they are so freaking cute, and comfortable! My money was well spent on these, I've been wanting to own a pair of high-waisted shorts for a long time, and these are so perfect :) thanks xx
B000GZBIQ4|2|Great fit. Very ecomical. I would refer this to any of my friends deployed or in the US. THANK YOU.
B00LGRWKAY|4|The sleeve length is fine but the torso fits a bit snug. I'm 5 foot 9inches and weigh 190. I don't have a big belly so I expected it to fit a little looser. All in all, it's pretty nice.
B001F7P57A|3|I own this wig in black and use it often. I decided to purchase the white because it goes better with my Christmas costume. I must say that is much thinner than the black, the &#34;hair&#34; seems finer, and you can see my hair very obviously underneath it. The curls are very tight together and you can see base pretty badly. I ended up separating some of the curls to cover the scalp more.<br />The style is still pretty cute, and it works, but it's overall &#34;meh&#34;. Arrived in good shape however, it's kept in a net to keep the curls in good shape, which I appreciated.
B000NVWYV4|5|Champion makes some of the best sweats you can buy and this hoody is no exception.  Fits and feels great and will buy more.
B00JPONIAG|5|I love amazon. I can find everything that I need.
B00DYYD47K|5|I love the details, it's favorites' mom. Always Hurley has been my complete clothier.
B002OFEAL4|3|I cannot rate this product completely correctly as I received my order and the sizing was totally incorrect. I never purchased these items before so had to go by the sizing chart. My daughter is a 5T and weighs 50 lbs Q. According to her weight, she would wear a XXL.  When I received the item, I opened one and saw that this item could have fit a pre-teen child! Even fully clothed, these panties were gi-normous on my daughter. I really need this type of panty as my three-year-old is very large for her age but still having accidents. I will need to reorder but will have to guess on which size to purchase. It would be so much better if these could be sized based on the clothing chart for youngsters. When I receive the new order, I will update my review. (Remember that this rating is only for the sizing, not on how effective the actual product is.)
B009I4EOKQ|4|Great fit. I have it in several colors, best t-shirt bra on the market. The sides are smoothing, and the straps are comfortable.
B00CBIOL0Y|1|This states it's a long, it's not.  It also stretches after wearing for only an hour. I feel like I just threw this money down the drain.
B00JXXD5TI|2|Not a nice material at all. But I used it for my purpose. It is expensive for sheer material. expected it to be better fitting and quality. Disappointed.
B0092FXYIO|4|Straps were a little wide in the back and felt like they might slip when swimming. But other than that the suit fit great.  I hope it holds up to lots of chlorine.
B00GGH6668|5|Perfect! I bought this plain tank top and u costumized and it looks awesome!
B007WPNNJ6|5|Have use these before and like the Wigwam brand for quality sox. Will purchase again when the need arises. Fully cushioned fits well and soft to the skin.
B00KVPXEM0|5|Awesome gift for my husband!! He loves it!! :)
B00KON5M8I|5|This dress is lovely. I got it before xmas, which was unexpected, so was able to wear it on xmas day. Postage was very fast. Fabulous thanks sandi
B00U86QIES|5|Kimono is perfect for covering up when getting out of bed and is nice and light weight. Love the lace in the back for a little added sexiness. Everything fit perfect and is extremely comfortable. Fast shipping and arrived quicker than expected.
B004C55SPG|1|\\"Unbreakable fiberglass ribs\\" .. First use , 10 minute walk to work , now in the trash can in the lobby
B005WW0RSG|5|Great quality, very cute.  My son loved it.
B00JBXXEVE|4|I love the dress the only issue is it is missing belt loops for the belt
B00PX5XYEQ|5|They are great. They fit really good and are really soft on the inside material. But they aren't as high up the ankles like it shows in the picture.
B009CDEPY8|3|The chain is too short
B00CWNB83G|5|Awesome! They fit perfect(I have small hands, so they were a bit big). I was so happy when I got them.<br />#FrankIero
B004CM2DO8|1|I guess this would only fit a child. I understand that it's firm control but just looking at it makes me think that only a child could fit in it.
B00KC2WZ36|5|Seriously.  I felt so beautiful in it.  The underlayment skims the hips and the lace overlay just floats on top and it's just so very beautiful.  The fit is perfect, with the skirt hitting just at the knee.  I wore this dress to a wedding, but it could also go to a cocktail party easily, or with a suit jacket, to work.
B00I95KWPQ|1|my daughter - a very average newly turned 5 year old - cried when she put this on because it was SO small.  Such a hassle that the sizing is SO off.  It was more like a 3.
B006KDDNZ0|1|Wrists are too tight and they are, therefore, unusable.
B00K7U44PU|3|Very cut outfit; however, the black on this outfit has a washed out appearance and it seems as if the outfit was washed 1000 times.
B00F23ZYI8|4|This morning it was 17* F. I have several pairs of gloves that will not keep my hands comfortable on my 5 mile trek to work. This is the first time I wore them and my hands did not get cold. I wear a large and I bought an XLarge in case I had to wear a thin pair of gloves underneath the mittens. The thumbs might be too tight with another pair of gloves. I would have given 5 stars, but my thumbs were a \\"little\\" chilled on the ride. I might be expecting too much. At least I can ride my bike to work and not freeze to death. They blocked the wind sufficiently. I have not used them in the rain or snow. For skiing, I suppose they would be great as you are not going 45 MPH.<br />*Updated 1/25/14. After reading other reviews, the thumbs are too tight. They do keep my hands warm enough, though. I thought I bought an XLarge, but the size is L/XL. if you have Medium hands I would buy L/XL and not S/M.<br />On another note, warm winter motorcycle gloves are over $100. So I remain with my 4 stars.
B000N75SNO|5|This coin purse is really cute, and looks EXACTLY like the one that is featured in the Naruto series. It's built well and can hold many coins. My ONLY gripe with it is that it's kind of small - the one in the anime is a bit bigger, so I thought the one I was buying would be too. But, I suppose it's 'standard coin purse size', so I don't mind that much. Overall, I love mine and use it all the time!<br />:)
B00M7ODFEA|5|Very nice hat
B003HIHQ90|5|Spanx is the all time classic essential.  I am not heavy but I like to have a slim line in certain outfits.  It was an uncomfortable world before Spanx.
B0042LI3Y8|5|Nice quality hat. Wore it to work in and it let my head &#34;breathe&#34; nicely. Got many compliments and questions asking where I bought it.
B00ACIH29M|3|The product is much less bulky and heavy than regular Hanes, and being warm-blooded, I'm a fan for summer months.  One pair, however, has already worn a hole by resting against my button-fly jean fronts a few times when I was riding or active.  Regular Hanes without stretch are very apt to losing shape, turning from a long-legged brief to a bagging, sagging, bulky pair of boxers within a few hours of donning them.  They are also uncomfortably warm at times.  This is a much better alternative.  More color options and perhaps slightly heavier weights to WEAR better would be appreciated.
B00MBVQCL2|5|My wife loves it!
B00HWFCUOU|5|Comfortable!
B00OKXL8PE|5|very soft slippers for my 4 yr old granddaughter...she loves them! And they do have a non-skid sole.
B00B8BQMX4|4|I am 5'3&#34; and the stockings go a bit higher than I expected. It's fine.<br /><br />I do like how the insides of the stocking , where the design is, has some sort of silicon material that ensure it stays in place. Although, later at night I found some parts of it left on my leg...<br /><br />All in all, definitely worth the price.
B00YQE8GM0|5|I received this product free or at a discount for my honest opinion.<br />I got this for my husband for father's day.  It is well printed and of great quality and I think it will fit him well.  I ordered a Large instead of a medium but the quality is great!
B006PI0IUI|5|The wall is pretty good for $5.  I'd recommend this wallet to anybody.  It's much cheaper than buying straight from one of those informercial companies.
B00GLJA60S|3|It's ok... Nothing to complain about but nothing to get too excited about either...
B00J4AWM0I|4|Very Sparkly. I will use for my wedding. Not as good of quality as expected, but this will do...
B00BB8UWVC|5|My daughter looks awesome in this and the outfit itself looks great! I wish I could've found more outfits like this...with the shoes to go with.
B00B8P4YDU|5|Bought this for my husband. He seems to enjoy it
B0083QLQEC|5|Best coverage I have found and can't see the petals through your cloths.
B0049W7BD4|5|Very nice and entirely comfortable gloves to accessorize with.  The supple tobacco leather looks and feels upscale,  just what I wanted.
B00BJOY8QS|5|These are very cute and comfortable.  I bought these just in case my Halloween outfit's stockings tore.  However I ended up not wearing either one of them.  I did try these on and felt that they would do the trick.  I think they are very cute colors and would definitely buy them again.
B00GNJ7HDU|5|Very sexy, I ordered this for my birthday and I love it!
B0007YXTPW|5|excellent fit i could not ask for more
B00IYRPTD4|5|Beautiful!!!!!!
B00LQR94KI|5|Pretty.
B008X1FIXM|3|So it is very cute and fits perfectly but the bow is upside down and floppy. I am thinking about pinning it. It is also see through so a white tank top is needed underneath.<br /><br />Ordered a small<br /><br />I am 5'2 and weigh 115 pounds. Size B chest.<br /><br />I almost ordered a medium because of the Asian size thing but I am so glad I didnt.
B00B5VY0X6|3|Poor
B0050AFZ78|5|Good value
B008UB4TFS|5|This is so pretty as well as practical.  It is definitely not your dad's old fashioned looking thermal underwear.  The fit is snug, but is supposed to be so that it can be worn under other garments.
B0014DBY5C|4|I bought this item as a pledge to make physical and sporting activities.<br />They are super comfortable and soft, only they were a little big to me.<br />I recomeindo .
B00QEUL7ZW|5|Fit perfectly great material looks great
B006XLL90A|5|classy and clean look.
B007JYPT1U|5|Perfect
B00KTPQUM8|2|Cheaply made and uh............no length?  The zipper sticks out when they are fastened.  Pass.
B002EMDF2C|5|I bought these for my son and he thinks it is comfortable and they fit just right.  I would be ordering more in the near future.
B0081TUM3M|5|They're not &#34;soft&#34; fabric, but you don't want soft fabric for something like this because it doesn't provide friction against clothes you wear, and things will ride up. These are nice and stretchy, and worth the price.
B000A0WLQ6|3|It was ok doesn't fasten with a button like normal double knee dickies do fit was ok but probably won't buy again without button
B00TA3RJIE|3|I thought I ordered a medium but I got a size small, so I couldn't even put them on to say if they were comfortable. They look cute.
B00FNZNDM4|2|I opened this top up and LOVED it right away... but then I became instantly disappointed when I noticed that some of the embellishments were missing and the ends of the yarn (where the knots ties the two strands together) was right smack in the middle of the front of the shirt... very visible. I wasn't too bummed about the embellishments as I can sew them back on, but they were no where to be found in the packaging... making it obvious that the top was sent to me in that condition.<br />I LOVE AxParis and was super excited about this top, but I sadly had to return it as it was just a mess. I won't be re-ordering the top either as the description always say that &#34;one is left&#34; and I'm scared that it'll be the one that I returned :( Le sigh...
B00EL8HWA8|2|I like how the suit looks , but fits horrible! Way too tight up top, then super big on bottom! Cant wear! Isnt worth returning, cost more to return then to buy. Very unhappy!
B00GS3EEAK|5|This was a gag gift for my brother.  Added attraction he can also get use out of it.  Which I'm sure he will because he loved it!!
B00GIBUPHI|5|beautiful and warm.
B00COEGYMS|5|This tutu fits great, is the perfect size and looks darling on this little girls.
B003015GIM|5|Lovely Father's day gift.
B00BEOOHVY|4|Super cute! Wore it for a Halloween party and it was great! Sheds a little bit. Runs small. I'm 5'4&#34; and 130 and I got a small and it took some work to get in to but it was worth it.
B00WNISWT8|5|Love it but it's a lil small
B00F9A0CFY|4|Great material!
B00AYE8XH4|1|Should have believed other posts about this running small, as it certainly does. But would still be returning it because there is a big flaw in the fabric on the front of the vest. Very disappointed. Quality control should be better.
B00L7Q1WCG|3|Too large in the bust area than the rest of the suit.
B00J9A9QYI|4|They were nice looking. A bit small and after a few uses the seams ripped probably because of the sizing
B00AKSCK3M|5|These shorts are amazing for every time i do something active (basketball, gymnastics, working out etc.) I am a 6'1 190lb man, 32-34 in waist and the medium fits perfectly.
B00BXFK3KS|4|Love them! The purchase was so great. I'd buy again in a second. Pants look great and fit my bum. :)
B003DBIFW8|4|time to go back to those old days in HS gym class and see why we were able to<br />play hard , and not lose our balls.
B00293F6FK|3|I ordered these panties, and was pleased with them when they finally arrived.  There was a week or so delay from when I placed the order to when they were shipped - from Hong Kong!  After taking several days from the initial notification that they were shipped, I received a notice in my mail box that a signature was required!  It took another few days as a result to actually receive the item (which the US postal service had damaged the package in shipping but not the panties themselves).  They are great, feel great and look fine, but was it really necessary to require a signature?  If I had known that they were being shipped from HK and would take a couple of weeks, I definitely would have opted for a more timely alternative.
B00HQ33KVA|5|Nice quality. Arrived early. Very happy with it!
B00M1B0EFC|4|These jeans aren't too stretchy, are just a little too long for me but I haven't washed them yet. I'm 5'7&#34; but have kind of short legs and am wearing these with flats. The waist fits well and they are comfortable. I used to buy ColdWater Creek jeans but they went out of business. I'd purchase these again. They fit true to size, in my opinion.
B0052BALY2|4|fits my body in such a way that my belly looks larger than it is due to the pockets sticking out and the cut of the front, but very comfortable and functional and I love the quality of carhartts
B00JK70P04|4|Fit as expected. Good quality. Delivery was a little longer than expected.
B00GT5A3SY|2|see through don't buy
B00NGEFBOW|1|Size chart is not clear..hard to understand. Why it says big girls?..so dissapointed. I will never buy again
B00JGM7DEY|5|Love my pants!!! ♡♡♡
B003H2L75U|5|Whenever I saw a propeller on TV or in movies, I would always want one. Now I own one!<br /><br />The propeller works though you might need a really strong fan to make it move quickly.
B00GJKWDKK|5|Ordered these fuzzy socks before, ordered again, and will in the future, they're great!
B007R0MXME|5|its cool hard to get use to but i like it id buy another one its kinda ninja like its cool
B001SJY8YG|5|The wig was in great condition when I received it, and it looks just like the picture! So wild,so rock, so much fun! Thank you!
B002ABGL0A|5|Fits well 5 stars across the board
B004UXTDUQ|5|Runs a little big, but pants length is fine.  The shirt fits easily over childs head and is very soft.
B00M2EQHYA|5|I got nice compliments! Awesome purchase!
B00NUT1Z2K|4|These are great for working out or for having better support to your package. The only issue worth noting is the length or lack thereof in regards to the strap itself. The strap could be just a little longer which would reduce the pressure applied to your &#34;undercarriage&#34; making using them for workout more comfortable and effective. However for the price these are great for workouts where you need support. Suggest that immediately after workout you remove garment so that you do not have a sweat soaked strap resting against you which can cause buildup of dirt and bacteria that can clog pours creating other unsavory issues in a very sensitive region of the body. That aside I would still recommend these as they are comfortable for their purpose, and even all day if you are not wearing them for exercise.<br /><br />As a final side note, these may seem small when you first try them on. However as others have suggested, figure out the best placement of your &#34;gear&#34; in them. If you work with them and find the best position for placement them these will make you very happy.
B00HCMNI3K|3|It was a gift.  No feedback from recipient.
B00NYY8O5C|5|Needed this for our trip at Thanksgiving.  Fit perfectly and is definitely worth the money.
B00EFO8VRG|4|They're decent pants for the price. That said, I couldn't wear mine despite ordering two sizes larger. I am 5'11 and about 160lbs (72kg), fairly slender but I have some muscle on my legs. I ordered an XL (US M), hoping to get something around 31/32 US waist size. The actual waist size on the pants is acceptable (probably a 30/31), but they fit so tight on my thighs and butt that I can't comfortably wear them. They would probably tear within a couple weeks if I tried, as the fabric is fairly thin.<br /><br />If you have slender legs and no butt to speak of, these may look fantastic on you. Alternatively, these might be really good pants for a smallish frame girl. Considering the cost ($16 w/ shipping at time of writing), you won't be out much if they don't work out.
B0092G5TA4|5|Great PJs.  Super soft.  I ordered a 4T and fit my son (3) great he's prob like 38&#34; tall and like 35 lbs or so.  Super nice pjs and would order more in different patterns too!
B003VD1ZFW|5|The shirt fits comfortably. It was definitely worth the wait.
B00D3ZK23Y|3|but to small had to send it back suit runs small
B007MPF6XW|5|At first I thought my corset was too small but after adjusting the ties it fit perfectly I got the 22\\" waist cincher and it looks amazing yes you have to put it right under the bra line for that hour glass figure. I'm going to buy anotherone very soon.
B0018OFKJS|5|Item as described. Quick delivery. Thank you!
B00YMNOU5M|5|perfect
B003GXFTGS|5|Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good
B00CYY53Y8|5|fit as expected, very comfortable.
B00HYNA88U|5|This checkbook is top quality leather. You'll know that as soon as you open the box and catch a whiff of the leather aroma.
B00N2Y3J9U|5|I just got this today from Amazon and yes, still not cold enough here to put to use, but I tried this baby on and I will tell you if this don't keep your neck warm, prevent drafts going down thru your neck and losing body heat thru the neck area, nothing else will.  Double thick soft fleece that is super warm and will not make your skin itch after wearing it all day long.  I have a Minus33 gaiter made of merino wool, it's good, but the wool makes my skin itch after a time.  I work outside doing security work all year round so staying warm is a top priority.  It also has adjustable cord to make for a perfect fit.  I would recommend this for really cold temps and long exposure outside.  Skiers would love this thing.  I want to add that RefrigWear makes a few gaiters, this is the one you want to get, just make sure it says \\"Fleece\\", the other cheaper ones are not fleece.
B00EDS84B2|5|Love this suit on my son this is perfect for my upcoming wedding
B00UHMX184|5|Easy to unsnap. Came fast. Very supportive and sexy. Lol Well padded. And so comfy. Love it!
B00317CDVI|4|Photo is slightly misleading. These are extremely short. Similar to the 3&#34; Underarmor compression shorts in size. Was thinking these would be more like the 6&#34; ones. But seriously...SO SOFT. Its like sitting in a cloud.
B001YUU9U6|4|These fit but are a bit stiff.  I'm sure they will relax after a few washings, so glad for the heavier quality.
B00BYN0KAM|4|Just a little too short. It's not lined but it's pretty well made. A fun dress to wear for a casual party.
B00LKW2RNK|3|Top too small, arms extremely small, pattern different from the picture, top material not stretchy at all. definitely buy a couple of sizes larger than you normally would
B008JUFGD4|5|I loved its!
B000J4E8O6|5|Your product has excelent quality and were received very fast. Thank you
B00689X9NW|2|I'm about 5' 6&#34; 185 and couldn't get this buttoned. I wish they had sizes to chose from because this would be perfect for a trip to Disney or somewhere that you might have to wander around in the rain for a while and want more than a poncho. they only had one size fits all to chose from.
B00E19YFM0|5|Husband Loves....Slightly loose in back side (butt)... After washing, just right....Color holds well too....Oh did I mention sizing was right on!  MTT
B00G36DV6U|5|Bought for my husband.  He really likes the shirt and it looks very nice.
B003TFE5H2|5|Great bra. This is my &#34;go to&#34; for all outfits. I usually buy the gel backless/strapless, but these are so lightweight that they are my new favorite. Just make sure you wash with soap and water after each use to get maximum wear.
B00DC69SS4|4|Stylish and very fashionable!  If you want to look your Sunday best or the bell of the ball this is the perfect item to wear. More importantly its very comfortable to wear.
B006B5W6O6|4|Have purchased these pants in the past from a different supplier and was always satisfied with the fit so purchased again through Amazon.com.<br />These pants are a great dress alternative to jeans, they are neat looking and hold a good crease, but unlike dress pants there's no, &#34;butt droop&#34;. These pants fit well and hug the body although I have found that they do run small, I have a 36&#34; waste but purchase a 38&#34; waist and they fit great.
B00I36KOZ4|3|Loved the look an feel but it runs a little small. Even on my head it was tight so I can't imagine how tight it was on my fiances head.
B00UZW6W28|2|I suggest buying a size or two bigger, it runs small. Be prepared for the shirt to shrink.  It says to tumble dry low, which I did, the shirt still shrank two sizes to small. So I've waisted my money and will at it to the 'skinny' side of my closet.
B0018OKZW0|5|My husband will only wear Levi's 501 shrink to Fit jeans, they are somewhat hard to find, in his size, in stores where we live.   So I'm especially pleased to be able to order them on line and get them quickly and at a very reasonable price.
B007X24IVA|5|The fabric is a little on the thin side for my taste but other than that it is super cute!!!
B003O68AHC|5|Nice quaity wig, fits very well. Pleased with the shape and color. Held up very well Halloween night with the rainy weather we had.
B00L9E6I0M|4|Beautiful dress! My daughter looked gorgeous! Received a lot of compliments and it fit perfect! She's 3 but wears size 4, and I got her size 4. The only issue I had was the flower on the front part of dress fell off. It was glued to a thick safety pin so I used the pin and pinned the flower to the dress. I'm going to try and sew it to the dress instead of gluing it.<br />Other then that, I really recommend this dress!
B00GMEXC7Q|4|Fit is what I expected.  Fabric is very shiny, surprisingly.  Would have liked these better if less shiny. Deducted a star because they lack a jigger button closure, they have only a hook and bar. Over time, the hook and bar are going to loosen making it necessary to visit the tailor.
B00JJIEQ7W|4|Materially is really soft and doesn't have issues with bunching.
B00IT07I4E|5|Sooo soft! I am female and generally wear a M or L in women's. This fit great.
B00GRHC7M4|5|Cute and warm jacket for Spock fans!  The cuffs are a little snug, but maybe my wrists are too big?
B00MCLH2O2|3|It's not as it appears in the photo.  The neckline is much higher than expected. :(
B00KAW3DIE|5|Very pleased
B000E0T4P8|5|I purchased one of these and after receiving and trying I came back and purchased more.  Bra is very comfortable & doesn't have those irritating underwire supports.  There is a small support insert on the side of the bra under the arm but it's not irritating.  I haven't had any problems with itching associated with the band or any of the bra for that matter.  I haven't had the bra long enough to rate it's durability but will update if I have any problems.  Easily washed using manufactur's instructions & delicate cycle.  If it stands up to the test of time, I will be buying more.
B000W4RH14|5|Beautiful color and great quality.  My son loved this for his birthday.
B00D7LTT42|1|too small not  satisfied
B00DC8GJ20|5|Love this shirt! It is soft and looks exactly as pictured....Sizing is correct. I usually wear a medium size and that's what I order and looks as pictured. I am 5'01&#34; and 140 Lbs.
B00F2LMN3Y|4|It was so cute and comfy  but definitely ran a little small.
B00E46K88K|5|good
B00HMWYZ2S|4|It fits nice, not really a slim for me. I'm not much a muscular type (athletic fit). And below are rest of the details.<br />Height - 5. 10ish<br />Weight  - 175+ lb<br />Shirt size : 40 ( I pick the slim fits).<br /><br />I brought it in summer so can't say how warm it'll be. But seems to be of decent/good quality and I can wear a slim fit or thin sweater underneath. It gets tight around armpits and don't think a thick sweater or loose shirt will go with it.<br /><br />This is not for every one, if you are not muscular +tall or with broad shoulders. It might fit you.
B00KDZ7MJE|5|Very nice shirt. Would buy again in a heartbeat... Great buy, and my sons favorite brand and happy son, happy mom...lol. Thank you for the quality and the bargain and the service!
B005NX1ZXK|4|The fit is just right, meaning no room to gain a pound. I ordered a large when I'm a size 6 easy. The length is about 1 inch to long (I'm 5'4\\") unless you put on a bulky shoe or one with a slight heel.
B000V0EPXC|5|Great scrubs. Color was as expected and the fit is true. Good size pockets and the fabric is comfortable.
B001UI9R0A|1|This fit like a junior size.
B003VWAH8E|4|Good construction but runs a bit big. I ordered by my waist measurement and it is still too big... Not enough holes to tighten it.
B00509NSFU|3|This shirt has a nice graphic from the TV series on it. Unfortunately the shirt itself is low quality. These are budget Anvil tees. The store I work at has these printed for the painters that buy from us. Total cost for the printed shirt is about a fifth of what this shirt is selling for. These shirts are so thing you can see you hand through it with no back lighting. I would't spend this kind of money on another one.
B00MTUYEAG|1|very very small
B00CJQHUUG|4|Usually I buy clothes from store after trying it on. So I was nervous when I ordered this dress. I got it within a week after placing my order. I ordered the black one, L size (I wear US size 8. According to their size chart, that should be size L). Actually I really love the lace pattern of this dress. The fabric is pretty good and soft (unlike some cheap fabrics which are rough and itchy!). The length of the dress is not that short, but it would be perfect for me if it was 1 inch longer. The reasons why I took 1 start off are-<br /><br />1. I wish it could be little bit more well fitted. But it is NOT poorly fitted. May be my size is in between Medium and Large.<br />2. There was little bit of extra fabric along the V neck line. I trimmed the extra fabric with a scissor so that the neck line looks cleaner and more prominent.<br /><br />Bottom line, I loved the dress and so does my husband. He says I look great in it! I am glad that I bought this dress.
B006W1UMJ0|5|I really wasn't expecting much for the price; however, I was very impressed. I have worn the dress three times already and each time I get so many complements on it. &#34;That's such a beautiful dress....Where did you get that?&#34; I'm very happy with it. If you use it as a dress you will want to wear a slip under it because it is not purely opaque. It wouldn't be too horrible if you didn't have a slip but I would recommend it. If you are wearing it at the beach I would say don't worry. The best think about the dress is you can wear it to the beach and then put a little jacket on and it's nice for work or going out in the evening.
B00NHYOCFK|5|This dress not only fits perfectly but is absolutely beautiful!
B00AIK7834|4|I love the color and designs but expected them to fit a little larger than they do. It is almost as if they are a large for teens. I didn't check the dimensions for the size I ordered as I liked the design so much. But don't remember if it was there or not. Like the fabric.
B002XGZT5K|5|So happy! Love the fit. Love the look! Love the color! Love the feel! And absolutely LOVE sleeping in them!
B00QT0F06O|5|Fits perfect
B00KRYPQTY|4|If you are top heavy order a size up so you can zip it up. Usually a medium but I got the large.
B00FX9ZCR4|5|I would have liked a button at the very top, but otherwise, this is great.  It is flattering and classy looking.
B00AO9JUFI|5|Like the extra length.
B000IBH7M0|5|A relative of ours told me about these and suggested I get my husband some.  Got them for my hubby for Christmas.  They fit great.  It is cold up here in Wisconsin! My hubby wore these to snow-blow the driveway and walkways, and said they worked great! He wore them over jeans and a shirt, and wore his Carhartt coat on top.  He said he was actually sweating they were so warm!  I know he can't wait to try them out next deer season!
B000SB314S|5|to  be honest it was 1 size small for me i head to purchise XXL instead of XL   But i am looking to shop some more in  Woolrich quallity best  contineu like this good   exxelent
B00AFL9KL4|5|i wear these with my boots to church, they look good with boots and a skirt, they are soft and warm.
B00974AX66|5|I've had other, more expensive, firm compression socks, but they haven't worn as well as the Gold Toe version. They are a little tough to put on, but if you get you foot into them and take it slowly you'll have a sock that is comfortable and doesn't creep down.
B008BNNA9G|5|EXCELENT
B002XF7NSW|5|Owner of the Checkered Choclate/Brown pattern scarf.  I bought this scarf as a gift for my fiancé, now I want one too.  *PROS  -Super soft.  -Really warm.  -Not itchy like a wool scarf.  -Good length, not too short or too long.  -Rich colors.  -Wide design makes it versatile.  *CONS  -None.
B005SN5I56|5|Near perfect undershirt.  Only thing I would like better is to have it about 1&#34; longer, to compensate for the normal shrinkage over time and my specific wearing preferences.  (Yes, it will shrink a very small amount as all shirts do.)  Fit, feel, taggless, are all great.  Doesn't overly &#34;stretch-out&#34; over the day as other shirts can.  No undershirt on the market should be less quality than these, but they are there, so start here and save yourself the hassle of lessor products.
B00PI1TMOQ|5|Sexy!!
B008XHXSS8|5|My daughter-in-law said the items ordered from Motherhood are comfortable and make her feel special.  This is her 1st pregnancy.  I bought clothes from Motherhood when I was  pregnant and love the way they felt and lasted. I thank you and she thanks you.
B004QJI5OO|5|This is a very nice product the material is of a good quality and I would recommend getting it if you would like a very good Waist cincher.
B009YRMZXU|5|I hate wearing bras,but it a necessity. So I look for comfort. I found it. I have 3 of these now.
B00MI3XV6C|5|Looks lime the picture. Very pretty.
B00NYN8E26|4|Nice shirt. Looks exactly like the picture, the color did not change after washing it.
B00P0CHMYA|5|Super cute and pretty great quality for the price!
B00HC99N6Y|3|Decent quality scarf, a little shorter than most that I own but it's pretty good for the price. It doesn't hold a fluff very well though.
B00I98IBO2|1|So cheap looking. Mesh is sloppy i love you and unevenly cut. Very itchy and hard. It was large for my daughter you wears 5t/6t and we bought a small.
B00ACIGVJE|5|My hubby really like these,comfortable.
B0086TOFD0|5|A
B00J0KF0EM|5|This blouse is very nice, the fabric is soft and fresh, is perfect !, the love !! certainly buy you many more! I'm at 130 pounds and size M I stay perfect. recommended
B0007CKN4O|5|Great jeans
B00KR9I2TU|3|It's ok.I like it,but I didn't love it.Too wide for my taste.Little bit long too.But still is a good brand.The color is lovely.
B00BQWWBVW|4|I liked it. However, it is slightly long and a little big at the back. I have already washed and worn it twice. It looks nice.
B0029F1X28|5|My son loved the costume shirt/jacket.  It came with 5 gold pips (although we didn't expect those and had ordered them elsewhere).  The Next Generation com badge was a plastic pin, so it is easy to remove.  The waist was smaller than the shoulders, so I would say the fit is exactly as you see in the product picture.
B00CIUULOK|5|I absolutely love the way this dress feels on! I just wish I could have fit in it! It feels like silk and has flow!
B00MAFX3CA|5|Was that i expective
B00KXTG5H0|4|Does it's job
B00HSNZBSS|3|Great craftsmanship, high quality leather,  but wallet is too bulky.
B007PSEDEY|3|The nature of this soft fabric shows the body defects because of the body cling.  I will be wearing it under a cardigan sweater so it works out great.  A little less Lycra would be desirable for my old body. :)
B00F5XVQ50|5|I am very particular about the t-shirts that I wear and because of it I always have a hard time finding something that I like. When I came across this shirt I just loved the way it looked and I have always been a fan of Southpole. I would recommend it to anyone  that just want a semi-simple shirt at a reasonable price the is above average quality.
B00KY7B45O|5|Big hit Christmas. Morning
B00MQVLDD4|5|Fit nice no compliants
B00CWZUH3G|5|Good
B00KYCPE0K|5|All I need now is a new jacket to put on.
B00LUM19WA|1|I've never seen an xl that small! Usually xl is almost too big. So disappointing.
B00R6RV5PE|5|Love this so much super cute and comfortable.  It's all so soft the tags are the only ruff thing but I think that could be cut off.  The fit is perfect.  Really beautiful.
B0069WHV96|5|Fits good way hot looking
B00G7SNFPG|3|I was surprise by how warm this jacket/coat is. I wore this winter in MN -14 degrees and it kept me warm. It also kept out the wind. My only issue is that it is &#34;TOO&#34; light and so does not feel sturdy. We'll see how it holds up. The outside chest pocket is fake. The zipper hood is also fake but for the price I guess you get what you pay for. The style is nice.
B00B2AEFE4|5|I got these as a gift for my wife. She loves the material and fit and I will likely order a second set.
B00466IDWG|5|Good shirt, solid design, great to wear.  Our son, 7, loves it.  True to size and washes very well.  Definitely recommend.
B00EKQSDKO|5|Beautiful dress . This store needs to be looked at. They have quality clothing at great prices. I ve been shopping at another on lne store for over a year, No one could get near rhere prices & quality until now. Sakkas has and their shipping is much quicker. Ty Sakkas for a job well done. This syore shows lots of promise.
B00MIJN882|5|This product is made in India.<br /><br />I liked this Jacket because of High quality,stylish and very warm.<br />There is no such a thing I didn't like about this jacket.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006IYV1LY|5|The shirt itself was a little larger than I'd have expected for an XL, or maybe I'm just getting smaller (not).  Over all, good quality shirt that didn't shrink funny after being washed.  Good weight fabric, so should last.  Hopefully the picture won't fade out too quickly.
B000LK43XO|4|It is hard to find a reasonably priced extra firm girdles. This one is just right on almost everything.Only area for improvement is that it would be nice if it had a side zipper.
B0006USFMO|5|Wow!  I've been testing out new jocks for the last week or so, and I gotta tell you this one is GREAT.  It FEELS like a jock should feel, where you're supported but it's not digging or pinching.  The 3-inch wide waistband is neither too tight or too big, and has different but distinctive green and black stripes.  The pouch is so HOT, it really cups and supports you, in just the right way so you're not feeling too constricted.  My test for all Jocks is the treadmill to see if I'm bouncing around too much, or if there is too much movement which could cause abrasions.  This one passed with flying colors.  Its a great woven pouch, that's absorbant and breathes well.  Definitely gives Bike a run for its money.  A GREAT, GREAT JOCK!!
B009JW4XIA|5|This jacket was a birthday gift for a buddy of mine. I liked it so much I’m looking to get one for me.
B00IP90L2A|4|Material is thin so you can see thru the costume. So wear dark sweat pants and a dark t-shirt. Other than that looks great.
B003K1LXB6|5|Good fit not small like a lot of other hats on coats covers your head and enough room if youre layering underneath also wearing another hat.
B008M7LVTW|5|Exactly what I expected
B000PK3R7I|5|My Niece absolutely loves it.
B00MBAI7S4|1|Don't recommend this product
B0018OKYXA|4|Perfect gift to a young man. He likes it a lot and it fits with jeans or casual pants !
B00BUBGJ1W|4|The red bleeds through along button openings after washing.  Otherwise this is a very well made shirt.  Very high quality.
B00OPLD3DG|3|Nice jacket but it was very small.  I purchased it 3 sizes bigger because I thought it would be small.  My daughter is very slim and normally wares a size M/L.  I purchased a 2x and it just fit.
B00IF3KAFE|5|Very soft and very comfortable Henley. My daughter loves it as well so I suspect won't be in my drawer much longer
B00B2PMF4G|5|Intend to wear this light scarf with a new lavender tee this spring and summer. It has a seam rather than a continuous loop, but that does not matter. When you wrap it it looks good.
B00631VHSE|5|The perfect nightgown for the warm summer nights.
B00CAUZANU|5|My husband purchased the jacket I hinted to, checked my closet for the size needed and didn't let me know the santa was bringing it . that's why we're still married after 43 years.
B0040GJTNE|5|I don't have this exact shown color of the jacket, mine has a black zipper instead of the white. I've been wearing one that I bought in 2005 and use it every winter very frequently. It still pretty much looks as if it were new and feels the same as when I bought it over 7 years ago. I can't even read what's on the inside label because it's been washed so many times. Now that shows they know how to make a quality product.
B003YHL5QY|3|I bought this with a specific dress in mind, and it did not match well at all.  It just seems like a cheap product.  I have not used it yet and I do not think I will, but I paid so little for it that I can't really return.  Some things you should see and touch before you buy.  Live and learn.
B003ECTUHK|5|Freático fit!
B00ID4ROGI|5|I like socks that are comfortable to wear, stay up, and are not too tight.  These are the perfect socks and it's a great value for the money.  I have so many different socks and have paid twice this amount for 1 pair of designer socks that don't feel as good.  I've never written a review on socks before, but, these are very nice socks if you don't mind the docker logo on the heel.
B00AWUAOHC|5|This equine scarf adds a pop of color and has a classy overall appearance when worn over a sweater/top or under a blazer/jacket. A nice gift idea.
B00IY4NNR6|1|its rubbish.. i dont even wanna give 1 star. the item that i received not even look a like in the pict.. totally wasting money
B00DJ629E2|5|Just what we were looking for
B006SRT5F0|5|Very light weight, but very warm. Wicks well, also. Without spandex, the shirt hangs a little looser which I find more comfortable that the tight fit of the spandex models.
B00P28QSGK|3|This fits small for larger chested women. I think it's just the style but the bra itself is very cute.
B004LCTYOG|5|I love it. I get more complements on this T Shirt then anything else i wear.
B003E2QYU6|5|Seriously ... he was so darn cute in this outfit.  A little too big, but he still looked amazing!<br /><br />Thank you!
B00P9PNE8Q|5|These are beautiful!! Fits my daughters head perfect and has room to grow with her. Well made and silky soft on her head and they do not leaves marks on her head. These are lovely!!!!
B00BQLB0S8|3|i like it but it would be better it if was tighter around upper body
B006KLDVRC|5|Perfect size fast delivery not china!!!
B00TPX0M9M|4|I bought this in 1X and 2X- I'm an 18/20, and never know which will fit (5'9&#34;, pear shape).  For me the 2X was far superior, since it wasn't tight over my butt.  I wanted the tunic to hang loosely- as it does on the model, and I get that with the 2X.  I ordered the white and the blue, but I'm only keeping the blue.  I thought the white was less attractive, in person.  I also worried that with it's long length, if I sat down on something, I'd stain it and ruin it- and since I want this for outside wear, white is probably impractical.  The blue is very bright- it's an electric blue- but it's very flattering.  The arms are long, but not too long for me- however I'm tall.  I do not think a short woman would look very good in this- it would &#34;swallow&#34; you.  It's a garment for taller women.  The length is marvelous and slimming!
B00S8410QI|5|I was pleasantly surprised by the material, fit and quality.  I was worried about the sleeves being too tight, but they weren't.  Thx
B00AQOHHA6|5|Wnoderful
B00IGHATEG|4|Nice
B00MZHL1U4|4|These are a heavier fabric than my other capri leggings and just fine for all but the hottest weather.  While they are quite fitted, they do not fit like skin.  They would be perfect for yoga or exercise.
B00A9SBSWW|5|Beautiful ties. I receive lots of compliments when I wear them.
B00T126P5C|5|Shore Club hit the jackpot when they made this tankini! It's bright and happy -- just like it's name! The fit is incredibly flattering. The top offers coverage while the tummy is light and flowy. I used the Size Chart to determine my size. I typically wear between a 20-22 and ordered a 22. The tie in the front gives the twins a little extra oomph. For the first time in many years I feel GOOD in this swim top! Bonus: It doesn't look like a swimsuit and can be worn with jeans or capris!
B00332FJZ8|2|The bamboo/viscose boxer briefs are the end of ball soup!  These are great for all-day and especially working out as they keep your stuff dry and in place due to the fabric on the inside.  No cotton getting sweaty then bunching between your legs with these.  The bamboo cloth keeps your legs from rubbing while working out, yet is a lot more comfortable than the alternative spandex based athletic underwear.<br /><br />--- That was originally.  However, after wearing them for some time, I've come to find that the mesh lining that holds things in place is designed very poorly.  It is a mesh material with a seam on the edge.  The two sides meet very narrow at the bottom kind of like a \\"V\\", so that basically the mesh edges will rub the bottom sides of your junk.  This won't be apparant at first, but after several months you'll definitely notice the effect!  \\"Why are my balls itchy and feeling raw on the lower sides???\\" (insert joke)  Hmmmm wow just where the mesh sides just so happen to be... what a coincidence!  I even tried cutting just the edge of the mesh off to see if it would help.  Slightly, but not a total solution.  MAJOR design flaw here.<br /><br />Basically, these will eventually rip your underacarriage to shreds if you wear them everyday.  Either rotate them out with other underwear or just wear them for athletics.
B008MCZ2LK|5|The graphics are Awesome, my son's favorite shirt. Cool ass shirt.
B00D4K3WXU|4|very cute jacket well made the only thing I don't like is having to button it instead of zipping it.
B00EHVSPK0|3|Shirt is more form fitting than I expected.  Probably will not wear it as I do not like my shirts to fit tight.
B000TA529K|4|Fit well<br />not tight like many others ive bought<br />now my go-to work sox
B008MWJ3NI|5|This pants are really good, when they arrived I thought they would be a little more warmer, but well that is what i expected for the price, havents used the yet for skiing, but i hope i dont get cold.
B008F6GDIY|5|Gift
B0011V06Y2|1|Material is scratchy making it uncomfortable to wear.
B002QRBLVC|5|my husband really loves these belts and had been trying to find them locally to no avail.  he really hates being on the computer, but while looking for something else on the amazon site, he ran across his favorite belts.  thanks so much for making them available on the site.  i think he really likes the way these belts stay so flexible, and he literally wears them out.  also the fact there are no pre-cut holes makes for perfect adjustment.  i think he had his last set (tan and brown) for over 10 years wearing them almost daily!
B00E258F7O|4|Shipping was an eternity but when I picked them and tried them on my girlfriend said they looked good on. I am 6 feet tall and these are more likely suited for a basketball player. I need to hit the tailor so another 15 bucks on top of the price but otherwise, I like em.<br /><br />Can't really tell that there are pads inserted which is a plus.<br /><br />Buy em and get them tailored, unless you are Lebron.
B0012GOXMM|5|I used this card holder to store gift and discount cards.  It actually holds a lot.  Great for what I needed it for.
B00AHUUA2G|5|These are great socks for backpacking
B009JW8PPC|5|I bought this for my brother as a gift. He loves it! He said the hood can be worn out as shown in the picture or can be tucked in and worn more like a track jacket style.
B009JXDDO4|5|Soft and warm.  My husband loved it. Been looking for a nice hat for a while and this is the nicest one we found.
B00KD5BV64|4|LOOKS MORE LIKE 3-6 MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE BABY SIZE.
B0060NIDPA|5|Super cute stocking stuffer for a teen-aged girl!
B005IVCCZW|4|I really like this jacket. It fits well and it is very stylish inside and out. Out here in southern California it keeps me really warm during the winter. But when I travel to Chicago and New York, it's not as effective (it's definitely more of a fall coat).
B005SIQUL2|3|I like the leather its nice, but the quality of the wallet is poor, not much care in the details and its a slim wallet right? well when you put your money and cards inside it gets wider than I expected....
B00E8RDN3C|5|We ordered this for our girl (9) and it's a perfect fit. It's snug but not too small, and the quality is great. We spent a long summer on the coast of France surfing and it was holding up great! Will buy this brand again.
B0053ESMOE|4|The earmuffs are very nice, fits well on my head while others I've tried were too short to cover my ears completely. The stitching is nicely done and the faux fur on the inside is soft and warm. My only problem is with the aux cord. I don't know if it's because of the mic on the cord, but every time I listen to music on my iPod touch 4g, the voice control function would activate itself at random and stop the music, and then I would have to \\"swipe to cancel,\\" only to have voice control pop up again seconds later. I thought it was because I pressed the button that turned the mic on, but it continued to happen even when I stayed away from the button. And the mic didn't even work when I tried to speak into it. I was extremely annoyed by this so I switched to a different aux cord, and now everything works fine. I really wish the mic didn't keep turning voice control on though because I liked the original cord.
B00R98N1P2|1|This dress looks nothing like the picture.  The beads are spaced few and far apart.  I bought at 2xl and it's more like a size 8.
B002XKYQKK|5|I listened to the other peoples reviews and ordered these in size 10 instead of my usual 8, to make sure they fit. I am 5'4\\" and 140lbs. They are skin tight and come just to my ankles, which is the exact fit I was hoping for. I ordered another pair in size 12 just now. They feel pretty low-rise to me but that might just be due to my big butt
B00KFY4DK4|5|I looked forever for a flightsuit costume for my daughter for halloween that wasn't super expensive. I came across these pajamas that were reasonably priced, made from sweatshirt material so they're warm and had a cute little hood! I wouldn't let her sleep in these as the hood kind of seems strange for PJs, I don't want extra material near her neck while she's sleeping but for around the house or what I needed them for it was perfect. I sewed on a few patches and it was a great cozy costume!<br /><br />The only concern I had was the size since toddler clothing doesn't usually come in small/medium/large but I got the medium for my 2 year old who usually wear's a 3T and it was a good fit. It was a little snug in the diaper area but for a potty trained 3T it would probably fit perfectly!
B00FX9ILMM|5|I got this hat today and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was more awesome than I expected it be.<br /><br />On the back, it says &#34;Remember Alderaan&#34; which I wasn't expecting, but love. Love so much, #canteven
B00AKJKAAG|5|I bought this as a present and it was great. The fabric has nice quality and is exactly as shown in the picture. Great gift for a baby shower. The size is for a newborn baby. Excellent packaging and delivery
B0032Z8R5U|4|Nice design; its fashionable and the fabric has a gold shimmer. A head turner that is true to the product description of &#34;a new, sexy look to the everyday suit&#34;!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the material is a bit itchy.  So its not something you would wear very regularly.<br /><br />Also, the sleeves were quite long for me, so I had to hem them and sadly lost the nice design at the end of the sleeve.
B00NGSPREM|5|It is fine. Not a high end product... but it's nice to wear when needed.
B006UH6GMI|5|This is the best simple long sleeve tee. The v neck isnt too revealing, the sleeves are long (I'm 5'7), the torso is long and put it through the wash with no issue. Definitely would recommend.
B00BC9NXZW|4|Very pretty…loved the color!  However, it fit a little big and just felt awkward.
B00A7QMTIS|3|For small head.  Perfect for my daughter. Wish there was a larger size for us fatties. Thats ok i guess.
B006STXN10|4|I am about 5'4\\", 145-150, small busted with curvier bottom half. Based upon reviews, I was unsure whether to order a small or medium, but went with a small considering comments about the dress being roomy in the hip area. I also preferred a snug fit. The dress was definitely roomier than I expected for a small, but fit very well. I think for my particular shape, a medium would have been too baggy to get the figure hugging shape I was looking for. The fabric was nicer than I expected, and the cut of the dress also allows for a little ruching up to help camaflouge the tummy area - got it in black of course which also helps.<br />All this said, when I stepped out of the bathroom with this dress on to check it out in the full length mirror, my boo did let out a \\"whoa, damn\\", which is the true test. He commented a couple of times over the course of the night how much he liked the dress. I did find the top doesn't stay draped off the shoulders as in the pictures - it kept creeping back up on me - but it is cut to be low on the collar either way. It is definitely a sexy dress and I'm very happy with it overall.
B002HT4OIQ|5|Uncle Fester, It was everything I thought it would be the fit was good. The mask was comfortable to wear
B00415HS4Q|4|Order recieved super quick. Great service, Socks fit fine and really help on wooden floor that was causing falls in regular sock.
B00JPNGSJA|5|Excelente
B00GSISGKO|5|Perfect for my corny dad. He loved it.
B002I9ZGH8|5|lovely warm long coat.  the faux fur is lovely and soft.  the coat is very warm and perfect for the US winters.
B004M6XUI2|5|This is a very good wallet, it is made of quality leather and has lots of room for cards. I like the removable ID folder so you don't need to carry the big wallet if you are going somewhere where you don't need all your cards, just your ID.
B007AB5YT4|5|This slip both fits as expected and feels good on you!
B002KXYC2C|5|This leotard has become my new favorite staple. I teach and take Ballet, Tap and Jazz classes 4 days a week and this leo holds up well to washing and drying.  Love the high neck and built in shelf bra - great for keeping the girls in!  No more unintentional peep shows every time you bend over!  The leg is also cut a little on the high side offering a flattering leg line while keeping full coverage in the back.  Size does seem to run on the snug side - wouldn't necessarily order a whole size larger than normal but if you're falling between sizes, err on the larger side.  Overall, a great basic leo!
B004497M2W|5|I'm a total NCIS nerd, sadly, and this was just too funny to pass up as a fun around the house tshirt.  Great quality, fast shipping.
B006JML5XE|5|This coat is beautifully made, just as all the other Via Spiga coats I've had. It runs a tad small, I am a 12 and the size large is a bit tight. It has pleats in the back, so cute, they do not stick out to make you look heavy, just look cute. It is high quality, and I would recommend this.
B003ZW6J78|5|I really love these shorts, they fit great and stay in place during all my various aerobic activities, running, squats, lunges, jumping, stretching, floor/ab work, etc. They don't ride up on the leg area and are snug yet very comfortable, not to mention flattering! They fit very well, I am 5'4 and they come a few inches above my knees and come up to right below my belly button (I can pull them up more if I'm having a muffin-top day). I ordered a size XS, I wear size 1 pants, 110 lbs and they fit perfect! They seem very durable and I'm sure they will last me years! I would recommend!
B005H264FQ|5|Great Shirt.  Arrived as expected.  Fits as described.  Love the shirt!
B000KBCQTC|1|This shirt is not a tall at all.The shirts say tall but after I washed them, I couldn't wear them anymore they were too short!
9789879296|5|Nice roomy shirt.  I'm 6'2&#34; 260 lb, and the XL I bought fits great.  Extremely comfortable.
B00J7IF358|5|Nice. What I expected
B00M2PD2B0|4|It has more snaps than I expected. It may take a few minutes to figure out which snap goes to which especially for someone who is not used to  the style. I watched my mother in law trying to figure out which snap goes to where. It was kinda funny.
B00HJXDKUS|4|The hat is made of quality material and fits nicely.  My only complaint is that it is more of a true purple than a deep purple.  I was expecting a draker color like in the photo but overall it is a nice hat.
B009314Y6I|3|I've had lots of real and faux fur in my life. I've sworn off the real stuff since about 12 years ago, and can tell the difference. I'm not convinced this fur is faux, and being from China, I'm not convinced the labeling is true. It's unfortunate, these are really cute, but the fur I'm pretty sure is real and it squicks me out. I'll be giving these away.
B00BKIESVS|5|My husband likes it.<br />Its excellent.
B00FXZYPAS|5|Beautiful dresses!  Colors are perfect.  Going to use these as bridesmaid dresses
B001DFT7KA|5|Looks great, fits great
B00FXLJV88|5|This is amazing better in person none of the sequence is falling off i do believe its well made i do plan to buy in a different color!!!
B002ZBIOFA|3|I got this for my 10m old and I ordered the 6-12m size.  My son was only 19lb, so I figured the 6-12m size would be perfect since he still wore some 6m old clothes.  When I received it, it was a little tight in the legs, but luckily, we only had to use it once.  So if your baby is bigger than the 50th percentile, I'd suggest a size up.  Otherwise, the outfit is very cute and comfy, not bulky and hot like a lot of other baptismal gowns.
B001FOR2D8|1|Fabric is fine.  Buckle is a piece of JUNK
B00BOZTQOQ|5|My favorite thing about these mittens is that they STAY ON.  My son is currently wearing the 0-6 months and they always stay securely in place.  The mittens are super soft and cozy and function as both scratch prevention and as an extra layer for cooler weather.  I've washed and dried these a few times and they have not faded or lost shape.
B00IT3CQZM|5|they are more like  very high end sweat pants comfortable look is modern, ill buy a second in black
B004IM0GDW|3|Nice dress great material
B00ENZ63EU|5|I decided to get this particular binder because of a few recommendations and I must say, it lives up to its expectations. I wear a 34B and decided to go with a large. There was no struggle getting it on, there are quite a few hooks but there was no problem with them at all. I didn't realize how well it worked until I looked in the mirror to adjust it - you'd be hard pressed to get me to take it off! I look completely flat. My only qualm is that the arm holes are quite small. As I will purchase this product again in the future, I will make sure to get a size XL just for that reasoning. It is extremely comfortable, even on the highest setting (my preference). There are no breathing restrictions, and coming from a choir kid, that's a HUGE plus! The other thing is that whenever I receive things in the mail, my mother likes to read it and see what it is before giving it to me. I double checked, and nowhere on the package does it state what the contents are (the package is quite small, too). It simply states &#34;fashion accessories&#34;. Over all, I am extremely happy with the product and 10/10 would recommend it to a friend. I'm about to, actually!
B0083EZDJI|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B0036FQK32|5|I'm just really skinny- a beautiful dress- well made- love it- I need boobs thats all lol
B001VOH7KU|3|In fact, the size seems much smaller than the picture.  The color is SKY BLUE...not at all like the color in the picture.  I wanted the color in the picture.  For the price, I can make it work.
B0009VQB9Y|5|This Natori sports bra is fantastic.  Fits perfectly. Will use for everyday wear, very comfortable. Great support, beautifully made. I love it. My last sports bra was Patagonia (no support,uniboob,cost me $50.00, threw away).
B004V2N6NQ|4|Typically wear a 1X in all other eVogues stuff. Took others advice and got a 2X and glad I did.  If fits perfect.
B00GY8BIF8|5|Probably one of the best underwear out there for those who like trunks.
B005CSNTJY|5|Received this a day earlier than expected.  Fast shipping.  Fits perfectly.  Just as sub freezing temps hit, I got my hoodie.  Keeps me<br />cozy warm at work and looks great.
B002G9U3WS|5|I have three pairs of these, and for better or worse, I wear them every day.  I used to wear the classic Dickies for work, but kept blowing the knees out.  Though these cost about twenty dollars more, they last much longer and are well worth it.  Some of the reviews have issues with the stiffness of the material - yes, they are a bit stiff, but this adds to their durability, and after a few washings they loosen up and are quite comfortable.    I like these pants because they are relatively unique, at least here in Austin, TX.  You don't see many people wearing them.  This must be due to the fact they are hard to find in retail stores.  A lot of places carry Carhartt clothing, but only one place in town carries these (a genuine farm and ranch supply store on the outskirts of town).  Though it might sound lame, I find this uniqueness kinda cool...
B00CKGBGQE|5|Very nice fit. The length is perfect
B00DSN7SRY|5|My son loves his beanie cap.  I was worried it wouldn't cover his ears but I was wrong.  He really likes it!
B00EJHOPY2|5|excelente producto
B007BHXBU6|4|Only 4 stars because I just got it and have only worn it once.  But so far, I'm loving it.  Looks well made.  Nice, soft material.  Very cozy.  The three tops that I've bought so far have been great.  I think I will be ordering more things from Patty Boutik.  Very cute and feminine.
B0089NHQZ2|5|I have received many compliments on the shirt; I ordered it 2 sizes large, but it fits snug.  I would definitely take care with this one.
B00FO9Y5G2|5|Fits perfectly and so soft, I'm very pleased
B00OB9F2KO|1|Do not order this dress unless you are under 5ft tall and weigh no more than 95lbs<br />This dress is so short, my t-shirts are longer.  It is also completely see through so its like walking around naked.<br />The dress doesn't really look like the picture either. I ended up giving it to my 6 year old daughter because it actually is a dress length for her.<br />Waited forever for it to come and cant even wear it. Super disappointing. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Trust me, waist of time and money.
B00MML8YDU|2|Top fit fine, however, the pants fit around my hips and I prefer around my waist.
B004YXXDIK|4|Cute gloves, nice pink colour.  Good fit, purchased for our 5 year old.  She hasn't yet used on her bike.
B0074T7U4E|4|Very nice shirt fits well and is very comfortable I would recommend highly to everyone who asks about thus shirt
B005MEHZ2K|5|Exactly as pictured. Fit seems accurate but this erik be a gift so theres no telling just yet. Arrived in only 2 days; 4 days ahead of estimated arrival. Def recommended.
B00AWJ6QD4|4|I have only used this once so far, but it fits true to size and is comfortable for the most part.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because for anyone who has any bust at all, this is a bit awkward to get used to with the straps because they sit a bit funny on the side of your chest which feels weird under your arms.  It isn't uncomfortable, but takes some getting used to.  And for those having trouble with the zipper, the sticker on the product when it arrives new in package states that you are not supposed to unzip this before getting into it.  It says to leave it zipped and pull it over your head, and just use the zipper to take the garment off so it won't pinch, as it fits snuggly. Overall I am pleased and found that the fit runs true to size for the size chart.
B003T9XGHI|4|Costume is nice construction. Thick fabric. Gloves are a bit of an awkward fit as other reviewers mentioned, but doable for a costume worn for only a few hours. Suit also fits a little tight in groin so order a larger size for taller men.
B009URT8M0|5|Don't bother reading the negative reviews. This is a great shirt with a great fit.  I should've bought two before the prices went up again.
B00OU8DXUC|5|It Actually Has Good Quality Material. Great Product, But My Hair Is Just Too Thick. So The Beret Doesn't Hold All Of It, But It Does Hold Most Of The Back So I'm Satisfied.
B00655SD62|5|I loved the shirt, fits as expected and very comfortable.
B002LSI2WM|5|I bought these for work after looking all over locally in the stores for plain black pants. Unlike popular pant styles, these pants have a waist which could be a little tight for some people. They are comfortable though and fit me well. Even the length is just right for me because I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh about 125. I bought a 4 regular. Usually pants are too long for me and I have to cuff or hem them.
B00A5H736M|5|this shirt looks great on guys of all sizes, my husband is a 2xl and it looks great and is good quality.
B00FHDVIH4|5|Finally a glove for kids that actually stays on and keeps snow out. Wish I had found these years ago (and had them for my childhood)
B00EKEBJJS|1|It was too inexpensive to return, but they had sewn the bow on the underside of the hat.  I had to use a seam ripper to take it out and correct the issue.
B008X1FOH2|4|I'm 5'5&#34; 145lbs, normally size 7/9, 36C, and I ordered a Medium. The dress was loose on me, but it fit my friend who was a cup size larger than me.<br /><br />The dress was very nice and of good quality. Good length - not too short, just right.
B005FPMZGM|5|I bought these when I first found out I was pregnant because my due date was Thanksgiving. They are currently put aside due to a miscarriage. I cried when they came in because they were so cute. I can't wait to use them on one of my babies someday.
B00862LKTY|4|These screen protectors do an adequate job of doing what they are intended to do, protect the screen. They came with a cleaning cloth and cardboard squeegee to help apply the protectors and get out any air bubbles. They did help, but there were still some air bubbles left. The anti-glare, matte appearance was nice, there was still glare, but nowhere near what I would have had with a typical, non-anti glare protector. All together I would recommend these as a nice, lower cost alternative to some of the pricier screen protector options.
B008JRTJYO|5|Was a little in anticipation about the fit BUT fits like custom tailored!! Got a great bargain and completely fits the bill!!
B00O8YDLF0|5|I love this sweater and receive compliments whenever I wear it
B00FAYHQXU|5|Love the quality and length, I ordered a 6 and has to return it for a 4. I can't wait to get the 4's cuz they are darling shorts I know I'll wear a ton this summer!
B00CTJ5DU2|5|I'm a big fan of Joe's Jeans, particularly The Skinny fit.  Great jeans at an amazing price ($49!)
B00LEEMWXY|3|Cute shirt but I expected slightly better material from the picture. Just a slightly faded cotton tank top.
B001EVX9DE|5|Works great
B002GCY1SM|5|Spiderman, Spiderman, <br />Does whatever a spider can <br />Spins a web, any size, <br />Catches thieves just like flies <br />Look Out! <br />Here comes the Spiderman
B00U4KRBYY|4|Other pants from another supplier fit well.  These are just a bit small.
B00G4C2N5I|5|This is the second shorts I have bought and I love it. Great fit and quality.<br />I recommend this. A great shorts for beach or anywhere. You can dress it up or down
B007GZO940|2|This was made weird and fit weird in this color.  I got this in other colors and it fit much better
B00O0SIWFS|5|Fits as expected, very sexy with my favorite heels. Looks great even with my blue Jean jacket.  Bought more than one. Length is perfect.
B00CAUZ8ZA|5|great denim jacket! I am 5'5 size 4-6, bought small and it fits perfectly
B004DEI2QI|5|They are great
B00ITO0U54|1|This product is terrible, the fabric and very poor, the image that pops up at amazon and beautiful, but when I saw that ugly, bad clothes made, I'm disappointed.
B00CA8F3MK|4|As other explain only issue the back its open but the quality its very good! :) I had a small issue with 1 ear little losse but not big deal
B00HQ1SX7I|3|The color is lovely but the texture was not what I expected. The texture of the tie is what I expected for the shirt.
B0050AFYQK|5|Highly recommended seller
B000W22YLE|5|Got excellent Deal on 4 pair Bib Overalls. Excellent Shipping! Best Prices ever on Amazon. No Ones Price can beat Amazons Price plus many times Free shipping,got to Love it! I Love Free Shipping!
B000N8S1C8|5|a good bang for the buck ' just 1 thing i did not care much for it was the pockets on the bib they are a little to narrow and to shallow . the pockets need to be about 1 inch deeper.<br />but that's super minor would and will purchase this product again thanks
B00EUX3T06|1|Was expecting more. Seems like something you will let your friend put together for you at home (in a rush). Bought Adrianna  Papell  before & been very please.  Will get my money back!!!!
B00N91144S|5|Very pretty fits good I ordered one size up
B000FQ7NKO|1|I purchased 4 of these as I loved the size and compartments. I've used 2 and the belt broke within 2 hours and it just fell off. Not really safe with money inside.
B0038OZPTG|5|Wonderful blouse, thank you!
B001FAV4CM|5|Just like a pair of new shoes, its rare to find a cap that feels like an old friend from the first day you wear it.  I put it on and after 6 hours I'd forgotten it wasn't one I'd had for years.  Amazingly comfortable and as my friends said it looks great.
B00292W7MQ|4|good bra, quite supportive, easy to close and open with one hand, I would order one size larger than you think because band under chest is a little tight
B003NX8CME|5|This fits a little snug in the shoulders. However, it should be noted that I do have somewhat wide shoulders.
B003BR25N4|4|I ordered this Derby to add to my hat collection of which I wear from on a daily basis.  I figure; a hat collection is not a hat collection without a Derby Bowler.<br /><br />Now, first off, this hat is oval shaped not round, and coupled with my head shape the medium was a bit to large (brim rested on my ears)  Luckily, I have a top notch tailor who ( as before) padded the inside of the sweatband to get a more useable fit.<br /><br />The hat itself is of outstanding quality; napped wool felt, fully lined, and leather sweatband ( i personally like the fabric kind). The sizing issue was a slight bother, but, hey, such is life when buying from the store on the shore (Amazon).<br /><br />Due to the oval shape of the hat, I recommend that  you purchase this style of hat in person.<br /><br />Why four stars?  The trip to the tailor.
B00009MVIA|5|I bought these shoes for work to wear with my pant suits.  They are very comfortable and have a sexy little edge to them.  I am more than pleased with the value, comfort, and versatility of these shoes.  They can be worn to work, the club, to dinner, wherever...I love them!!!
B004LEUVY6|5|I mean, it doesn't have a FIT. But my roommate likes it and she uses it on her lanyard. Hopefully it will graduate up to her car keys when she gets a car :D<br />The quality was good, the color was good, and it hasn't chipped or faded or anything.
B00MYLCDYY|4|ON Time and fit as expected
B00GUBBTZ8|5|Great value and great shorts. Fit great, are comfortable and seem sturdy so far.
B0064Y4CFK|5|I already had a pair of these and wanted another pair.  Love these shorts!!
B00LTOONQI|4|The is better than i thought for an outfit under 10 bucks. The shirt feels like a soft Tshirt and the prints are very bold. My daughter loves it. I could potentially see the bow falling off in the washing machine, so i may stitch it on as right now it is floppy and only connected at the center.  It is just a tad to large for her, (i ordered her L, recommended for 4-5) but my daughter is somewhat small. But it is totally wearable. I have attached a few images. I think the colors are a little off due to my sunlight, but i found the colors in person accurate to the image i ordered (rose)  I think perhaps the shorts are a little awkward, but my daughter doesnt think so. Since i cant really explain why i feel that way, maybe im wrong :D Anyways, i recommend this (and will revise to give a full 5 stars if it washes repeatedly without issues) and will probably buy one for my friends daughter in another color.   *update* its been awhile now, and i do see considerable fading on the shorts. They are still cute and my daughter loves it, but the shorts look like a very &#34;dusty&#34; now. I wash and dry them like any other piece of clothing, so with more care they may not fade. They are play clothes so we dont mind much :D
B008BHSRIG|5|Shirt looks and fits just as in photo, except that the neckline is not as wide. You can still wear it off to the side but it requires a bit of stretching. All in all, it was a great purchase.
B00BUS66FY|5|look and feel like real leather!
B0038JSD9A|5|Excellent purchase. Good quality sweatshirt. Pretty thick. Sharp design. Highly recommend and looking to purchase another design.
B007P0HCMC|4|Shipped very quickly and was exactly what I wanted. My groomsmen and I are wearing these for my wedding and they look great!
B00E61C7LY|5|The best! This is the best sports bra I have ever had. I decided to give this bra a try since it had good reviews and looks like it would do what I needed it to do - 1. Support, not compress 2. Separate, not bundle everything together (which looks so weird and feels gross when sweaty) 3. Fit my small frame and large breasts. I am very glad that other women took the time to review this item because it helped me make my purchase decision. I have tried a number of different brands and styles over the years and even resorted to wearing 2 sports bras at once just for support while I'm active and moving. It is more expensive than what you can find in most big box stores but it is not a waste of money because it works and is well made! My normal band size (in the UK brands like Panache) feels a bit small in this style, but I kept it anyway since it was a good fit otherwise. You might try one band size up when you buy yours.
B005PF85L6|4|It's always hard to find a shirt that will fit around my neck. This makes it much easier. Collar not too tight and making the shirt unbearable to wear for extended periods of time.
B002JY8BLK|5|Love them! The fit is great for my small ankles/calves, I would recommend these for anyone with smaller legs :)
B007WHW5XE|5|Perfect. I wear it often.
B00JAC0R0C|5|Love It!
B000MXB4VE|4|A comfortable and well fitting bra.
B00OBOHR3O|2|Cool shirt but it fits a little smaller than I expected.
B00IGNTCN4|2|The shirt itself would be amazing but mine came with a sleeve that smaller then the other.
B011M11BGC|5|Very comfortable.
B000MXB7A2|5|I have never bought a bra without trying it on first, but the reviews were so good for this one that I took a chance.  I am so glad I did!  This is by far the best bra I've ever owned.  It's extremely comfortable and fits perfectly.  It's very pretty on, but still gives great support.  The thickness is just perfect and the straps have never fallen off my shoulders.  I just ordered another one because now I don't want to wear any of my other bras.
B00DQ5J8JA|5|It's hard finding our 12 year old son shirts that fit and he deems &#34;comfortable&#34;.  He really likes this shirt, wears it all day and to bed.  It's been through a dozen washes already, but looks brand new.
B00O1TWZBI|5|this dress fits perfect
B000BPLSF0|5|Fit absolutely perfect. For this price you'd be an idiot to pass up. I got two different styles and can't wait to get more. 👍
B000WTOCTY|5|I've ordered several pairs for my husband in a variety of colors. He loves this style.
B00BTPPN3O|3|This has a very weird fit
B00LPSFPEM|3|too small
B00T87X7RO|4|but it is a fitted shirt so that is why.  nothing wrong with the shirt
B00HQZ500W|4|Nice socks, holds well after months of washing.
B00CIREPXG|5|Fits as expected.  My daughter loved the material. It was not itchy but very comfortable.
B003M518II|5|I got this in black and natural.  I had to iron out the creases as it was shipped folded.  Looks cute, and is easily shaped.  The extra detail with the threads makes it classier than the   plain sunhats you see.  Also, I have a small head and this fits even without the inside ties.  worth the extra money ($38 is a bit pricey for a basic cotton sunhat)
B00MY71A92|4|He's just a Lil fat one thousand
B00LN9XQQC|5|great style, fabric and fit
B00GV4C1TM|2|Do not buy, save your money
B00CXJ3WMY|5|lovely winter skirt. it's nice to have a work piece that's bright and pretty. there's very little stretch to the material which i like. it's nicely made and i would definitely buy this brand again.
B008A5FYBW|4|I am 5'10\\" 160 lbs with an athletic build. I wear a fitted dress shirt of 15.5, 32/33. The French Connection shirts are Euro sized, so I bought a small. If it is a Calvin Klein shirt I would buy medium. I like the contrast b/n the blue and black. The colors are subtle, but attractive. The only issue I have is with the shoulder area. If I lift my arm above my shoulder I can feel the stress on the seam b/n sleeve and underarm as well as the length of the shirt riding up. Other than that it is a good shirt, esp. at the sale price.
B009TW3RA0|5|My 6 yo wears a 6-7 or 8 and this dress fit her perfectly. We ordered an 8 from another company but had to return, way too big and reviews said it ran small.  This dress was true to size and a great fit. My daughter loved it for her farther/daughter dance she attended.<br /><br />The material was actually very nice, I was really surprised. Sewed together nicely. Even came with a nice shaw she was excited about wearing.<br /><br />Would definitely buy from again.
B002DCNWZ8|5|My hair isn't really all that gray, yet.  No really, it isn't.  So I need something to help me look festively ancient when I'm playing Santa for the kids.  And this is the ticket.  Really goes in and blends well yet a simple shampooing in the shower makes it all wash away.
B003IFY78A|4|I have big legs. I am 5'8&#34; and wear a size 12 - 14. They fit perfectly. I will now be purchasing the other colors.  :-)
B007P1S1GW|5|The colors are just like the picture. They are thin but didn't tear after a night of dancing with my shoes off... what more could you ask for? as far as the sizing goes, I'm 5'3\\" and about 150#. They were comfortable, although just a little short at my waist.
B000BUKJV4|5|I bought this for my husband very late for an \\"on time\\" Christmas delivery, but it arrived the day before. :)  It is a very nice sweater and perfect for my husbands needs.  He wears it to work over many of his shirts.  He could not be happier!
B00BBT3WTU|5|I love love these jeans.  So much I ordered another pair.  They are snug when you first put them on but loosen up a little after awhile and are stretchy so they are really comfortable.  I would recommend you buy 2 pair.
B0038A78VI|5|As a large 40DD woman that works for Big Brown, I needed a comfortable bra that I could move and work in that didn't dig into my sides and kept me from jiggling all over while keeping me cool. I am very pleased with this choice. I had read in some of the reviews before I ordered some women ordered a size smaller, I didn't I ordered my true size and it fit great. Ladies it helps in your reviews and thanks to those of you that did indicate your size as we all know you can't try on something your ordering online.
B0015N8S1Y|5|Great Hats.  Fun, packable and keeps the sun at bay
B00OV2BP2U|5|I bought these set for my son. It's pretty and fitted. My son like it.
B00N85PIL0|5|My ten year old loved this beanie. Great material looks, feels, and fits just as expected.
B00BLW2Q8U|4|Cute!
B00BILHRFG|2|It's cute but does not sit on my daughters head properly. I've tried bending it and moving it but it just doesn't work. Don't waste your money on this one. There are plenty others out there.
B0036MMQ06|5|This t shirt is awesome!  Great quality cloth, great printing on this shirt too.  A great addition to any Cannibal Corpse fan's closet.
B00FYERIDO|5|very pleased overall  prompt mailing  good quality,  fit and  value for the cost
B000XZ8SV0|5|nice color nice heavy t shirt
B00OPEBVGY|5|This hat is super warm! I walk early every morning and I have to say it definitely keeps my head from getting cold. Plus it looks super cute!!!
B00FB6J39W|1|wear this size in all other pants/shorts but could not get much past knees
B00DIGK0BC|5|very nice
B006TWTHUW|5|I was borrowing an evening gown from a friend for a pageant I competed in and the front hem was a little too long. The 6 inch heels were the perfect height and kept me from accidentally stepping on the dress, and with the ankle strap and tall platform, I didn't have trouble walking in these at all! No pain for a short wear time and they worked out perfectly! The she's were affordable, true to size, and arrived just in time! If you need some extra height and aren't trying to spend a fortune on big name designer clear heels, this is the way to go.
B00N1HAAQI|5|It is really comfortable
B000FV2PRK|4|This slimmer lives up to it's claim of smoothing out back fat. It is nice to wear under anything that either sheer or clingy around those areas. You won't mind someone coming up and hugging you or placing their hand on your back....no worries about all that fluffy stuff they would normally feel.<br /><br />For me it is way too hot to wear in warm weather. It would be trading a smooth torso for a red sweaty face!<br /><br />Also...mine does roll up at the waist. It helps to have it over the outside of your pants/skirt rather than having it tucked in....if your top is worn outside and is long enough to cover it.<br /><br />I think it is a little pricey but sometimes it is just that important to look your best!
B00MMPG43I|5|The size was pretty precise.  I got what I paid for and I am happy with the product.  I ordered the black and the blue pinstripped suits.  The original price was $120, the Amazon price was a steal!
B0009MZV94|5|These socks really keep the heat in your feet without feeling static cling. They feel as if they give you a lift in your step. Like walking on good thick carpet. Purchased these several times, never let down by quality.
B004FZY16A|2|The fabric wore out quickly
B005PL6OR2|4|Very sexy and fit well, but does seemed over priced for the quality of the material. feels a little cheap.  Otherwise I am satisfy with my purchase.
B00A8D65P8|3|I absolutely loved the top pieces!  They flowed beautifully but the slacks were so thin and see through.  I would have preferred to have them lined and ended up returning.
B0097XEZ6Q|3|I can usually fit a size 14 without any problems, however, this was somewhat small.  Not very forgiving in terms of stretching unlike your typical swimsuit.  It definitely holds things in place.  Good color holds up well in the washer. However, not likely to purchase again. :(
B008L57STC|5|I love yoga pants, and I love scrubs. These pants combined the two! They have plenty of pockets for all of the junk I have to carry at work, and they are more flattering and comfortable than traditional scrubs.  They are a little long for me but I will never buy a different pair!
B00O2DBWQ2|5|Super adorable combo! The hat is a thin fabric so it just rests on your head in the back rather than sticking up at a point and was super comfy. Scarf isn't to thick but isn't to thin, not itchy and keeps your neck warm. It was such a great buy for both that I got my friend one for Christmas as well as myself.
B00K6XW6S0|5|Where can this go wrong.  It is Star Wars and on a t-shirt.  I loved the artwork on this one when seeing it online.  Had to have it!
B002AN6B9O|5|Came in handy for all of us for a Breast Cancer Walk
B003M8I6CQ|5|Fits great and is comfortable.  I am 6'4&#34; 180, tall and thin and these give me a comfortable fit and plenty of length even after shrinking.
B00EMG3V5Y|5|These are great for the first few weeks after bringing baby home. after taht you need a bit larger size. These fit my co=worker's baby boy who is a newborn. They are soft and wash well. Gerber makes good products.
B00DWXYPEY|5|Great purchase. I ordered a day before and I got it the next day. It was perfect for the birthday party
B000LMRFX2|4|Looking for a nice Handkerchief for my new Tuxedo that would look nice and not cost a small fortune. This was it.
B00COFPKEK|1|This blouse was like having a roll of sand paper draped over your shoulders arms and body.  It fits horribly and is NOT flattering at all.
B000R0HJ9S|5|As a Dachshund owner I just had to have this nightshirt, Very comfortable to sleep in. Would like to find it in another color. It washes well and in the few years I've had this night shirt, the color hasn't faded.
B00DGM7IR2|5|Love the outfit- especially the tutu! It's a nice quality and adorable outfit. We can't wait to wear it soon!
B0084N1QTO|5|Very nice tie. I just brought three more ties. This tie is made of Better quality than high end stores.
B00EC88BTS|3|cool
B00ET1V640|2|I bought these looking for a comfy pair of undies that came up higher than the lovely post baby belly that hangs (gross, but some of you ladies knows what I am talking about!!)  I used measuring tape and the sizing chart to ensure I was purchasing the right size.  They are too big.  They go way above my belly button, and I feel like they go way to far up my back.  I expect underwear to stop above my rear end... these keep on going.<br /><br />They are cut way more french style in the legs than the picture shows.  They also roll down at the waste the moment I even remotely begin to bed at the waste.<br /><br />Unless you have no belly at all and like your undies ridding up to your nipple line, I would pass on these.  :(  Like Fruit of the Loom, very much disliked these!!
B00B90931M|5|My grandson carries this around the house now all the time!  He uses it to carry everything from his toys to his blanket.
B0088B8GOA|4|All good only problem bottom snap hard to use, feels like it might rip if not careful. would still buy it as received .
B000NM06K4|4|Came on time, fits great and seems to be pretty true to the sizing chart. The front seam gives it a nice look but expect major wedgies. Also camel-toe. SO MUCH CAMEL-TOE. Other than that it breathes nice, sits well, and is very comfortable.
B00FO3AQS4|1|Don't buy. Here's why.<br /><br />I've bought things before after reading bad reviews. I've thought &#34;it can't be all bad,&#34; or &#34;maybe that person got a fluke,&#34; &#34;maybe I'll get lucky.&#34;<br /><br />Won't happen with this. I got this for my wife, thinking how awesome it looked in the pics. Sorry, ain't true. I guess maybe she'll have a good time trying to figure out what else to do with it.
B00MENH81U|5|Great!
B000932PAQ|5|The credit card slots are snug but that is a good thing.  Quality leather, study zippers absolutely love it.  I bought the burgundy and it is a deep rich color.  Very happy.
B00ODT35EC|5|This suit is smooth (not ruched), showing off the fact that I still have a waist, but the sash and skirt camouflage my tummy pooch and my upper thighs. I absolutely love it. The fabric is sturdy and feels like it will hold up a long time--I swim 2-3 times a week. On the sizing, I am 5'2&#34; and wear an 8-10 petite in clothing. I bought the 10 and it fits great. Tall people should make note of that.
B00GDLWHH4|5|I want another pair
B008ADK2VG|4|This material is lightweight (not thin...not thick nor 'fleecy' (It's 100% cotton). The sleeves are a bit long for a size that's listed as small to medium. (Update: After i washed it and put in in the DRYER, the sleeves shrunk to a very reasonable length. The other 'parts' shrunk a little also...which gave it a slightly more taped look.)
B008CFTXJY|5|My husband loves it. It is very handsome and elegant.
B008Q0E61U|3|These are very nice looking and come in a box with good presentation.  I did not realize how wide they would be.  They do not work on the skinnier ties men are wearing today. But my son does have a few ties they will work with. But just know they are a little larger than expected.
B00ATM2UW0|3|GREAT VALUE, for the money.  This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a $50.00 tie.  But, at its price, it's a 10 out of 10 for value.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I rated 3 stars based on overall quality, etc.  It is a 5 star value.
B00UXQ338W|5|Love this swimsuit. Fits just right and true to size.  If you like a little longer swimsuit this one is long. I am 5'9, pretty tall and I don't have to worry about it riding up and showing my tummy. It's pretty much like a tank top swimsuit. Which I love because I am in my mid thirty's and don't feel the need to show everything off anymore. But still like to go swimming.  This is the fourth swimsuit I bought this summer and love it. Hope this review helps.
B009I3S7MI|5|Simply beautiful! It actually looks WAY BETTER than the picture depicts. I can't wait for my 10 month old daughter to wear this gorgeous piece with her gown and silver sandals for my big wedding day next month. I am very happy that the band is adjustable, and it compliments her gown quite nicely. I am very very very happy with this purchase!
B00ISRCF1O|5|Very good product.
B001F8MK5Y|1|Air Force style? no not in the least!!! I am in the air force and i bought these to work around the garage in and i would have been better off wearing a trash bag
B00FCSTXFI|2|I NORMALLY WEAR A LARGE, BUT ORDERED AN XL JUST TO BE SURE.  THE SHIRT IS VERY CUTE AND WELL MADE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS STILL TOO SMALL.  I WOULD ESTIMATE A SIZE MED IN US STANDARDS.
B002QREFJ2|5|I was quite disappointed to find that this belt was very very narrow, and was definitely a woman's belt. I suppose the name &#34;luxury diva&#34; should have tipped me off, but I honestly assumed this would be a unisex belt.<br /><br />Sadly, the belt is just not very wide. The band itself is only just over an inch wide, which means there is plenty of slack around it in the belt loops. Luckily, my friend, who is female and has the same waist size, was literally right there and bought it off of me right after I told her I was planning to return it. She seems quite taken with the belt, so that makes me think that the belt is of reasonably high quality.<br /><br />It's just not a men's belt.
B0043O5C02|4|I have a size 6 reg and they fit a little looser than the 6 petite in the waist. I prefer the fit of the 6 reg better. Why the petite are a little tighter in the waist is anyone's guess. In jeans I wear a 4, so glad I bought the 6. Overall a good pant for work.
B005RFFFUI|5|Nothing is worse to me than cold ears; and I really dislike those ear muffs that clamp on to the back of your head.<br /><br />These are perfect and I don't care that people laugh at me when I wear them and say \\"Oh, you look so cute!\\"  My ears are warm and theirs are freezing.  :-)
B009H6NPBE|5|I'm not much of a flower girl, at least on my clothing, but I adore this scarf.  It'll go with just about anything--don't know if I'd wear it with stripes, but hmmm....  Actually, if draped a certain way, it's more Impressionist than representational of flowers.  The splashes of color are happy and vivid and much prettier than the picture.<br /><br />As with all AD's wraps and scarves, the texture and size are perfect for the pattern.  The size is big enough to cover a tank top if your workplace isn't pro arm or cleavage and still have enough for swoops and swathes, but it's adaptable enough to fashion into a conservative jabot or kitty cat bow.
B00COJKFZA|4|Fabric is a little too see through and very staunch/stiff. Could have used a better fabric. Otherwise a beautiful dress.
B00PKMMDVC|2|The shirt looks as it does in the picture, however it is made of extremely thin fabric. I returned mine because of how cheaply it's constructed.
B000EC36LY|5|These t shirts are made very well. Holds up for many years. Love the way they fit after they have been washed.
B00GFLLWD2|5|Great price for a decent shirt! Received lots of compliments.
B00MHDMT8Y|5|Really like the shirt had several compliments on it the first time I wore it
B0009JE7E2|5|perfect girly socks to make any outfit complete. I had been looking everywhere and i finally fount the perfect pair.
B00OAY9POE|1|This sweater looks NOTHING like the one shown!!! The picture in the listing clearly shows an off-the-shoulder design (with no hems) & a loose fitting bottom (also with no hem). This one has hems everywhere you look & it's incredibly short. I'm very dissatisfied & will make a point to get my money back!
B00LFJ5F7S|5|Okay, so just like almost every other comment says, these swimsuits run quite small. I ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear and it fits just great! I put this swimsuit on almost as soon as I got it, so I could see if I liked it or not, and let me tell you.. I LOVE IT!! I actually feel attractive when I wear it and I've gotten SO many compliments on it! (Plus my fiance likes it, so that's always good!!) It came on time and I had no problems with any part of my order! LOVE IT!
B00J4BKCH2|5|Great price, great fit!!
B0066SJPD8|4|Bought this a few months ago for a funeral. I love this hat, only problem was it didn't stay on my head. It's not the hats fault, my head must be to big...lol!! It's made well came wrapped in plastic and shipped in a box. Held up pretty good till delivery. Received plenty of compliments.
B000HGR294|1|Lightly used, cared for as recommended, Coating delaminating...after a few years of use! warranty is lifetime which is to say if it delaminates its dead /end of life warranty over. Thanks for nothing Marmot Update I bought this précip rain jacket from REI to their credit REI replaced the jacket today  for me, even after Marmot was making no promises to replace the leaking and flaking coating. I have purchased 5 précip jackets in 10 years,every one delaminated sooner or later and every one was said to have been an improved chemical coating. I have been paying for Marmot R&D Thank you REI I will continue to buy from REI even if it costs a few $ more as long as REI stands behind all products they sell.
B007ZQIWPW|2|Didn't fit right. Its quite square the bottom isn't as a cut as it looks in the pic. I was expecting more from this purchase :(
B00H46887U|4|Good value for money especially the night gown
B007R2878G|5|The purchase came on time and was just what we had expected it would be thanx. I would order it again
B00BTPQBBW|5|Size Medium fit me perfectly and I weigh approximately 145 pounds, 5'4&#34; in height.<br />I really love it! :)
B00JY8KMJS|5|My daughter loves this coat. I bought it big so it can be worn a couple of years. Great balue!
B00QQYOQ7M|5|Good product
B00ID0S99I|4|They are great fit and everything but they are still a little see through
B009ZGPZLY|1|The quality is too bad because of the poor and fade cloth.
B004SKBN9A|2|T shirt looks washed out and stretched up.
B00GI6J0WO|1|It was ok. You get what you pay for. Was made really cheap...
B00DJQMNG6|4|Great color, its fun wear and well made. Its a very fitted dress and little small for me, so it will have to go back
B00DOZO01S|5|Fast delivery. Very nice bra. The color is great and the fit is perfect, and the padding is just right. I would definitely buy this again.
B0041W147Q|5|The order was delivered quickly. It was well packed and was undamaged. The cape was just the right length and made of good fabric with a glossy finish, probably nylon but it is NOT thin. It's made to last. I'm 5' 7'' and it is about 1 1/2 feet off the ground. I'm using it to perform the song The Duke Of Earl and between this cape, my top hat, and my black cane, it will create the effect I'm looking for.
B00EBUE75Y|5|Purchased for November CRPS awareness. Excellent color and received many compliments.
B0073SZZQ6|5|I loved this hat, it perfectly fits my 2.5 year old. It is very beautiful and the color is very bright with nice patterns. He looks very handsome. The eyeglasses are very big and don't stay on his nose-they slide down.
B008JST4Q6|5|I have a confession to make: I do not wear these while driving around in a fur coat. I don't actually own a car or a fur coat.<br /><br />I do wear them in my freezing cold office at night and around town all winter, though. Warm, well made and look, feel and smell great! I love these arm warmers so much that when I thought I lost them, I immediately re-ordered.<br /><br />Compared to products sold at retail in the US, the sizes run a bit small up the arm. I'm pretty tiny and love that these actually fit me very well, but I'm not sure they'd be comfortable higher up the arm on someone with a larger frame. If knee-high boots are usually at all snug on you, these might not work. They're exactly as long on me as in the picture.
B00CJUIEM0|5|I had this hat in my cart forever and kept waiting to buy it because, honestly, this hat is pricy! Since my daughters first birthday AND Easter is coming up I decided to finally purchase this hat. I'm glad I did. The flower is oversized, colorful, and fun! My daughter looks just darling in this hat!!
B003IMG7PO|4|Wife bought this a year or so ago and just bought it again after the first one got lost while traveling.  Says it takes care of the problem she has with some jeans that have a sort of gap in the back of the waistband.  Also used for a skirt she liked that had a fold-over waistband that wasn't tight enough to keep the skirt from sliding down towards her hips.  Not as easy to adjust as a regular belt, so she'd try it on, then take it off, adjust it again, and so on until it was just the way she wanted it.  I asked her why she put up with that, and she says regular belts have a lumpy buckle and you have to match the color with the outfit or accessories.  &#34;Invisible&#34; belt really is just about invisible and suitable for her purposes, so she's happy enough with the product to give it four stars.
B00E6PBXJM|5|Jeans fit very well.
B00FMXDQ6U|4|Good stuff
B00192WU42|3|I purchased these because the description said it had a double layer front. It does not. So if you are looking for the same, don't buy these.
B006W5O22E|5|I like this tie very much. The quality is great, good looking and length is exactly what I need. I'd like to wear it every day.
B00KYJ37LQ|5|I gave it as a gift to my daughter.  She loved it!
B008CQ5Q94|1|The bangs are obnoxiously long and the sides are lopsided, and the back is rather choppy. It doesn't fit me at all. Not only that, but the hair came out in clumps in my hand as soon as I opened the bag. I was so excited for this product, and deeply disappointed.
B00R8YJRJQ|4|Perfect fit, great gift
B007VUOUFI|5|Fine
B001KWQE3O|1|Concur with previous review ... wish it was written before I bought my Retractable Charger.
B00BCQQC2Q|4|Very stylish. Looks like denim, but a lot thinner than your typical pair of blue jeans. Nice alternative to the more common western cut denim shirt.
B00ADQBM8U|4|I like it but I bought a medium and I thought it would be a little smaller than what it is. I'm 5'4 and 112 lbs and I definitely should have bought a small and it still would have looked big on me, but in a good way.
B0065Q5WA6|5|Love it for sleeping. Soft and comfortable. Washes well.
B0069UFEQK|5|These are the best gripper socks. I bought about 5 different brands and compared to these, I don't even have my daughter wear the other ones. She only wears this one. She is just a little over one year old and we have very slippery hard wood floors. These are the only socks that keep her from slipping and falling. I highly recommend them. I wish I would have bought more of this style. They are worth every penny.
B00GT0MV5M|5|it works really well if you recline your seat. very comfy.
B0096R6XSG|4|Fits as we expected. I appreciate the correct sizing. I wish there were more colors available to choose from though.
B007GCOFT2|4|The top was a bit too small in the shoulders area but the pants were very plentiful, would have to go up to a medium and then not sure if the pants would be too big,  Would be great if could order separately.
B00A3Q8UXA|5|This is a beautiful dress...I ordered in purple size 16...the bow ties perfectly...the only issue as stated in other reviews is the elastic to hold the dress up is NOT good at all and my breast are 42D and it still doesn't hold up...I will have to get it altered but for 29.99 I  will find someone to alter it...Overall I love the dress and thinking of ordering it for my bridesmaids...I purchased for a banquet and cant wait to wear it...29.99 was an excellent price for this dress...
B00AD7L1PS|5|I was afraid the socks will be too large for my 7.5 size foot, but they fit really well.
B007N0ATHO|5|Love the feel and fit. Very classy and versatile. An elegant top that can worn just about anywhere. Love it.
B00IUOSS66|5|I love this dress!!
B00FJ5LW6M|4|These wallets are not perfect but it keeps my cards clean and keeps them from rubbing together. I never have a problem with the magnetic stip wearing out.<br />I just have to buy a new one every six months.
B00EKXGB8I|5|Fantastic T-shirt - finally a t-shit my wife likes when I wear it!<br />I cooked a pile of bacon one morning around the time when I got this shirt and stained it with bacon grease splatter... I treated it with stain removed and washed it and it came our perfect.<br />I recommend without reservation .
B0077E29Y2|5|Brought for my son and he Loves them...
B002XZKY56|4|this was a gift.  Very cute and soft.
B004KAAD5I|5|V. good
B00CI9JBT2|3|Wanted it to be oversized, it fits kind of just right. Thought because it was unisex that it would fit bigger thats why i order small to med. Dissappointed that it was advertised with a hood but when i received it, IT DID NOT HAVE A HOOD.
B008MPZVL8|5|great design, picture holds up well to washing
B002FVWJT2|5|This is the perfect backpack for my 5 year old niece to take back and forth to school every day. She loves to carry it and it looks super cute on her. The size is just right, some of the other &#34;little kid&#34; backpacks made her look like a turtle that was about to fall over backwards. She can run and jump and play all while wearing her ladybug bag with no fear of tipping over. :)
B00387MP3W|4|its really beautiful and is only slightly large! The price is so low ...I am surprised at the excellent quality.
B000FGYYHE|1|This cap is made of nylon that is not really stretchy. It barely expands to a diameter of 5-6 inches across. It doesn't fit on me and probably won't fit on most adult heads.
B00RKYD1ZU|3|Just what I expected.
B008JGLXSU|5|I am a cable technician. These are perfect. I also use them for auto work and yard work. Perfect grip with awesome protection. My coworkers actually have me order them gloves all the time for them as well.
B009ZKMJFK|5|Nice looking pins, though i'd rather see ordnance hanging off the pylons, rather than drop tanks.  There is no mistaking an A4, the pins are decent representations of the aircraft. i logged pretty near fifteen hunfred hours in them, i'll wear these things with pride.
B00KGV7CDQ|4|A bit on the large side of things but a good quality cap.
B00HWFCMD4|5|Can dress up or down in them.  Great!
B00GS5VCEO|5|slim fit very low rise
B00X0FTLLG|1|The size you order is too small should order two sizes larger
B00MH36EJO|5|I saw these in a shop in the Minneapolis airport and almost bought one.  When I got home I found it on Amazon (of course), for a better price.  I bought two in white and blue.  I'm going to Italy the end of October and I think these will be perfect for the plane, for a wrap if the nights are chilly, etc.  They will also be useful in my office which is always cold year round.  They fold up small so I can put it in my carry-on bag or my purse.  They're very versatile and soft and can be worn a number of different ways.  I'm very happy with the purchase.
B004054ZNO|5|This is a must have for a complete Harry Potter look....its a great scarf and is very durable, believe me my 5 year old is ruff on things and its holding up great!
B008MQBJ9K|5|The fit was perfect
B0001YSBV0|5|Fits great
B00GC02M2Q|4|It made me look wide. Sadly I had to return it. I am thin but do have a shape so it makes me look wide. If you have no hips it would probably look great. I really wanted it to work :( It did fit perfectly other than the hip area issue. Great price too!
B00E1ALO0K|5|beautiful!!!
B004J009FS|5|I received one of these as a gift, and had to go back and order more. I LOVE this hoodie. It is very comfortable, keeps me just warm enough, and washes very easily. The fit is loose, but not overly baggy. The sleeves are a good length, and fit my wrists well. The price is reasonable. I have noticed that after wearing my original product every day for two months, it has started to pill just slightly on the sleeves. I seriously wore it everyday for several hours at least, so I think it is still high quality :) I typically wash on cold and hang dry, I have not noticed any shrinkage.
B00Z27ZAVK|5|Love this Bra! I purchased 2 of the and the both fit great! especially love the double strap support! I love RBX!
B0018OMJWE|4|It's so hard to find pants that are 36x29 inches in stores these days, so I'm really happy to be able to get these on amazon so easily!
B00H2068KW|5|Love it! It looks better then the pic. Glad I found this to replace the one I lost.
B004FEEZ7G|5|I love this hat. The brim is just wide enough to cover face and shoulders. I have gotten a ton of compliments regarding this hat (for my baby of course). I also love that it has ties to secure it in place.
B00BBWNAMQ|5|really beautiful clothes, good quality. highly recommended, calvin klein never fails.<br />bought it for a gift and was very well accepted
B0052E76DS|5|I really liked this item.  I put in on a down vest when its zipper pull broke off.  It looks really cute, feminine and stylish.
B00LPUUVJO|4|The quality of the headband is good and it's adorable.  I bought this for my 9 mo/o daughter with a small-average size head and it was a little tight but still wearable. She was only able to wear it a few times though.  I wish it had been a bit more stretchy so that she was able to wear it more.  Overall,  it was a good purchase.
B00KS4YNHO|5|Cute!!
B00689GWGI|5|Beautiful robe. Good quality. I wear it with pride when I take my dog outside early in the morning. I feel like a geisha when I wear it.
B00PIQWOSM|2|Dress ordering is easy and reliable when you have accurate measurements to compare to. Lindy Bob is consistent with this. My issue here...Quality in the making of the dress is not consistent with a new Lindybob dress.  Here's why... The pattern on the dress is not as sharp as the photo description suggests. It isn't even close. The image seemed blurred and as if it spread or bled out. The underside of the pattern compared to the top of the fabric are different colors (not uncommon) but shows through the intended image dulling the photo suggested &#34;navy&#34; color. The dress belt was missing a button. I can't find a spare to match so 2 new ones were sewn on by myself.  The zipper pull was not properly machined stitched and required re attachment on one side. I'm no seamstress but if the teeth are not anchored properly, the dress won't close.  To much work for me to fuss with at the cost I incurred for purchase and delivery for a &#34;brand new&#34; dress. These are the risks you take when buying online. I'll be overly wary from now on.
B005OS4Y2S|5|Just as I expected.
B00RMNR7HW|1|Material sucks sizing was too small will not recommend this dress  anyone .
B004CNNQJI|5|We had trouble finding these button extenders for my husband's dress shirts.  I located them on line and just purchased five so we would have them for a long time.
B00FMJ5PUY|5|When i placed the order for these i thought i was going to get some sweat pants with the logo on it but instead I got a light fabric material. which is exactly what i wanted! Fit great and has pull strings to make them fit a smaller body (wife enjoys wearing them as well!). 10/10 would buy again.
B00AEVJ6BO|5|I wear size 6. based on size chart, I need small size. when I selected small, it has size small - 10. I was confused, thought I ordered the wrong sized, went back, checked again, it's small, so proceed the order, but a little concerned about the size.<br />Once it arrived, I immediately tried, and it fit perfectly:-) I still don't know why there is a &#34;10&#34; after small. but it's small, and size 6.
B00NABV4Z6|2|wrong costume js that is yui, not iwasawa
B00OBZ88GI|5|Looks good.  Great gift.
B000TNDG7M|4|I am so happy with this wallet, I love the designs and all the compartments.  The wallet itself is longer than I would of thought but that is still a plus. The only negative thing I would have to say about it is that there is a back pocket on it that really isn't a pocket or much of anything really. All in all I strongly recommend this buy....
B00A3EXVCC|2|it fits me good and every thing but i don't like the colours of the one that i get,its not the colour of the one in the picture
B000I7RCAQ|5|Great t-shirt - bold, beautiful colors. I bought this for a gift for a friend. He likes wolves and he will love this shirt.
B00DQZ2M7K|5|Loved it!  Large and holds a ton.  Comfortable straps , easy to store when not using .
B00EH8MQTO|4|I expected better material but overall great look! Size was what I expected.
B002WT7IPW|4|These tough type zippers can be annoying but overall the jacket fits right, after a few washes it wears just right.
B00P2N12NE|4|Perfect as a warm underlayer or for XC skiing. Looser than expected [not too loose, though] and nicely cosy. Would be OK with a casual or long skirt, but thicker than is probably fashionable with a fancy skirt or dress. Easy under layer for outdoor activites and comfy to lounge in.
B00N72ZO4K|2|size runs very small!
B003E7GUZU|5|Covers my melon as expected.  Great for those cold SF mornings.
B00775MKQS|5|Very sexy! Fits my curves perfectly.
B005QXVDUC|5|Good price and quality. Size was correct. Most other brands were not correctly sized. Good looking thick material. Will buy more.
B00CXSI3V0|5|Cute country hat! Fits great! Lots of compliments on this hat, I think my friends will be ordering one too.
B005UFJQZA|5|Im a size medium it was a bit small but it still fit wore with shorts it looked amazing!!!! totally recommend it!!
B005VMMVOK|2|I ordered two of these t's for a friends daughters in Australia. I am embarrassed to send them on because of the cheap quality.  Ragged stitching, cheap looking graphics and 100% cotton fabric that is so thin you can read through it. Made in Pakistan by hungry ten year old children.
B00N0SNZJC|5|Arrived earlier than expected and for the price it can't be beat. The reversible option is an added bonus and quality made.
B00KMKKFBC|4|it was too large for me and i despise the fabric choice.
B00IF3YLV8|5|Really fast shipping, really nice pants!
B00IF3KJCS|4|Great polo shirt for me.  Great fit, great feel and great price.  Score another one for me.
B002VLZH2W|3|Good workout shorts. Not appealing for everyday use, but not marketed as such. Thick enough to hold up to workout and frequent wasing
B001UGE4E6|4|This little number got the job done for me - it was part of a Halloween costume. The pieces included are secured by velcro, which does a sufficient job of keeping them in place. Unfortunately due to the slick nature of the material, these do slide around a bit and require some attention to keep in the proper position.<br />My only real complaint is the velcro on the neck-piece should be further extended. I felt it was very loose to begin with - I corrected this by adding a piece of velcro to the item, and viola, problem solved. All in all though, I'm happy with what I got.
B00E4CRKYE|3|This zip is very thick like the zip of a bagpack and makes waves in the fabric, I am planning to change it for an invisible one, the dress looks good for the money. I am 5'4 and 140 pounds, i bought a size xl thinking that the fit could be small, but it fits somewhat large.
B00F9R8QZA|2|Very, very small. I'm a size 4-6, ordered a medium and it felt like an XS. Color was at least as described.
B00MYZ87XQ|5|LOVVVVVEEEEEEEE !! OMG !! So cute. I'm 5'3 an they're a bit higher than my waist but they're still cute. I recommend getting a size up.
B00FK23P2I|5|Good quality and pretty.  My only disappointment is that it is so long that I will be wearing it as a summer dress instead of a shirt (seriously).  I will probably have it altered so that I can wear it with jeans like I wanted to, which adds to my cost.  Even so, I would recommend this item as long as you understand that you won't be able to tuck in that quantity of shirt.  The top of the shirt fit as expected.
B005OFLTT2|5|Excellent !
B00NMOXYHM|5|This product was great. I was a little nervous it might have holes based on other reviews, but it came in great condition with plenty of usable areas. It does have an uneven edge, but that is because it is the shape of an animal. I got plenty of good quality, usable leather out of it. I will definitely order again!
B00303CYZS|4|My baby looked adorable in this outfit for his Christening. The hat fit perfectly and did not fall off during the ceremony. My only caveat is that the pants fell short and were more like long shorts on my baby.
B00B90931M|3|It's not the best quality, sort of reminds me of a gift bag. More of a throwaway item than anything else. I expected thicker material.
B0006USFJC|4|not bad, it fits well, i like it
B00IT7REKA|4|GREAT
B008MC21LE|5|The shirt looks exactly as it was pictured.  Graphic is very nice, not off-center or smudged.  Shirt fits well and is good quality material.  I would buy from Michael Shaffer again!
B00M407KEI|5|Perfect dress for my little girl. I loved it!
B008T43NJ4|5|Bought to is for hubby as a Christmas gift for when we sneak out late at night and go into the spa. It is easy to unwrap and is very handy for quick cover.
B00KXEGT44|4|Received these today.  They are very cute!  The little ties on the side give them some attitude.  The fabric is a little on the thin side so i wouldnt suggest them for every day wear out about town without a long shirt.  But they are cute shorts.  Great for working out or yoga.  They are lightweight but good quality as far as fabric quality and stitching et.  Very comfy.  I am a solid 24.  I got a 3x.  I would say these are more of a 22.  My daughter wears an 18 and they were a little big for her to give you an idea on size.  Overall these are very cute shorts.  They would definitely look adorable with a long tank top to run around doing errands or amazing for your workout or yoga couture!  I do recommend these but they do run about a size smaller than you would expect.  I did receive a discounted price for an honest opinion.
B00O8CDSL4|5|After reading the reviews I was very worried it was going to be too small; however, if you use the sizing chart provided the fit of the dress will be right on. I measured my chest and bust and it came to a small, so I ordered the small. It fit perfectly!<br /><br />As others have said, the dress is see-through. I knew this before I bought it after reading the reviews, so I still gave it 5 starts. Walmart has a shaper slip by Flexees. I got one for this dress and it works great with the material and you cannot even tell it is see-through with the slip.<br /><br />I plan on buying more dresses from this company. I looked at more of them on amazon and they are so pretty!
B00HR0EMV4|5|Softest socks, and hold up amazing. These are incredible no-see-ums, as they have rubber in the back so they don't slip down under your feet. The only type of sock to buy, in my humble opinion.
B006HSDBL4|4|Shirts are of good quality and very comfortable. They are somewhat large but this will not be a reason for me to return the shirt.
B00RE9A63Q|5|Beautiful and very elegant
B001RKG2OU|4|Great overalls.
B00JB9H8QU|2|Although the dress looks beautiful and fits well, way too much glitter falls off. It's not flattering for a grown woman to leave a trail of glitter.
B00KBJB2IY|5|Feels comfy
B00CMB7SEG|5|I like everything about these suspenders - style and appearance, how they function, quality of material, price. Excellent buy!!
B003WVAKUE|5|Pros: We used this outfit for our son's 1 day old photo shoot at the hospital. He looked like the sweetest future domer! He may choose to go to whichever college or university he chooses (aside from USC) but he cannot escape developing a lifelong love for Our Lady's University!<br /><br />Cons: It was a tad too big, but this wasn't a deal-breaker for us.
B00IJIGUG8|5|Awesome shirt I love it!!
B00DXTJRCC|5|This was a great buy....and I picked the right one out of all the ones for sale on Amazon. I am a 38C and they fit just great. Just thick enough and does not ride down or move. Looks just like the picture and very, very comfortable.
B00BG9JWEE|5|I would defianantly recommend this. It isn't the same color as the picture but it still goes well with everything I wear and I love them!
B008VEYR4W|5|Yizzam shirts are great. Rich colors, comfortable fabrics. Not to mention how great the patterns are. I own five of their shirts and, needless to say, I've never seen somebody in the same shirt! Love that! They run true to size and get ready for compliments!
B00M5CV9B0|4|love this
B008ASB7S8|5|My daughter loves these glasses. The service was great.
B00LUIKGGY|5|Great shirt. Will buy some more.
B00GWE9AHC|4|The dress is beautiful and exactly as shown in the picture. Good material but too long for me.
B009DK3CFS|4|A little bit but he loves it!
B00BOT885U|3|Pro: light and well made<br />Cons: it is kind of small and you can hardly put a clean cloth inside.
B0096A1NJ2|5|I Love the shirt ! I'm on my second one!
B00LI0AS0I|5|He loves it.  The perfect in between.  Fits great.
B00L00KMQQ|5|Love it. Thank you
B00EEJY702|5|👍
B00BLS184W|5|very confortable, love the snaps!
B00LFVS794|5|Sent as a gift. No feed back?
B00TYY2V3M|2|They were cute just not made for someone with large thighs
B00ORZIYBQ|5|LOVE IT! The best wallet ever!
B00K3WAUA0|5|We all absolutely loved this little bathrobe that I bought for my grandson.  It's soooo soft, will be a delight for him to wrap up in coming out of the bath.  The sizes run large however.  He's about to turn 4 and is not small for his age, but I got the small (2-3) size and am so glad I didn't get the medium.
B000F74LUS|1|Not worth the money
B00DW7SGGI|5|Wonderful dress for this style. Color is very pretty and the quality is good( I would say great, except that the zipper came slightly separated from the material it was supposed to be sewn to) however nothing I can't fix.  The weight of the material is of great quality, and overall I feel I will surely be back to do business again with you.
B00P2RI1WU|2|This sweater is ok.  I didn't like the material.  The deep V is makes me look like a grandma.  I returned it.
B007FE5Z1S|2|They are adorable, but the ink made my son break out in a rash.
B003N9BUJ0|5|I was reluctant to order a bra on-line - had never done so - but it is so hard to find a good fitting bra my size (38D) in the department stores.  This one exceeds my expectations.  Not only a good fit but comfortable and looks good.  The straps even stay in place once I adjusted them for my body.  I'll be ordering this one again.
B001OJEWUA|5|Great quality shirt considering it's a rock t-shirt. But the quality is good and the shipment was fast. In fact I'm wearing it now.
B00KBI9M28|5|I love
B00HANMM0G|4|nice and sturdy, but tighter than expected.
B00HGAW4YC|5|Love these jeans!  The wash is great, the material is soft and somewhat stretchy, and the length is perfect.  I would definitely size down at least one size.  I am 5'8&#34;, 125 lbs. and typically wear a size 28 (curvy hips).  I ordered these in a 27 and they are still a little bit roomy, which is good for a boyfriend jean. If you want them extra tight, I would recommend even going down two sizes.  Perfect for spring!
B00E0HFF1I|4|Jacket fit as expected. It is water resistant and has a fleece lining for warmth on cold spring/fall mornings. Velcro on sleeves for easy adjustment. My 4 year old boy really likes this jacket. Zipper quality is a little poor but overall good purchase.
B00GJB8POC|4|I bought as a Christmas gift.
B001PO5JBA|5|Perfect with the spider-man boot covers and mask!  They arrived on time and are a perfect fit. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a well made costume.
B00E8QXRV6|5|Great product! Love how it fits my boy! It fits as expected for his age, so if your boy is on the bigger size, buy a size larger.
B000VR1ZYM|5|When my son got married I had difficulty finding an appropriate dress, and actually bought two others before discovering this one. I don't normally spend this much on a dress but in this case am very happy that I did. It was perfect: for the wedding, very elegant and age appropriate (early 50s) with the little jacket, and for the reception afterwards attractive and even sexy by itself. Shipped promptly, nicely packed, (still needed to have it pressed a little before wearing), beautifully made. I'll wear it to other weddings and probably for a nice evening of dinner and dancing. I'm really so pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this dress.
B000NRT7C2|3|So the quality is what you would expect for the price.  This is not a daily wear belt for sure - even without having worn it, you can tell by material feel and structure that it will warp after extended use.  However, for a daily wear belt, you would be purchasing 10 of these belts so it fits the price range.  What I don't understand is the sizing...I purchased and received a medium (34-36&#34; waist), put on a pair of 34&#34; pants, and the belt barely touched the first hole.  I'll hold onto the belt as I'm hitting a cut cycle and will wear it at some point, but certainly not the expected sizing.
B008H4DRE2|5|Love these hats! So hard to find in local stores.  My husband works outside in the winter and insists on these hats because of the fleece lining!
B000WO1FAS|4|I like the overalls, they do seem to run a little small, but my daughter loves them so i love them.
B00LE2KE0E|5|EXCELLENT-OUTSTANDING T-SHIRTS.......PACKED WELL.......THANK YOU VERY MUCH...... YOU'LL LOVE IT
B0012M65ZY|5|I have been wearing this bra for 20 years and love the fit.
B003636MHS|4|Very nice shirt - one for myself, one as a gift.
B00NVDXB9U|1|very big.
B00I1LTZTW|5|Great tank!  Too bad there aren't more like it!
B009W8O3R2|4|Great hat. Cute and pretty warm. I do wish it fit my head a little better. I think I have a pretty average sized head, and this tends to slide down over my eyes often. And the buckle doesn't help keep it in place either. It's too far below my chin, so some of the cold comes through. Regardless, I'm relying on it through this abysmal winter and its doing the trick well enough. I would advise most everyone to purchase a hat like this in person though, so you can try it on. Nothing like a hat to fit.
B00OSTL8NM|5|Good Shirt.
B008KCKB7C|5|very good
B00FN31NG4|4|The two sides are pretty similar, but different enough.  It is lightweight, but warm!
B0051R0BWO|5|Very good product, excellent 100% recommended.
B00J63YJPY|5|Top 3 best things I own. I love it! Bee and PuppyCat is my jam!
B00E0WVGE8|5|I love jag they fit great and they stretch. I'm 60 years old and I need all the movement I can get in my jeans.
B00G3LL6X0|5|Great product - fit is perfect and socks stay in place and are hidden. Received socks quickly and am pleased with this vendor.
B0045H0L1W|1|Of the 40 finger lights I ordered, only 12 work (and of those 12, only 8 work without shorting out).  For the price, I expected them to not be of the highest quality, but I didn't expect more than half to not work - and I paid over $9 in shipping on these things!
B00SIWLEVQ|5|fit perfect and price is great..easy ironing..
B00DYI0COY|5|really comfortable! Like it soooooooo much!
B00TFM5ZYA|3|It is a cute dress, but the top portion is small. Not much space there!
B00ACIG1BW|5|This items was for my grandson & he was very please he love the fit. Thank you
B00OJOMRF4|5|it fit perfectly, its super comfortable and its exactly as pictured! definitely worth the money!
B00WMRBK9E|1|I bought these for my daughter and they were too small.  Since they weren't a lot of money I didn't return them.  Also they look like they'd fall apart after a few washings ...
B004E06HLI|4|The shirt itself looks great and seems like solid quality. Unfortunately, that just makes it all the more disappointing that these things are sized like they were made on a planet of hobbits. I thought the fact that it differentiated between Asian and US sizing would mean that the US size was actually US sizing. It is not. Not even close. I'm 6'4&#34; and 220 lbs, which I realize is pretty big, but I'm also fairly slim so with most collared shirts I fit in either a Large or an XL depending on the brand. I wanted this to be pretty form fitting, so I thought the US Large was probably okay. I realized there was some risk that it would be a little too tight, but as it turned out it didn't matter which one I chose because they were both too small. I couldn't even get this buttoned it was so tight around the chest and shoulders and the sleeves fit my arms like spandex. I did like the actual shirt, so I'm ordering another one, but next time I'm ordering two sizes larger, and even then I'm nervous it still won't fit. If you're an Enormo-American like myself, I would recommend you buy two sizes larger than your usual.
B00CLS8MQS|5|I needed this emblem for a recreation of Rabbi Alexander Goode's uniform for a reenactment of the story of the four chaplains who sacrificed their lives on the USAT Dorchester in WWII.  The item is good quality and attractive in appearance.  It worked very well with the outfit and I received compliments on how it turned out.<br /><br />It is what it is: a Jewish Chaplain's insignia.  It is not supposed to be overly ornate or fancy; rather, it's supposed to be uniform and send a clear signal of its purpose.  This item did that very well; people could identify me right away from my Christian Chaplain counterparts.
B00I03EMPS|4|We live in South Texas and I just had to buy this outfit when I found it on sale.  The 12-18 month size seems a little big but my daughter is only 9 months.  I just can't imagine she'll fit in it around 12 months...probably closer to 18.  It is super cute, comfy looking, and well made.
B00LNEG2LS|2|I was disappointed when receiving the dress. i order a size small and it was waaaaaay too large. I m 120pounds and 63''
B00LHR9KVA|5|I bought this for my (very) &#34;picky&#34; adult son, who is also very sensitive to the &#34;feel of the fabric&#34; and he loves it. Thank you!
B0006SQGF4|5|My columbia wallet was old and tattered, and I got this. <br /> <br />Great wallet and really does have \\"some\\" extra capacity without the bigger size. <br /> <br />
B009I50QIE|5|shirt was good quality and fit perfect.
B00ESJ18X2|5|Nice hat!
B0083S18LQ|5|Amazing quality so comfy and very cute!!! I dont understand how anyone could complain about it being itchy... unless you're alergic to soft? Lol. I absolutely love this shirt!!! Its my favorite piece clothing right now i wish i could wear it everyday & i wish it came in more colors.
B0030HG1K8|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE MY COSTUME!!!!!!!!!! Its super duper cute and it fits like a glove!!!! It shipped to me really fast too! Now I can't wait until Halloween!
B00JVSXZWC|5|like it
B008RTSNX2|5|If you're searching for a great-looking casual winter coat that will keep you super toasty warm...this is the one for you!<br />I purchased a black one, size medium.  I'm 5'6&#34; tall and weigh approximately 140 lbs.  This coat fits me perfectly.  I love the cut and how it comes in at the waist.  The hood is great...not too big, and removeable.  The fact that the hood's trim is fake fur which is a plus for me too.  Cuffs at the wrists keep out the wind...in fact the entire coat (which comes down to just below mid-thigh) keeps out the cold, wind, and rain.  I'm delighted with this purchase.  Love it!!!
B006O94FSY|1|This bra getting a 1 from me because its not for all size. If your bra size is 34DD...This bra will not fit you!!! The bottom of the bra doesn't hold tightly to body at all. If you run you are going to bounds!!
B0012M0Y1A|5|This bra is perfect!!!  I will order again as this has become my go-to bra!
B009B2U18Y|5|I purchased this scarf in the Fall and wondered how warm it would be in the winter. Turns out that despite the hole pattern that makes the scarf FABULOUS it is surprisingly warm. PLUS people always complement me on the scarf. It works great indoors because the pattern lets your body heat vent, yet thick enough material to work as a cold weather accessory.
B00ZU3EH74|5|I was a bridesmaid and I needed a special look on my friend's wedding. All the usual bridesmaid dresses just made me sick and I was looking for something more original and this seemed like the one which would suit me. Wedding was great and i had a fun time acting attractive
B001069NH4|4|I own a pair of these in the steel gray color.  They are very stretchy and hug every curve.  They look great under a long flowing top.
B002SD6PTW|5|Arrived fast and looked adorable. Exactly as pictured. I had to wash it a couple times because I kept letting my son wear it. It stood up to the washing machine which was great because now I am having another little monkey and can keep it for him to wear.
B00LPRYJZ4|2|Got a 34 and it was too small. Then I got 36 and it was too big. Didn't really like the colors not what I expected.
B00JM2WJRE|5|This is the clothes to her daughter next year very good fabric pattern above and letters are beautiful! Just a little time to see the surprise!
B00EWC8ST2|5|These are both comfy and nice looking. They fit true to size. Good quality.
B001BZ40IG|2|Poor quality.
B004Z4I6CG|5|These jeans are great for my little girl to wear with cowboy boots or flats. It is hard to find jeans for little girls to ride in other than Cruel Girl and/or Wrangler ($50 jeans) so these Levis are great for the value, looks, fit and durability.
B00M6GQP5A|1|Quality is very cheap!
B00J8HESF4|4|I bought this as a &#34;goal&#34; dress as I progress on my fitness journey. It is a bit tighter then I thought it would be. That just means I will have to work a little bit harder to rock it. Over all the seams and material are a bit on the &#34;cheap&#34; side but It does look ok.
B000GGZZSA|5|Great deal and very cute
B00IYXDHXW|4|The waist band is at an awkward spot, somewhere between empire and natural waist. All around it fits well, The way the arms are cut isn't exactly my taste, but I still like it nonetheless.
B00IJCXZX0|4|All cotton is a bit stiff, but I like the print and for an authentic Hawaiian made shirt it's really cheap.  Considering Hawaiian is the only type of shirt I wear to work during the summers
B003TPTAOK|5|Fit and feel great.
B00MZIU744|4|I love it
B00KHPZC9M|4|A tad bit snug for my average 10 year old.  Sizing up might have provided a better length too, but we were pressed for time. Fabric looks amazing! Purchased as part of costume for school play.
B009EUKYXA|5|I am very happy and I love it. thank you<br />www.mrhappyonline.com
B00LWTVA66|2|I liked the material but the shirt did not match the size. I order XL but it felt more like a size L
B000FAHINC|5|My husband used to be able to buy these locally and now cannot, so we ordered them online.  He is very happy with them and will order more as he needs them.
B00KGE7CO2|4|Pretty good, I ordered the jean colored pants. I expected more like dress pants that just look like jeans, but it is more of an actual jean material. The pull on factor is pretty cool. I ordered them in brown too and that material is more like a dress pant material.
B004B8U9XK|2|This belt is quite nice - until you notice that the coloring is starting to wear off due to the rather sharp metal belt buckle digging into the belt material.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the belt appears to have some sort of laminate on it to create the sheen finish and this finish is exceptionally prone to wearing off. Mine started wearing off after about 30 days. This is rather disappointing :(
B00BBB3S2E|5|Very cute shirt. I found it to run small. We had an 80's party. These shirts really made the outfit.
B004I8Y18M|5|With its soft \\"sunset\\" colors of pink, peach, mauve,lavender and purple, this scarf can be worn with many different shades of clothing. It is certainly an excellent value for real hand-sewn silk.  I think it would make a very good gift.
B0021SKY8W|5|The bra is a little on the pricey side but, it is by far the best bra I have ever purchased. The support is like none other and it is extremely comfortable. I have to save up my pennies and by at least three or four more of them.
B002GJ0SHS|5|geat costume!!!
B00729MZAK|5|I gave these to my niece for Christmas.  The embroidered snowflakes are cute, and the velcro tighteners at the wrists are a nice feature.  They seem of typical quality compared to department store mittens.
B00LY5ISQI|1|The materal looks and feels very cheap.  Also, it fits too big.  I ordered a Medium and it fit like a large.  Don't waste your money on this item.
B00IWM0AOE|5|For the price this shirt was awesome
B00LQA5XX2|5|Really happy with this product read the reviews followed the size chart fits perfect always get complimented
B00A599GBU|5|The shirt I received was and is amazing. The artwork is beautiful. I'm a small person, but I knew the shirt was gonna be big. It'll last me a lot longer and my friends loved it.
B0046BPHHA|5|Very soft and nice.  Bought the large/xl size for someone who normally wears xxl, and it fit him well.
B00DL247GM|5|It's a beautiful skirt- long and modest. Those are hard to find these days! I'm 6'1&#34; so that makes it even more difficult for me to find a long skirt that doesn't cost a fortune from a tall girl shop. I ordered another skirt from there as well, and it exceeded my expectations! I will always check there first if I am shopping for a skirt!
B000BLIMIA|5|I purchased this cap because I already owned the Jaxon Cotton Herringbone 8/4 Cap and I wanted the Herringbone 8/4 Cap for cooler weather.  It fits well, although the sizes run large like European sizes, and it is comfortable to wear.  It has a nice shape, so it looks good, and best of all, with care it can actually be machine washed (That goes for both the cotton and the wool models of this cap).    This is, hands down, one of the best caps that I have ever owned, and it can't be beaten for the cost.
B003XPH7JQ|5|Hudsons suure do look good around my ankles when the ladies r doin their thang...if u know what I mean...its all about the jeans the jeans...
B00PPZ6YVY|3|They are inexpensive for a reason. I used them for a birthday party favor and this was acceptable.  But compared to a Gymobree tie, they are flimsy and weak.
B00012O1SY|5|They fit perfect and they have no flaws. Will order again.
B005IXK7ZW|5|LESS LAUNDRY TO BE WASHED! Bought these for anticipated potty training but have been using them as a second diaper cover since my kiddo likes to rip off her diaper at night and then pee gets in the bed. This keep the diaper contained and even if she unfastens it, the absorbent part soaks up the rest so it doesn't leak into the sheets. A HUGE time saver for me. Will also be great come potty training time. I liked them so much, I bought a second set. These do run small so buy a size up. Glad I read reviews and took others advice on this.
B00DSY9GS2|5|Nice comfortable fit. They seem durable. I've only washed them once so far but no fading or shrinkage noticed. I'm looking to purchase more socks from this supplier.
B00LCD9Q5E|4|Pretty, but also very sheer. Not gonna be walking about without a robe :)
B00EFNRFBK|3|Good looking shirt but material not as thick as old chamois shirts.  Expected better quality for $50 from Woolrich.  After a few washings they do shrink!
B00CFJKTA0|2|The material was thin and the scarf had holes in it. I was refunded my money and thankfully did not have to send it back, just provide pictures of the holes. It was a beautiful color though, and would have been ok without the defects
B00GFMS5SG|5|gold toe are very soft and very comfy you  will be glad you purchase these and the price is great
B00C1OXCNK|5|Go FGCU!
B00KJXOY8C|2|Im sending it back, it's soft and just as described, but way too small and tight
B00LHOA4FO|2|For some reason these are not listed on the orders, but the size chart is W-A-A-Y off.  Size chart says waist 31 1/2-32 for a size 20 H. I measured these and they are 35 inches, maybe more.  Almost would fit his Dad, but not quite.  Rather than return them (not able to do anyway, if they don't appear on the orders list),  I will keep them and hope his dad loses weight or grandson grows into that size.  If they appear on Order List, I may just return them.
B00OS9MOM6|2|I was hopeful that the dress would be similar to the image, and be of decent quality. However, the dress had a thinner fabric than expected and was prone to wrinkling. I ordered a size Small (S) and the fit was rather baggy and unflattering especially at the waist. Upon receiving it and trying it on, I immediately returned it.
B00IR93INC|5|My friend, who is the grandmother of the boy, was thrilled.
B009DNWH2O|5|fit as expected
B0018ON8PQ|5|Service,jeans as advertised.Thank you.
B00DSI3FT4|5|I love this top. The sleeves are a tad bit long, but no problem, I like it that way. I am a small and got medium and fits just right.
B002QYFWV0|1|fits terribly
B003VD1RN2|1|Was to small and the pocket ripped the first time I tried it on.
B008OQUUB6|5|High quality.
B00QNYNJOQ|5|I'm hooked!! so perfect, well tailored, lined arrived timely and don't wrinkle easy, wonderful material
B004WPHPP2|5|I loved this costume. NOTE buy a size larger as it runs small.  I am a &#34;large&#34; but based on other reviews I got XL and it fit perfectly! Also, it is sexy without being too revealing. The wings it comes with were comfortable too. I recommend this costume.
B000VJEZ42|5|Due to her consistent quality and classy styles, I have been a fan of Donna Morgan clothes for over 20 years.  The sleeveless dress with printed jacket, which I just wore today,for the very first time, did not disappoint...the unmistakable classic \\"Donna Morgan look\\" was apparent as soon as I slipped the garment on!  Easy fit with a relaxed feeling, yet still maintaining a certain \\"elegance\\" about it.  This is the dress I'll rely on to give me that extra \\"pizazz\\" for the office, or just a nice quite dinner engagement.  This is what I've come to expect from Donna Morgan over the years....and she delivers....again!
B007T2UII6|5|I am so happy to have found this seller on Amazon!  I have ordered 5 tops from Patty Women and have loved them all.  I have less than a perfect figure and these tops are all flattering on.  I'm curvy with a large bust and these tops flatter without being too revealing and they cling to all the right places. I will definitely order more from this seller. My husband has loved the look of every top so far!
B00C9WFDOA|5|I am 5' 6&#34;, 140 lbs. This shirt is size medium fits well.  Also, the Nightshade color is lovely...between an ash gray and a light violet.
B004J24IZ8|5|It's a shirt, it fit, and I love Angels and Airwaves.  Is there anything else?
B009AOO2WO|4|The dress is super cute and has a satin feel though of course it isn't high quality material. The dress is very nice for the price point.
B00K4983T2|3|I ordered a true white, like pictured and I received a cream colored item.  Looked like a dirty white at first.
B008ROWG6C|4|It is a great buckle for the value.  The only problem I have had is the adhesive used to attach the colorful front to the lighter gives way when lighter fluid gets on it.  This happens when you fill the lighter.  Used some superglue to fix the problems and it has worked great since then.
B00C1C5D20|5|My little guy Loved this shirt . Wish I could have found more things with Mike on it
B00HDA3NP4|5|These are the perfect size for newborn/infant spit up.  They absorb well and cover us!
B00TX4SR40|5|Wore it to a wedding and I had so many compliments. People were asking where I bought it.
B001MAAGX8|5|bought this wallet with some doubts with out being able to see it but when it came in a day earlier than they said I was impressed with the quality of the wallet I will buy from this seller
B002GHC3ZA|5|Carhartt is the top name in workwear and this sweatshirt does not dissapoint. Long enough to cover the waistband of pants, yet not bulkly through the midsection. Great value.
B007ZQ57WI|4|the shirt fits right, looks good, cost relatively little...so, yeah, no complaints over here!  the sizing seems true as well.
B00M0O05MW|4|collar shipped wrinkled and had to have pressed
B00Y1TSI3W|3|Material very thin and clingy. Must use shapewear to maintain modesty. Material is like a thin tee shirt weight.
B00CA4UDYM|4|The Levi's Women's Demi Curve Skinny jean id, 26/3Medium Apparel, pants are excellent me is perfect, and as always pay for this merchandise deserves it, but there has been a GRAVE mistake, I bought two (02) pants and I was sent only one with these features, the other is branded pants I dont know named Seven 7, huge, wide boot cut for a person with another anatomy! I must say that I am very dissatisfied with this shipping is expensive for me because I am away in another country and it is unfortunate that you can not trust my purchase ... even beat him Levi's decal label the pants to do go through as part of the brand. Now I need to know that I do to get the goods I bought, and it is coming to me just today my hands. Thanking your prompt response, goodbye.
B00667MG1M|3|The quality is not as expected
B00COGQYTE|5|I love it! It arrived right on time and fit me just right! I usually wear a size medium and that's the size I bought and it fit me fine. Its a great buy and I would definitely buy again!
B001IMKBWG|2|The ball isn't actually good enough quality to play soccer with, and the paint just immediately flakes off of the surface once it's applied.  So it basically fails on all fronts.  I gave it two stars because my daughter was excited to design her ball and enjoyed the actual process.
B00HLR3R3M|5|Lovely gloves.  Fit perfectly.  I am so pleased with them.  Also they arrived within days of me placing the order.  Can't wait to wear them. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall and they come a few inches above my elbow.
B003MVYWZI|1|Jeans were not comfortable. I do not like the cut of the jeans
B0091QI59M|3|I had to return this dress as it hung like a sack on me and had no shape at all.  The material is very nice and pretty, but that couldn't compensate for the shape.
B000FAHIW8|5|They're great
B008PIJQV8|4|Great wallet
B00NJHNJYK|3|good quality fabric , printing is fine, good size , warm and soft
B00IV4VTRU|5|Love them just wat I was hoping for
B00400ORD2|4|I loved the belt, because it looks elegant yet casual. They look great with both pants and jeans ... very good choice!
B00GS6CVDO|1|My daughter really loved these leggings they are super cute. However, i payed over $40 only too find them through another seller for under $5 ???? Was extremely shocked and will buy several more through the other vendor.
B0094MEHK4|5|Great for my son in between wanting to dress up for Halloween and not wanting to dress up it keeps him dressing up
B00BQ12QKE|4|There is no size info I want the dress but don't know the size ... Will some one let me know what size is being sold thanks
B00L3XQE8A|5|These shirts are really great for any occasion -but really sharp looking for work, very comfortable and with that little bit of stretch they don't bind you up, they keep their shape and clean up easy.  Great shirts !!!
B000UA2LHU|3|this is a really nice belt from Dickies. i ended up having to return it though, because the sizing runs pretty small. i wear size 35 jeans, and 38 for belts, just to have some extra room. got this belt and was stoked because it looked great. tried it on and it was way small. had a hard time getting it on using the first hole (normally i'm about 3 holes in). sized 38, but felt more like it was a 34 or something.
B000UPP7ZS|5|I ordered the unisex scrub top because women's sizes do not fit right. I ordered the large and it fits great. They washed up nice, didn't shrink and not many wrinkles.
B001T8OCD8|3|The fit was expected, but again the cotton was a cheaper cotton.  The socks needed to be a thicker more refined quality.
B00DTU3XPW|5|Perfect little sheath dress and not too short, at least not for my 5'3&#34; frame. The fabric is nice - not too thin; doesn't require a slip.
B001B4HVL0|5|This shirt was exactly as described.  It was super cute and I have gotten a lot of compliments.  Great product and great service!
B000KRT9G4|5|This duster is very well made and looked terrific on my adult son.  He loves it! He is 6'5 and broad shouldered, so I got the extra large. It fit perfectly without being too large in the middle the way some extra large sizes fit.  He says it's very warm and works great in cold or rainy weather.  Some dusters were a little less, but this is the authentic article and I'm glad I paid the extra money!
B00EB145Q4|5|Perfect style, perfect fit, perfect price.  I am tall, and it is very hard to find pants that fit.  I could not be happier with the quality, these are well made and stylish.  Good stretch, and they hold their shape nicely--mine too.
B008IHM0XW|5|Love this dress, fits beautifully and is very soft fabric.
B00M2OF1AQ|5|I've been planning on revamping my brassier collection. Usually, I wear regular body bras with no underwire for comfort, but I decided to give this one a try and I was super pleasantly surprised. It's been a while since I was distracted by my own cleavage, but the view is awesome.<br /><br />As for the fit and comfort, I got a 36C which the size that I've always gotten int he past. I would, however, recommend getting one size up so when I get another bra, I'll go for 38C. The comfort is surprisingly better than any other underwire bra I've worn, and I'm trying it out for my first workday.<br /><br />You really can't beat the price for the value. Victoria's Secret bras never really fit right; they;re far too round and have padding all over. This bra is more subtle and lets your breasts take the shape for themselves rather than try to make them into perfect orbs.<br /><br />Bottom line: I absolutely love these and would recommend them to a friend!
B012HPTS0S|4|Thick Rayon, stretchy, comfy, nice print. This &#34;One Size Fits All&#34; is actually on the small side of medium for U.S. size customers. Happy!
B00KHHQ4A6|5|Very cute set with quality fabric and accurate size
B00VKRAAF2|4|It's a little longer so for sure one to wear with leggings and not jeans
B00GAG1E0I|4|Light,comfortable, easy to put on.
B00415O4HK|5|For the price, this was an absolutely excellent wig. Nice texture, doesn't shed, pretty styling. It also holds itself together surprisingly well, considering that it's mostly a big, hollow dome; I thought I might have trouble with it imploding but it was totally fine.  I ended up cutting the flower and feather off and you can't tell. I also repinned the bangs into a different style, but the way they came looked good, too. The wig looks exactly like the picture, with one positive exception: the actual color is slightly more of a realistic platinum blonde color than the phony silvery white of the picture; this is perfect for a true Marie Antoinette wig, since she tended to pile her own hair on top of her head, rather than use powdered wigs like many of her contemporaries.
B00PWG7P9Q|4|Beautiful dress.  I bought it to wear to a September wedding.  Seems to run a bit small but not uncomfortable so.
B0056Y3MPU|4|Hubby likes them! They fit just as expected.  Levi's are classic and well made - you get what you pay for!!
B0008JFAH6|4|Wrangler jeans are great. They are well made and they hold up to rough boys. The only down side is they run small so order accordingly. My 13 year old is short, not chunky and normally wears a 12 or 14, had to order 16 in these. My 9 and 10 year olds needed 12 in these and they both usually wear 10's. Other than that, once you figure out the correct size they are great jeans and worth the price.
B006ZVFB2U|3|these are pretty good quality for the low price, the hole design in the back of calves looks really cute but it feels uncomfortable for jogging in
B00D0SZHP2|1|Product runs extremely small and wasn't worth trying to return out of this country.
B007CG2GFW|2|Trunks, “Men’s Salty Solid Broadshort” received 7/30/2014, are less than satisfactory to me for the following reasons: 1) Wrong waist size.  Ordered 32”.  Actually measured 34” when tying drawstring as tight as possible. 2) Pocket can’t be fully closed.  Pocket has 1 1/2” of Velcro to close but has a width of 5” which therefore allows 3 1/2” of space for pocket contents to fall out. 3) Wrong color.  Color ordered was royal blue.  Color received was more of a baby blue.  I kept the product because I could alter the waist myself to make it work and didn’t trust a return and replace to provide the right product. Note to Amazon:  Even though 2 tags sewn into the product say “Trunks Surf & Swim Co”, brand search on your website using what’s on the tag does not find this product.  Successful search results from using “Trunks” – unexpected frustration for customer.  After 1 year of use in a swimming pool on a daily basis of about 20 minutes/day, inner lining basically disintegrated.  Chlorine from pool was rinsed out on a daily basis.  Also, one of the velcro strips, that is to provide fly closure, failed - would no longer adhere to the mating strip and would not adhere to new velcro.  Removing this strip and replacing with new strip fixed the closure.  Suspect bad quality strip used in original manufacture of the trunks.  If not, then velcro as fly closure is bad design.
B005UDA034|4|runs large .. so returned for a large..  Great, warm, Winter coat!
B000HKI4PG|2|This is pictured on a man and says one-size, but the length of the ear pieces could barely reach. But the farther he tried to push them up his nose to get them to reach, the less they stretched around his face. My husband has a long lean face, so it wasn't a matter of his face being abnormally large. These are just children sized! Very disappointing. Just because he somehow found a way to have them awkwardly sit on his nose, I'll give it more than one star. But they were an annoying hassle the entire night.
B00OHXSVHU|2|This dress is cheaply made. I was quite happy when I saw a discount and immediately bought it home. However, it looked quite unflattering on me. The V-neck back was beautiful, but the front was not quite so. there was something huge and bulky about this dress. Plus, the silver glitter went all over the floor and now permanently stuck on my feet.
B00DNW7H8A|3|Product fits as expected. However, if your breasts are larger than an A cup size, they are too large for the cups of this product. There is zero support, even with the straps tightened all the way.
B00D641FAG|3|wish they had a better sizing than just medium/large..  I was not that blown away by this product.  I will not recommend to friends.
B00CV3E8I4|5|Very good material but a little larger than normal
B00HS5DQD8|3|I liked this jacket when I received it, but it runs small. I had to return it.
B00TIPFNKA|4|Awesome belt looks exactly like the authentic and provides a hole puncher so if its a little big you can adjust it. I suggest going one size up just in case.
B00JVTNZ1M|4|These are classic athletic socks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Warm<br />Nicely cushioned<br />Comfortable toe seam<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small<br />Terry lining is not soft<br />Loose elastic strings<br /><br />These socks shrank a lot in the first wash, despite being washed in cold water and machine dried on delicate.  They are snug on my size 6 feet.  I also wish that they were soft on the inside.  They are good socks, but could use some improvements.
B00NGS6B8I|3|The quality appeared good, not thin at all. I have them in gray as well. They're really cute but after about a month, the waist lost its elasticity and I now have to keep yanking them up. And I am not over- or underweight, so I can only fault the material.
B00FL7YKIA|5|our alarm system.
B000UVHQ60|5|This was exactly what i was looking for, the price was right and these bags are worth the money, cant wait to use them under the tree this year for all 4 of my kids!
B00DGCAN5G|5|Very pleased with this purchase. I ordered a size up as recommended. I would order again if other colors were available and made available as a daily deal.
B00BNR4MF8|4|I was surprised at the quality of the fabric for what I had paid for this suit. I wish there were less pockets, but I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality regardless.
B00CFXX84K|5|I love this blouse and the products at Hee Grand.  The blouse feels so comfortable and beautiful while wearing it.  The details in the blouse are great, I love the epilets and buttons.  For the price I bought 3 in different colors.  My only concern is you really have to buy it two sizes bigger.  I asked for a return and instead they refunded my money....wow...so I was able to buy more.
B00DSKQB6Q|5|both my sister kids love it
B00KHYCJ58|1|First pair was chipped, significantly scratched, had finger prints and lots of lint/dust.  Customer service was nice and tried to help by sending out a replacement pair (after I had to prove their fault with pictures) but the second pair was also scratched and dirty, (less so than the first but unusable).  Went to an Oakley store and bought replacement lenses at retail and it was worth the price.  Infinitely superior.
B00QD7CLQA|5|Awesome t shirt love it
B00OCGPIZA|1|I bought 2 pairs of these. The dark blue and the lighter blue pairs. Both of which you can see EVERYTHING under the pants. If I wear full undies, thongs, undies matching the color of the pants.... Doesn't matter. You can see it all. And don't think about bending over. I am SHOCKED that someone would see crap like this to unsuspecting women. This is not cute at all! How embarrassing it was for me. Thank God I wear a long tank when I'm at the gym. But I was in the middle of a dead lift and I looked in the mirror and was horrified! Not because I look badly, but because I am a modest woman just trying to get my lift on. Go ahead and say, &#34;but these are for yoga, not lifting.&#34; I hear what you are saying, but regardless of whether you are stretching or bending with or without weights, the fact remains that these pants are see-through. Unexceptable. Worst money I've ever spent.
B001H0F6FG|4|Quality is very good at this price level. Open bottom involves usual tradeoff - easier to use (compared to warm up pants with elastic closure at bottom of leg) but not quite as warm. If you want the best of both types of warm up, you can get models with zippered closures for each leg - very nice but much more costly.
B00MC4RJ0Q|5|Very cute, but too small. I'm waiting on the exchange for a medium
B00QG04478|5|Loved it!
B002YLJA9U|4|Nice Broach for the price.
B00PC3D6NS|4|I bought this a size bigger than I thought I need due to other reviews saying that this ran small just to be safe and it actually fit perfectly if not slightly large. I am about 5'5 with a DD chest and small waist so I was skeptical as to if this would even fit me correctly. I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. The sleeves are nice and long, the v neck is perfect with a cami underneath and the waist fits great. The shorts are slightly short, but I figured the shorts would be short in any romper and summer in Nebraska is warm so I don't mind. I made sure to put a pair of old spandex dance shorts underneath since the shorts fit just a little big on me. Over all I really love this romper!
B00HS8XLWQ|4|This shirt is fun & bright. I wore it to a family gathering on the Fourth of July & got quite a few &#34;where froms&#34; & admiration for it. It's a nice thickness & wears well. Not cheap quality material. The design though should be lasered more so than the plastic-y type iron on it has. It gives it a cartooney like feel. And the position of the design should be raised a lil' bit height to the collar for effect. Also washes well. I prefer by hand to preserve the appliqu&eacute;/design/transfer. The fit is comfy & roomy while still being fitted. I think you'll like it & despite my small quirks about it, I definitely recommend it. As I said, both men & women complimented this shirt.
B005NC8192|5|The suit was perfect for a large 3 year old.  The baptism was for a toddler.  You may want to have larger sizes for bigger kids.
B00Y4DXPMY|3|If you have thick thighs like I do it will not stay up.
B00AZ746GM|5|Although I'm a female, I always buy these men's Fruit of the Loom shorts to wear around the house. They are very comfortable, have roomy pockets, launder well, keep their shape, don't fade and are very durable. I currently have six pairs.
B003YDV6Z8|4|it's the perfect fit that I wanted
B004WYY646|5|I purchased this pair of pajamas as an \\"end of the winter season\\" special.  Well, as we all know, winter does not end very early in New England.  I have been wearing the pajamas and I am very pleased with them.  They go through the wash easily.  I personally use a garment wash bag for the top because it has a sequined scotty applique and I try to treat my gentle items a bit more carefully in the wash.  Looking at the applique, I don't think there would be any kind of damage done just running it through a normal wash, but I have the garment wash bags so it is no issue to use the bag to wash the top.<br /><br />The pajamas themselves are very warm and cuddly.  The material is soft, yet durable.  I would recommend these pajamas for cold season wear.
B0079MINA6|5|Perfect fit
B00DV0G5UU|3|the sweater fits well, but it runs small. The coloring of the dog and the spots are purple, not black. It's a good sweater and very cute, but i don't think i would buy this again.
B0002MGS9S|1|Did not fit
B00LP8YJ6W|5|Ohhh God this dress is too beautiful, the quality is good
B002GC2TWW|5|Gave this dress to my wife for a birthday present...She LOVES it and it fits so well...thank you for producing such good clothes!
B004M42JKO|2|I have other Ranger Up shirts, and they all fit well. They're all made from pre-shrunk cotton. This one isn't; the label says to hang dry to avoid shrinkage. Based on that warning I tried it on before washing. It's a shade more snug than the other Ranger Up shirts I own, and any shrinkage at all would have consigned it to the thrift store bin. I'm not into clothes that have special care instructions.<br /><br />Banded Bottom issued an immediate return authorization through Amazon's system, kudos for the customer service. I like the shirt design enough that I cross-ordered the 2XL.<br /><br />These are nice shirts, but if you can't tolerate shrinkage, order a size larger (or more) than you normally wear.<br /><br />When the 2XL comes, I'll update with a post-washing fit review.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got the 2XL and don't like it either. I've come to the conclusion it has to do with the way the shirts are cut. I have an average build, not skinny, not fat. The XL made me look fat, and I thought it was because it was more snug than other Ranger Up shirts I have. But the 2XL has the same effect, amplified. The cut on these shirts is just OFF, strange, unflattering.<br /><br />They're heavier cotton than the other RU shirts I have, and don't drape like them; they keep the shape they're sewn into rather than conforming to the wearer's shape. And they're too long - both the XL and 2XL extended to my crotch. I guess that's Ok if you tuck in t-shirts, but I don't. I downgraded my rating of the shirt because of the funky fit. This one is off to the thrift store.
B00E5WWHLO|5|My son is a large 4 months. This is big on him, as was expected since it is a 3-6 month size. Kept him warm. Easy to get on and off for swim and to change his swim diaper.
B00BJ9J5DO|1|Didn't like it at all. The color is a neon green and the outfit itself seems like something you'd wear for a costume.
B00M9UTKSC|5|Adorable swimsuit for my daughter. She loved it.
B00RMG3016|4|I have not run in them yet, but the fit is as expected. I went with XL after reading comments, but I think an L would have been better. I am 6'3&#34; and 200lbs. They fit fine, just could be a bit tighter. I think they should be a little bit difficult to stretch on, but that is to one's tastes. Arrived quickly without incidence.
B00HS0LHAM|5|Fit exactly as expected. Nicely made. Fits over jeans and tights comfortably and under boots.
B007X4AW36|4|Loved the shirt fit Really Nice.  However, it's really faded now and I always wash it in cold water. So, keep this in mind if you are using it as a Dress workshirt.
B008SBGZ4I|4|I really like this shirt, fabric and it did arrive earlier than expected. However its not as easy to tell that its a skeleton face as in the picture.  Its not obvious that the cutout at the center top is part of the 1 eye socket as it is in the picture. The 4 middle holes just look like holes. You can't tell that the 2 in the middle are supposed to be a triangular shape making up a nose. Thankfully I like the shirt anyway, but even the teeth are just little circles while they seem more teardrop shaped due to the roots of the teeth in the picture shown. Its a bit disappointing that its not as obvious in the picture but the shirt is still cool.
B00RT16VRY|5|Love it.
B00QTYINKK|2|These were a VERY small extra Large- I had to give them to my daughter who wears medium.
B00P9HDP9C|5|So cute! Loved it very comfy
B004WKTGLS|1|they are to small and thin.And i feel that i waisted my money! I wasn't happy when i opened the package.
B008ARIS86|4|This is a well made cap -- a fine product. The &#34;one-size fits&#34; all is true. I wear a 7-3/8&#34; hat and the cap fits well.
B00JBXXEVE|4|Little tight around the hips, need to alter. otherwise i like it
B00DBJOJG8|5|Usually in my size it costs an arm and a leg for good pants. Only thing I wish was they more options as to length of the pants.
B008JXYACO|5|Purchased this coat for my daughter in her early 20s. Not only did it do the job<br />of keeping her warm, even in the snow we visited, but was very becoming.
B008A4W50G|5|These are just what I wanted.  They are super comfortable.  I wore them during an all day travel from Alaska to Florida and was entirely pleased with their looks and their comfort.  Was worried about the waist being low (I'm old), but it turned out to be better than at the waist.  (It's not very low.)  Going to order some more!
B00FFXJ4CW|5|the black fabric of the skirt LOVES lint :( and somehow sticks to itself
B00GMSY352|5|My friend loved it! She had no idea I was going to get it for her either which made it an even better surprise!
B005IASS88|5|Great gift
B003835VWS|5|I bought one of these in Thailand for my husband as a gift.  After 8 years it had stretched a little but was not worn out but he wanted another style.  So happy I found this on the site.  Cheaper than a trip to the night market in Chaing Mai!  Great quality.
B00763VSW8|2|Great design BUT, the black shirt underneath in the picture is NOT included! I know the description states that it's a crop top, but the photo is deceiving, as a grown woman could not wear this alone without a very long cami underneath (the top is only a 12\\" drop from the top of the scoop neck).
B008JETZA0|2|The glasses I received were not the same ones that were in the picture. The red lenses were not red, but purple. The spiral pattern does not glitter like it should. It also lacks the red \\"X-ray Vision\\" circle on the side. Plus this is not the only time this has happened. I ordered a pair last year that had this same picture from a different company and received the same exact pair, neither one was the one that the picture shows. Granted my dissatisfaction is only due to that I am looking for the exact pair in the picture and did not recieve the particular item I paid for, not once, but twice.<br /><br />It would be nice if Amazon sellers would post a picture of what they are actually selling, not something that looks like it. I also tried contacting the seller twice via email asking specific questions about their product. Neither email was ever returned by the seller.<br /><br />I will say this though, I did receive the glasses in good condition.
B000PC0TWM|1|I received the costume however the tiara and arm gauntlets were missing.  Not happy.  Also, this is supposed to a sized 14-16 and it was way too big and falling off.  I had to pin it to my undergarments to keep it from falling down.  Not satisfied with this at all.
B001F6VAXY|5|All 5 ties purchased from this vendor were outstanding and, though only one is silk, the other 4 have a wonderful feel to them and they tie up into very nice knots. They were represented properly, packaged extremely well, and delivered as quickly as any order I have ever had online. I am extremely pleased with the service and the ties.
B000HG6USS|3|They serve their purpose as a costume accessory. Good price, but they weren't &#34;fitted&#34;.
B002G9UEZE|5|i live in indiana.  we get several good months for riding a motorcycle.  i like to push it as far as i can when it comes to riding time.<br /><br />last month wasnt too bad, but we had a few days colder than normal.  one of those days i had taken a day off of work and planned to go riding.  that day came and it was chilly.  the day off work was already in effect though, so i wasnt gonna blow it...i went riding anyway...<br />.<br />ooohh..to say it was 'brisk' would be appropriate...<br />.<br />on the ride i past a local store that sold carhartt gear.  id bought stuff from that store years before, but thought they might have something to help out on this cool september morning.<br />.<br />i found a black sandstone carhartt vest.  it looked cool.  got a size to fit over my leather jacket, paid my $48.00 bux and split.<br />.<br />perfect.<br />.<br />its not so bulky that it was really noticeable as i rode, but it cut the wind and chill down a ton.  when it warmed up as the day went on, it folded up and fit in the bikes bag nicely.<br />.<br />money well spent.  i know itll last for years as carhartt products are high quality items.<br />.<br />all in all, if carhartt marketed these towards bikers, i think they'd sell a bunch of them...<br />i know id buy one...cuz i already did.<br />.<br />going ridin'.<br />later.
B00E1LCQ2Y|3|Love it
B00D6CAWG6|1|I was shocked when I got this items.....I want to return them immediately. Items are not same with pictures.
B00AU52WVK|5|I received the blue tank top within 2 days of ordering inside a plastic bag within a padded envelope to ensure safe delivery! The top is very soft, breathable and feminine looking. While the top is snug it is not a tight or confining fit which is something I do not like.
B00E20ITYI|5|The measurements were accurate just as displayed. We were totally happy with this product.
B000BSW6G2|4|These are 100 % cotton and while I like the idea of the various blends I seem to come back to cotton.  They feel good. We wash in hot water hence they do shrink, but that was expected and overall the no fly pouch design seems to work for me.
B001D4S3JC|5|I was Christmas shopping and saw this coat. The deal was unbeatable and I needed a black coat. Every time I wear it I get compliments. It comfortable, not bulky, and warm enough for a cold day. It's stylish, warm, and I am so glad I bought it for myself. I love it!
B005NXN0OC|5|Case was what I was looking for.  Sturdy to  protect lens in purse.
B0037W68LS|3|I wanted some high rise jeans, and these are pretty good, but the denim is thin, almost &#34;jegging&#34; quality, and needs to be much stiffer or thicker. The waist fits snugly but then the denim has too much stretch and it makes your belly look a little bloated. If the fabric was more durable, it would act more like a girdle and flatten your belly out more, in my opinion. Otherwise, the legs are nice and skinny, and the style is classic Levi's. &#34;Paintbox&#34; is a deep, rich black, very nice.
B00PLRS6RG|5|Brought this for granddaughter, and she loves it.
B00IMNPNMC|5|good~~~~
B0093Z6N40|5|My wife bought this and typically wears a woman's size 10-12.  After reading the other reviews, she listened and bought a size 16.  It fits perfectly on her thin body.  She says if she didn't buy it in this size, it would be too short for her 5'9 body.  I think it looks great.  She thinks it looks great.  It fits just like the picture.  The leg holes are comfortable she says.  Not too tight at all.<br /><br />The only issue she had, is that since it it such a large size, supposedly, the straps are a little too long.  She spent ten minutes with a needle and thread and moved them.  Seemed like an easy fix to me.  She says if you need a little more coverage on top, move the straps up a about an inch so they grab from the stripe part and not the solid body section.  It pulls the suit over your sides a little better.  If needed.<br /><br />She doesn't think this would fit a very busty girl well.  (Her words, not mine).  I think my wife is perfect.<br /><br />I hope we have helped.
B0055COLHG|2|Sleeves are long and for a 5'5\\" person the front is about navel length.  The back is 3\\" longer than the front.  So if your a medium and are 4'10\\" and plan on doubling the sleeves this sweater is for you. The yarn and weave is nice.  This item had been returned previously.  The item shipped to us might not be indictative of this actual sweater.  We returned it as defective.
B00389VMN4|5|The comfort waistband is a real plus. My son wore his size M Hanes exclusively - not wearing other brands - because of comfort. As he's grown and needed a larger size, he was reluctant to get new briefs unless they were exactly the same. I was very happy to see they were available, and my son is pleased with them.
B00GOZ9VJQ|2|I should have read other reviews before I ordered this tank top.  The tag indicates it's a &#34;one size fits most.&#34;  It should state &#34;one size fits most dolls.&#34;  It's cut much too small and narrow.  The 92% nylon and 8% spandex fabric makes for a very uncomfortable fit.  I will donate the top for someone with a 3 year old.
B00CKLIGF8|5|Such a great color! I love this shirt!  When ever I order from allegra k I know that no matter what it is im gunna love it. So nice
B007AK1MPU|5|Fun socks for my son. These easily fit an adult man.
B00EO4Y5G8|3|XL size is huge!
B00BCYDSLQ|5|Just as expected! Perfect
B00GAG4NHE|4|Great shirt! Go up one size!
B00BBT9N02|3|I wear Lee relaxed fit jeans size 14 long and they fit great not tight but these I had to get a 16 long and still on the snug side.  The fabric, color everything else you would expect was there.
B001GNCWKG|2|I bought two pairs, size 36x34, to replace my old pairs (same size) of the Iconic 5-pocket pants.  What could go wrong, I wear 36x34 for every other style of Dockers.  I first measured a new pair against an old pair and thought \\"uh-oh\\" since it looked like the new pair was about 1/2\\"-3/4\\" shorter than the old which had already been washed/dried a gazillion times.  I thought I might be able to live with this, but when trying them on they bottomed out on my crotch area even before I could get them pulled all the way up around my waist.  These pants have obviously been re-designed for the skinny young adult (D3 style?).  The quality is also not as good as the old Iconic 5 pocket.  The old style has an inside waist liner that is white with a red stripe.  The new style does not have this, and the waist patch on back is mostly blank and cheap looking.  Be careful if you are sizing based on other Dockers styles.
B004VOD6ZM|4|Does a good job blocking the sun. Very light weight, and it is adjustable to grow with my child's head size.  Although it is unisex, it does make boys look a little girl-ish with the wide brim.  I did not care as much since the purpose of my purchase was sun blocking.
B004S0018E|1|I ordered a large and it came and looked like a childrens large nice quality but very very small couldnt even get my arms in the arm holes. returned it right away..
B00T2PP3ZQ|3|Hat all bent up in delivery box,not happy.
B008FGRQRG|4|I love the way it feels, not to tight.
B00HYRDBOO|5|I like the the material and does not stain which is awesome.
B00ATGTMZ4|5|Love to wear this on cool days and the sleeves stay out of the way while cooking.  Win Win...love it and it's sooo cozy comfy!
B00GQVC3Y8|5|Nice but all scarfs in the begonia pattern is the same print in all colors.  Not as nice as pictured but works for the price.
B008CGWS9U|5|Ordered this and came on time! Though I don't know if this is normal but when i got it the colors were really bold, but after washing and drying it once the colors faded a little. It's still bold just a little slightly bland. Not sure if this is supposed to happen but this shirt is great! I ordered large but it was a little long. But still a great shirt!
B004SZVZI4|5|Great staff uniform!
B00NJ6DQA8|2|The hat itself is great...but its a tight fit for my 6 year old. It fits my toddler been than my 6 year old. Not a &#34;youth&#34; size fitting.
B00RZUUP44|4|The material is so soft and beautiful; the color is a bit deeper than it looks in the picture (it leans more toward a burgundy than a true red). The size is just slightly smaller than I expected - I can still wear it, but I will definitely be putting a jacket over it.
B0051CBETS|4|Had ordered several on eBay that claim to be 1X only for them to be too small.  This one is just as desribed, nice robe.
B008MA3J7G|5|Good undergarment for power walking.
B0013XWDEE|5|Love these bras! They are perfect under tshirts and they are oh so comfortable!
B000MX8ZZ2|5|NICE FITTING BRA, COMFORTABLE
B00U5YX0Q2|5|Great dress you have to order the next size but it fits great the material is not cheap looking , dress it up or just with flip flops take it on vacation  Very very comfortable love love it I even bought one for my sister  Wish their were more colors.  I order the jumpsuit to try next in two colors
B003DI167W|4|As for giving it as a gift, I was happy.  The product arrived on time and the recieved loved it.
B00LQM3TAY|5|Bought this as a gift.  He loves it!
B00LJNM5KU|4|Beautiful
B00JRRJNLE|1|What a disappointment. This is a poorly made costume, so short it could barely cover my hips yet it was the right size on top so great if  you are 5ft 2-4 height not 5ft 7or above.<br />The fur  / feather look is poorly sown on to the dress and this results in seams that scratch you. The quality of the fur / feather material is that of a cheap teddy bear. In general I would not recommend buying it and returned it to Amazon the next day.<br />FYI this is dry cleaning!
B004TLVK4Q|4|Perfect size for standard size reading glasses.  Lightweight but sturdy.  I needed something small to fit in an evening bag and this did the trick so well that I purchased three more.  Nice selection of colors.
B00K7IQVHG|5|Very warm.
B00DQNT5MC|5|I like it and it is very cute. And the quality  the jumper is very good too. the color is beautiful
B001AI9ZD4|1|Its not leather.  cheap wallet
B00MB3CYUI|1|Hate that
B004LE8WLK|5|I like the colors (grey and olive) They fit well and seem well made. Looking forward to taking them with me on overseas travel.
B00K65LXNM|4|Great quality pull over fleece. Would definitely recommend. I live in Australia and an american large is XL/XXL in Australia, so for people are buying internationally I would definitely recommend. Just bought 2 more seeing as they have dropped to $20 bucks from $36 when i bought mine. Materia is nice and thick, not cheaply made.
B0058O02YC|5|It's perfect but a little bigger than I expected.
B001FAYLOU|5|Colors are exact and fits great!
B00NB0RZA4|4|This coat arrived fast, as ordered, good quality and feels warm however... Only one small issue. Size. Every other coat I have I'm a 3xlt. This one made me look like a ten year old in his dads coat. I was able to send it back for a refund and get a new one and their support was very helpful. Just make sure you check what size you need. Here in a standard large, tall. Not even a 1x. So, good product but check their size for you. They are very different
B00G461IRI|5|Love it
B00DPPG114|5|I tossed the leopard bow, but aside from that, I love this hate. I can pack it and afterwards, I can mold it however I want. It's not gonna be as smooth-looking as it does on the model, but it is crinkly in an attractive way. Covered my face and neck very well.
B003WMTOL4|5|These are the BEST pants!  Elastic waistband in the back and ties in the front.  I love the fit and the flare of the pant legs.  The quality is great and I love the style.
B00W6OB3KO|5|So happy I ordered this shirt! It is great quality and fits perfect!
B00HWYSJR8|5|Great product
B00B3HV3SW|5|I had great nursing bras with my first child, but not compared to this!  I love that it gives you shape and support.  My bra size fluctuates significantly (up to an F during late pregnancy, back down to a low D or high C once milk production normalizes) and this bra seems to fit me regardless!
B00GWSYBWC|5|Fit perfect and warn.
B0007N7RXS|5|I ordered my captain's hat for an \\"I'm on a boat!\\" themed-party, and it turned out to be exactly what I had wanted. The hat looked great and fit perfectly. There was a plastic adjustable strap in the back that isn't shown in the picture, and a hole where your ponytail can go, if necessary. Other than that, it looked exactly like the picture.     Needless to say, the hat was a successful part of my nautical outfit and I can't wait for an opportunity to wear it again! The price was low, the shipping cost was reasonable, and unlike other reviewers, my hat came in a cardboard box so it wasn't bent or anything. I believe Private Island was the seller, so I would recommend going through them if possible.
B001ANK1E6|1|Returned item. Very unhappy with customer service and the handling of the matter. Ordered size 4/6 which normally run a bit bigger on him. But he could not get it over his head without it hurting. Once over it fit snug. Not recommended
B00MJVCG0K|4|brand new. They are very soft so I wore them anyway. I would buy more despite the hole.
B00DRG3VZA|5|These are amazing! I'm the type of chick with a little butt and thunder thighs and these fit so well over it all! There comfortable and true black! They also have a little extra length at the end which is a plus because I like my pants like that, and I'm 5'8&#34;. Great deal, ordered two and will order more in the future!
B0009M9SYS|5|Most comfortable bra I've ever owned
B00IMGZXZQ|5|The best money you can spend. This is a firm hold and difficult to put on but it does its job beautifully.
B00J312PI2|5|Quality hat with real fur at a good price. Love that it's Made in Poland! Trendy and functional. Order receipt shipped with a handwritten thank you note from the company, a great personal touch.
B00OZHFOE6|5|I just received my coat 5 minutes ago and after primping around in it, ran to write my review.  It looks and feels expensive.  Quality workmanship with a great lining.  Would I seem too conceited if I I look great in it?  Don't worry, it's not about me, it's all about the coat.
B00E59C4HO|1|the sizing is so much smaller than they should be. Dissapointed
B004D7SUGC|5|This is a nice robe - buy it ...you will not be disappointed. Warm and cozy. Good deal at a reasonable price.
B00DYQGYH0|5|Honestly the best underwear ever.<br />I have had the most expensive underwear, you name it. These actually fit. Most underwear fit nice for about an hour then they get all loose and ride around. These stay perfect all day. I have ordered a lot of their other types since then and they all fit great. Never again will I buy Calvin Klien or anything of the sort. This will be my go to company.<br />Every pair is individually packaged with very nice labels. These could easily sell for 30$ a pair around the U.S. like a lot of other top brands. Hopefully they keep their prices low though!
B004DP2YGQ|4|Excellent
B006Z8JKZM|5|warm comfortable and does not shrink also for me thase sweats are not as big around the legs which make me look clownish their really nice im planning on getting some more
B00T8L0Z2U|4|I am usually large but this one was biger than I expected. In other hand, the color is wonderfull and also has a very quality fabric.
B00B2B6IVQ|5|Hi all in internet land,<br />I play in a band and during outdoor summer concerts  these shirts are a good way to look dressed up and be comfortable.<br /><br />I usually wear XL but after reading the reviews I decided to order 2 sizes XL and 2XL.  The  XL fit but was just a little snug/smaller than what I like for a T-shirt and it will probably shrink even smaller after washing.  The 2XL  fit me good around the neck  and comfortable around my body,  (I hate loose neck T-shirts)  if I order more I will order 2XL at least in T-shirts anyway.<br />I will still wear both shirts I just like the 2XL better more comfortable and I love the design.
B00INV644O|5|This is my absolute favorite nursing bra. It is actually cute and comfortable which is a rarity in any bra! I first bought the hot fuchsia but then bought it in nude and black. I'm considering buying other colors and can totally see myself wearing it after I'm done breastfeeding if it still fits and if it isn't too milk-stained.
B00Y89XIBM|2|Sending back all the dresses they were made very well and a nice design but way to small...
B00DQO5DYK|5|It's beautiful
B007IDNQ9Y|4|A bit tight but overall it's a nice material ad I like it.<br />Arrived timely and the Hoodie is as I expected it just wish I had ordered  a size bigger...
B0047N0MT0|4|Excellent pants that wear like iron. I wear these to work and on weekends and have no complaints with this Internet purchase.
B000A38BSK|4|Luv me great for ridin
B00IOMOFWA|4|comfy. quality. on trend. excited to sport them all summer.<br /><br />they do fit on the hips tho- and the drawstring sides are great
B004UM7YUS|5|This hat feels firm so I know it will hold its shape for several uses. The color is perfect and goes well with black and browns. Looks way more expensive which is great ;) used it at a party with friends and everyone complimented my fedora!!
B007WA2VB2|4|Ordered this dress despite the bad reviews and I'm glad I did. Nice light weight cotton blend. Sort of reminds me of a those sort of sheer t-shirts although not as sheer. Very simple design that's perfect for the very petit. No problems with stitching or seams (I sew so I'd know a problem if I saw it). It even got to me 16 days before its estimated arrival.
B00B89ORI8|1|Unless you are a size 2 this item will not fit you. This is one size fits all and the size they ship you is a lie. The dress on the model is one size. There is elastic under the bust and so on me it stretched all the way, 100%. The dress is really tiny. Because of the elastic that can stretch the dress to 30 inches around they will send you whatever size you want and call it that. It comes with a yellow sticker glued on the dress that says do not remove if you are going to return the dress. When you try on the dress and stretch it the sticker falls off. They have this on there because they know you will return it. This item is a piece of crap. I'm surprised amazon carries junk like this with inappropriate selling tactics. No I can never wear this dress. It is also very low cut way below the cleavage. The model on the photo and how the dress looks on get us impossible unless you are size 2. Amazing piece of crap for amazon.
B0075JUKBI|5|color to dark. will spray with silver hair spray to match husbands hair.  A nice gift for a joke.
B00YPIHAU6|4|Asian sized, made in China too small
B007KFZE54|5|As a very healthy figured woman..this is a perfect sleeping bra. Not really a sports bra. It has a loose hold, PERFECT for sleep, or healing from surgery.
B00NGMNZ38|5|I have bought these twice. They are great fit-stretchy. They are nice and long. I am 5ft 8 in and they are plenty long. Great material. I have worn mine for 3 months and there is no signs of wear and tear.
B00D3G15R0|5|I love everything about the Carter's  clothing line. The Layette was just as I anticipated and I have no regrets. Of course I will buy from this clothing line again.
B0044T66D8|5|Best cute headband ever.<br />It fit her awesome and has great stretchy band! Unfortantly we have lost it so I am debating buying a new one.
B00NM7S5GO|2|I don't like the material. Too much. Too thick and bulky.
B008O5RDNA|3|Like the graphics. Not so much the material of the shirt.  REALLY shrunk and one of the shirts came apart at the seam after first washing.
B00B190TEQ|5|The jean arrived on time and fit great. They are pre washed, so the fit an wear is ver y comfortable. I highly recommend these jeans.
B007OVOJ78|5|I LOVE THIS THING, SO COZY
B000UVPUSG|5|These have sat in water, in snow, ice, and stood up to leaning on a heater for too long. They get 40 hours of wear at least a week and have been better then expected. I won't ever pay for the name brand of Carhartt again when these are just as good and a third of the price!
B00BCRWS2I|5|Luv it will buy again no dought.also it gets five stars because it's perfect . Thanks I will be getting more.
B0087C5QT8|5|Perfectly Fitting Awesome Color I would Definitely Purchase This Product Again If Other Colors Are Available And Priced The Same****
B006D9BMUE|5|The shorts look great and I cant believe how fast they got here. Looking forward to buying again in the future and will recommend to my family and friends.
B00551OZKU|5|Great
B00GM3RV5Q|5|Loved it, soft, comfortable! A little thin for a sweatshirt so not for winter. Jimi Hendrix picture was perfect! Great for gift
B00ATNEGDU|4|Well, the product is as expected.
B00OJM85B6|4|thank you
B00BSZUEVG|3|The material is not as heavy as it used to be but nice for summer anyway.  The stitching on the leg hems is poor - puckers a little here and there.  There's also a crease in one of the hems that makes the leg edge crooked - it's hard to iron out because the fabric won't take too much heat & steaming alone won't take it out.  I also bought these shorts in dark green & the problems are exactly the same.
B00H7KHKIG|5|like it
B00EZ477CG|5|I love it, it was thinner than I expected but I am very pleased with my order. It was suppose to take over a month to arrive, only took two weeks. My best friend is going to love it :)
B0007KQHJG|5|bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  This was one of her favorite gifts.  She loves it and wears it a lot.
B00BFX4MOG|5|Love them Lolove them, l
B004M4ZAR8|5|This shirt was exactly what I expected. The right size, the price was amazing and the imaging was dead on, absolutly no complaints. Highly 100% recommend this shirt.
B00BUZKOG4|5|Bought shirt for a gift and my grandson loved it.
B00IVERGPY|4|I like this jacket very much. I thought that it might be a bit heavier, then again I guess it's just right to start the Fall off with.  The size is just right as well. Very comfy too. I would recommend this product.
B005GR0TVM|5|Nice, thick t-shirts but do seem a little short in length (and my husband is 5'11&#34;)
B007FR4SCM|5|Love it love it love it its a beautiful purse in a beautiful color it's my fav purse. I get so many compliments and the bag and the color and I tell em exactly where I bought it &#34;Amazon&#34; ....
B00C0X0E0Q|4|I'm excited to get these shorts, I can't find anything like these at the local stores. I'm nervous about the size I'm 5'7 145lbs 27 waist 36 hips. Crossing my fingers the medium fits \\"true to size\\"
B0000BNFAN|5|I have had 2 pairs of these Danskin capri leggings for for 16 years!!!!!  They have kept their shape and color.  They have never been at all see-through!  I finally purchased 2 new pair and they are the same high quality I had in the old ones.  I love these!!!  You cannot get this quality at this price from anyone else!!!!
B00P3RLC0W|1|This dress is beatiiful but is very small . The size xl is the same size m
B00FQCMEX8|3|Words were printed on a cheap sweater, can't say it's worth the money spent. Although, it fits well and it's comfortable.
B00L7Q1VHC|5|I had read reviews that said it ran small, so I went up a size and it fit perfect!! I'm 5'3&#34; and 140 pounds and ordered an XL. I've only worn it once, but it seems well made and is very comfortable. I received lots of compliments on it too! :-)
B00A3G257C|5|been a while since i used a chain wallet and this one is perfect , not too big cuz there are some that fold and end up being too big and uncomfortable but not with this one
B00EHOBVO4|5|It's great
B00FQSV5IM|5|Exquisite piece. Beautiful scarf with vibrant colors.
B00F9H373Q|5|Works great for a great-grandson!
B008J4MWK0|5|I'm 5.1 and weigh 120 lb and it fits perfectly. Thick, plush, seems well made. Exactly what I was hoping for!
B000CQ2ZOQ|5|I did this already!  It was great!  thats why i chased it down and bought it, again and again,  I don't loose my lighter anymore.  it also deters anyone from walking off with my lighter.  everything is organized in one place, it's great. Good looking too.
B006PGGJOE|4|can try it ..... ........ .........  .........its good one ....... my wife liked it ............ great for the price .......
B00N9PY5J0|2|The arm are extremely too small & the little rhinestones on this picture isn't what I received, received one with hugh gold tone spikes! The torso & length is for someone that's tall, so my short torso/height didn't work at all (a lot of material left)! I'll suggest that they start listing the models measurements for a more accurate picture!
B0090437XO|5|fits good.
B00QQYOFP0|3|It's an okay product.
B004KPKRQS|2|This suit didn't work for me because there is no coverage to prevent nipple show-through.  If it had had some coverage there, it would have been good.  It supported my 38-C boobs nicely, which is something I have a hard time finding.
B00COQCKN8|4|I read in other reviews that this slip fit smaller than advertised, so I ordered one size bigger than the size charts claimed I needed.  It fits nicely, so the sizes do indeed run a little small.<br /><br />Separately, the product description claims this slip must be line dried, but the tag on the slip itself calls for a tumble dry.  So its care is that much easier than expected.
B008RW9PCC|3|It's not a fitted jacket, has too much extra space. I'm average build with waist 34 and height 5' 10\\" and this looks a little bit too big on me. One thing that's a plus is that it's reversible and the inside doesn't look ugly, you can actually wear it inside out and not be ridiculed.
B00C2G35D4|4|i am 5 foot tall, about 115 lbs. I wasn't sure what size to buy-I bought a small. Fit perfect-until I washed it. Dress very cute, not cheap looking, very comfortable. I wish I had gotten a medium though. it still fits, but I seemed to be pulling it down alot, now its a little snug in my hips!
