B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app!  It gives you plenty of options for not only the type clock but a multitude of ways to notify you!  I like the fade in feature as well as the ability to dim the screen.  If I would change anything it would be to allow you to dim even lower, almost off.
0140186409|5.0|My daughter needed this book for school, it was a required reading. Instead of running out to bookstore, I ran to log into amazon.com. Once again, I received a pleasant deal!
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|This is a splendid collection of &#34;Early Music&#34;. Early Music is how the Archiv label of DGG defined its mission from the outset. I had bought many Archive LP's over the years. I always admired the sound quality, choice of repertory, performers. I also admired the scholarly notes, even though as a non-specialist, I rarely read them more than once. (The booklet enclosed, gives identification of the contents, a history of the label with highlights of some performers, in brief, and that's about it).<br /><br />What you get is 50 or so CD's of great music and performances, at a bargain price. This would be a fine starter collection of early music.<br /><br />For myself, it was a chance to hear some old friends, once more. (The LP's have long departed). It also brought new repertoire and performers to my attention.<br /><br />I am not going to pick favorites or the &#34;bests&#34;  I have been picking CD's at random, and have enjoyed every one.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Now I am a big fan of the show. Love watching several episodes back - back. Can't wait for season 4.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This is one great movie.  It has lots of comedy and awesome singing sequences.  We've watched this movie soooo much that everybody in the house knows the words to all of the songs.
B003U53GK8|4.0|Season Six finally answered many of the questions about the island and how the Oceanic 815 survivors ended up on the island, but it also left a lot of questions unanswered. The build-up to the final episode was engaging, but the final episode left me disappointed. The &#34;flash sideways&#34; are finally explained (sort of), but the explanation doesn't really make sense. In my opinion, the writers could have kept the flash sideways and had a completely different ending that would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If you've watched seasons one through five, you have to watch six for closure, but don't expect to be wowed by the ending.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The author must use \\"stream of consciousness\\" style of writing because I found it to be all over the place. Impossible to pin down, confusing. If others think this is an example of good writing I have to wonder what they learned in school. Does she ever get to the point? No more by this \\"writer\\" for me, thank you! What a waste of my time.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie puts a twist on the power that loving and being loved can do!  Great fun for any age.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I love Spartacus. Always felt bad that Andy Whitfield didn't live to go the distance with this series. It was a good last season, although I think they could have done more seasons and held peoples interest, afterall, Rome did rule most of the world for a very long time.  Overall, Im glad I got it. Im sorry it is over.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Once you set up , it sort of becomes clear this is a battle game more than anything else. At first I was nervous to fight multi player, but that is where you get the large amounts of seeds and nectar to further yourself  with everything else. You don't need to use real money, as long as you are patient, except in one area: if you are fighting multiplayer you will need to buy a shield so no one attacks you while you are offline and you lose ALL your seeds and nectar. And that will happen, trust me. If you aren't going to spend money to buy a shield, I have one recommendation: make sure your seeds and nectar are as close to zero as possible so when you do get attacked, you haven't lost much. With all that said, I love this game and Ice Age. They are both from Blue Sky but have different goals. Enjoy!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John's Greatest Hits is a must have for anyone who is a fan of someone who has been giving us one hit after another for over 5 decades. His new album the diving board is a testament to his longevity in a business that in my opinion has turned it's back on artists who have paved the way for the young new faces we see on stage today. Having a compilation of this man's work on one CD makes it easy to remember and appreciate what a tremendous talent he really is.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|Not having seen this in 15 years, I was stunned by this film's quality.  Movies in the last few years can't compare to this.  They may be strong in exposition and expression but they don't know how to complete a story arc.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Kids love this movie,, great for fam movie night,, had this on VHS when my girls were young now own it on DVD for the girls and the grand kids to watch
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|Good quality and service as expected. However, these are the exact same as the FIRST ZOO 6136 set. Maybe I should ask Where are the parents?
B007REV4YI|5.0|regular blu-ray and digital copy movie good movie but one of the weakest bond movies of all just got it to round out the collection
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Thank you Christopher Clark for introducing this approach to the endless &#34;who is to blame&#34; literature published about this complex subject.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|ear pads are cheap thin plastic, not like the old ones. head band is also made of stiff thin plastic, unlike the old ones. theme here ?  sound is ok for voice and hearing whats going on, but again not as good as the old ones. they really do seem like $20-$30 pair, not what they are charging. all the money of went into the TA3 connectors to make the cable easy to replace.  the upside is they are light and reasonably comfortable for open ear design. not for critical use where isolation is needed like field audio recording, then the HD280's are the best price / performer hands down.
B00C50NV2C|5.0|Cool glasses, light and work as expected. I would purchase these glasses again.  Adds a whole new dimension to gaming with both players on the full screen without seeing the others actions.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|Bought this & the talking castle  for my granddaughters  3 rd. birthday & she loved it.nice details. Great for the imagination. :-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator and happened upon the fraction calculator as the free app of the day. I liked it so much I found this one too. The numbers are big, it's simple to use. I would have no problem paying for it , and I have recommended to several people for their own devices. Well worth it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I liked the main character. Put in prison unjustly and he didn't get mad; he used his situation to make a new and better life. A modern Job.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun fun there's lots of riddles and helpful clues I liked this game had to buy it so I could finish it out to see what happened can't wait for part 2
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Needs more apps, Google too slow on puttiing out updates, so other apps can be added, Google wanting more control!!!
0765334798|5.0|Scalzi is one of the best writers of science fiction today; and, Redshirts is a very well-written and funny, yet thought-provoking book.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was anticipating this book with much excitement.  Both athe Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are on my top 5 list of books ever read.  However, this book didn't live up to my expectations.  Khalid Hosseini showed exemplary writing in the prior two.  This book fell short.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game, I can't put it down. Simply entertaining.  I USED to spend time playing Scrabble, but Tree of Life is where it's at.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is on my list !!! I will read this book at least once a year. This book has everything, horror, heartbreak, friendship, fear, rage and revenge, and of course love. If you're a Stephen King fan you won't be disappointed.  After reading this book I''m left wondering about Abra, maybe we will read her story someday. If you haven't read The Shining do that before you read this book. The movie was great, the books better.
0525478817|5.0|OMG! This book is amazing, and should be required to read by every high school. It teaches you to live, and not just breathe (i was short of my breath the whole time i was reading, Hazel-effect) I love this book, the kind of love that you never want to read it again, because you know if you read it one more time you will be never be able to let it go from your heart.
B006UKC566|5.0|It looks like the goo guy is like Jesus Christ and the Bad guy is like the Anti Christ making his soldiers.<br />The end looks like the War in Heaven Revelation 12.
0439023491|4.0|four stars, as fun as the first book but maybe a little too gory. lots of surprises though, good read.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|This is the Dukes greatest western film ever. Bar none. You cannot get a western that has more. A little comic comes with it. TOM
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Ever since I updated the new version of Facebook, pictures don't load normally. I usually have to pull down to update to most recent posts, click on the picture, or turn my WiFi off then on again, and I know it can't always be my WiFi.....please fix this, it's very annoying...
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Beautiful vocals, the music is so wonderfully written. Had only heard the single Pompeii but the rest of the album is equally strong. Love this album!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's hard to play the game some time to do what you have to do so it's not that bad for a FAR game but good
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|Another one of my son Mikey's all time favorites, The black eyed peas are played constantly by Mikey. Best, TOM
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I just got this kindle fire hd 7&quot; like 3 weeks ago. I also noticed the Facebook prompt telling me to update. And when you press where it says &quot;update&quot;,  it takes you to the google play store. So, I went to the Amazon store thingy, looked up Facebook, and THAT'S where it says update. So simply, go to the Amazon store, look up &quot;Facebook&quot;, and that's where the update is. Hope this helped.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game for all ages - helps children increase their hand-eye coordination and strategy skills...I sometimes play more than the kids ;)
B008AIGWVA|5.0|It's funny it's great and my family likes it  even my parents laugh of the cat!!!!!! So I have to admit that I and my family likes it so I and my family like it love the cat so I have to show my parents and my other family about the dog
B004P5RMZ2|4.0|It's good to watch them create their music. The concert would have been better to watch if it wasn't split up though.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Told with amazing feeling....loved Bobby telling his version of this story and look forward to buying this in a hard copy
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't play minecraft on android but I play on PC instead. but this version keeps my brother from asking so much about the PC version. great app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how Peeta is so venerable and I'm so in love with how he really does love Katniss but she thinks it's just a tactic to win
B00594XOZU|3.0|This has stopped working.I also get the same message appear when trying to log in.<br />Please please Amazon sort this out as seems to be a update error or something.
B0084B5TK8|1.0|The slowest most dull and genuinely un exciting book that I have EVER read. This statement speaks volumes considering that I am a die hard vampire fan. I used this book as a way to get to sleep at night (reverse circadian rhythm) as it bored me into slumber. Literally this book is so boring I could only finish a few pages at a time before passing out - took me 3 mos to finish. So... in. Closing, unless you are a naturally nocturnal soul like myself, do not read this unless you are looking for some shut eye - if you seek adventure read something...ANYTHING else. Bram Stoker...... you are genuinely unimaginative, stale, and vastly overrated as an author. Thank you for succeeding in sedating me to dream land though.
B00884GR0W|3.0|it was really fun before I had bought minecraft on Pc and even for mobile. if you have a felling for this game than the 6.00 $ minecraft this is worth the buy
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|Was it the awesome special effects? The great story? The deeper philosophy? The exquisitly designed composit space craft construction? The very cool self essembling graphite weaponry? The interesting biology? The preciousness of seeing an actor actually help his own child to attempt to surpass himself? Let the haters hate... I like the story and I think this was one of Will's best. It was certainly one of M's best. It IS good clean family fun. Enjoy.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is somewhat like the original angry birds, but in Star Wars fashion, (which I love Star Wars) and it give you different backgrounds than the original.  So that makes it fun.  My grandson wanted to get this game because he also played the original.  I'm sure you will like it also.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I came out of this film thinking \\"This is the best film I've ever seen in my life!\\" (And I'm over 70 so I've seen a lot of films). And then I read the reviews here and find that a lot of other people felt the same way. This isn't a movie that people just like. All the reviews say something like \\"The best film of the year\\", \\"The best film ever of its genre\\", \\"This film is the most perfect film I've ever seen in just about every way\\", \\"an extraordinary film\\", \\"I'm in awe,\\"etc. There aren't many movies that get reviews like this.<br /><br />You just have to see this film in 3D with the silly glasses. And don't think \\"Oh I'll wait and see it when it comes on on DVD, etc\\", because you will get just 10% of the experience. The experience of seeing this movie on the big screen, in 3D, is what you want. Please don't miss it because you will regret it forever.  An extraordinary film!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is fun. I also love the new Halloween update! I like how you can buy different borers and people.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|This may be a movie that could grow on some. I am privileged enough to have never experienced war. The hell that both sides are submerged in Right Now. The senselessness of it all. My guess is this movie captures that a little. I assume from budget constraints or time restraints that the editor was forced to use lousy takes. This same restriction allowed for flaws in make up to show because the close-ups were just too close. This allowed for some really bad acting to show up in the final version of this movie. This actually made the acting look bad at times. But it does pull together and convey the more general idea that &#34;war is hell&#34; but the more disturbing attribute that for many there is no end in sight. And like the end of Blade Runner &#34;Maybe he just liked life and decided to let me live.... Not my life but any bodies life&#34; Dekard said in the narration.  In the end this movie just shows me a smaller version of same stupid things that people are compelled to do to each other for some nebulous reason. To win a war but nobody really wins. EVERYBODY LOSES. Not a bad flick and not that predictable either.
B009A9SULS|5.0|Better than the previous Kobo I purchased. The size of mini is just so right. All ebook readers should have this size.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Joe Satriani is one of my favorite guitarists and if you are reading this, you likely know he is probably one of the top 3 living rock guitarists along with Steve Morse, and I'm not sure about the third.  I saw Joe perform this album when he came though Denver with The Steve Morse band warming up.  It was a great night and I really liked the songs from this album live.  On listening to the CD a few times now, I've come to conclude that while this is solid work from Joe, it is not in the top third of his albums.  It is still definitely worth getting, particularly if you are a Joe Satriani fan.  But if you are new to Joe Satriani I'd get others first e.g. Surfing With the Alien, Strange Beautiful Music, The Extremist, and Crystal Planet.
B0055S348W|4.0|Amazingly simple to install and immediately found my wireless printer.  Printed out a photo and a page from the Note App easily.  BUT, the glitch is Gmail.  I can't print from Gmail, nor from the app, on my Kindle Fire HD.  Keeps asking for an application-specific password, but doesn't work or give any instructions.  Hope this will be fixed!
0596805888|4.0|The quality of content is not in question. It is undoubtedly a great book. However, there are paging issues with the Kindle Fire HD. I will sometime flip pages only to read the last half of the previous page. This has happened 3 times and I am only on the first chapter. I think there may be an image missing as well (the xkcd comic). Please fix!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best ive ever read. It gives much more detail than the movie and is a powerful story.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|Nothing special in presentation, and mostly a gateway for the dev's other apps. I  would not have even considered it if it had not been FAOTD. It was, however,  a nice break from Amazon's &quot;all games&quot; leanings.<br /><br />An &quot;at a glance&quot; widget would be nice.
B009WHDE3C|4.0|Great feel good film! Love is always a possibility no matter who or where you are and this cute story is a great example.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|I read this in that other brick and mortar bookstore while browsing with my daughter. We laughed so hard there were tears streaming down our cheeks.  It's absolutely hilarious and one of the most creative books since The Monster at the End of this Book.  I love it, and I am asking for it for Xmas.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|This a great movie. It's too bad I wasn't able to watch it because it kept hanging up. Poor quality internet from Comcast? -or it is Amazon?
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've become addicted to this simple tool for a peaceful sleep.  Don't underestimate the power of a simple sound.  I simply don't rest as well without it.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|What an amazing comeback, this is better than their previous two albums, i can't stop listening. My favorite songs are Nicotine, Casual Affair and This is Gospel. Buy this!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What a journey.  The visual effects of this movie alone whether you like the plot or not make this movie worth watching.  The acting is done really well too, making this movie a favorite.  What an adventure.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Can anyone live without their facebook? If you say yes, you must live on another planet or are completely techno backwards. This was one of the first apps I put on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 after I bought it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game it has variety and I Have fun with collecting. Just wish I could bingo more often.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I'm a fan of Lady Antebellum, even more so after listening to this cd!  I just can't get enough of it!  My very favorite is &#34;Downtown&#34;, which I could listed to over and over again.  Great harmonizing, just an incredibly talented group.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was pact with suspense and was entertaining the whole way through.  No wonder it one Best Picture in the Oscars this year.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was not only very erotic but also captivating. The storyline was intriguing and kept my attention. I could see myself in the story. I would love to read this trilogy all over again.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|this is quite possibly one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. Hands down. A lot of people say that this game is not challenging enough, I guarantee you that is the players that have never beaten all the levels in under 30 seconds. It is also extra challenging whereas you miss a star, you have to go back and replay the entire game to recollect that star. Excellent powers up great. Excellent action, and works exceptionally well on my wifes dual core tablet and on my quad core tablet. I've been playing this game nonstop for the last 5 days since it was the free app of the day. Excellent job Amazon, all I can ask now is that you release the second part as a free app of the day. Or else I'll just want to buy it it's that good.
B007NESBK2|5.0|amazing show and concert from sade......amazing beautifull singer with great vocal..... excelent sound and amazing  video qulity. 5 stars . Recomended !
B0064J6OMO|1.0|This movie goes too far.  The premise is familiar (switched lives) but the execution is disappointing.  It's really crass.  If you don't like overt obscenity, you will not like this movie.  Again, it's too bad.  This movie had potential for broader appeal (especially with the lead actors chosen) if they just hadn't \\"gone there\\" in so many scenes.
1416550550|1.0|As hard as I've tried to complete this book it is just too slow and I could not get through it.  There are sections that just drag right into the next slow section.  This was chosen as a book club book and I hate to not complete it, however, it was just much to boring to hold my interest.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A wonderful story based in history.  I live in Australia where we are haunted by the tales of the Aboriginal &#34;stolen Generation&#34; and the thousands of children taken from their mothers in England and shipped to Australia. Growing up in New York, I had never heard of the orphan trains. The similarity of stories were startling.
1400069807|5.0|Well researched, extremely informative, and filled with great information on healthy eating and avoiding the worst of the worst processed products.<br /><br />I thoroughtly enjoyed this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it<br />It is the best!<br />It is seethe 5 stars<br />It is the best thing ever<br />You shoud play it some time
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Having never read The Shining, only setting the movie dozens of times, I too felt it was frightening more by what was not shown than was.  In Doctor Sleep I was able to relive The Shining through different eyes while watching the terrified little boy grown into a terrified man.  Also, it was absolutely essential to see Danny hit bottom so kudos to Owen King.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|I love this movie.... Such a classic!!! Rene zellweger is absolutely a riot and Colin Firth makes me want to move to London!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I loved Star Trek growing up and these movies just made it so much better from the special effects and so on. I love these movies. Great service by seller. Delivered in good time too. Mike
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|A most scholarly, in-depth and intriguing, account of our nuclear weapons program. This informative work touched on the egos, political in-fighting, heroism and  the angst of the individuals involved.  the underlying theme of this book was that because of egos, politics, etc, accidents occurred, lives were lost, valuable resources destroyed, and the government lied. There were no really satisfactory safety mechanisms on the operational nuclear warheads, and no consistent stable command and control. Communications during emergencies was non-existent, or at best marginal. We as a nation were lucky, the world was fortunate that a nuclear war was not initiated, by accident.
B000J5XS3C|2.0|I bought one of these to use in a mobile sound system configuration; it has great features, but the quality leaves much to be desired. It replaced a larger (and more expensive) Mackie 1202 mixer, which was too big for our needs. Unfortunately, it is inferior to the Mackie in every way except size. The Mackie is much older, at about 15 years old, but is more reliable; the Behringer is less than two years old and has a couple of dodgy connections. The cable wart power supply is inconvenient and makes the small size less of an attractive feature. The power connectors are also somewhat flimsy, compared to a standard 120v power cord as used by most pro audio gear.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this unit, however, is its sound quality. It has much lower headroom than the Mackie, leading to frequent accidental clipping when using any amplified source (like keyboards, tablets, phones, laptops, USB sound cards, etc.). Given that it's targeted to beginning audio users, it isn't very forgiving of inexperience, so whenever I've let others setup and run this board, it's ended up sounding harsh and clipped. Even when everything is working perfectly and no incoming levels cause clipping, it's still not up to the quality of the Mackie (much less higher end boards or gear).<br /><br />I plan to replace this unit with something higher quality, as soon as possible. It's simply not something I want to rely on. I feel similarly about most of the Behringer gear I own...it's so tempting, due to the low price, but a couple years into doing pro audio work again, I have learned my lesson. I can't afford to rely on gear that prioritizes low price over quality.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'd never played this type of game before, but downloaded it after reading the many positive reviews. What can I add to what's already been said? FlipPix Art is fun, addictive and rewarding. The basic concept is easy to learn, but it gets progressively more challenging a you go...just as it should. Fortunately the increases in difficulty are not too great, so you have an opportunity to gradually develop your skills.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Only complaint is can't get to the buttons on the bottom of the screen on my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus

B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I have to say, I like it. The data for weather is sourced in off weather underground, with a link to it on the main page if you want to view more details.<br />The app contains basic swipable screens that show you different pieces of weather. One is just the current temp in your location, which it determines on first launch.<br />Second screen shows you hourly forecasts w/temp and precip.<br />Third screen lets you add in locations.<br />There is one screen with the Dev's other apps, which I guess some people feel is an ad, but I disagree. I think any app can and should show you other apps the developer has worked on. If you like the app, you may want one of those, and if not, you are probably uninstalling anyway.
B001MV49HG|5.0|I had the first press version bought from UK few years ago. But the disc has been broken. Then, when I bought this copy from Amazon.com -  I love the audio quality gets better. But I dislike the details on the cover - not as complete as the UK first press version.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|I love it! Armin Van Buuren gets it right every time! Great vocal and instrumental tracks both! You can never go wrong with AVB!
1455526959|5.0|If you're a fan of Michael Connelly's Det. Harry Bosch, then you'll be very happy to read this latest installment in the series.  Not as dark as &#34;9 Dragons,&#34; nor as light as &#34;The Drop,&#34; &#34;The Black Box&#34; is about an older, wiser, more responsible Harry, but with none of his edge taken off.  Warning:  As with most of the Bosch books, it pays to read them chronologically.  Otherwise, you might miss some of the developments and relationships in Harry's life.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I mean its a dvd set.. all were in working condition. It was delivered quick and I didn't leave me couch for a week marathon watching my favorite adult cartoon from the 90s.

B001NHNG64|4.0|I don't know that much about guns and rifles.<br />Guess I know more, on a short term basis, but<br />was it all necessary? In all a very enjoyable read.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I love this book. It brings me back from a dark place.<br /><br />I love Miranda and she is not like any other models.<br /><br />She has my respect.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is like the best game ever!  The little music video is almost the best part!  (You'll probably be singing it for hours)  Those cute little dumb creatures are also amazing, my personal favorite would have to be the guys who's sold both his kidneys on the internet!  Ah, I love it!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I enjoyed it.  It has a very clean, clear plot.  Don't listen to the bad reviews.  I don't understand what they are about.  After Earth was an enjoyable family sci-fi with no foul language, which is rare these days.  Great job!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Brilliant little tool.  Frees up a lot of space by wiping out any unnecessary files left over by uninstalling apps and programs.  Small tool and easy to use(usually a 1 click process)  = a must have if you install and remove games and
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the features. But the whole reason I got the clock was for the white noise, and it plays on a repeat that is less than a minute. It's very distracting while I try to sleep!

B007Z9QTVI|5.0|One of the greatest films.  My Freshman college students love it.  Highly motivational.<br />This is my first copy I keep losing it to students.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I watch this movie whenever I can and with the CD I can take the music with me wherever  I go.  The music on the CD sounds as good as the movie on my home theater.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|it was very easy to install and it works great, the setup was very simple as well within 5 minutes i already was ready to use it
1600597963|5.0|Just loved how the basics of the bead embroidery were explained, the examples were amazing and surely the few projects were actually great - especially for the beginners. But I can tell that this book is more than good even if you are not a beginner :)
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Looking for a film to introduce a writing assignment on Mental Illness.  Held the students captivated (college level). A little rough for some.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book really grabs your attention and keeps it. The details were great and kept you on the edge of your seat.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Book is honest no nonsense look at the restaurant industry and Bourdains life. Loved it. Would recommend it for Fans of Anthony Bourdains shows.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have had kik on my kindle since July, and I have occasionally deleted the app and downloaded it again, for other reasons. But the problem I am facing is just like everyone else, I am unable to get access into my account. I'm unsure if you guys have updated the app, and maybe that's why it stopped working. Typically, I use kik more often than text, and I am unable to now. Do not download, it's s waste of time and space. I am highly disappointed.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I bought it for my Nikon D3100 and it fit the camera perfectly, the charger, an extra battery, extra SD cards and a small cleaning set (brush, cloth). It still have room for other things. The padding is great and I feel my SLR well protected and safe in there.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love this seres! I have read it 3 times so far. Now I am just waiting for the movie to come out!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book! As an avid King fan, I was not disappointed! I've always wondered what happened to Danny from The Shining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great sequel. Because I hadn't read The Shining in many years I read it again before reading Doctor Sleep.  Amazing continuing story of Danny Torrence. Do suggest you read The Shining before reading Doctor Sleep just to familiarize yourself with he family
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|A quick look at basic info. All I  wanted on my kindle and free ! Not for anyone looking for a lot of details. There are other apps offered on the last page but only a few and half of those are free also. Nice little app.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app is great! I don't need to scour my favorite websites for news and interesting articles. Its nice to have it all in one place.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I'm glad I checked it out and I will definitely read the others in the series.
B00CRS88IO|3.0|This was set in 1940 after France fell and the French fleet was up for grabs.  Fleming was the do all know all super secret Brit Agent who would fix the problem.  OK so far.  But, as we rocked along in 1940, there appeared jets, helicopters, V-1s and V-2s.  OK, there goes any hope of a thread of reality as none of that stuff was around in 1940.  Oh, yeah, I really don't think anyone is as interested as the author in the style, color, make and model of each character's current outfit.  That added to the tedium of this work.  I was sucked in by this being a described book on Fleming's WWII exploits, not the author's ideas of what they were.  I'm betting that Comdr. Fleming was as dashing as Bond and as he is in this book but lets stick at least somewhat to the facts as they were in the time of this narrative and leave off the clothes horse descriptions please.  Overall, a less than satisfying and somewhat juvenile book.  Had it been a free borrow It might have been worth an evening's read.  As it was, just money up a well dressed wild hog's nether quarters.
B0007KVAVG|5.0|This is a great album if your a Judas Priest fan you will like this. Rob Halford sounds great! I Love it!
B008JFUTUY|1.0|After the trailers there is nothing; the documentary cannot be watched. I sent two emails to complain and got no answer.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I am currently reading the book.  I am a Kay Scarpetta fan and enjoy reading Patricia Cornwall's book about this character.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|A really nice piece of work from one of our generations great entertainers. Elton sounds great, he is playing like it really matters, and this is music he cares about. I say this as a fan from day one. I tuned him out during his shlock period, but here is EJ singing with fire and passion, and reading his recent interviews, he seems like a likeable guy at this stage of his life. If you like the sound that brought him to prominence, get this album!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|If your a Judas Priest  fan you will like this, its a little darker music than Painkiller. Great  album. You will like it.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|This was a terrible movie,not worth watching the special effects were ok , the love story predictable and terrible terrible
B0002VFXFE|5.0|chose the rating do to it being the silver compound don't need to use a lot of it helps keep processor cool
0763657875|5.0|This book has so much information under the flaps.  I saw this in London but did not have room to bring home.  I ordered three of them. Good service.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Fun game, but you have to get tokens to play. Takes way too long to accumulate them for free, and I.m not buying them.
0440217563|5.0|These Books are AWESOME.<br />I will read over and over again, I love them so much! Historic fiction/romance/adventure amazing : )
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was very disappointed in the ending of the book. It was boring and did not keep my attention. The ending was a big disappointing. Such a let down from the build up of the first 2 nooks in thr Trilogy.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|Great movie. I saw it online and then I purchased the blu-ray after. Worth the money. I greatly enjoyed the songs (it took getting used to but it grows on you) and I did enjoy the story enough to support the series.<br /><br />4/5 stars on the movie but still deserves its chance for people on the fence. Take the time to watch it if you're a fan of MLP:FIM
1623650003|2.0|This book is being promoted as the new \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Trust me-Alex is no Lisbeth Salander & Pierre Lemaitre is certainly no Stieg Larsson. I found most of the characters including Alex & Detective Camille very unattractive characters. With Lisbeth I was rooting for her in all 3 of Larsson's books because she is a sympathetic character. There is nothing sympathetic about Alex.<br /><br />I found that this book dragged in a lot of places expecially the last third of the book. The book is repetitive & tiresome. It is a very grim tale. This is the first & last book of M. Lemaitre's that I'll be reading. Save yourself $24.95 + tax & check it out of your local library.
044022425X|5.0|These Books are AWESOME.<br />I will read over and over again, I love them so much! Historic fiction/romance/adventure amazing : )
B008Y212PI|5.0|If your new to this type of game take it slow and figure out the system. Once you understand how to work the puzzle it's very addictive and a good brain work out without being too frustrating.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|i have not seen this movie in a very very long time. it is a little weird. i was expecting more violence. instead there was a lot of sex. im not complaining but i can honestly say i did not expect that much hard core sex.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the size, features, easy install, &#34;the whole Idea&#34;. My only criticism is that more app support it. Not really a negative towards Google, just really looking forward to other apps. Happy I bought it though, very inexpensive.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Although this movie is pretty bloody, it is pretty awesome! We saw it in the theatre and then I bought it for my husband as a bday present.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|You collect coins, get gadgets, this app so totally rocks, dude! Never gets old! I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ignore all of the negative responses, and listen to mine!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|christian bale has become my favorite actor. i loved american psycho, and this movie was just as great. even if you do not like him this movie is worth watching at least once.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The acting is superb, the writing is superb, it's just a superb series and I'll cry a lot when it comes to the end.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|She loved it! Good for any little girl that likes MLP! More reasonable priced than a lot of them that I have seen also
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Dont plan on plug and play..I figured it would be a quick process...it wasnt for me...also my slow internet connection didnt help.<br />I was primarily looking to watch You Tube on my flat screen..it just was more complicated than i was willing to invest. Maybe others<br />are loving it, however, i sent it back.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|arnold i the man. i remeber watching this on vcr tape. i must of rented it a hundred times. if your into bodybuilding this is a must see movie.
1455523550|4.0|I read this book for an outside reading assignment for my 9th grade Honors English class and I absolutely loved it! It was, yet another, great love story by Nicholas Sparks. I finished this book in just a few days because I just couldn't put it down. Safe Haven takes you and makes you feel a various amount of emotions including, but not limited to, happiness, sadness, excitement, and anger all throughout this novel. It makes you want to read more and more. The reader could experience a change in emotion within a split second just by reading a few words more. Safe Haven, also. teaches you about life and how rough and how pleasurable it can be, It teaches you the strength and determination it takes to find true love and how hard it is to break free from any difficult situation you may experience through your lifetime. I would HIGHLY recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys  romantic and/or dramatic novels. If the specified reader enjoys reading horror, comedy, or even action over romantic and dramatic this may not be the book for them. But, overall, I though Safe Haven was a great novel and an amazing life lesson.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great fiction novel that sucks you in! I'd recommend it to anyone, all ages, either gender. Don't miss this one!
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3OZ4WHW2GAIT3]]Don't let the title of this keep you from buying this product! It's still amazing just the sizing is a little off.  I assumed that it would seamlessly sit side by side with my mac wireless keyboard but it's just a little bit bigger.<br /><br />The best and most useful function of this keyboard is the ability to perform calculations and then send them to your computer! This eliminates the need to copy from your caulcator.  While this may not sound like a huge deal, when you are working with larger numbers, it's very easy to mess something up and this function prevents that from happening!<br /><br />Overall, this is an extremely nice tool and I recommend it to everyone!<br /><br />Please watch my video for more information
B000SEGUDE|5.0|D.M. has an Awesome ability to weave a complex story together.  It had the right amount  of  difficulty and flow to keep me engaged and making deeper connections in his writing.  There are great themes on belief ,human morality , future ethics and present ethics.  Black swan green is one of my favs as well.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro has - deservedly - just won the 2013 Nobel Prize for literature.  She recently stated that this is her last book.<br /><br />This latest (and last?) collection of short stories, along with her many, many books (over a lifetime of writing), deserve high praise.  And the Nobel Committee has just announced the BEST praise any writer can EVER receive, calling her a \\"master of the contemporary short story\\".<br /><br />Well Done, Alice!  WELL DONE!
0316247545|5.0|Very well put together nice quality, a lot of info in such a small package. Worth the money. A beautiful book!
B004U8URGA|5.0|Great music,enjoy listening to this cd very much. He does the songs very different,but still has his style that you can identify.I bought 2 CD's.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|First of all Chromecast is hard to set up combined with poor product support = frustrating evening.  The WIFI at my house is encrypted with the latest encryption as should be yours (WPA2).  But Chromecast does not support it.  The only way I could get it to work was leave my WIFI OPEN!  Chromecast then updated itself so I turned my encryption back on after rebooting  to see if it would work now and......nope.  Had to open WIFI back up to get it to work.<br /><br />* FYI Chromecast also only works on &#34;G&#34; band WIFI it will not work on the newer &#34;N&#34; band.<br /><br />It does work well with Netflix.  But that was all the further I went.  It was too much trouble for too little payback.  And of course it does install Google Chrome browser on your desk top as well as try to make itself the default browser.  A Roku is a much better option with a lot more flexability which includes streaming from your home sever to your TV.<br /><br />It was much easier just to hook up my laptop to my TV via HDMI cord and use a wireless key board and mouse that to use Chromecast!  Spend your $$ on something else!
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I am rating 4 stars because it works for what i want. It looks great, runs pretty smooth and i like that i can put any zipcode to get instant answers. The hourly info is great too. Dont know if i would pay for it since its pretty basic, but its amazing on free app day.
B0053FANS6|5.0|This seemed like a good conversion to HD. The quality is good and the movies are fun. The Mummy movies are somewhat silly rather than scary, and suitable for people who would like a fun horror type movie without a lot of scares.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An easy ready with the perfect amount of emotional turmoil. Characters that have elements that everyone can identify with, which allows you to start thinking, do I really truly know anyone?
0143119680|5.0|The title drew me to this book and at first it wasn't what I expected.  It turned out better than my expectaions.  I bought this book and the second book in the trilogy so that I would re-read them to stay current while I wait, impatiently for the third book.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Another great effort by the Cirque team with an assist by James Cameron. Have yet to see a half-hearted attempt by these two dynamos.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Looking forward to the next two books. I can feel the emotions of Kat sand Peeta.  An exacting love story.
0740785508|4.0|Its ok,love to lirns omethong new...it is not a bad produkt, it cood be better but I like it . I will recomend it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I postponed reading Hunger Games because I thought I would be disappointed. I shouldn't have worried. I was hooked after the first ten pages.<br /><br />The plot is riveting. The characters in this \\"post-apocalytic\\" world, which was once the United States, are believable, and you quickly care about them. Actually this \\"post-apocalyptic\\" world is two worlds - one with all sorts of modern marvels and one (where most of the action occurs) where life is hard due to the cruelty of the ruling group.<br /><br />I knew the conclusion after about fifty pages, but I was amazed to see how the author accomplished it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik was put on the kindle app store not to long ago . But it hasnt been work for a month or so . And it really needs to be fixed .
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've used kik forever on my kindle, but I tried logging in the other day, and it took forever, then said there was something wrong. I've deleted the app and everything, I've waited a few days, and its still not working. Please fix.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This movie is awesome! Who can compete with Robert Redford!  I was very disappointed in the new version of The Great Gatsby. The dancing and rap music was very inappropriate for that era.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa as always set the bar for other guitarists. A great performance with a few guest appearance that may suprise you.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|i live in a small town in India. it automatically detects my town  and gives local weather information. it also simultaneously shows ( after selecting place ) information about another town where my father lives. this app do good job and is very useful.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Amazing. Read the books first before you watch the show but the is definitely fantastic. I love that era. Exquisite
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the first games I've downloaded to my KIndle - great graphics and lots of fun!  I know I'll come back to play it time after time - love the hula skirt!  I'm planning to download the movie.  ALOHA and MAHALO (thank you)!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|really great purchase, tried it with YouTube and works like magic :) but It really need a GOOD Internet connection
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Read the phantom and loved this book, the snowman ,would recommend it to anyone who likes a good crime novel
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Nice story and some beautiful prose. I can see why it is on many reading lists. I will be reading more from those old lists.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|My only downside is that I had to get the chromecast software &#34;somewhere&#34; out of google play store because they only support united states, I understand the reasons, but either way it is not non-us frienly yet.
B009MYARIK|4.0|How determined can you be to stop your sister from consummating her marriage?  Yes, you know she rushed to marry and she will regret having done it.  This is a race to prevent her from consummating so she can annul her marriage when she comes to her senses.  Loved it!
0802473156|5.0|I bought this after a suggestion from a friend. I was starting an old love up again and didn't want to screw it up. This book has made me get why it didn't work and now we're doing just great! I love this book (the boyfriend too). I'd suggest it to anyone!
B00006G8K0|5.0|A classic from the Hammer factory and one of the finest &#34;Dracula&#34; adaptations.  Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are nothing short of sublime in this trendsetting 1958 horror film. Director Terence Fisher keeps the blood flowing — abetted by Jack Asher's crisp Technicolor photography. Track down the excellent 2012 Hammer restoration (available in Britain) with additional footage.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|This is every bit as good as any of their previous works. Hands down the best pure rock band today.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Robert Jordan is definitely one of the greatest Fantasy Novel wirters of our time. Would recommend his material to any avid Fantasy reader.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Would have liked it as a kid, but not as an adult. I do not suggest this bond flick. that is all
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This will be brief as I hate writing reviews. However, some things just HAVE to be reviewed and this album is one of them. I've been a Volbeat fan since \\"Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil\\" and, for me, they have never released a BAD album. Some are less favored by myself than others but I would not consider any of them BAD. Up until the release of \\"Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies\\", there was no contest that \\"Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood\\" was my favorite album. Every great band has at least that ONE album that stands apart from the others and, for me, that was \\"GG&CB.\\" I truly did not see Volbeat ever topping that album. Then came \\"Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies.\\" Wow. What a truly phenomenal album. Is it better than \\"GG&CB?\\" In my personal opinion, yes it is. Is the best song on \\"OG&SL\\" better than the best song on \\"GG&CB?\\" Probably not. But then again, does it really matter? No, not really. This is truly a landmark album from Volbeat and I hope they continue to get better and more popular!! Viva la Volbeat!!
B005SJIP1E|5.0|The version of Mahler's Second in this set was the very first recording on LP that I had ever heard of the symphony back when I was 12.  I later had the 6th and 8th and was familiar with a few of the others.  Columbia LPs back then were of very poor quality -- always had hiss and pops -- and with Mahler it was always annoying.  After a while I avoided Columbia unless the classic Odyssey recordings were on sale (which in the 70s was 3 for $5!)  So now we have a 12 CD set for less than the original price 40 to 50 years ago, without even considering inflation.  On top of that, I had no idea these recordings could sound this good.  The clear, rich, and mostly undistorted sound is very listenable.  The only thing that is slightly annoying is the 1960s tendency to have too much stereo separation.  This problem is mostly noticeable with headphones.  With speakers it is less obnoxious.  As for the performances, I find them to be much more restrained than I remember.  Perhaps it is because with time many more conductors are hearing the emotional depth that Bernstein heard in these pieces.  Bernstein was really one of the first conductors to get past the stoicism of the early 20th century.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|this movie was so funny that one point I literally almost rolled off the couch. I have a pretty quirky sense of humor so maybe it's not for everybody... but, I think I'm going to watch this movie over and over and over again and I suspect it's going to be funny every time.
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|After stumbling upon a couple of songs by Florence + the Machine on youtube that I enjoyed I decided to buy the deluxe edition of this album.While playing with different styles and putting them on the same album can prove to be a hit or miss for a number of musicians,I have to say that wasn't the case with this group.If anything it seemed to draw attention to the vocals.The variety of instruments and how loud they are in comparison to the singer at some points,the rapid change in styles,it all makes you listen in a way that a lot of modern music doesn't.I'm glad that I bought this CD and was drawn in enough to truly listen to songs that I might have normally overlooked.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like Mahjong and I especially like this one.  It keeps me busy on those long waits in the doctor.'s office or other such places.  Dedicated two this up.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Really nice game, needs more cars to chose from and upgrades for the design of the car. It would be nice to be able to reset .
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Good story.  Good acting.  I watched this with my wife and we both enjoyed it.  It has a little something for both of us.  I will certainly watch it again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is one of my favorite mobile games of all time!<br /><br />I have been a fan of Cut the Rope since it's release. It's a fun and innovative game.
0385537816|3.0|This book is less literary but is entertaining. I had a hard time getting into it in the beginning. Less literary than the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' imo. However, the writing style here probably hits more of the mainstream audience.
0307970299|5.0|The story was well written and very descriptive, you could almost feel what she was going through. Maybe I can relate to the story as I backpacked part of the PCT myself. When I was 20 my boyfriend and myself were planning to hike the PCT, but it never happened; it's been a dream of my for some time now. This book has inspired me to start training for a dream that may become reality.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So easy to plug and play - worked really well.  Initially was worried when iPad wasn't communicating with my TV, but after rebooting iPad it all worked GREAT!!  I've used it every day.
0805091742|4.0|Presents the power of checklists, or basic planning, from many different angles.  While I was introduced to this book at work, its been helpful for home and hobby to boot.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I did this rate because this book was great there was no dull parts I loved it and whenever I went to bed i wanted to read more. This book is great.
0143124544|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I didn't know anything about it other than a character with a disability (but I didn't know what type). Wow, I had NO idea how thought-provoking & heart-wrenching this story would be. \\"Me Before You\\" far surpasses the typical/traditional love story. Actually, I'm not sure I would consider it a love story. It's so wonderful & it gave me a renewed respect for those who are disabled, especially to the severity of one of the main characters, Will. I loved the author's writing...I felt like I was part of the story. I could feel Lou's (main character) love/pain over Will...especially in the last chapter & epilogue. I've had my fair share of heartbreaks but the one in this story puts all of mine to shame. It was captivating. You'll remember the characters & how the story made you feel long after the book ends. Highly recommend. So glad I read it...& I will definitely read it again.
0452289963|1.0|I am a student of Abraham, Bob Proctor, Bashar, and basically anything to the law of attraction.<br /><br />I read this book and felt incredibly depressed at the end of it.  Prior to reading this book I had a firm understanding that I am a co-creator with the universe.  That I can feel and experience whatever it is that I wish to experience simply by controlling my thoughts, which control my emotions, which control my actions, and which create my results/reality.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book if you are the type of person who believes in achieving your dreams and also believes that the entire universe is supporting you in your mission.<br /><br />This book made me believe that all my desires are from the ego.  That my desires to have a life that creates pleasure for my five physical senses and my desire to extend this type of life experience to any and all who would also like to experience the same is from the ego.  And it is from the ego because my desires to 'change' my environment are from an inherent 'dissatisfaction' with the now.  That if I kind from the joy of simply existing whether I'm living the life of my dreams or shuffling papers in an office for thirty years that I am not living a true life.<br /><br />So at the end I felt incredibly nihilistic.  If I did find joy in the present moment, regardless, of my environment than I one of the 'unconscious' people.  And on the flip side if I do find joy in the 'present' moment than what is the point of wanting a richer fuller life by conventional standards, because how can you feel joy in the present moment yet also a sense of dissatisfaction.<br /><br />I summarize this book in one sentence.  &#34;If you cannot feel 'presence'/'acceptance'/'complete surrender' to the present moment (regardless of the environment) than you are unconscious and suffering.&#34;
B004XWMXW4|4.0|Smooth Criminal as well as other great songs on this cd. It's a great mixture of all different types of songs
B000VHE9Z4|5.0|This set of 40 Star Trek DVDs is even better than I had imagined it would be.  I am very happy with its viewing and audio quality and with its packaging.

B00DVPN30A|5.0|If you're a big fan of Amos, you just love this man's voice. It's unique.<br /><br />If the above is you, then you'll like the album. You really can't not. It's not his best, but best is subjective, so be your own judge. The quality of his voice is not as subjective.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It moves on too fast.  Cannot keep up with it.  Needs to slow down. Did not like it at all.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The additional step of the PC or smart phone app makes it awkward when selecting a Netflix program. It gives great HD pictures to my LCD/LED TV screen. It works through a WI-FI setup.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has been perfect for me and has meet my need for a calculator. Not to complicated and easy to use.
B005TKD512|5.0|Very well written, interesting and full of examples, stories and experiments. Great book. Practical, too - I made the first chapter required reading for all my staff.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book because of the reviews. The description of the book made it sound like a version of the TV show 20/20.  Continuous interviews with survivors of the Zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />I am so glad that I got the book and read it. I liked the story a lot and it was interesting to see how different cultures, different countries, the military and groups of people fought, lived and died to save themselves. The story was well written and thought out. The scenarios were realistic and it made you feel like you were there with the people telling the story and living their experiences.<br /><br />The book is far better than the movie. I wish the movie had followed some of the best excerpts of the book and they made the film from those stories. This is the first zombie book I have ever read and I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. I liked the story and it leads me to try other such stories.<br /><br />I rate the book as five stars. Some of the tales in the book will put the spooky feeling in the back of your neck and others make you think about what you would have done in the same situation. Isn't that why you read, to stimulate your mind, use your imagination and entertain yourself or to learn. Get this book, you won't be sorry.
B00FGEO9NE|2.0|I'm a fan of Homeland and really enjoyed both season one and two. Season three has not lived up to the first two seasons so far. Dana Brody is my least favorite character in the whole show. I don't like her character and wish they would write her out of the program. They have given her way too much screen time in the first two episodes. I'm interested in Carrie, Brody, Saul, Quinn, and the agency and how it all plays out. I don't want to waste my time on Dana and her love life. Brody wasn't even in the second episode,they replaced him with Dana. If it continues down this path I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to watch it. I really like Clare Danes and Damien Lewis, they make a very interesting couple in the series.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|This CD has something for everyone. Retro 60s,70s R&B ,soul. The song &#34;A Strange Arrangement&#34; sounds like and should become a timeless classic.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The game is awesome it is so much fun and very entertaining look forward to my turns every day well worth playing
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app. My daughter loves this app. It is easy to follow and pre teen friendly. Would recommend to most young girls.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game.  This is definitely the right to play after you've watch the movie.  It's full of fun and entertainment with a childish twist to it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|it was exactly the size i was looking for. i bought it for use on photo-walks. it holds all my main gear, 17-50 2.8, 70-200 2.8, 50 1.8, flash with case of batteries, DSLR with battery grip and an extra spot for miscellaneous cables and triggers.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Enjoy the game play and the story line is pretty interesting even if it is a bit corny. All in all this game is a great pastime.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I already started season 2, and that one is much scarier than this one is.  But, this one was still good, and it took me only a week to go through the whole season.  In fact, I was so into it I bought the second season, so it's definitely good!  Can't wait for the premier of season 3 tonight!
B00000IQW5|5.0|You feel good when the movie's over and you don't mind watching it again.<br />Always did like John Goodman, especially without R. Barrge.
B007SGM084|5.0|This wasn't at all what I expected and much better. Just wish it had continued on. Lolz. Was worried it would go deep into the bdsm lifestyle and be focused on that but that's not the focus in my opinion.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Fun game so far great graphics nice features for hints and dialog puzzle was not<br /> to hard interesting concept for the game
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game! Relaxing also challenging due to the different levels! I play a few games everynight to relax. I definitely recommend this app. If you like playing cards you will like this game.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Amelie provides a fresh perspective while still maintaining a comic tone. I certainly deserves the critical acclaim. If you want a fun, light evening movie, I recommend Amelie.
B000002IJL|5.0|I love the songs and the music. I bought this CD to replace my old tape recording. I know, I am still behind the times. My son says I need to get an MP3 player and get my music electronically. Oh, well, in  the future...
B00871C09S|5.0|Still one of the greatest movies ever produced. The acting and the suspense is classic. I believe it's hitchcocks best films.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|A lot of twists and turns that kept me at the edge of my seat the entire read.  It was no predictable as are most of books in this genre that I have read.  It is fast paced and it all starts within the first few pages.  You will not be disappointed.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I ordered this a year ago, but only had a 2.1 sound system. I just upgraded to a 5.1 and thought that my favorite Marvel film could test the system out.<br />Despite how good of a movie this is, I was disappointed. It still only plays in 2.1 (there is no setting for audio on this disc). My other movies play just fine on the 5.1.<br /><br />I don't know if it is just that they sent me a Canadian copy of this product, or a faulty manufacturing error, or just an unlucky \\"only-guy-on-earth\\" with this issue.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|Go to moremarvel like the instructions say.  enter in code.  go to digital copy plus.  Open your itunes and sign into your itunes store account.  Enter in your digital copy code for the movie again at digitalcopy plus after you have selected itunes as the player.  It will give you a second different code for you to redeem in the itunes store.  look under quicklinks for redeem.  hit redeem and download the movie.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Layout and color themes can be adjusted. It only learns what you type if you allow it to. Finger slider available, many many many languages supported. More extra characters on a keyboard then I have ever seen
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Talented, seemless, effortless.  Sheryl Crow seems to have made the transition to country music!!  I look forward to the next CD!!

B00F8LPH90|5.0|This has been an awesome game so far. I really didn't expect it to be so good. I got it on my android phone first then got a message today that it was available on kindle. The first zombie game I have actually enjoyed.

B00BMUVUZG|4.0|I enjoy all John Grisham books. The Theodore Boone series are great children's books, though as an adult I have enjoyed them too.  I always find John leaves you with some though provoking information.
B007RAJVR4|5.0|Once again, Jason does not disappoint in his musical journey. This talented guy plays, sings, writes and performs and rarely disappoints his fans. Another keeper from Mr. Mraz!
0800187792|5.0|I love the story. I was talking to my wife about it and wanted her to see it and enjoy it as I had years earlier. I can show it to her grand children when they come to visit us from Europe, with out worrying about cussing and lewd and intimidating scenes. Though they understand a limited amount of English they can enjoy the film.
1451648537|3.0|Easy read.  This book provides some real insights into the life of a maverick genius. It is not afraid to expose the flaws as well as the brilliance of the man. I think it could benefit from some  editing.
1250006341|5.0|Gift but I could not put it down before I mailed it. Would like to have one for myself. thanks

B008RA3X5E|5.0|We very highly recommend this alarm clock.  We use the alarm clock almost daily.  Very easy to use.  No errors or problems.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I am surprised by some of the negative reviews this album has received, but understand it is not for every persons taste.  For those expecting \\"Sting\\" from the Police, this album is not for you. A nostalgia piece, or the same old sound is never my preference.  I prefer musicians to grow and change musically, and expand creatively into other, possibly less lucrative directions.  Sting has proven with his work over the past years that he is a musician who is continually exploring, as well as gaining wisdom as the years pass by. We age with him.  I love The Last Ship...it is a highly personal account of a boy from Newcastle, England, growing into a man, defying the usual path allowed for children of shipbuilders, as well as his father, and striking out on his own into an entirely diffent direction.  He is now looking back to the past to understand the man he is now.  It is BRILLIANT, and I urge you to give it a listen.  The English Folk tunes combined with using his Newcastle accent, as well as watching the death of the shipbuilding industry (and loss of a livelihood for too many souls) he, as well as his father grew up in, is quite moving.  It is important to look back while looking forward.  I know this is the soundtrack for a Broadway play, and if I could order my tickets now, I would. Expanding into different directions musically is risky, and I applaud that he had the guts to do it! If you are a fan of Celtic or Folk music, with some jazz thrown in, you will love this.  I am a musician myself, and I was extremely impressed by this album  I also have a new respect for Gordon Sumner.  Well done!

B001BR3P3U|5.0|This is an unusual musical with enough comedy to keep the viewer interested every step of the way.  Or, is it the other way around?<br /><br />The only drawback I could find was that action scenes at times were over-the-top, quite a bit exagerated - most of the chase scenes.  Can't recall the rating, but the grandchildren loved it, and noted the exagerated scenes throughout.<br /><br />I not one for musicals of any kind, but this one kept my attention as it did way back when it was first released.  A keeper!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Sucky. It glitches and crashes everytime I play. When you buy a character it takes your coins and doesnt give let you play as the character!!!!!!!! Do NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT get this app!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever HAD !!!!!!!!! And it does not freeze I am really happy with the game
B00ET7INY0|5.0|Ry did some live recordings years ago, this live recording is also good. It was Volver, Volver, that sold me on this recording. A sweet surprise and the ten piece band made it a 'famous story'. Also worth the price of admission is Wooly Bully, or it is Ry' s story about Sam The Sham and the Pharoahs that makes the song. Back in the old days Ry did some touring with Sam. Ry, of course, has played with lots of wild and crazy guys, some of the best and brightest in the rock and Tex-Mex scenes, so if he thinks Sam was awesome, then he was. Lots of great stuff here, certainly the guitar solo on Vigilante Man is a sign of Ry Cooder' s trademark, the bottleneck guitar.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great Game.<br />  On long car rides its a great game to play.  Fun to see if family also has 3 stars
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved this book so much. It changed how I look at the enemy. Never trust your enemy but always respect the enemy. Be the careful gentleman of a bad situation
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|A truly delightful little book.<br />There is an Eleanor and a Park in all of us.<br />Highly recommend.<br />Very well written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and just over all cool<br />I was very surprised when I got this game it's amazing..it's runs very well on kindle fire
B000003C2S|5.0|What had started with Scream Bloody Gore and continued with Leprosy is taken a step further with Spiritual Healing.  Songwriting and production values are even better and this album marks Chuck Schuldiner's lyrical growth as he began moving away from the splatter/gore lyrics into topics more thought-provoking and relevant.  A truly awesome album.
B001RLP862|4.0|I've just read over some of the Reviews for the Bicycle Prestige playing cards and would like to ad my 1.5 cents worth.<br /><br />S. Michael states that these cards are made in China.  They're not and they never were.  If you look at the packaging a little closer you'll note that the box IS made in China but the cards are made in Spain.  That's because Fournier makes these for Bicycle (Fournier is actually owned by US Playing Cards which also owns Bicycle).  USPS also owns Gemaco and Kem so I suppose they could have chosen another source for these but rumor had it that Fournier was chosen because their cards were the closest to paper cards in feel and performance.<br /><br />I understand the criticisms of flexibility and feel versus, say, the Copag cards.  But then they're completely different animals.  If you get these cards, treat them exactly like you would your paper Bikes and you'll be very happy with them.  Copags and Kems are MADE to bend and return to shape but you would never do that with a paper card.  These are basically the same but with the added benefits of washing plus extreme longevity over the plastic coated paper playing cards you keep throwing out.<br /><br />Price wise, you should be able to find two decks of these for about 10 dollars so they're on the low end of plastic playing cards.  By my count I have 9 decks of Kems ranging from two 1938 decks up to three 2013 decks, two decks of Copags and these Fournier Bicycle Prestige cards not to mention a myriad of paper Bikes, Hoyles and whatnots.  I like them all for different reasons (plus my daughter is getting into magic tricks) even though they're all very different.  You'll like these if you prefer the feel and action of Paper over the more traditional professional plastic cards.<br /><br />The only real minus is that the paint is a bit fainter than on other cards and it will slowly come off (I've had mine for about 2 years).  I don't play cards on felt so that has likely accelerated the process.<br /><br />FYI, my wife is reading this over my shoulder and says she prefers the Prestige over all the other cards in the house. . . so there's that.<br /><br />She's always used paper cards and says these are the easiest to shuffle and deal.
B000003C5C|5.0|This Death album brought the band to the forefront of the death metal scene with their improved song writing and production.  Songs like Leprosy, Pull The Plug and Open Casket are what death metal is all about.
1250006341|5.0|There are some super photos of behind-the-scenes, as well as a some background information.  You will enjoy this volume - try it.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|After the greatness of Individual Thought Patterns, Chuck Schuldiner and Death were able to continue the growth of their songwriting in unexpected ways.  Melody and brutality merge in ways to compliment each other in an aural assault that leaves you wanting more.
B00FN811SY|1.0|Please make this available for the Kindle Fire. I've been so anxious to use it once it was announced that this app was coming out.<br />Thanks!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Book stands alone even though it is the first one in a trilogy. Loved the fast pace, complex characters and sub plots.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|A film character with mental challenges is often pushed and pulled by outside forces.  This time she does the pushing.  I would have liked to see a little more of how her passion for animals was her motivation rather that just a flood of new ideas.  So called \\"normal\\" people can continuously misunderstand what's right in front of them.  It's a small but happy story free of overacting or manipulation.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun, interesting,challenging puzzle game. I just finished the 5x5 puzzles on to 10x10 puzzles which seem to require a little more thought.
0385349831|4.0|It is a good reminder of ancient old wisdoms of life philosophies on translated manuscript found in Accra.  Whether you are religious or not, this little book will give you daily guidance when you need it.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book. I found the website and thought it was so good that I bought the book to effectively pay for the value I was getting online. The book is well organized and really useful for a novice like me in that it presents basic information and then follows up with more complex and technical techniques. Highly recommended for someone that wants to start home brewing.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I've been looking for a card game to play on the go. Stumbled across this one and told my friends about it. Good work

B007TKT2SK|4.0|Good calculator, serves it purpose and I haven't found anything wrong with it. It works as it is supposed to.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is addicting and increasingly challenging. Best game of its type that I've played!<br /><br />Hints don't seem to help much since the puzzles I've used them on have large open areas, but they do occasionally help. Deselect button is a big plus!<br /><br />However, I've had issues with the user interface. Even on my 7&quot; Kindle Fire, the paint and break buttons are too close together, and I end up hitting the wrong one at least once very few puzzles, despite increasing how careful I am. I'd love an option to put them on opposite sides of the screen, especially with the playing field being so easy to center.<br /><br />I've tried playing on my LG Spectrum II, but that only works well for 5x5 and acceptably for 10x10. 15x15 makes each block too small for my fingers to be very accurate. I have to be incredibly deliberate painting and breaking on this smaller screen as well.<br /><br />Recently pleasantly surprised to discover additional puzzle pages. I've been playing a little while now and had only found 3 pages. All of these puzzles must be completed before the others are accessible. No teasing here with pages you can see but not access!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|All of my kids really enjoy all of the different angry bird aps. The kids can't wait to see what they come out with next.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I thought this was a great historical read. I will look at certain stories and people from the New Testament in a new and better way.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the author a little because for a twenty year scholar of religion, my book discussion group found a couple errors in his book that caused us to think \\"Spin\\" more than once.<br /><br />Read it for yourself, you will grow your faith and learn that you might have more to learn about this \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\".
B0061S073A|5.0|I have this on my phone and my kindle. My kids know if they want to play on either device to click that button before they do anything. It locks down the device to where the kids cannot get off of that screen without the password and they cannot purchase anything even accidentally.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Beautiful well written novel!  I was entranced by every page and the author brought the characters and setting to life.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This ap kept freezing and never really worked right, it needs work and some tweaking for sure. Hopefully they will improve it.
0385121679|5.0|Amazing condition, arrived quickly and packaged well. I had loaned out my copy and lost it, This was a wonderful replacement. Much better than expected.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book taught me a lot not only about the beginning of Christianity, but much about Judaism and what life was like two millennia ago.  It also provides context to the battles about religion today.  A very compelling read.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|I only recently found The Oatmeal site. I have lived with only two dogs...both poodles...and both wonderful. I was bonded early on to cats and found that the cat lover skills carefully acquired from age 6 weeks onward have no transferability to dog lover skills. I couldn't believe how big a gap losing my first dog made in my heart. For all their less tha endearing traits, they inch their way into your heart. This book beautifully captures the joys and penances of dog companionship.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|The 3D is actually really great for the film. I'm not usually a big fan of 3D in theaters or in general because of the way that it's overdone and cheesy, but everything stands out for this one. It's worth the extra amount to pay.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|2010's ABIII was, to many, an extension of the masterpiece that was 2007's Blackbird in terms of style and composition.<br /><br />Well, Fortress stands alone.  Alter Bridge has done it again, and taken their music to the next level.  This is quite literally their darkest and most aggressive album to date.<br /><br />If you've listened to Mark Tremonti's recent (and excellent) solo album, All I Was, you'll recognize the differences in the hard riffs and spiraling solos from their previous albums.<br /><br />The title track, like Blackbird, is the magnus opus this time, clocking in at seven and a half minutes, featuring all fans have come to love of the band: Kennedy's renowned, multi-octave vocals, perhaps Tremonti's greatest guitar solo (which is saying something, considering the critical acclaim of the Blackbird track), Phillip's fantastic beats (who also had a fantastic side project release called Projected, check that out as well), and the pulsing bass of one Brian Marshall.<br /><br />The majesty of this entry to the rock world is hard to put into words.  It's simply unbelievable.  Get it, listen to it, and  love it.  These guys are the rock legends of today.<br /><br />If this doesn't, at the very least, win Best Rock Album, then I've lost all faith in the music industry.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book makes you want more. I couldn't put it down.I love all of the detain so you can really feel what is going on.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Great, fun game normally. I purchased and was charged the $4.99 but didn't get the power ups. Love the game and will not attempt to buy any more.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|great story told with humanity and understanding of relationships and the power if forgiveness.  Would highly recommend this book .
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|They tell it the way they lived it.  What a story, what a band!  Brought back great memories of the Hell Freezes over concert.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I remember when Trent Reznor released Pretty Hate Machine in the late 80s, when Down In It was on the radio, it was great! Now he has evolved his work into Hesitation Marks which is a great album in my opinion. Every Nine Inch Nails album is great! the listener needs to resonate with the theme of every Nine Inch Nails Albums (songs for that matter), which I did and I appreciated each and every albums, singles, soundtracks he did. To bad very few radio stations play current NIN tracks anymore. NIN is NIN and opinions about his albums are valid but a true NIN fan would argue that all of NINs music are awesome in their various ways!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's one of the best bingo games, it always keeps you wanting more, just wish I'd win more. Really have a lot of fun playing the slots.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Very pleasantly satisfied and not the least bit surprised at such high quality work and attention to detail. Would expect no less from the true God Jehovah's Organization. Thank you for your diligence. And praise Jah for His undeserved kindness!!  I only wish I could give more than 5 stars.
0060555661|4.0|It is a required reading for my finance class. I haven't really cracked on the book yet but it is pretty thick so I should probably start early...
1401322786|3.0|I listened to the audio version of this book and thought the narrator did a fantastic job - I loved all the different voices!<br /><br />The start of this book was great, Dor's story drew me in immediately! I was fascinated with his fascination with measuring time.<br /><br />Sarah's story was sad to me. I felt so terrible for her, kids can be so mean. Ethan was such a jerk and I hated that Sarah couldn't see that.<br /><br />Victor's story instead of making me feel bad for him actually made me a little irritated with him. Here he has a wife who loves him and instead of spending what time he has left with her, he wastes it on trying to find a way to preserve himself so he can live forever.<br /><br />It was a quick read, but there just wasn't much to it and the ending didn't really make complete sense to me. Overall it was good and if you're in the mood for a quick read that makes you think a bit this would be for you.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|hey I like ur page on rb u need to add the light and dark to tablets to it awesome
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Joseph Fiennes was more than excellent in this movie; why he was not up for best actor makes me doubt the ability of the folks voting.  One does not have to be a Shakespeare fan to love this movie.  The movie was in good condition, and the sound was great.
1781162646|5.0|This is a delightful, nostalgic return to earlier Stephen King books.  The story is uncomplicated and written in King's breezy but thoughtful style.  It was a perfect antidote to some of the dense, depressing fiction that I had been reading earlier in the summer.
B00003CXFV|5.0|The fact that this was based on a true story make this &#34;do the right thing&#34; movie even better.  The movie was perfecly cast, and one really did not want it to end. The movie was in good condition and the sound was good.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|They sound better than ever - enjoyed this cd very much!<br />I read the reviews of other buyers and they are the reason I bought the cd.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Superhero movies are so easy to bomb especially when it has so many heroes in it. Yet somehow a number of different movies with different superheroes somehow came together to lead to this surprisingly entertaining and great movie.<br /><br />Sure, it ain't perfect but it is one of the closest one I've seen to that goal. If the movie was more complete and rounded out I wouldn't have minded sitting for 4 hours of it.<br /><br />Worth it.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|This is a PERFECT example of &#34;don't judge a book by it's cover&#34;. OMG. This guy &#34;looks&#34; like a stone-to-the-bone dweeb, but he sure fooled me! I had to laugh at myself for being SO wrong! If you love &#34;old school&#34;, the Motown era, street corner groups, the Memphis sound, then THIS is your guy. He must have grown up listening to his parents record collection because he is WAY too young to have heard it himself. And I must say his parents were some hip people. This guy has a LOT of soul and a respect for all the musicians back in the day. I personally think his biggest influence was the group Confunkshun because I hear a LOT if their style in his songs to the point of totally ripping them off, but I am NOT mad at him, he does a good job. If you're going to pay tribute, then THIS is the way to do it! I am thoroughly enjoying this cd, and so are my friends. I first saw him on &#34;live from Daryl's house&#34;, the web show that Daryl Hall hosts, liked him, but really didn't pay attention until I saw him on PBS doing a concert. He is GOOD!! You will get HOOKED! You will have a &#34;favorite&#34; every day!
B000VZKMSO|4.0|This album, in my opinion, is amazing. It is also, Kanye's last great album. Every album after this one has just hasn't been anywhere near as good.<br /><br />Now, you have to understand, I do not usually listen to this type of music. I am more of a Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Blue Oyster Cult, etc. So when I say this album is amazing, I really do believe it. I could listen to this album many times over from start to finish. The lyrics are catchy and the music just flows and has a great beat.<br /><br />A few of my favorite tracks are:<br />Good Morning<br />Champion<br />Stronger<br />Barry Bonds<br /><br />It's a great album, it isn't for everyone, but I do enjoy it a lot. I think everyone should give it a shot though, if just to try it out.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good, sexy story.  I had put off reading it for quite some time, I wasn't sure if I would like it.  I did.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I am a lover of both Cher and Christina. Wow did this movie not disappoint. The story line was great and the vocals were out of this world. Do not be afraid of the title all the dances were done in great taste matter of fact if they had this burlesque show around my area I would go see it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Actual uses are limited. The streaming from a computer can be going great for a while, but then slows down a lot. I figured out that by turning off my phone's wifi, it speeds up again. Maybe my router is just bad, but even with it working smoothly, it still has a few issues here and there.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|This is a great movie not only for children but for adults. Can't help but get a little teary eyed at the ending.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple. 2 disks per movie, 6 disks total. 1 disk each for the movie, 2nd disk is for the special features. Cannot beat the price, I got it for (and its still selling for) $30, which is a BARGAIN. You're getting 3 AMAZING BLU-RAY's for $30 total. If you buy these individually, they cost anywhere from $12-25 a pop.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|This 4th edition by gameloft contains great graphics , realistic cars,and good sfx.The  biggest disappointments are its story missions where all one does is kill kill and kill gangsters and nothing else. The difficulty level is too easy both for the story and race missions , only rampage holds up some challenge. None of vegas's infamous exploits are fully explored and almost the whole city infrastructure remains unused. Another drawback is the space used up(it uses almost 2.5 gb) .<br />It lacks the depth grand theft auto provides in vice city or liberty city franchises . So in my opinion the game's great for 99 coins(discounted price) but its NOT AT ALL worth 699 coins.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Lot's of good baby tips and tricks and a really entertaining read! Not like those boring text book like baby books.
034580404X|5.0|I love this book. The story line is great and even when I think I might lose interest something happens. I like that I can't completely guess what's going to happen.
B009K916ZK|5.0|The adapter arrived on time and work perfectly each time I needed it.  It continues to be part of my kit when I travel.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I not only love the special effects and the way the original characters are played by new actors, but I love the alternative history line. In this one, though, there's a subtext of certain critical events being inevitable, even though the timeline is changed and the crucial role is performed by a different character. I can't explain that without injecting a spoiler. I did have to watch it a second time before that message completely sunk in.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Ms. Strayed has included all of her experiences as she took on this monumental hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Why does someone do something like this?  Cheryl Strayed at the age of 26 had STRAYED from what most consider a stable and moral life.  She felt she needed to rediscover who she really was  and in so doing find peace of mind.<br />The book covers Cheryl's three month hike. You will discover who and what she meets along the way and how she deals with it all.<br />The book is well written but drags a little in the middle.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Update: spent a lot of time on phone with google support.  they could not determine why could not be configured to work from a macbook air running mountain lion...  works fine from an iphone or ipad....<br /><br />I have now spent more than 1.5 hours trying to set this up.  I am very tech savvy and have tried all kinds of \\"configurations\\".  Samsung TV show Set Me Up, 4 digit code, name of Chromecast, etc.  downloaded the chromecast setup app.  it finds the chrome cast.  shows that the chromecast is on one of my networks. but then every time get the following message: \\"We canʼt seem to connect to \\"ChromecastXXXX.\\" Make sure your Chromecast is powered on and nearby and that you are not on VPN.\\"..... nothing works... rebooting computer, router, etc.  nothing works.  have searched all over the internet and not found any answers....  may have no choice but to return....
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Very thought provoking book. Cannot explain it, you need to read it to understand the raw motivational power. It comes highly recommended!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Like I said before,I can keep on going how good this book is,page after page it gets better and better.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|castle is a well written series with good acting interesting murders but with a comical feel. very much a feel good series
1401324029|5.0|The story lines are so fantastic,I take this book every place I go,everyone should try it,I love the tv show also.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Amazing game..except at one point you have to control yourself from buying from the store. This game is enough to keep you satified until hearthstone comes to the kindle
1401323820|5.0|After reading the first book,I had to buy more,as you go along it gets better and better,just love it so much.
B005LAII08|4.0|The slapstick humor didn't work for me... the mother/daughter relationship I enjoyed a great deal. Oh, and its beautiful!!!! Middle of the pack for Pixar (what a tough standard they've set for themselves)
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love this  game but it's telling me to update but there's no way to up date it. Please fix thus problem. We can't play until they fix this bug. :(
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was expecting banter/moonlighting with some Sherlock Holmes tossed in. I FEARED it was a complete knockoff of the BBC Sherlock.<br /><br />I like it quite well... a nice drama... Lucy Lui plays a real life character (versus McBeal's Ling Woo or Charlie's Angels...). Well worth a peek. Jonny MIller makes Sherlock seem like a troubled soul
B004LROUW2|4.0|1Q84 is mysterious story with touch of perceived supernatural elements. It is interesting to read with anticipating more on each chapter.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I originally got this because I use my tablet a lot. This has basic and useful functions. I strongly recommend it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Keeps my interest...sometimes it is a little slow, but I like it!  I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|finished this game in one sitting one of my favs :) i recommend this game and more by this game company
B0063GORYU|4.0|good graphics good size I like the hint option the cards an nice looking g a lot of options in games. it is very entretaining
B00785P2QC|3.0|The vehicles take a while to load and glitch out a bit but the game is addictive.<br />I like watching my money go up lol.
B00009UTQD|5.0|This will fit 3 or 4 filters with their plastic cases. It will fit even more filters if you dont use their plastic cases and thread them into eachother.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I dislike that it is no longer a google run app for android. I would like it to not be a third party app. And also sometimes it won't play desktop videos. That bothers me.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|With electronics, i always have the problem of not having a philips small enough so i have to use a flathead and end up stripping one of the screws. Not anymore, this kit has every tool i would need and some i dont think i would ever use. Its great to have for anyone who likes to fix their own stuff. I cant recommend it enough.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE IT! It has alot of great ideas and crafts. Its easy to find stuff and to use. Its  awesome bc even my grandma can use it.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman's ability to tell an engaging tale is well known and much appreciated.  What stopped me in my tracks was his startling description of the Ocean (read: Cosmos) unfolding in a bucket of water!  Exquisite and transcendent.  This one stays on the shelf to read and reread.  Kudos to Neil Gaiman, author and Metaphysician!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The picture quality is very good when streaming Netflix. I do wish there was more streaming options. l like that it is compact and easy to install.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel started out slow but once the twists and turns began, I couldn't put it down.  It is definitely worth reading.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Every song on this album is extremely enjoyable. I've listened to it 8 hours a day 5 days a week since I bought the entire album.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|I would not quite say \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" is my favorite Megadeth album. That award would more likely go the it's successor, \\"Youthanasia\\" (but that's another topic). I must say there is reason why this is Megadeth's biggest commercial success. Dave managed to streamline his sound, very different from what was heard on \\"Rust In Peace\\" yet still stay to his roots as a thrash band unlike Metallica who resorted to trashing themselves as a metal band and mutating into a redneck-rock band lumped with musicians such as Garth Brooks. (No offence to Garth or country music but Metallica is supposed to be a METAL band if I remember correctly!) Dave, thankfully, did not make that mistake on this album and remembered who he was. Because of him doing so, he created one of the best albums of his discography. Songs such as \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\", \\"Architecture Of Aggression\\" and \\"Psychotron\\" (probably some of my favorite tracks) show that Dave can play in a more radio-friendly style and yet remain the world's state-of-the-art speed metal band! I am also glad they did a 20th Anniversary tour for this album (a tour I saw them on, I might add)last year. There is a reason why many metal heads prefer this over Sell-Out-Tica's \\"Bland\\" Album....as I heard someone else refer to it as.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I have cut quite a few bottles with this system. It takes practice but once you get the hang of it the results are awesome! I have done liquor and wine bottles. I'm most successful when I boil a large pot of water, be sure you have plenty because if you run out mid way your basically destined to fail.<br /><br />Tips<br /><br />I swipe two fingers by my nose or forehead and massage that little bit of oil into the area that I plan to trace a line in.<br /><br />Make your line in one motion do not retrace<br /><br />Listen for the tiny crack when the cold water is being applied and give a sure and swift tap against the bottom of the sink. 8/10 times this works perfectly. 9/10 times it works!
B001FB563E|2.0|End of the world movies can generally be categorized into one of three categories.  The first is the zombie scenario, which is probably the most popular in terms of ticket sales and advertising.  Examples of this genre including everything from action thrillers like World War Z, to gory horror flicks like the Resident Evil franchise, to comedies like ZombieLand.  The second category are the alien invasion movies.  Here we have films like Skyline, Storage 24, Oblivion, and others of this kind.  Then there is everything else, few of which see much success.  A good example of the latter is \\"The Road\\" which came out in 2009.  Set in a near future where smoky fires cloud the skies yet rain and gloom cover the earth, the film seems set in a USA after a nuclear war has disabled the infrastructure of modern technology.  The plot follows a man and his son who travel westward to the Pacific Ocean hoping to find any community to live with.  Along the way they meet cannibals, criminals, and other refugees.  The father dreams about his past, life before the catastrophe, and shortly thereafter up to and including the birth of their son.  There is also a long running dialogue between father and son about good and evil, and whether they count as good people versus some of the evil people they have met.  The overall mood of the movie is somber, grim, and dark.  Compared to other end of the world movies, this would classify more as a drama with only the occasional scene of action or suspense.  I myself found it hard to stay focused, and would not bother watching it again.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|i was so glad to hear a new album came out from them.  I was a big fan of the first two, and this exceeds expectations.<br /><br />Now the animal heads on the album color, I don't quite get it :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was hard reading about some of the changes the characters went through, but helped build their depth in the long run. Very enjoyable.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At this time the only two programs that it supports is You Tube and Netflix. Hulu has just come on board. I thought I could stream the internet from my IPad but couldn't. The Google Chrome browser does not support Chromecast. It is easy to set up. I guess we have to wait for more apps to support Chromecast.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Great for my collection. love Alex O'Loughlin . Hawaii five-o is one of my favorites. I can watch it all the time
B009MF56GC|5.0|Better than the first one, can't wait to see the next one, good action movie.  This is a great guy movie.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|Fits like a champ. A small lip on the front if you set it face down. Not a lot of protection for the front.
0060723513|1.0|The intro does call this \\"fiction,\\" but it says that it is based on true experience and that it was fictionalized to protect the aborigines.  Other clues also present it as true.  However, if you Google Marlo Morgan, the first thing that pops up is \\"Marlo Morgan apology.\\"  Follow those links and you will find ample evidence to convince you that this is a hoax.<br /><br />The book, while a reasonably good read as an adventure story, doesn't ring true.  Besides the hard to believe claims like the idea that the aborigines communicate with mental telepathy and have miraculous powers of healing, it presents the aborigines as \\"noble savages\\" whose excrement literally and figuratively doesn't stink.  People are people, no matter who they are.  In any group of people there will be those who \\"smell good\\" and those who don't.  Morgan's aborigines seem all cut out of the same cloth--little variation in personality.  Any group of people who have survived as they have has to have had a good bit of genetic variation, which is part and parcel with personality variation.  In addition, it was pretty amazing how the aborigine beliefs seemed so tailor made for a new age audience.  Not one jarring belief amongst the lot.<br /><br />The links I found while following the \\"apology\\" trail, however, do ring quite true.  Little tidbits like the fact that the thorny spinifex grass that she claims she had no choice but to walk on actually grows in tufts, with paths between them.  If she had to walk on them, she would've been leaping from tuft to tuft in the desert heat.  There's a great website by the Dumbartung Aborigine Corporation debunking the book.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I'm angry that I spent my money on this book.  I'd like the author to repay me.  It is wrong that she's made so much money exploiting the aborigines and people's interest in them.
B008JFUPPI|2.0|In a time of remakes, sequels, and attempts to cash in on successful teenage angst(I'm talking to you twilight fans)books  RIPD at least tries to take a new turn on the buddy-cop movie.  Our main buddy-cop actors, Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds, play well off each other and do the best they can with the material that they are given.  What is the problem with the material that they are given is that it is very bad.  At times the material seems to be forced or comes across as very disappointing. The editing team did what they could with the movie but, in the end, didn't help the movie at all.  The directing and writing was that horrid.  In the end, the movie came across as a rip off of Men In Black than its own movie.  It's a shame because it could have been a great movie.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Horrible! M. Knight ShameonYOU! The set has a lot of toilet paper. It was weird when the alien came out of a pumpkin.
B00BHWG3GU|5.0|Allen Toussaint is fabulous - a total Southern gentleman who has written so many fabulous songs!!!<br />he is always so positive - loves life - and we are so happy to have him in New Orleans!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is challenging but not impossible. It also has some hidden aspects that open up as well. There are also expansions available with even more content.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The cover art on the DVD case tells you all you need to know to decide whether or not you'll like the movie. If you like Brad you'll love the movie. It also won't hurt to have a firm belief that the United Nations bureaucracy will save the world from any disaster, zombie apocalypse included.<br /><br />As you probably know by now World War Z the movie bears little resemblance to the great book World War Z.  There are zombies thrown in to move things along in the movie but they're just part of the background for the star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game: fun, challenging, and fast-paced. And it was free.. at the time, anyway. An awesome game for all ages!
B00B0YUKA0|5.0|Classic should be required reading. Coelho has a way of explaining life's journey and spirituality in it's simplest  terms. Enjoy!
B009CGYO0K|4.0|This book was a good thing to read when I was bored. It contained a lot of funny comics and thongs that are just very true about cats. The only thing I'm not crazy about is how short it is. But other than that I really recommend this book for people who own cats or people who just want have a good laugh.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Some minor problems, such as occasional slow startup, doesn't detract from this handy app. Showing the work that has been done is a nice feature.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game Will blow your Sox off. The game is awesome!!!!!! It is so addicting so don't play it to much ok.
014241493X|5.0|I love this book so much. It's different than TFiOS and LFA, but John Green never fails. I could read this book every day and never get sick of it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Can't believe how easy and fun this game is to play. Love that it is not so complicated as the games on Facebook. I recommend this game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is enjoyable in spite of the almost unending stream of advertising that takes place during each hand that's dealt. You can select whether you want a regular deal or a winning deal, which I find extremely helpful. There is also an option in the winning deal that allows a tutorial to show you electronically how to win by featuring the best moves. This free game is a must have.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|It keeps popping up when I do not want it to.<br />I hate it so much and it wakes me up in the middle of the night.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Had to delete - just wanted a kids game that didn't need full internet access to play - I couldn't get this to play this on my kindle fire without it.  Sad it looked fun too.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie - can't wait to see the next one.<br /><br />However - I thought it also included a digital version on the movie UltraViolet.<br />It turns out that Ultraviolet is the name of a &#34;service&#34; that lets me convert DVD's that I own to digital and store them on their cloud.<br />Oh well, I see by the reviews that UltraViolet was a lousy movie anyway.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Movies are for entertainment, and having said that, this movie entertains. Some of the more jaded reviews here are curious indeed; just what is entertainment to them? Great CG, interesting premise, some vision... Go enjoy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|By far one of the better books Stephen King has written. This is the Stephen King I hope for when opening a new book.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Virtually every track on this album is killer. My favorite is Noncompliance to ASTM F 899-12 Standard, partly due to that opening. However, the whole thing is a worthy listen. An instant classic that sits perfectly next to their entire discography.<br /><br />This is my album of 2013.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Very good movie with Denzel Washington where he is playing a pilot with an addiction problem whose great flying skills don't help him until he finally confronts his problem.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|What do you think of when you think of nuclear weapons? Do you think of bunkers full of the most technologically sophisticated equipment in the world? Do you think of layers of security and safety protocols to ensure that an accident is next to impossible? Do you think of all the \\"command and control\\" structures to make sure that every weapon is accounted for and never used in response to a false alarm or by a rogue group or individual?<br /><br />My assumption had long been that the most powerful weapons in the world would have merited the best of all the above. In \\"Command and Control\\" Eric Schlosser pulls back the curtain and reveals just how close we came over and over again to nuclear disaster in the past sixty years. He uses the accident in Damascus, AR as the main narrative thread for the book. But what really makes the book stand out is how he weaves the account of the disaster in Arkansas with a history of nuclear weapons in the United States and the many near misses that should have made the government far more safety conscious than it was at the time of the explosion in Damascus. At first, it seems like he's just providing a little historical color when he gives the history of the nuclear arsenal and the near misses but he pulls all the threads together in the end and the result is a nail-biting conclusion and a truly well crafted book.<br /><br />Schlosser brings a great deal of narrative skill to the book. It doesn't read like dry history but rather has a pacing more in line with a fictional techno-thriller. This is a book that will keep you up far past your bedtime in an effort to get in just a few more pages to find out what happens next. Educational, sobering, and a real page turner. Pick this one up if you have the opportunity.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Hour and hours of bath time play!! were in heavy daily use for several months, my kids still occasionally ask to play with them at bath time. No issues with mold etc.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I could not download this app. Is a credit possible later on another game. I love the plants vs zombies series. Thank You novee8@gmail.com
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|We loved the first Season and we are onto our Second Season! Excellent for families. My eight year old son loves the Doctor and  especially Rose. Highly recommend it!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Enjoy Larsson's Triology .... Well written stories.  Wee bit &#34;dark&#34; , but well written ... keeps your attention.  Too bad there are no more coming.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Antony Beevor's \\"The Second World War\\" truly presents the war as a world war that was interconnected as opposed to the tendency of many authors to discuss the war primarily from the perspective of their national involvement.<br /><br />He combines scholarly sources from all theatres, letters of the combatants to evoke the reality on the ground, a sensitivity to civilian casualties and what they had to endure, and a clear-eyed critique of all major commanders and political leaders on all sides without showing any of the kind of parochial view that you would expect from a Sandhurst trained British officer.<br /><br />In the review of this book by the Washington Post they concluded that it was \\"the definitive history\\" and I haven't encountered anything of significance to disagree with that assessment. It also helps that he is a heck of writer and moves the accounts along at a pace that doesn't tire and makes one want to read on.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Just downloaded this app yesterday and actually got it as the free app of the day and love it! Very simple comes with widgets but I love the fact that the temperature stay in the upper left hand corner of my phone....just to add I have the Samsung Galaxy s3 international version.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|As a mystery novel writer writer I can recognize good writing. Schlosser weaves a non fiction drama that reads like a thriller.<br />John Achor (johnachor.com)
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This app should be renamed (Live streaming religion).  The available channels are approximately 95 percent religious based.  There are very few general or news channels and most of these don't work.  I was highly disappointed.  If you are looking for religious TV, you might like it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT BOOK.  THE FIRST BOOK I HAVE READ BY THIS AUTHOR.  AN EASY READ AND NOT PREDICTABLE.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very simple yet well thought out piece of programming. Figuring out how to approach solving each puzzle becomes second nature after a while, but you can't take anything for granted; as soon as you do you'll get bit. Try it, you'll like it.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Some of it was pretty predictable but the main character is so interesting that it kept me reading.
B000G3MKT0|5.0|Greatest Album of all Time. Hands down. Literally no comparison. 741 weeks on the top 200, what more do you need?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This sequel to \\"The Shining\\" is one of the best books I've read all year.  I'm a big Stephen King fan and this is probably the best book he's written since \\"The Cell\\".  I agree with some of the other reviews that this book is not as scary as \\"The Shining\\", however, I read \\"The Shining\\" when I was a kid and I'm sure it wouldn't be as scary if I read it now as an adult.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves the older Stephen King books and \\"The Shining\\".  It is a great sequel - I could not put it down!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's surely sounds like an awesome scheme. I'd recommend this book to add to your books to read list! Awesome, kept you guessing.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I use it to charge my phones, portable speaker and its been working fine so far. It looks nice too and I would recommend it to most people who want a charger for multiple USB driven devices.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Works ok, but the L2-R2 buttons gets some using to, I had a cheaper controller before and the buttons were easier to click.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Took forever to upload, but never have been able to pull up the game to play.  Have deleted from my Kindle.  Seemed to make other apps run slowly.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|this has become one of my favorite HBO series.  I loved B. Cumberbatch  in Amazing Grace.  He has become one of my favorite English actors.  In this series he is the perfect English gentleman but is torn between duty and wanting more out of life.  With each situation he becomes more of a man you love and trust.  I love the story, the acting and the time frame.  The progression of the story line form beginning to end is wonderful to watch.  The emotional battles within his being is amazing to watch, what outstanding acting.  I have since purchased more movies that he is in.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Loved the 9 exercises and the last one says it all. We get what we focus on. Everyday we are bombarded with how awful it is yet mixed in with missed expectations hide a lot of what's wonderful.  If you want more joy, peace, contentment in your life then this book is a way to bring it to you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Keep getting a message to update from an older version......So show does one do this if Google play is not accessible? DO I uninstall and reinstall?
B005VPRG10|5.0|This is intended as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son. He's a star wars fanatic for some reason. He has many star wars Legos and loves them all. No Legos sit for very long without being played with or created into something. So, that's why 5 stars. I know this will be a hit. It keeps him thinking, creating and away from TV and video games.
0979019710|5.0|An author I enjoy (Honoree Corder) suggested I read this book.  Reluctantly I did because based on the title and the fact that I LOVED TO SLEEP till last minute in the MORNING.  I can now thank her as well as Hal.  It was inspirational as well as tactical.  I appreciate the stories of himself and others.  I would recommend this book to anyone that find themselves at a plateau of any kind.
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is probably my 14 year olds favorite movie. I really enjoy it too.  I would recommend it to anyone with a daughter over about 11.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Simply put, an amazingly scary, spine-tingling, and entertaining feast of a movie.  I was so engrossed in this cinematic experience--so much that I felt as if I was there in the moment.  The acting was superb--the directing and cinematography even better.  I purchased The Conjuring immediately after I rented it.  A must-see.  You won't be disappointed.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a good movie and a little scary as it's something that possibly could happen.  I sure hope not!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a very fun game!  Nice to have entertainment and brain training in one.  Good for kids and adults.  Definitely addicting :-)
B003H072QA|1.0|I am a big fan but this dvd would not play on our home dvd player so I am so bummed
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Grandson loves this! however still need to follow what they do and read on the kindle, but it helps on visual learning
B005PK56TA|5.0|Well, it was trying its best to tell a horror story, not in a simple way, but with the way that you cannot image.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This was a much needed item for the kindle.  It was a great item to add. downloads quickly and fast.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie! The packaging was great, the shipment was super fast. The movie is a classic Halloween must-watch for our family!
B00338QENI|5.0|A well written, easy to understand educational book that I have recommended to several friends and family members.  I like how the author inter twines the historical science of cell research and with the lives of a family who were directly affected.  You can't help but feel compassion.  Studying history brings understanding.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a diehard Stephen King fan, I love this book so far. I purchased it for the Kindle App on IPad and haven't been able to put it down yet!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its fun to play with kids when trying to win one another in ur family. one thing about thisbgame is that you will never stop play.
034580709X|3.0|I may be wrong, but this should be the 1st Harry Hole (\\"Holy\\") novel by Nesbo.  You definitely sense that Nesbo has great talent as a crime, mystery, thriller writer in this novel but something is off.  The crime is a bit boring by the standards of these types of books and the entire Australian adventure feels long-winded.  Too many characters, odd relationships that develop and break all too quickly, and just an overall sense of going around in circles.  This Nesbo story is nothing spectacular.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I will say that its nice to have a weather app that accesses weather underground but I do not like adds on the last page when its a paid app.  Just saying its really weak of the developer.<br /><br />That aside, not bad.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Circus Maximus is a talented bunch of musicians. They rank high as far as songwriting and change-ups in their tempo and beat.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was very good. It was written so that I was never bored and the plot was well constructed. I love how the author chose to narrate it and the characterization was awesome. The flow of events wasn't straight forward, which was one of my favorite parts. It's amazing how Zusak wrote it in such a unique way. It was a different read, and I recommend it to everyone. I need to stop reading sad books though for awhile.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is interesting game. It is all about sea life.  I like it because you can learn a lot drone it.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Brand new movie to add to my collection...Check<br />Box of puffs tissue for said new movie... Check<br />Will<br />order<br />again...
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|A wonderful motion picture, a real classic. Everyone should have this classic in high definition in your collection. 5 stars.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|The game its fun and addictive but when you reach a certain level, it becomes impossible to expand unless you purchase resources, since the game is slow and difficult to accumulate resources. Its designed that way to force you to make purchases. In the end, its all about money. Nothing is free.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|As readers of alternative history are all too aware, the suspension of disbelief is critical to enjoying novels like this one which tell the story of Abraham Lincoln and his life long war against vampires.<br /><br />To my eye, the art is probably at its highest form with writers like Professor Harry Turtledove, whose extended education in the area(s) they embellish can't help but make their stories all the more believeable. A great case in point of this type of writing at its high point is probably his In the Balance four part series where Turtledove revisits World War II, albeit in an altered form where space aliens invade Earth midway, much the chargin of existing the then existing Earth combatants.<br /><br />On the other side, the art has its low points.  To my eye many examples of these can be seen in the cheapie What If books you can find on sale in many bookstore bins that are marked with the words CLEARANCE SPECIAL.<br /><br />Happily this book is closer to the high point than the low point.  And throughout the story the author reveals not only a good working knowledge of Abraham Lincoln's true biography but also an even better knowledge of the way people wrote and expressed themselves back then.  To my reading, there's probably no better writing in this book than when the author is writing and using Abraham Lincoln's 19th century voice to express himself.<br /><br />That having been said, this book is still not on par with the highest of the high and that's because for knowledgeable Lincoln readers there were several factual mistatements that were made thoughout the text.  The most obvious one was when Edwin M. Stanton was described as being part of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet in 1861 (before even Ft. Sumter as a matter of fact) when in fact Stanton didn't join the cabinet until the next year.<br /><br />On the one hand readers could say who cares about a factual mistatement in a book which discusses Lincoln's career as a vampire hunter.  However I think the better argument is still that when you're trying to tell a really outlandish story about a history character, it's probably best to keep your verifiable historical mis statements to a minimum.<br /><br />Because the artistry and creativity of this story was as otherwise good as it was though, this book still deserves five stars.  It's a fun ride and new readers of this book should be advised to come ready to suspend disbelief and have a good time.better argument is still that when you're trying to tell a really outlandish story about a history character, it's probably best to keep your verifiable historical mis statements to a minimum.<br /><br />Because the artistry and creativity of this story was as otherwise good as it was though, this book still deserves five stars.

0761174192|5.0|Gorgeous calendar.  High quality images of kitties that are not boring like the typical cat calendar.  Like cat photography art, these images are sure to brighten your day, every day, as you get a new kitty daily!  Deep, saturated color and large images, too!  Great office or kitchen table calender.  Place anywhere you'd like a little cat joy or reminder of the date.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I got one for my sister and one for me. We both like to dance.  I like the way he sings. The rhythm makes me dance and I am using it as exercise at the same time. He looks so authentic and down to earth. Love it.
B00DXPC1U6|2.0|I am sincerely hoping that the producers come out with the real final episode, in which the last one we saw (S08E12) was only a bad dream Dexter had.<br />They need to do this to save face vis-a-vis the millions of people that enjoyed one the best writing on TV for so many years.<br />Do it not only because we are complaining about such a bad ending, but to help the cast´s careers. Otherwise, we will get stuck with an extremely bad recollection of what was such a great TV show.<br />Please have mercy!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this game it is fun and always entertaining. I always end up playing it fire hours upon end. It is addicting that is the best way to describe it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Only good for Netflix and YouTube streaming.  I would not have ordered it with such limited use (my TVs already have wireless internet access).

B0049985XW|5.0|We are heading to Michoacan, Mexico in January to see the Monarch butterflies, and the movie was filmed in this area. To this day, the area is defined by the filming of this movie. You can visit the little chapel where one scene was filmed or stay where Humphrey Bogart slept. It is an excellent period piece.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this story. I could read it again and again. Frances Hodgson Burnett's writing is uplifting to the soul and makes the human condition more bearable by bringing out the goodness in all kinds of people.

There are at least a dozen places in the movie that fade from color to black and white and the sound also disappears--of course too, keen/main parts of the movie !

B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love it even more than the last 2 seasons. But, they are getting a little 2 much like soap operas. Just sayin. The wrighters should structure it more like the first season. Thats what we all found so fasinating.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|this album is great. Its not the album i would show a new megadeth listener. but if you are used to daves voice and you like the past few albums, youll love this one. most of the songs are fast, heavy and catchy, just like what they always put out. the lyrics are good, with the expected mix of social commentary. the biggest thing keeping people from this album is daves voice. its not what it used to be and sometimes i wonder if he should just hire a vocalist. its different but i personally dont think its bad. just dont ask him to sing a tout le monde anymore
B00C7607BC|5.0|I recently saw this movie standard def (scary, I know). It was so fuzzy and cheesy looking, I couldn't watch it anymore.  This version was the version I have been waiting for!  If you love disney movies you should definitely add this to your collection.

B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|Love the Loud era. Love the tour costumes. They looked hot and funky especially those boots! Wasn't really happy that she left out Darling Nikki and the Glamorous life, tho. I don't know if it's because those aren't her songs. She also left out Run This Town and Live your life. She's very good at energizing the crowd and especially love the interaction she has with her audience. For example, she takes pics of her fans and then herself and gives them back their camera. How sweet. What other pop star does that? Another one, she does a lapdance on her female fans..well actually rides on them, lol. They were just giggling with excitement. It reminds me of when I was watching the All For You tour on dvd and Janet was riding on a male fan during her Do You Mind performance, lol. The only difference is Rihanna did it on two girls. At times, she reminded me of Madonna, Whitney, and Bob Marley all in one. Her vocals were good and she sang live. I would say the Loud tour is much more developed and established than her Good Girl Gone Bad tour. This one would make a great add to your Rihanna collection. They should also release her Last Girl on Earth tour on dvd. Never really got to see that one.

0307740919|4.0|I literally devoured this one because it was so short and easy to understand. It really should be considered a short story.  Frank's journey to get to his dying sister, Cee, was beautifully written.  Morrison hits a home run with this one.
B00C6B9XCW|1.0|It is a bit ADD, but otherwise it was extremely enjoyable for the almost 30-somethings.  So much nostalgia.  It also reminded me of Canada.<br /><br />The bad: I can't play this bluray on anything I own.  There are no players for my linux computer.  I've researched and if I buy a autoswitch for HDMI, I can't play the audio of this bluray.  Apparently the HDCP of bluray is no better than the NES blinking light.  Both are meant to prevent piracy, both prevent you from actually watching the movie without a retarded theatre setup.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|As described. Was told about this movie and thought I would give it a try. It was very interesting. Have watched it several times.
B0087ZG7GQ|1.0|But in bluray I can't watch it.  I can't play it on my Linux computer.  If I buy a bluray player and hook it to the hdmi auto-switcher, it will have no audio and play in SD resolution. The fact that this package includes a DVD is a godsend.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|As described. Watched it but it was not what I expected. It was suggested and I thought ok will see if it is as good as others say. Just not for me I guess.

B00DETP4FK|5.0|This is a difficult album to explain. In concept, it shouldn't work. It is mostly ballads that are musically underscored.  What makes it work, however, is K T Tunstall's voice, her strong songwriting ability and the nuances that she expresses through this music.  The more you listen to it, the more it grows on you.

B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie is full of action and I loved the sea battle scenes, especially with the USS Missouri.  I have enjoyed watching this movie several times and never get tired of it.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone who likes action with a little humor.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|A beautiful true to life movie. \\"Coming out\\" is the smallest part of this movie. Although the sex scene is rightfully regarded by many as one of the top passionate Gay scenes of Gay film.(as evidenced by YouTube) The movie presents a picture all to common in today's world. A picture of a dysfunctional family, and the sacrifice of one caring person within that family. Zach is lucky that he found Shaun to care for him and encourage him to think about himself and his future. I also appreciated the visual of two Gay men as a family with a child.Children need people to love them and it does not have to be a man and a woman.
B002OMZTSK|4.0|High school is hell. Or at least the equivalent. Ask Russel. He's going through some really tough stuff in school. His friends can't help him, his boyfriend won't, his parents don't know. All-in-all, it's pretty much suck city for him. Until the day it happens.<br /><br />You see, there can't very well be a GAY club at school. Not proper and so not allowed. But what if they made a club that no one in their right mind would want to belong to? Geography Club is a perfect angle. The misfits gather in secrecy, drawing strength from one another. And that strength is going to be necessary when someone Russel trusted stabs him in the back (figuratively, but it may as well have been literal for as much as it hurt).<br /><br />Russel struggles to fit in somewhere. He wants to be liked, to be respected, but he finds out that life doesn't always give us what we want, though many times it will give us exactly what we've been looking for.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story. Russel is kind of an every-kid. His boyfriend is the strong one in their relationship, until the chips are down. When he has to decide between respectability and Russel, the answer isn't easy and it's very easy to believe.<br /><br />This review originally appeared at Mrs Condit & Friends Read Books
0385349947|4.0|Some early reviewers knocked Sandberg's book as elitist because she does not discuss the problems experienced by poor and low-income women. But that was a bad rap because Sandberg is quite clear in her thesis: Before you can have a country (and a world) that provides serious attention and solutions to the concerns of women and children -- improvements in health care, education, child care, family leave -- you have to have more women leading governments and corporations. Lean In is Sandberg's  analysis of the reasons women haven't achieved leadership parity with men (because given a choice between having a family and having power, many women choose family) and her prescription for achieving leadership parity (women should lean in to their professional aspirations right up until the moment when they must lean back in order to have a family.) Sandberg's key insight is that women lean back from their careers long before they actually need to -- when they're just thinking about having children rather than after those children actually arrive. If those women continue to lean in, Sandberg suggests that they may find that when the time comes for family, they may not actually have to lean back, either because they've achieved enough power to successfully juggle career and family or because enough women have become government and corporate leaders that the climate of professional life has become more family friendly. And while Sandberg clearly is hoping that those who lean in will develop a taste for power, she does not denigrate those who choose family, wisely endorsing the longstanding feminist goal of providing choices for all women. Although this book is clearly aimed at professional women, many of Sandberg's insights can prove useful to any woman in the workplace. For example, she notes that men apply for jobs when they have around 50 percent of the posted skill requirements while women don't apply unless they have 90 percent. Also, men are more likely to ask for a raise then women, and when they do, men generally ask for more money than their female colleagues. However, Sandberg's insights for professional women are often invaluable. For example, when faced with high child-care costs that almost wipe out a working mother's income, Sandberg advises viewing those lost dollars as an investment in future earnings. Professional women who drop out of the work force for a few years will never be able to catchup to that lost income, which in professional circles can be huge. For that and other advice relevant to any woman embarking on a professional career, Sandberg's book is a must-read for 20- and 30-something women.then women, and when they do, men generally ask for more money than their female colleagues.

030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is a novel whose status as a bestseller is well-justified. It is intricately plotted and unfolds suspensefully from first to last. For that reason, I gave the book three stars. But I had two huge problems with the novel. First, the novel and the story it tells rely on gimmicks, and even when the manipulation is done as well as Flynn does it here, I still resent it. Second, I disliked all of the characters in this novel and read to the end ONLY to see how Flynn would pull it all together. A big literary debate in 2013 has centered on likeable characters, with the writers of \\"serious\\" fiction implying that readers who want a character they can like are too light-weight to be worth listening to and writers of bestselling fiction suggesting that literary lions who cling to unlikeable characters shouldn't bemoan their lack of commercial success. For me the bottom line on this is simple: There are far too many great novels out there about characters I'll care about that I'll never live long enough to read to waste my time with characters I dislike, however great the writing.
1416955070|3.0|I've been eyeing this book by Cassandra Clare for a long time, even before the movie came out.  I seem to see it everywhere and I was wondering what all the hype was about.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though it seemed like it had all the ingredients for a novel I would like, this one fell flat for me.  I don't often say that about a book, especially a promising urban fantasy like this one.  But Clary Fray just didn't capture me.  And Jace Weyland even less.  The book read more like an introductory guide than a story, by necessity of its dizzyingly complex fantasy world.  The plot twists were predictable and the prose tried too hard.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  \\"Jace unhitched himself from the railing\\" might have charmed me if used once, but the same expression twice or more?  And \\"he grinned all over his face\\" is just silly.<br /><br />I probably will pick up the second book and give it a chance, as I am a little curious about what happens next.  But I'm not dying to know, and that in itself tells me that The Mortal Instruments won't be going on my top books list.  Apologies to anyone who did like the story.  If you haven't read it, you may want to skip it and give Divergent a try instead.  Or watch the movie: it was much better than the book, for a change.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Lzzy Hale and the boys rock, very very very good. Love the sound the vocals the instrumentals. The groups best so far.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like the app but don't like the fact that you have to leave a review or like on facebook. I guess it could be worse tho.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|My wife and I have totally enjoyed this series.  Great acting, easy-to-like characters and an intelligent storyline.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Excellent! Very true to the novel. Acting was superb. I thoroughly enjoyed the series having just finished the novel. Highly recommend this version.
B001BANK32|5.0|I'm not sure why I'd never read this book until now. The movie adaptation has been a long-time favorite of mine, and I've been a horror buff since I was quite small (honestly probably too young, but oh well lol). This book is so much better than the film. I loved the ending so much more in here in novel format. A must read book, even though it is far older than myself!
B0033V51QG|5.0|Viktor Frankl's book should be required reading for everyone. This book is short in length but so powerful that it will become a part of you forever.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|So many themes combined into a great novel.  Love story, irony, physical and mental survival...turbulent emotions from the main characters.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Totally unique story. A bit difficult to follow but stick with it and you'll be rewarded. Enjoyed characters and uniqueness of storyline.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Even though most people think the newest good thing should quickly earn the title &#34;best,&#34; and even though every film is technically based on a Shakespeare story, Whedon's Much Ado About Nothing is the most fun I've had watching Shakespeare on the big screen.  Now, I get to watch it on my smaller screen at home whenever I want.  The clever directing and hilarious skill of the actors pay excellent homage to the centuries-old script.  Definitely one of the top five best movies to come out so far this year, too!
1476727651|1.0|i own and have read every stephen king novel.  this is by far the worst.  dull story, dull characters, terrible ending.<br /><br />****************spoiler alert***************************************************************************************<br /><br />in the story abra kicks rose out of her mind and causes an earthquake!!!<br />why does the story end with rose being slowly pushed over a railing???  no fireworks, no earthshaking, nothing.  the huge battle that was built up<br />through the story was more of an afterthought.<br /><br />don't read this!

B000N4S86Q|5.0|Glad I found it and can't wait until I get watch it with my brother on our next movie date
B002CGSYNU|2.0|I bought this to replace a lost cap.  Now I can see why I lost the last one, it doesn't hold worth squat.  Definitely a design problem somewhere.  On the other hand, it didn't cost a whole lot.
B000JSI7C6|5.0|This movie is replacing one that I had but got broke.  My brother and I were watching it when it cracked and we couldn't finish it
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Bought directly from Amazon, and the service was amazing, as always! The DVDs actually arrived close to a week before expected, which was perfect because it was just as we finished season 3! The only thing I recommend is make sure you check the DVD region before you purchase! While it wasn't an issue for us, as we were watching on the laptop, it does mean we can't watch it on our DVD player because the discs are region one, and we live in region 4.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app.<br />It is very accurate and dependable.<br />I am able to track the weather here and in Austin where my son goes to college.

B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Let me start this review by saying I am a 35 year old, Black woman. So I don't think I am in her intended demographic. I love music and I will listen to anything at least once. I was expecting a bunch of teenagery, popish, sugary, bubbleheaded music. Boy was I wrong! Good music is just that...good music. It doesn't matter to whom it is targeted, good music will transcend all marketing.<br /><br />First of all, her voice is heavenly. She can really sing and knows how to convey emotion in the songs. While listening to the songs, it took me right back to the 90s. Her style reminds me of a combination of Mariah Carey and Beyonce. If you love true R&B, then this CD delivers just that. I didn't feel like I was listening to a 20 year old sing. None of that mindless, materialistic crap. Her music has substance.  Her voice is mature and her music is about the uninhibited freeness of love (I know freeness is not a real word).<br /><br />Her music is fun without being fluff. I was pleasantly surprised. Love EVERY song. I recommend this CD to young and old.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Excellent piece of navigational equipment. Used on my last sailing trip, had a higher accuracy than the boats gps. Well done.

B009RX85N0|4.0|Season one is very different from season two but other than a few weak episodes it was as magical as season one (season one had a few weak episodes too). I'm looking forward to season three, will Niel and Emma find each other again?
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|good app for kindle. would recommend to all kindle users who are looking for an alarm.  I use it each and every day and have never overslept. keep this in mind when serching for a reliable alarm.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout will make your heart pumping! Good blend of cardio and abs. But I am also supplementing it with six week six packs because I want a toned body for my wedding.
B007Z5WMCW|2.0|Mostly free TV from around the world but you get what you pay for.  Most of these programs/channels are not the number one channels from their country.  There is a lot of stuff but remember the programs are in the language of their country so most of it is not too useful unless you know the language.
0425267695|5.0|I picked it up on a whim.  took it home. wow.  what a universe this author creates. I cannot wait for the follow up volumes. you are caught up in a world that is created like a fine watch.<br /> the pieces fit together well and run without fault.<br /><br /> I have read almost all written by  bujold, lackey, lee, mccaffrey, ringo, weber, etc.  stellar world builders all.<br /><br />this guy is right up there with those I consider at the top of the genre.<br /><br />never heard of him before, but he is on the radar now. and he will be on yours as well.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Weather information is important and this app gives you the data.  Nice to have a reliable source that gives you the weather information when you want it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I OH SO ENJOYED THIS TRILOGY!!! Am sooo lost since I finished it. I brought it just out of curiosity to see what all the big hoop la was about...said to myself &#34;think I need to read this&#34;. Had a hard time finding the next book to read after it.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is one of my favorite fantasy films, featuring a young Tom Cruise, and a beautiful Mia Sara. And...an unrecognizable Tim Curry! The makeup, costumes, and cinematography is absolutely arresting.
1452115567|5.0|What a precious book!!!  The pictures are beautiful and Maddie is a wonderful dog!!!! I have a coonhound and now she is doing some of the same!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. The way the author entwines the characters together is wonderful. Her portrayal of family, love, marriage are all spot on. I will definitely look into reading more from this author.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I'm very happy to say that I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  While there are a lot of characters to follow, and some definite political/religious tones to the movie, it was no different than many novels out there with a lot of characters (each chapter hopping from one character to another).  Some people may get annoyed how the movie, often at a critical juncture, will jump to another character... but if you pay attention you are easily able to follow along.<br /><br />The overall theme, however, is beautiful... and yet hauntingly depressing.  We are doomed to make the same horrible, terrible, mistakes over and over; generation after generation... yet love will always remain.  Beautiful and sad...
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's a great way of keeping up with the weather if that's something you like to do.Also has very nice background and you can put more cities then just your own.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|These books just keep getting better and better! I can hardly stand the suspense sometimes. Probably my favorite book out of the series so far
B00AYR2FQ6|4.0|XM Spectrum took to playing \\"Zong for Zula\\", had to have it.  Also liked \\"Quotidiam Beasts\\", and pretty much the entire album.  A real bright spot in what's been a miserable year musicly.  XM also played a few selections from earlier albums, not so good there.  Seems more finished, more refined, more inspired, more focused here.  Looking forward to the nest album!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like reading from the kindle app.  It's easy to use.  Much better reading experience that reading some e-books in the .pdf format.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|WOW!  Best album of his illustrious career, it's kind of like hymns of healing, speaking power to the powerless.  His voice just keeps getting smokier as the years roll by, such artistic integrity, not the same music anybody else is doing.  WOW!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter who is into &#34;Princess Movies&#34;<br />It arrived well before the date promised and in perfect condition.<br />Would definitely recommend this seller
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I just started and finished the first four levels. The difficulty was just high enough to maintain my interest. I am looking forward to more levels. The game is well worth downloading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well written book with an interesting plot.  Quite a few twists and turns along the way.  I didn't want to put the book down.

If you love dis try the computer version or the x box. Please buy! Thank you NOTCH! (creator of Minecraft). This game is about punch`in trees and fighting mobs. World of blocks are awesome.
B006J386TE|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is a GREAT series!! So glad that I started watching it when it first came on!! Reminds me of the town I grew up in. A small town in GA that was against growing and making changes in the way they had lived for many years!! 10 out of 10!! A must watch!!!!!
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|Although I like the approach the author is taking, I found the book to be heavy with technical information and detail.  I kept looking for a chapter summary, but didn't find any.  After the first 1/3 of the book I was skimming and skipping all the technical info looking for the next important piece of information.  I think it would be really good for physicians and researchers.
1446249182|2.0|The author has too many personal stories<br />I'd rather read a more technical book on stats<br />whether than an autobiography
031624662X|5.0|Ancillary Justice is the sort of book that wins awards - and with good cause. First, it is a vast space opera, with Banksian AI warships and space battles and intergalactic colonisation and such. Second, it has that \\"sense of wonder\\" that (apparently) defines SF. But, then, good lord, Ms. Leckie's also snuck in a character or two! It seems that one of those AI warships has - somehow - been trapped in the body of a human being (a sort of thawed human robo-zombie thing). How'd it get there? What is it doing? What is going on?<br /><br />These (and other) questions are answered through the course of Ancillary Justice, which combines the aforementioned wild space operatics with sterling character development (you'll never feel quite so attached to an empathy-free, personality-free computer program ever again!), political chicanery, a good ol' fashioned whoddunit and - as if that weren't enough - some cunningly progressive gender politics. When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a billion tons of space-faring metal, the intricacies of gender - how we define it, what it means and all the culturally-imposed baggage thereof - tend to be forgotten.<br /><br />This is a book that will please the traditional SF crowd with the drama and impress literary readers with the socially-savvy undercurrents: be prepared to see Ancillary Justice bandied around a lot come awards season. (As it should be.)
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love it. I play it every day ;-0  I might get tired of listening the duets someday but I'm not there yet...<br /><br />Who ever loves Barbra should by it.<br /><br />There you go, this is my review, five stars for sure.<br /><br />Suzanne Beaudet
630336568X|4.0|Movie was great quality but case was a little rough looking to be advertised as like new .but overall still satisfied
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This would be a great game for people who like puzzles as well as those who don't . At first I didn't even like puzzles but this really is a great game
B00867HDTA|5.0|No complaints here. I agree with some people who say that the game gets old after a while but it's still fun nonetheless.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love the percy Jackson series and one of my favorite books is the Battle of the Labyrinth, if you love PJO you should buy it.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|I can really only say how I love this app it is very clear of where the stats are located and the names of them I can only say I really hope you like it as well as Ido
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is so enjoyable that I am so addicted and even get in trouble for playing so much. It's that fun. It also have slot more variety of obstacles that games that run the way this does. Such as temple run and subway surfer. But this is much more original and has slot of character. I love it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I LOVE this show!!!  Best on tv...I own all available dvd's...and will hate to see it end.  This whole series is a masterpiece.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Well worth the price of the game!  Our grandson, age 2, loves filling the tanks, and his grandfather, age 71, loves racking up the money!  It keeps them both busy!  (Lucky me!!!)

B003G4W49C|5.0|Great writing, great story. You get to know the characters deeply. Ender's game is well worth the read. Get it and enjoy.
0670024856|5.0|An enthralling story, wonderfully written and over far too soon.<br /><br />This is the life story of Alma Whittaker, a female botanist born in 1800 to a wealthy and unorthodox Philadelphia couple who train her in languages, thought, and persistence, expecting her from a young age to keep up and participate in their glittering intellectual dinner parties.  She lives into her 9th decade, and her adventures, and those of her father, whose story is told before hers, weave together many threads of the development of evolutionary thought during the mid-1800s.  Her life takes her to Tahiti and Amsterdam, through some very complicated and dramatic relationships, and finally to her own conclusions, independent of Darwin and Wallace, of the reasons for biodiversity.  Wallace even makes an appearance, which was a delight.<br /><br />I hesitate to mention many of the most interesting events, because readers should discover these for themselves.  Just wonderful, especially for anyone with an interest in scientific thought during this time period.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This book is a gem. Easy to read and easy to be motivated to do the experiments. Happily it all worked out!
B008NQYWC0|4.0|A fascinating novel that combines fact and fiction. I have never read a book dealing with time travel and I was hesitant at first because of that, but it ended up being really good. I wouldn't classify this as a horror novel, but it does spark interest because of the true facts it deals with surrounding Kennedy & Oswald. This is in my opinion not a typical Stephen King novel, but he does a great job with it. I didn't give it the complete five starts because it was long and could get a little wordy in places, but other than that, I would definitely recommend it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo mail is 100 times worse now 10/9/2013 than it ever was before.  Whoever is coming up with this stuff needs to be tarred and feathered.

B003L77GRO|5.0|Continues to leave me asking for more. Keeps me on my toes. The next series cant get here fast enough. :)
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book as the plot kept me in suspense. Great cozy mystery. I will be reading the next in the series. The only things I didn't really care for was the sex scenes and the light cussing.

B004Q3SGWG|5.0|This movie was spell-binding. It held your attention plus had glorious scenes of nature while showing the side of a sport i would have never seen otherwise.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I love that it has the several stories in several lives going on and somehow they're all \\"connected\\". I will recommend this book to everyone.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|This album is what Elton said it would be: very mature and piano-forward. You won't hear 1970s  Elton on here because it's 2013 and he and Bernie have matured since recording \\"The Bitch is Back.\\" Elton's voice sounds old, his piano playing sounds young-- if you want music that sounds like it's from Elton's time capsule this probably won't be your thing. If you want to hear the next chapter in the book of Elton and Bernie's incredible songwriting career, this is rewarding and authentic. The songs \\"My Quicksand,\\" \\"Home Again,\\" and \\"New Fever Waltz\\" capture what this album is about. \\"Take this Dirty Water\\" may be Elton's best gospel song since \\"Border Song.\\" And \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" is a great song, too. Something about the way Elton sings \\"Things have to change and they might\\" feels like a wink from Elton, one of those classic hooks that has been his signature.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|The plot is great. Despite the cast of one, sometimes two, in nearly every scene, this avoids closing in on itself or turning purely \\"psychological.\\" Instead, it's a riveting man-against-nature (woman, actually) story, with Murphy's Law doing plenty to keep it moving. That alone would have made it a good movie.<br /><br />But that ignores the cinematography. Words like \\"grandeur\\" and \\"majesty\\" kept running through my mind. Cuar&oacute;n took the most dramatic location ever, low Earth orbit, and made the most of it. The effects that simulated weightlessness were utterly convincing, but really, the visual spectacle of hard, black space and The Blue Planet set a new standard.<br /><br />It doesn't happen often, almost never, but I'm ready to go back and see this again. And yes, I'm sure the DVD will be great, but the big screen turns this into a very different experience.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When Stephen King is on he is one of the best story tellers around. And boy oh boy is he on in Doctor Sleep. Not only do we get to find out what happened to Danny Torrance but he introduces us to a whole new cast of amazing characters. I will never look at an RV in a campground the same way again.<br />PS Bonus points for the Joe Hill references.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|I like this type of SyFy. Also, I like the BBC stories as well. They seem to have a different way about how they write their stories.
1476727651|3.0|The Shining dealt primarily with human dementia, alcoholism, precognition and the possibility of ghosts, which put it within the realm of possibility in our day and age.  This followup not only deviates a great deal from the movie, (and reinserts characters that Kubrick felt well to kill off, as well as a critical alteration in the plot at the Overlook Hotel), but also deals with a myriad of supernatural issues that make the book far less credible, albeit readable and extraordinarily well written.  I suspect whoever does the film based upon this latest work (inevitable), will create many changes in the direction I speculated as they did the first.  JUDGE MARC MOGIL
B009NXV2RK|1.0|This is a very poor novel, full of cliches and burdened with a pedestrian and highly predictable plot. The characters are cardboard cutouts. Nothing to recommend it.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|The CD is one that you can put in the player and let every song  play. You can also repeat play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book should be required reading for all middle school classes. Children and adults will  both enjoy this fantastic book.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|It was okay but not the same without Maurice White. There were a lot of slow songs and nothing really up tempo and interludes.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Got this for a 4 year old and he hasn't stopped playing with it since he got it.  Well made and nicely detailed.  Liked it so much I am ordering products more from this line.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was drawn to the story of Lavinia and the mystery of her past, then was intrigued by what her future held.  I couldn't get over the constant misery & tragedy that occurred at Tall Oaks.  Somewhat predictable but still an enjoyable story.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|Great movie with beautifual special effects which make this movie.  Ending is just like the book only better.<br />A must see if you like sci-fi.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased this for a 2nd tv.  It is identical to my first tv which has a Roku 3 attached.<br />Plus:<br />- Price.<br />- Youtube.<br />- Phone integration.  Roku 3 has a phone app but the integration of the Chromecast with other phone apps (netflix, youtube, google music) was much better than having to use a separate app.  This is definitely the right way to go.<br />- Powers off with your tv if you hook its power to the tv's usb connection.<br /><br />Minus:<br />- Inferior wifi reception.  I switched between the Roku in the exact same spot and same tv.  The Roku got great reception.  The Chromecast reception was a notch down.  This showed up in Netflix by the video frequently stopping while it waited to download.  I solved this by upgrading to a newer Wifi router and the problem went away.<br />- No remote control.<br /><br />Overall, I would purchase the Chromecast over the Roku 3. The wifi wasn't a big issue for me as I needed to upgrade my router anyway.<br />I value the better phone integration over having a remote.  Who needs an extra thing you're looking for in the cracks of the sofa.  My personal preference is for my phone to be the center of my media.<br />Finally, I'm a cheap a*s and I don't see any reason to pay 2-3x to solve the same problem.<br /><br />Final answer is this is a very elegant solution to getting content onto my tv.  I think google will own tv access with this architecture, so many of these are being sold that much more content will rapidly become available (personally though netflix+youtube give me everything I need, but Netflix better be ready for youtube to one day knock it out).

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was truly an amazing story. It should be sad and depressing but I did laughed, cried, and had a smile on my face through all of it. Frank McCourt narrated the audio version of this and that is what I read. As soon as I finished it, I started it over with my boyfriend. Loving every second of it.<br />A book that I put off reading for years, and now has become my favorite book. The writing, and story are both so amazing. I can't wait to read the next book.

B0055QYKQO|2.0|Well I bought this board back in Jan of 12. It was a pretty good board for the cost. It had all the features and support that I was looking for in a performance board. Until about 6 months ago it ran fine then I started having issues with the computer shutting down for no reason. Included in my system was the following...<br />OCZ ZS Series 550W 80 Plus Bronze Power Supply<br />GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard<br />AMD FX-8150 FX 8-Core Black Edition Processor (FD8150FRGUBOX)<br />Corsair Cooling Hydro-Series All-in-One High-Performance Liquid CPU Cooler CWCH60<br />Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B<br />EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Ti Superclocked 1024MB GDDR5 PCI-Express 2.0 Graphics Card - Lifetime Warranty 01G-P3-1563-AR<br />ASUS BW-12B1ST/BLK/G/AS 12X Blu-ray Internal Burner with Disc Encryption, Black<br />OCZ Technology 120 GB Vertex 2 Series SATA II 3.5-Inch Solid State Drive (SSD) OCZSSD3-2VTX120G<br />3 Hitachi 2TB Drives<br />1 Seagate ST2000DM001 Barracuda 7200RPM 2 TB SATA 6 GB/s<br />I swapped out parts like the CPU, Ram, Power supply anything that would cause a system to just shut down, even rebuilt the Win 7 OS. Well I have come to the conclusion that the Mother Board has been the cause of the shut downs. We'll see how well the warranty works on this board.
1250030951|5.0|This is my first Rainbow Rowell book and I loved it to death--so much so that it nearly left me breathless. It was very easy to immerse myself in Cath's world. And while, at times, this was a pitiful world with a huge lack of friends, the few characters that appeared in this book made it one of my most beloved worlds ever. Really, I couldn't have asked for a story that is easier for some college students to relate to. And, damn it if I don't have all of Rowell's other books on my wishlist.<br /><br />I consider myself an extroverted introvert. If you put me in a situation with people that I'm comfortable with or in a discussion centering around a topic that I feel very strongly about, I can't shut up. But if you put me in a new situation or give me some alone time in my room, I become extremely introverted. For a while, it's just me and my laptop and my books. And because of this it was very easy to relate to Cath, unfortunate fully named Cather. I think that fellow introverts of all ages can agree that the similarities between us and her are plentiful. And while I hope my upcoming college experience does not mirror hers that much, I know that, at times, I'm just going to want to be left alone to read and do my own thing instead of going out to parties every weekend like her twin, Wren. It's who I am. While I am a sociable person, I don't want to be sociable all the time. But, in all actuality, I will never be as anti-sociable as Cath.<br /><br />See, Cath fears rejection and being wrong, so she tends to stay with what she knows and shy away from the new. Her fear runs so deep that she spends a solid chunk of the beginning of the school year eating energy bars and peanut butter in her room to avoid the cafeteria. It's that bad, which is why it's hard to fully relate to her though you can skim the surface of her overall experiences and emotions. What she knows is Simon Snow and Fanfixx.net. Put these two together and she has a loyal hoard of thousands of followers that adore her slash fanfiction that's slowly taken over her life. Her fear of reality is cemented by the fact that her fictional world is so widely adored. To her, it's better than real life, so it pretty much rules her life and even puts her beloved scholarship in jeopardy. And it calls her originality and creativity into question during her beloved fiction-writing class.<br /><br />Speaking of Simon Snow, I did have a slight issue with it. More of a small annoyance than anything else. This was so obviously a re-created Harry Potter. I understand that you can't have Harry Potter in this world because of trademarks and copyrights and such, but there was a legitimate Harry Potter mention in passing. Why even bring HP into a story whose overall purpose and fanfiction is a knock-off HP series? In the end, they're incomparable and it's way too easy to draw connections between the two. Don't put them both in the same world because of the similarities. While, overall, I chose to ignore this minor nuisance, I just thought that this was something small worth addressing. Every new chapter begins with a snippet of fanfiction, so there's no escaping it. With that being said, let's continue.<br /><br />Obviously, I adored Cath. And because there are so few characters in this book it is a very character driven book. While it is easy to adore Cath, it's easy to dislike other characters, especially her sister, Wren. I understand Wren's desire to be separated from Cath since they were a known duo in high school. She wants to be Wren. Not Wren of Cath and Wren (literally two halves of a whole because Cather + Wren = Catherine). But the way she went about such things was terrible. Not only was she partying so much that she nearly risked her life, but she cut Cath out of her life completely. She pretty much made Cath feel like shit and she hurt her several times. I really hated her for a solid chunk of this book. However, everyone finds themselves throughout their college experience and I began accepting her again near the end of her character arc. While I feel like Cath was too forgiving of her built-in best friend several times throughout the book, I think Wren deserved forgiveness near the end of the book. And it's really great to watch a character arc where the character learns so greatly from her mistakes.<br /><br />In contrast to Wren, there's nothing but great adoration for Cath's elder roommate, Reagan and her boyfriend, Levi. Reagan is not likabe at first. She's very sarcastic but sure of herself. As you can guess, this is a great contrast to Cath's personality. Eventually, she takes Cath under her wing when she realizes that she's Cath's only chance at getting out of her room for something aside from classes and they develop this beautifully unique friendship that I adored every minute of. Reagan is blunt, honest, and cool, and she's exactly what Cath needed in her life. In truth, she's the one who kick-started Cath's journey to self-discovery and transformation into enjoying reality and, for that, Reagan will always be loved. Levi is also integral to Cath's transformation and it's great to have a guy, not only that but an older guy, accept her quirks and immense love of fanfiction. It shows that you can find companions in the oddest of places. One plot point in regards to Levi that I'd love cleared up is his inability to read. He explained it in this huge emotional freak out about how he can't compute when reading--the words that he reads don't have any actual meaning to him which is why he must be read to or listen to lectures. He's an amazing listener. I think he's dyslexic. I'd rather that be cleared up because, as a reader, it's hard for me to imagine someone who can't understand what they're reading.<br /><br />I want to take a moment to talk about this romance because it was perfect. It was slow-going and it took over one hundred pages to even figure out who it was with. No names will be mentioned because it's part of the experience, but this romance can seriously only be described as perfection. It was slow-going and there were several bumps along the way, but the characters came out of everything hand-in-hand with the promise of greatness in their future. This was love that had to blossom over time instead of instantly. In reality, it took months for this to happen because it's a slow burning candle that eventually ignites into an all-out beautiful fire. And it made the characters tug your heart strings every which way because of it.<br /><br />One other huge plot point in this book was family issues. Cath and Wren's mother left when the were eight, so there's almost a type of abandonment issue there. Cath can't even fathom welcoming their mother back into their lives and it blows her mind that Wren is even considering it. But the biggest family issues in this book evolved around their father. He has this light in his eyes in regards to his obsessive workload for his advertisement company and sometimes this light goes out. When this light goes out he tends to lose it and find himself in a hospital for those who have trouble keeping their minds because he has insane manic depression. He loses himself, and it's scary for his kids. Despite the fact that Art is an amazing single father that loves his daughters more than life itself, it's a constant struggle for him to beat his problems and it's even harder for Cath and Wren to watch him suffer knowing that they can't help him when they're away.<br /><br />Overall, this book brings together a plethora of struggles and depicts the story about how even the presumably weakest can come out of any tragedy strong as long as she has the best type of friends backing her up and a love of something to focus her. Everyone needs their escape, and that's emphasized in this book. And it made me love this book even more.<br /><br />But I must say I'm dissatisfied with the ending. I got so attached to these characters, so immensely attached, that I wasn't ready to say good-bye. I have a few more questions and I want to see the way several relationships play out. And while I don't want this being a series, I almost feel as if I need a companion novel of some sort to truly satisfy me and my infinite wants, desires, and questions in regards to one of my favorite casts of characters ever. While it's so huge to make me love these characters the way I do, the downside is that my inability to say goodbye makes the ending just short of perfection. Because, in my eyes, the rest of this novel is perfection in its purest form.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell truly is a must read author. And this is a new adult book for the ages. It's all plot and story, no unnecessary drama or sex. In other words, it's the way a coming of age story should be written. And, boy, do I love a proper coming of age story.ence, but this romance can seriously only be described as perfection.

147674355X|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book because everyone seems to love it, but it just wasn't for me.<br /><br />The beginning of this book hit a lot of my pet peeves. In the first 20 pages there was slut-shaming, hypocrisy, stupid and unreal high school drama, stereotyping of gays, and stereotyping of blondes. Let me explain, albeit, I'll be quick about it.<br /><br />Slut-shaming.<br />Literally the first chapter of the book is Sky explaining how she's got a reputation around town for being a slut, despite being home-schooled all her life. She goes on to explain she's not actually a slut because she's a virgin. So, if she were to suddenly lose her virginity, she'd be a slut? Really? This annoyed me a lot. It didn't help that her and her best friend, Six, tossed around the word \\"slut\\" as a form of endearment.<br />Hypocrisy.<br />This line in the first chapter really annoyed me:<br /><br />  \\"Reading has introduced me to the (perhaps dramatized) horrors of high school and first days and cliques and mean girls.\\"<br /><br />See, since Sky was home-schooled every day but her senior year and her Mom, Karen, had a vendetta against anything technology related, all Sky could do was read. And reading, she admits, dramatizes the horrors of high school. A lot. And you want to know what Colleen Hoover does? All she does is dramatize high school in an unbelievable fashion. Which you can find next...<br /><br />Unrealistic and Unbelievable High School Stupidity.<br />Upon her immediate arrival, the entire school knows that Sky's a slut/whore and reminds her every second they can in the hallway or my sticking notes on her locker. And they do this by shoving over thirty single dollar bills into her locker with a note apologizing that they didn't have a pole for her. Really? Really? This is so unbelievable dramatized, I can't even.<br /><br />Stereotyping of Gays and Blondes.<br />The blond thing really annoyed me, especially in relation to blondes. Just look at this:<br /><br />  \\"Aren't you in my Science class?\\"Shayna/Shayla asks.<br />  \\"English,\\" I correct her.<br />  She shoots me a condescending look. \\"I did speak English,\\" she says defensively. \\"I said, 'aren't you in my Science class?'\\"<br /><br />Nobody is that stupid. Stupid blonde jokes aren't even that stupid. I get the whole stereotype, but that is just...wow.<br /><br />The gay thing is a personal pet peeve because I have many gay friends that you wouldn't know were gay unless they told you. Yes, some people have rather flamboyant taste in clothing, but they can be straight or gay. I have many straight friends that have an out-of-this-world fashion sense. So to pick out the gay guy immediately because of how he dresses really grinds my gears.<br /><br />Now that we're past the first 20 pages, allow me to continue. The overall story was interesting, and the ending was totally unexpected. At times, Sky really made me feel and she was a rather redeeming aspect to this story. However, I liked the brave outspoken Sky from the beginning of the book more than the Sky I met in the middle of the book. She returned slightly near the end, and I liked that. She's the only one to truly bring out emotions in me.<br /><br />But I struggled with Holder. While I understand how so many people love him, I couldn't connect with him. He flew off the handle so easily in the beginning of the book and I just couldn't deal with it. I just knew it was going to happen again and again and it got old, especially because Sky eventually just kept forgiving him. Even if he ignored her for a month and wouldn't apologize. I didn't like this characterization.<br /><br />I also hated the way that Sky and Holder interacted. They're 17 and 18 years old, they don't talk like psychologists. Seriously, they analyzed each other and even did self-reflection exercises and my mind is blown at the weirdness. There's one scene where they're doing some rather intimate things and he analyzes her connection to him. I don't get it! I do not. I do not. I do not. If you want to be a psychologist, send them to one instead of having them psycho-analyze themselves like they know what they're doing.<br /><br />And perhaps the biggest issue I had with this story was how dark it suddenly turned. I didn't realize for it to go where it went or for it to get so serious. It almost seemed like it happened out of nowhere. I mean, there is a graphic suicide and disturbing realizations from the past coming to light. I wish the transition was more fluid. And, to make matters worse, I hated how it all came about. Sky's seventeen years old and she's suddenly just remembering everything out of nowhere. Bam, the memories just start coming back to her suddenly. It all seemed really weird to me.<br /><br />With all that in mind, Hoover does have an amazing writing style and she does know how to tell a powerful story. I understand why it's widely loved. I just can't bring myself to love it because I found too many issues within the story that I cannot get over.<br /><br />Warning: this book contains suicide, rape, sex, other sexual situations, periods of drunkenness, and cursing. It is incredibly graphic.et it! I do not. I do not. I do not.

140006922X|3.0|Aslan's book is basically a rehashing of the minimalist school of thought represented by John Dominic Crossan, without the scholarly jargon. It's aimed at an educated lay audience. He does a good job of outlining the basic issues. I would say it's worth reading, but don't expect to find anything new.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed this story, it is a nice believable mystery in a love story. I'd recommend it. Easy to read.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Seems well made. I became fairly fast accustomed of using it. Doesn't replace my old mouse but it's surely diminishing the number of clicks I have to make per hour. If you want to have more control and why not, have a cool gadget, this is a good by!
0670024856|5.0|I can't remember being swept away by a novel so completely in many years. I ignored many necessary tasks for the last three days and, because I read the novel on my Kindle (ignoring my progress), I was blissfully unaware of the approaching conclusion.  Of course, Alma Whitaker could not live forever, but I appreciate being able to follow her from the moment of her birth to very near her death, a span contemporary novels aren't often willing to embrace.<br /><br />I can't help wondering how Gilbert coped once she finished the novel. It must have been very hard to put this world, this woman, aside.  What a delicious exercise in exploring a thrilling era.  I was excited to learn so much and be reminded of other things.  As I put my Kindle down occasionally, I also thought about the ways this novel reflects Gilbert's life and passions -- not in an autobiographical way -- but as a very inclusive reflection of her experience and learning.  Bravo! I recommend The Signature of All Things highly.

B00ET9T2WK|4.0|Just got back into the Battle Nations scene since they released it on Sept. 12 or so.  It was a very fun game on my little iPod back then and I got very excited to find it on my kindle fire HD.  Unfortunately there a few glitches that slow down the game after about 15 minutes.  Portraits of players will be messed up and will log my Amazon game center thingy out.  It will then crash, but thankfully has not crashed during a battle.  It will however crash after a pvp match, but still receive the rewards.  Though these glitches appear intimidating I still enjoy the game very much.  Z2 name Lohlen (hit me up if you need help, lvl 29.)
B000I5XOW8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I just had to have it on blu-ray.  Tommy Lee Jones' Samuel Gerard is probably my favorite movie character of all time. Jones excels at the boss-man, no-nonsense attitude. And Harrison Ford is always fun to watch. This is one I watch over and over again.
1450419895|5.0|I love this book. I can read it many times over because it is very intelligent and precise information that really explains well how to target all muscles. I love it and everybody must buy it if they want to take the workout to the next level.
B005HE5J7I|3.0|What I really liked about this book is learning the origins of some words in the english language, that the author just sprinkles throughout the book. I also really liked that each chapter explores a major event in the culture, history, or development of England, London, and humanity, eg the plague, construction of London, inventions in science, timezones, etc. Loads of interesting tidbits.<br /><br />The story does begin to drag after a while. 1,000+ pages is a lot without a coordinated plot across all chapters. The chapters do follow one character from one chapter to the next, but it progresses through their lineage, so there is a lack of direct correlation of characters throughout the book, other than their ancestry. What this misses is central characters to follow from start to finish. This made the book start to drag a bit for me.<br /><br />I'll read more Rutherfurd books, but maybe not another quite so long.
0634089358|5.0|This is one of those rare pieces of instructional material that somehow manages to pack a ton of info into an easy to understand, straight to the point book. Everything is explained, but not in the usual \\"throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\\" way of similar method books. Also, it's all good stuff you can USE!
B002SAS26E|4.0|I got this game hoping to play it with some friends that aren't serious gamers. They weren't ready for it...next time I'll just stick to the party games with those people. That being said, I really like this game. It's a good 2-player deck building/ resource management game. The game is a series of rounds or turns, best out of 3 rounds is the winner. The game took about 20-30 minutes the first couple of times I played it.

B00DZAWPNM|5.0|First off this album does lean more towards a polished pop sound, but if you've been following the band you know thats why there was a split after \\"Pretty Odd\\" was released, with some of the band wanting to go in a more stripped down \\"Sgt Pepper\\" direction while others wanted to move into the mainstream. After a great 3rd album, the 4th album sees the band making another step towards a more polished pop sound, sure there are a few tracks that sound a little more like the old stuff (this is gospel, ms jackson, nicotine) but just as many are a little heavier on the synth then previous efforts. All in all there are a couple of filler-ish songs, but at 3 minutes each nothing really outlives its welcome. In short if you liked \\"Vices and Virtues\\" then you should find something to like here.
B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|Upside Down is a little confusing visually but the concept is very interesting. The message of all is possible is very true and put in quite a different venue than usual.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played! It is very fun. In the game you go around and collect resources In the world and build a house or a fortress. You then try to find different things like gold, diamonds and iron so you can update your tools to make them better. Also you have to worry about Kreepers, zombies, zombie pigmen and skeletons (unless you turn off the difficulty). Their are also animals in the game like chickens, cows, pigs and sheep. The point ofthe game is to evolve and find things so that you can survive. The game is basically a survive. But if you are in creative mode you can fly, have unlimited resources, invincibility, and it is always day.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is right up to the standards of the Trekkies' expectations. The humor is outstanding. The cast is marvelous and the overt and &#34;sneaky&#34; references to the past movies from the future are great. I still can't rate it with Star Trek 6, Planet Earth, because sometimes the violence makes me think I am watching Star Wars. Gene Roddenberry was a tremendous creator, and very much in touch with future possibilities, and sometimes probabilities. This one is no different.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Personally loved this film.  Very much in the same spirit as Beetlejuice.  Sorry 60's Dark Shadows fan but this isn't the ultra serious remake you were hoping for but then again you all do realize the old show actually used rubber bats on strings as props...I mean Scooby-Doo had better quality control than Dark Shadows.<br /><br />Tim Burton has never been bound by source materials and that is why people either love his work or hate it.  Here Burton does pay tribute to the old show but only enough to serve as a basis, a starting point to grow an original story from.  While Burton may have skimmed some of the finer plot points of a daytime soap that had over couple hundred episodes the film itself never loses that \\"anything goes\\" convenient story-telling that is found in both day time soap operas and 60's horror.  (One of the reasons that made Dark Shadows a hit in the 60's.)  Indeed this film feels as if its Burton directing a well acted and produced Hammer or Roger Corman horror film.<br /><br />This is not a fanboy movie.  If you're looking for the next Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, or Dark Knight turn around.  I myself like those films but I often get tired with film makers trying to turn everything into the next epic franchise.  This Dark Shadows movie is a Friday night, pizza and a movie type of movie. Its a fun date movie.  Its pure entertainment that rather have fun then get weighed down by taking itself too serious.<br /><br />The film is witty, engaging, and visually beautiful to look at (the backgrounds and sets look great on Blu-Ray as does Eva Green and Michelle Phieffer).  The cast was excellent in this film and they seem to enjoy playing their quirky characters.  I only wish the film would have spent 15 minutes more on developing some of the minor characters like Johnny Lee Miller's Roger.  But I think WB and Burton might have been thinking there would be time for that in a sequel.  Lastly the film boast one heck of a soundtrack mixed with Danny Elfman's haunting score and groovy tunes from the early 70's.
B00DDQTKHM|5.0|I am new to these topics. With its real-world examples and common sense, the book helped me to prepare a plan for product marketing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great app!!  it does everything my regular alarm does only on my kindle fire. I don't know what I would do without it. its a life saver
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I enjoyed the season on the farm.  Lots of suspense but sad too.  Last episode was surprising. Have to see season 3.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Everything was smooth, no problems at all. Love the movie. Workin on gettin Iron Man3.  Thank you for the smooth transaction.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the most suspensful but disturbing shows I've seen.  Characters are great and storyline is really scary.  Can't wait to catch up on all the rest of the episodes so I can catch the new season.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Minor spoilers for Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber:<br /><br />I have the most difficult time reviewing the books in this series.  Voyager, like Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber has so much happen during the book.  It is so difficult to condense it down into a readable review.<br /><br />Jamie survived Cullodan and Roger is helping Brianna and Claire discover what happened to him after.  It has been twenty years and not all of them pleasant for our Jamie.  The first third of the book is the discovery of what happened in those twenty years since Claire left him in the past.  We also find out what Claire has done with her life since she returned to her time.  While both these story lines are interesting I love Claire and Jamie together and really was just waiting for that to happen.  Once Claire realizes that Jamie is still alive in the past congruent to her own time line she jumps back in the past to be with the man she loves.<br /><br /> \\"I shook so that it was some time before I realized that he was shaking too, and for the same reason. I don't know how long we sat there on the dusty floor, crying in each others arms with the longing of twenty years spilling down our faces.\\"<br /><br />Only after jumping through time does Claire stop to even consider that perhaps Jamie has created a new life that won't have room for her in it.  It is a big leap of faith after all, but now our clandestine lovers are back together.  But the twenty years they have been apart have changed both of them.<br /><br />\\"Do ye want me?\\" he whispered. \\"Sassenach, will ye take me - and risk the man that I am, for the sake of the man ye knew?\\"<br /><br />The craziness ensues right away and Claire and Jamie fall right back into their habit of finding trouble everywhere they go.  So much action happens from this point on.  There is smuggling, seditious printing, betrayal by a friend, family problems (Jenny what were you thinking), a lost treasure, pirates, abduction by the Royal Navy, someone back from the grave, a serial killer....the list goes on and on.<br /><br />I love all the action and stories happening and while it is convenient that Claire and Jamie keep running into the same people over and over again and again even though their journey takes them far away from Scotland I will let it go because it is all so interesting.  But I let it go because I love the story line so much.<br /><br />Some of our favorite side characters are back, Fergus is all grown up a man in his early thirties.  Jamie is like a father to him and at Fergus's wedding makes a very generous and emotional gift to him that made me tear up.  We get to see Jenny and Ian again and a few others from the Outlander including Lord John Grey (the boy Jamie spared in Dragonfly.  The addition of a few new characters add a lot of flavor to the story from the little china man Mr. Willoughby, Ishmael a black medicine man and Ian Jr., Jenny's youngest boy.<br /><br />The story is really compelling from beginning to end and as always it is an emotional ride, one I will not soon forget.  I love Jamie and how fiercely he fights for Claire and his family and friends.  He is the ultimate protector.  Again this is an epic love story for the ages.<br /><br />\\"Only you,\\" he said, so softly I could barely hear him. \\"To worship ye with my body, give ye all the service of my hands. To give ye my name, and all my heart and soul with it. Only you. Because ye will not let me lie--and yet ye love me.\\"k from the grave, a serial killer....the list goes on and on.<br /><br />I love all the action and stories happening and while it is convenient that Claire and Jamie keep running into the same people over and over again and again even though their journey takes them far away from Scotland I will let it go because it is all so interesting.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have nothing but praise for Evermore!!!! I have used it for almost a year and I find it an essential tool to bridge between home computer and  tablet devices.  Thank you for such a great app.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This was a decent game, but a little short for the price. Worth it for the app of the day, though.
1451673442|5.0|Amazing book - builds on universal laws that we've known forever; takes a commitment to complete suggested exercises, but well worth it!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Better fit than the older LF1 model. Not much more to say, but I needed to add these extra words for the review to be accepted.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|\\"Thirteen Reasons\\" is a light read with heavy feels in the story. Wouldn't read it again, but I am glad I tried it.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I would say that towards the middle to end of this book I started to enjoy the story. I also figured out that this was only half of the parallel story to be told in &#34;A Dance with Dragons.&#34; It was very difficult for me to be motivated to read the first half of this book. I just found it to drag on and on. However it was interesting to get the perspective of the characters we don't normally have views on like Cersei, Jamie, etc.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simple and elegant. Shows why Google is the best tech firm. Only if it works with local files as well.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved this book as much as the previous two. It continues the story line, further answering questions in the readers mind.
B00F8802SE|5.0|I'm surprised I love this show and cannot wait for Season 4, my family recently got rid of  Directv , best decision ever! Now, if I buy a tv pass will it show the commercials too? I hope not, we've been spoiled by Netflix , no commercials! Thanks for your input :)
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I know this is a fantastic novel, I just haven't sat down to read it yet. The digital copy works fine.
1452126577|4.0|I bought the book as a birthday gift, Th person said they enjoyed it .I did not read the book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cannot stand not having the 4th book to read, but I actually enjoyed these books more than the 50 Shades series. This one seemed more believable.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this alarm clock! Wakes me gently in the AM. Got to get their kids up for school and getting woke up with peaceful bells really helps me face the day. Plus their alarm sounds like a very loud rooster,wonder how farmers do it!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I won't spoil anything for anyone, but this book just kept the momentum going. I loved this book as much as the first.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|it is very cool awesome and funny and I would give it 100 stars but there are only five but the game is amazing
B00846REIS|5.0|I cannot stand not having the 4th book to read, but I actually enjoyed these books more than the 50 Shades series. This one seemed more believable.
B008NR91DO|5.0|Gary Moore plays superbly and sings very well too. Such a shame Gary died in February 2012!!!!!!! Jimi Hendrix was one hell of a talent and I am always so very sorry he died so young!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001BANK32|5.0|I love I can have this for kindle... My old book just couldn't take anymore so it was done & over with years ago. Glad to see it offered at a fair price especially since it's close to Halloween. I was sure it was going to be marked up, but good old Amazon made my day! Anyone familiar with King's writing will be satisfied with a nice long read filled with what King does best, horror.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Just what I need for the weather. Keeps me informed of upcoming weather for over a week and current conditions for my favorite places.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone!You will not be disappointed in this and we are going to be adding more into our music collection of the artists.
B0001I562I|5.0|A great, fun, funny movie from years ago!!!<br /><br />I love the humor.  SJP makes an appearance.  There might be other famous people too but her part really sticks in my mind.<br /><br />I truly think everyone would enjoy this and that's a very difficult thing to accomplish.<br /><br />I'd suggest Grandparents watch it with their Grandkids..... really, I think everyone would be entertained.
034580404X|2.0|I was told by several friends that I really needed to read this.  I wish I had not taken their advice.  I like a good romance novel, but this is just porn in writing.  I don't mind decently written smut, but this is over the top.  Unless you like torcher and nasty sex, I would not recommend this to anyone.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I found this book interesting and amusing.  Incorporating many different deities and gods and the interactions from the main characters past made for a good read.<br />Hopefully the series doesn't divert from the path it has taken.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love the game and have never spent any any money on energy or crystals. I never have to wait too long for the energy to restore or for rewards to build up.
0756405890|5.0|The language in this book is just so creatively done. The story is extremely interesting, even though no huge epic battles happen, some how the writer keeps you sucked in. I can't explain it. I'm reading it for the second time and seriously this is my favorite book ever written. Please don't compare this to a Song of Ice and Fire. This book is on a whole new level, and I'm sure you will agree once you read it. I have recommended this to all of my friends and each person has said it was the best book they have read, or one of the best books they have ever read.<br /><br />It has a slight fantasy element to it, which I love. I get annoyed with tons of wizards and magic. This book makes the fantasy element seem very believable. Pick it up right now!
B00F9040HU|5.0|I give this game 5stars it's fun and very exciting to play.  I would recommend it to everybody to play and down load it.
142314189X|5.0|Wonderful books in perfect packaging. Really loved and enjoyed reading it. Can't wait to get my hands on my copy of Heroes of Olympus set.
0140544518|5.0|I love this parody shedding light on the other side of the story of the classic tale of \\"The Three Litlle Pigs.\\"  The wolf's perspective is so innocent.  I read it to my kids and they laughed at how silly it was because he had a cold and was sneezing the house down.  It wasn't his fault.  Also they realized sometimes there are misunderstandings in life.  Such a fun twist to this tale.
B00DMEQP2S|5.0|Albums pretty great. Something different from their old album but sounds and songs that could fit in oracular or congratulations. Swiggity swag
B001AQMBNC|5.0|One of the early alien/sci fi/adventure films that I never grow tired of featuring great performances by co-star Karen Allen. I owned it on VHS but I absolutely had to buy it on Blu Ray! One of our all time favorite films. If you have never seen it GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these a while back and have 0 complaints<br />Great quality, good lasting battery, amazing range from my computer, awesome programable keys,<br />If you need new headphones grab these for sure
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After not having a case on my kindle, this was quite an improvement!  It protects it and yet keeps it light weight and easy to use.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|i love the series and the characters the shows are awesome i like the salvator twins and elena and kathrine
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is more fun than temple run cause there are more characters to choose from you can play against friends and you can jump roll zoom out of the way + more!
0394716787|5.0|This is such a neat book and I'm glad I bought it before Halloween.  I'm a big fan of Poe.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Got them in seconds. Very happy I got them from the kindle store. I loved reading them very exciting books.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|This is a great CD.  I love songs Magic city and I'd Rather have a Love.  I have always been a big fan of Joe.<br /><br />Sharon G
B006LSZECO|3.0|the book is a good thriller a pretty fast read, and keeps you interested. I won't spoil it but I didn't like how the book ended, I felt like it was lacking something. Or maybe I just didn't like it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This 'seems to be' a new type of game play catching on. It's really a lot of fun and presents the participant with challenges that are increasingly fun, interesting, and challenging. While -at the same time- providing appropriate levels of &quot;awards&quot; to keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />You get a lot of value from these games, because they don't &quot;force&quot; spending real $$$ to gain in the fun category. I found another called 'THE ROOM' which has a similar approach, of mystery and puzzle solving.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|great book to read, and super fast. very girly and definitely a tear jerker. Not a book to read if you're having a tough time.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I particularly like the layout of this application which very well presented. It helps organize my daily schedule. A great apps
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Finally a good racing game love level 2 and if you beat level 2 you get a mystery car my mystery car was a Porsche but yours might be different so get this app for facebook!! PS.i love PIE!!!!!
B005QN3ANK|1.0|this album is just awful, it'd nothing like their last two album the did. I would not recommend this album at all!!! my advise is , don't waste your money like I did, on ths crap of a album totally waste of $20.00 on this crap. don't waste your money or time with this album...this album'  s u c k!'  big time...
B001BANK32|5.0|This is my second reading of The Shining. I've read it so long ago that it was like I was reading it for the first time. I kept on comparing the book to the movie, and while the movie we good, the book is better. I liked the description of the hedge animals, and the friendship between Dock and the boy. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a  fan of Stephen King, Joe Hill, or any other writer of horror/suspense genre.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I can't wait for the next installment. I was thoroughly sucked into this world. Already preordered book two. You won't be disappointed.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|I enjoyed this, but not as much as I thought I would. I actually found it a little slow and boring in parts.
0783226845|5.0|This is a really good story and wonderful actors to take the leads. Very heart warming at the end and great to see the good guy triumph.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Great Collection, not the remixed mess that the Six-Pack was, so many great songs!! Each CD in the mini LP sleave is a cool idea and they look great!!
1781162646|4.0|My favorite element of this story was the celebration of times gone by.  I'm 61.  Stephen King really did a great job capturing the feel of the culture and times I grew up in, the beginning of the &#34;Love Generation&#34;.  The young hero deals with all the conflicts of a young man on the verge of manhood.  As a long-time Stephen King fan, I guess I was hoping for more a fright factor.  What I got was a good old fashioned murder mystery with just a hint of a ghost story, and the memoirs of a kind man with a lot of personal integrity.  Pretty satisfying overall, but not typical Stephen King.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I was really hoping for more of a triumphant return, there are some good songs here, but over all it's just not an over all great album.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app has made my life a whole lot easier since I have downloaded it. this way, I don't have to watch the news
B001TH16DI|5.0|Put off buying these movies for a long time, but at this price I could not pass them up. Now I know they went on sale because they intend to do one box set of all movies including the 2 latest, but I am happy with these.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Great feel of Brazil in this well animated flick.  Loved the characters and the music. My grandkids watch it in Portuguese and love it.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Received just the disks.  The digital copy disk is no good without the code, so I will just toss that, I guess.  Would have just bought less if I had known I wasn't going to get the code with the disk.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I don't like this app because every time I clicked on a video it would always stop and come back and kept on doing it?:( Maybe it might work a different time?
1400052181|5.0|what an awesome book, telling both the personal and medical sides of the He La cells...our book club really had different opinions on the ethical treatments of her cells. it is a book i will often think of, written with such feeling but no bias...
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|I enjoyed this effort. I am a loyal fan and know she's a very gifted pop/rock writer who vocally delivers her songs superbly. I don't blame any artist from expanding their horizons, however, I miss the &#34;raw side&#34; of her previous artistry and production.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Thank you so much, this dictionary has given me so many definitions and were very descriptive and I'm glad I went through the whole book.I even learned what a condom was hahaha bitches!!!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|The arrival of Jeremy Carver gave new life to this spectacular series, which unlike other every day, every year increases their fans. Every time you think you've seen everything, Supernatural continues to surprise with wonderful stories full of emotions for viewers.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|This is a fun set!  For any Back To The Future fan.  Lots of fun!  Easy to build!  Well worth the money!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham's books seem to be slow-moving in parts and fast- paced in others. I wish he could spread it out. The first half of the book was very slow...setting up the characters and plot. It was until the second half that the book became interesting with unexpected plot twists. Considering half of the book was slow, I can't rate it higher than three stars.
B0019GJ4EC|5.0|great cast with John Carpenter directing . Original scarry movie :-) What more can you ask for ? Best watching on a dark foggy night !
B003B96AOW|5.0|Great action figure and my grandson loved it.  Very hard to find also.  Glad that I can go to amazon.com for everything hard to find!
B00DQVST76|5.0|By far this is Madonna's most intense and cathartic tour yet. She was a woman scorned and the first half revealed it. However, as usual Madonna' never perspires in negativity for long, instead the MDNA tour is a spiritual ride, a reflection of the world and love, something to fight to live for. This woman amazes me every single time and I love it. No one will ever amount to the QUEEN of Pop Music!!!
1847940323|4.0|As much as I tend to loathe books in this &#34;manage change and be a better person&#34; genre, I rather enjoyed this one. It's full of stories/examples of how people at all levels, some with limited resources, have been able to bring about the changes they desired and how they did it. It's definitely not a scientific, scholarly piece and the authors pepper plenty of humor and tongue-in-cheekiness throughout, making it an easy and fast read. I didn't walk away with any new information, but there were many good reminders on all the things I need to remember and all the things I need to stop doing.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|No protection for accidentally buying stuff! I work 2 months saving up for something with the badges and now when I finally get enough, I go to the shop and accidentally bought something else I didn't need. Never buy this game unless you really want to waste your time.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie, excellent story line. Had me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008PWN0I4|5.0|very nice item works very well with my iPod classic and the wireless Bluetooth Bose speaker, works just like the add.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|An interesting prelude to the 75 year old original OZ in which we have all come to know and love. The actors do a great job and the filming is in great detail.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so much fun... for any age I say everyone should get this game. Its just as much fun as the movie
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I perhaps shouldn't compare this to Desk Top versions but.... It is most difficult to tell if blocks are on the same level or not I am going to look for another app and hope it is better
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so fun. My girls love to play it all of the time. Great game all the way around.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|you will find these games all challenging, entertaining and fun for the entire family. I Highly recommend trying all the games..
B006LSZECO|5.0|You won't be able to put it down! A really good, quick read. Ending was not my favorite but it kept me guessing til the last pages
0545265355|4.0|OK set.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Bought this for my son and his wife. Works great! We all have it linked to our devices allows quit time sleeps.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I fell in love with the song &#34;Let Her Go&#34;. It has so much meaning and Michael sings it with such passion. Basically saying, you don't know what you've got till its gone.
B00FKE3H0G|1.0|There is only a couple songs on this album worth listening to. The rest is horrible. I do not understand why it is album of the week.
B001D09OAI|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years. I was glad to see it available on amazon instant video.  Great movie!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|That might be the reason why I didn't give 5 stars -  At times this book moves too fast.  Talk of a film treatment, could be cool.  If you enjoy Sanderson, this is more of the same.  With the absolute garbage littering the sci-fi/fantasy genre, he is among the few pleasures.  You always feel sad when your done.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|My book club and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Rainbow created wonderful, realistic characters.  I could not put it down.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I adore this game, but sometimes it wouldn't load. and the worst part? it took up 99% of my memeory to the point where i couldnt download anything else
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first it seemed like this book was drawn out but all of the sudden you are sucked in. One minute you feel sorry for the wife. The next minute you feel sorry for the husband. I kept changing sides most of the book. It is a roller coaster of truths and lies.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Very close to the WOW experience. Lots of fun and even more since they went free to play. Worth spending a few bucks to get early access to content. Highly enjoyable.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I first came in contact with Frederick Forsyth when I read &#34;The Dogs of War.&#34;  This was simply not<br />my type of genre but I couldn't put the book down.  I promptly read all books he had written prior and have<br />gotten all of his books since.  I have tried other authors of this genre and none can compare.  Forsyth<br />explains everything such that I never get lost, and all stories seem realistic.
B00457X8BC|3.0|Seems a bit obvious at times. And sometimes a bit childish as well. Perhaps too cynical on my part. That's all
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know the younger set loves this book, but for us old ones, over 50, these young ones have a lot to learn.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|simple and easy reading， but thought provoking and inspiring. It really sheds light on the confusions that I have in my personal life ~
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The intersecting stories of people whose lives are affected in dramatic ways through their relations to each other provide the reader with continual surprises and insights into the characters and the problems they face.  A book that dares you to stop reading and put it aside for awhile.
B001I45UFC|5.0|His is a very good book and you will enjoy it very very much and its good wording and your kids can read it
B00DB97LCM|5.0|Because at long last Paramount Pictures are finally listening to their Star Trek fans, such as myself  and are finally get to see the first two Star Trek Movies in this ten Movie Blu-Ray boxset as Directors editions. When will the other Eight Star Trek movies in this set will also get the Directors Edition treatment and will it include JJ Abrahms 2009 Star Trek and his 2013 release of Star Trek Into Darkness, which were both superb Star Trek movies?
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|I felt this book working in me within the first 20 pages, and had more vibrant experiences of release and increasing peace than with D.U. Or Y.I.R. A wonderful contribution. Thank you, Gary, for this and for all that you do.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Has a very intriguing dramatic story that can't be matched in any other series. I hope the sequel is as good

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I have already contacted the seller about the return of this controller. Overall the product weights close to the original Sony one. However, upon using it for the first time I realized that the down button on the D-pad was unresponsive. The same amount of effort was made when pushing on the other directional buttons and they all worked perfectly. The design looks above average,the material feels great, and the triggers are solid. Based on first touch, those are much better than the Sony's R1 through L2 buttons. Unfortunately, the exterior of the controller does not reflect the defective interior of it. Bottom line is,good thing the manufacture is kind enough to provide a 2 year warranty, be prepare to use it since you might be as unlucky as I am.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|works as advertised however I did not find it as easy to setup especially using a windows 8 computer that kept dropping the connection, it worked much better with a nexus tablet.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Detailed writing really helps the imagination. It also gives you new little things to try. I've read this series 6 times now and every time I do I find something I would love to do or have done to me. It really is the perfect kinds of books. Lots of story telling and sex. It's a beautiful mix. It also helped reassure me that being kinky isn't anything to be ashamed of  And has given me more enthusiasm in the bedroom. I have a very satisfied husband lately.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|As a fan of golden and silver age scifi I usually look disparagingly upon modern essays into the field. However I found myself avariciously consuming this novel. If all fiction is in some way reflective, I have always thought it the ultimate goal of the genre to not simply show us ourselves as we are or could be in the future but to make us care about the nature of the perceived differences. Le Guin, Dick, Herbert and Asimov all brought us worlds that we're not simply futuristic but also alien in the most interesting ways and it is my belief that Leckie aspires towards the same. In fact I would say that she succeeds.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag free with a Canon DSLR purchase. Although it wasn't purpose built for the camera, now I actually find I prefer this bag. It's certainly not rugged, but it is a solidly built backpack.<br /><br />The inside compartments are completely customize-able with the included Velcro straps, so it also has sufficient room for a bunch of accessories. One nice thing I found was the the top compartment fits my laptop (Lenovo X220 12.5&#34;/2.5 lbs) or full sized tablet.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was an interesting book to read. I think it was written more for a youthful audience, but as a grandma, I enjoyed reading it. Death is a difficult subject to deal with, especially when it involves young people. As we go through these young peoples lives and loves, I thought it was dealt with in a sometimes amusing way. Having had cancer myself and survived, I know laughter and discussion about your ailment is something that gets you through the hard times.

0937381888|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from my local brew supply store.  They told me this was THE book to get on brewing.  After reading through most of it, I couldn't agree more.  If you are looking for a book on brewing beer, stop looking because this is the one.  It covers all aspects of brewing.  It's excellent for beginners all the way to advanced brewers.  It has chapters on almost every topic related to brewing that are thoughtfully organized starting from beginner and moving on to advanced topics and reference sections.  In addition to teaching you all the steps to brewing great beer,  It also serves as a great reference on grains, hops, yeast, various brewing equipment, metallurgy, sanitizing/cleaning products, beer recipes, adjusting water chemistry, etc.  If you brew beer, you should have this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is an imaginative writer.  He was able to put these three books into a series.  I crave series and this one didn't disappoint.  Not only is he as awesome writer, he has allowed other authors to take his premise and write their own additions to the Silo World.  That's pretty awesome, it is apparent he writes for his READERS, and not just to make money.  I would recommend all of his books and spin-offs to anyone.<br /><br />Post Apocalyptic  with a psychological spin! Very Awesome!<br /><br />Very Good Read Mr. Howey.  Thank you!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  At first the book is all about Auguste and how he deals with his deformity.  And I found that to be captivating.  Then Part 2 started, and it looked at life through his sister's eyes, etc.  I almost didn't continue reading because I felt the book was about Auguste, and what are they thinking bringing Via into the picture!  But I decided to go ahead, and I am sure glad I did.  You see, I have a retarded brother, so I am essentially Via.  I cried when I read how she was feeling, and the author got it so right. She loved her brother, as do I, and yet, the family revolves around him--totally.  Then the book describes the other people in his life and their lessons and reactions.  An excellent read!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|In A STORM OF SWORDS George Martin shows how ruthless a truly great author has to be, for in this volume we come across the infamous Red Wedding. Those of you who have seen the HBO series or read the book, know what I mean. For the rest of you, I will say no more so as not to spoil the experience.<br /><br />The saga continues, with King Robb battling to save the North, with Jon Snow returning from his stint of spying amongst the Wildings with his heart torn, with KIng Stannis in the grip of an evil sorceress, with Queen Daenerys learning her craft of Queenship as this 14-year-old begins to show the makings of a truly great monarch, and with cruel King Joffrey growing even crueler, so that even his Lannister relatives (apart from his doting mother) become uneasy.<br /><br />There are many wonderful moments as new characters are introduced. How I loved Lord Tywin Lannister, the cold patriarch of the family. He is so typical of a high-born medieval lord. How I loved meeting Lady Margaery and her family, especially her lively grandmother. These ladies seem so sweet, but they are cunning and ruthless in their ways too. My favorite part of the novel is the way in which Lady Margaery's grandmother, Lady Olenna, outwits Cersei and saves the day...for her grand-daughter at least.<br /><br />But you will have to read this volume to see what I mean. Five stars.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I first saw this as a 2D rental and I liked it but was puzzled why the critics didn't when it originally came out.  Found a chance to get it in 3D and went for it.  Enjoyed it all over again when I re-watched it recently.  I think it's worth seeing.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I'd like to start my review by mentioning all the positive things about this series, which keeps me reading. GRRM has created compelling characters in Sansa, Arya, Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen, and I'm dying to know what happens to them, and how they come out of this novel. So every time I'm reading something about them I'm happy.<br /><br />I'm not so happy with this novel as a piece of writing. The problem is that the structure of the story has become slack, and we have a situation with multiple characters and multiple plot-lines, which necessitates long waits between each point of view character to find out what happens next. For example, poor Sansa Stark finally left the Eyrie with her uncle-by-marriage Petyr Baelish at the end of A FEAST FOR CROWS, but no-where is she to be seen in A DANCE WITH DanceWithDragonsDRAGONS. So I'm still wondering what happened to her. Instead, the plot has become bogged down in too many minor characters and their dealings, and so the momentum of the story has crawled to a halt.<br /><br />What made J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series so successful, was that each book was structured around a year at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, like A FEAST FOR CROWS has lost its structure, so one reads and reads with no real sense of where this story is going to end up. And so the arc of tension is either sagging, or absent.<br /><br />I hope that GRRM will do a couple of things with the last two books in the series:<br /><br />Ditch the prologues. I have no idea why ADWD started with Varamyr as it seemed to have little bearing on what followed. The opening would have been much stronger if we had been plunged into the scene where Tyrion is on a boat escaping Westeros, just after killing his father at the end of Book Three.<br />Edit out the minor characters, and make the book lean and mean by just focusing on the lives of the main characters that we have grown to know and love.<br />I would love a scene in which Tyrion meets Daenerys, especially as their encounter in ADWD was such a cop-out. I want to see Tyrion confront his sister and brother. I want to see who ends up on the Iron Throne. And I want to find out what happens to Bran, Arya and Sansa. Do they ever see each other again? As far as I'm concerned, I would be happy NOT having to wade through stuff about another unscrupulous sellsword, or about Theon Greyjoy and his family, or about the Dornes. Frankly, I'm no longer interested. Three stars.e a scene in which Tyrion meets Daenerys, especially as their encounter in ADWD was such a cop-out.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Beware...it can become addictive!  This is such a fun little game to play at night before I go to bed.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I can see why people have problems with this volume of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, titled A FEAST FOR CROWS. We spend a great deal of time in the company of Brienne, Maid of Tarth as she wanders through Westeros looking for Sansa Stark, only to be told she was on the wrong trail. At the end of the book, she comes to a sad, unsurprisingly grisly end, and it all seems so pointless.<br /><br />The other figure who casts a long shadow over this novel is the beautiful but cruel Cersei. As she is not a sympathetic character, and she gets increasingly paranoid throughout this book, and there is no resolution to her situation, I can see why people would get impatient.<br /><br />It is true, that I found myself wondering, two-thirds of the way through, when this novel was going to come to some kind of resolution. And it didn't, which was disappointing. But strangely enough, I did manage to read most every word, which is unusual for me as I am the most impatient person on the planet. So what kept me going?<br /><br />I think the people who really kept me going throughout this volume were the Stark sisters, which is strange as we don't hear much from them. But whenever they appeared, the volume came to life. That might explain why I stuck with Brienne through thick and thin, as she was looking for Sansa Stark, and I kept expecting them to meet up.<br /><br />Otherwise, I have to agree with others who have said this needed a stronger editorial hand. In particular, I found the prologue to this piece as well as the prologue to A DANCE WITH DRAGONS (which I have just read) really unhelpful, and actually a turn-off to the book I'm about to read. In my opinion they give you hooks that are not really hooks, as they don't seem to have much to do with the main characters.  I hope that in his next volume THE WINDS OF WINTER, GRRM will do something about that. Three and a Half stars.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|The King is dead and chaos reigns. Sitting on the Iron Throne is the vicious boy-king Joffrey, ruled over by his ambitious, ruthless, amoral and disquietingly beautiful mother Queen Cersei. But many do not accept the boy-kings rule, and six other rulers rise to claim their place, including the Stark heir Robb.<br /><br />This volume opens with the flight of Princess Arya Stark, pretending to be the boy `Arry, and ends with...but that would spoil the suspense, so I won't tell you that.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my last review, there are echoes of the Wars of the Roses in these volumes. Joffrey is as vicious as Edouard of Lancaster, the heir to the Lancaster cause and son of the ruthless and arrogant Queen Marguerite of Anjou. Who his father was, was something that no-one was really sure of (as in Joffrey's case), but the betting was that it was Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset rather than King Henry VI.<br /><br />What is so wonderful about this book is the accrual of detail that makes the lives of these characters so real, and by extension the world of that long-vanished past of the 15th-century real as well. Most second novels are extremely disappointing. This is just as wonderful as the first. Five stars.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Amazing.  I loved every minute of it. Couldn't put it down. Read all the books. Now waiting for the new one

0385344228|4.0|An interesting book. I don't think he is the best author in the world as the book seemed to be written in very long hand as if it were full written records of the court procedures and happenings. This is probably because the author is an ex District Attorney and he is used to putting every last detail down on paper. It still flowed fairly well, despite this, and you got used to the wordy style once you got sucked into the story.<br /><br />The story itself seemed, at first, to be nothing new but as it developed, it opened up many layers and provoked many thoughts in this reader.<br /><br />Spoilers here - It gave one thought as to how far you would go to protect your own child, even if the evidence and your own gut feelings pointed towards him being guilty and an evil person as well. It then flipflopped from how much you would do to protect your child to would you be able to get rid of your child if you knew he was, inherently evil and would continue harming (and killing) innocent people. I nearly gave it a 3 as there were some parts that I did not quite believe, like Jacob's dad getting rid of the knife and some other cover ups he did, they just did not seem to fit with his character as an assistant DA- end spoiler<br /><br />Like I said it was a novel that sucked you in and kept you reading\\"just one more chapter\\" as I was intrigued as to where it was going and what was gong to happen. I think it will provoke some good discussions at tonights book group.
0399162097|3.0|When we first meet Rosemary, the protagonist of [[ASIN:0399162097 We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves]], she's in college, and she tells us that she's beginning her story in the middle. As she takes us back in time, we meet the other members of the Cooke family: Rosemary's scientist parents, her brother Lowell, and her sister, Fern. Both of her siblings are gone from her life now, but she doesn't yet tell us why. We also get the sense that there's something different and special about Fern -- but again, Rosemary doesn't tell us what it is right away.<br /><br />What follows is a series of Rosemary's memories of her childhood as she recalls the nontraditional way in which she grew up. Events that took place in her childhood have long-lasting effects for her entire family, and there are clearly wounds that still haven't healed. The novel is told in Rosemary's voice and skips around in time, seemingly wherever her mind takes her. Other reviewers here have mentioned that the way in which the story is told reminds them of a memoir. I personally thought it was like reading a transcript of an oral interview. Rosemary often addresses the reader directly, and she tells us what is in her mind exactly as she thinks it.<br /><br />On one hand, I think this is a brilliant strategy, and it makes for an engaging protagonist in Rosemary. She's a believable narrator, if not an entirely likable one. On the other hand, though, it sometimes makes for a confusing, muddled reading experience. While reading this, I would often forget where \\"in time\\" I was in the story. Rosemary would relate an event in one section, then skip ahead, then go back and tell us more about that first event MUCH later in the story. I kept getting lost in the narrative, which often feels bogged down by random events that don't seem to matter in the arc of the story (Harlow, in my opinion, could have been a much more minor character and the story wouldn't have suffered).<br /><br />Karen Joy Fowler explores a lot of big issues in [[ASIN:0399162097 We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves]]: the reliability of memory, the treatment of animals, the bonds of family. She clearly did a lot of research into both memory and animal experimentation -- but much of the research is delivered in a lecture-y, unengaging way, and it goes on for pages at a time. I understand her commitment to writing in Rosemary's voice, but I think the science could have been delivered more effectively. I did respond viscerally to the research regarding animal experimentation, and I'm certain that was exactly what Fowler intended.<br /><br />The strength of the novel is in the relationship between Rosemary and her simian sister Fern. Rosemary's memories of them together as children are written beautifully and honestly, and the ending of the novel is perfect. Unfortunately, the book as a whole feels too scattered, and as a result, the big issues that Fowler discusses in its pages aren't explored as effectively as they could have been had they been presented in a more streamlined approach. I have to give kudos to Fowler for her actual writing of this book; a novel told entirely in memories is definitely an intriguing concept. Unfortunately, the execution just fell short for me.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|But there are some words it never seems to learn, like &quot;too&quot; (it always suggests &quot;to&quot;). Touchpal has a better slide implementation. It has skip letters and double letter slide methods. But it has horrible lag on my cheapo phone. And it keeps updating new words. So SwiftKey beats it. If I get a quad core with 1gb RAM, I'd probably use Touchpal.

0345802934|5.0|I do not normally read fiction that would fall into the fantasy category, but was this was touted as a good read, so I gave it a try. I read in a review that this is not the place to start with Murakam, but I dove right in. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and found that, although long, not once did I have to go back to refresh my self as to story or character. Murikami leaves what amounts to bread crumbs all along the way, so that you never lose the thread of the story. But he is never writing down to the reader. I have since read many of his novels, and will continue to do so. He is destined to become known as one of the greats.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far it's very creepy, but a lot of fun!it took forever to download on my kin d levels HD, but working well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's and awesome game. Just wish it had automatic updates on the kindle fire hd. It's one of the best games and very addictive
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had visions of it being a boring program and I was quite surprised.<br />I just loved viewing this series.  I am looking forward to another season.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I read this because my best friend reccomended it.  I read all of it, but could have put it down any time and forgot about it.
B002ZG976U|2.0|The cd broke when I was trying to get it out of the package. The quality of the cd was very thin and poor. I had to buy the movie again. The movie is quite good, though
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved it and all the other books by George R R Martin. It is story that has so many fasinating characters.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm so glad we bought this device!  I love how it streams from any device from anywhere in my house!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have always been a horror show fan, so this book. So, of course I loved the series.  The survivors, weren't just surviving,  they took care of each other and became a family with all the Dead reeking havoc on them.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The main character goes through a transformation within and without.  Though it was more light than serious, the story drew me in early and didn't let go until I was done.  Jones' sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|We will be moving in the next year, so I am down-sizing the stuff factor.  This book is a helpful &#34;get started&#34; guide with great tips.  Enjoyable to read too.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The book was wonderful.  I couldn't put it down, even though I was crying like a baby.  I purposely saved the last chapter until the next day.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Anyone who reads this book must watch Malala address the U.N. (You can find it on YouTube) God Bless and protect you, Malala.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|This is yet another one of those books I had put off, one of those classics I had deferred after hearing so much buzz about: movies, video games like Command&Conquer, and a whole lot of commotion that seemed too good to be true. &#34;As good as The Lord of the Rings&#34; said Arthur Clarke, one of the pillars of modern SciFi. Really? I thought to myself, not believing it for a second.<br /><br />The presence of this book was itching at the back of my head, urging me to find out if it was as good as people said it was.<br /><br />I finally decided to try it out. At first the read was jittery, not easy at all to grasp it's simple-complex narration that uses solid sentences charged with meaning and depth. Gom jabbar, the word has lingered in my mind ever since. Muad'Dib, the name has stayed with me after a long yet fruitful read.<br /><br />I was stunned, struck by surprise after surprise to find such a deep, great, amazing read within my grasp. I could not believe the complexity, the details of a world so crude, raw, and hostile as Dune, and yet, so promising. The Little Makers, the Worms, the Fremen, CHOAM, the universe within Herberts's universe is vast and hopefully youthful, full of a breeze profound enough to stay, to linger, such that I hold Dune as one of the greatest books I've read, ever.<br /><br />Perhaps it's what happened to me after reading Dune. I was sad, terrified of reading something subpar. I got over it, but never stopped wishing I was back with Lady Jessica, Paul Muad'Dib, the profound yet simple-natured culture of the Fremen. I don't believe this book needs neither more credibility nor reviews to convince the world that it is worth your while. It has earned its place in the cosmos of literature and beyond.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a great app to check the weather in your area or somewhere else.  it is always updated every minute and shows acurate temperetures and what weather is coming your way
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|With &#34;11/22/63&#34; and now &#34;Doctor Sleep,&#34; King is clearly experiencing a career renaissance. Great story with and ending that doesn't let you down.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|This was a great film, fast delivery. This movie was sad at first then it showed a mothers love big time.  I love Joan Crawford !!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is truly awesome.it gives u something to do when u are bored.and this game is free so thumbs up.
B00CXQL828|5.0|THIS IS METAL THAT HAS BEEN REFINED SEVERAL TIMES OVER UNTIL ALL THE SLAG IS GONE. THEN IT HAS BEEN HAND HAMMERED DOWN TO COLD HARD STEEL, AND FINALLY SHARPENED TO A RAZORS EDGE.<br />SIT DOWN- TURN IT UP (WAY UP) AND HOLD ON.<br />FINALLY METAL LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. IT HAS A MELODY!!!<br />LET'S HOPE THEY KEEP IT TOGETHER AND KEEP PUMPING THEM OUT.
1449433251|5.0|Great.... That is all that is needed.  I got the soft set and is in great shape.  New.  Highly recommended
B009AMAJPA|4.0|this movie is action if you like action this is the one for you<br />very good and it really does keep you guessing
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Needed for the part where Nemo is in the fish tank and faces the guys in the tiki masks - Who ha ha ha...
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|this movie is good its not a regular mark movie but it does keep you in you seat for sure
B00480OHWK|3.0|My wife and I were quite excited (and grateful) to receive this book along with a number of others as gifts after our first child was born. I read every book with the open minded enthusiasm that maybe a child might experience. After a few readings, I discovered that though the story is simple and fun to read, that the reading of it was not as much fun.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This movie is really good i watched it over 5 times in one night that is how much it kept me interested<br />and it keeps you guessing whats coming next really a good movie i suggest that you buy it like i did
B00EI6E17A|5.0|song was the BEST in the WHOLE world! I loved that song!<br />Who dose not like this song?<br />IT IS SO CATCHY!
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|Amazing!!!! I love that it included the cd. Best purchase this year. The album is by far one of my favorites.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|No matter what anyone says about the action, cinematography, special effects, or anything else, there's a huge problem with this movie: There's absolutely no reason to find the source of the \\"zombie\\" virus. All you need is one infected person and you have everything you need to do the science required to develop a vaccine. In other words, having Brad Pitt running all over the world chasing down the source of the virus is pointless, which makes the entire movie pointless.<br /><br />If you can suspend disbelief sufficiently to ignore the pointlessness of the whole thing, you might enjoy the action which is well-done and exciting. If that's all you expect from a movie, you'll love World War Z.<br /><br />P. S. Why is it that it's always the mediocre films that are so full of themselves they sacrifice the ending to create the opportunity for a sequel?
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This game is fun but i think there are way to many updates required and i cannot connect to Facebook.  I really need the farm money for things to help me with the farm but it won't connect.  Please fix this.  Enjoy!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that it is very good for small children. There isn't much fighting or violence. Child friendly. I think that it helps develops paying attention to details.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Fine
0788859544|1.0|I am so upset with the quality of the DVD. It stops working at Scene 13. The rest of the movie doesn't work. I feel bamboozled. It's a shame because this was supposed to be a birthday gift for my sister. I guess this is what you get when you don't buy new...
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I'll try not to repeat what others have said and confine this review to my own personal experience. Perhaps that will resonate with a few folks who want a photo editing program, but are not power users or experts.<br /><br />This app is both complete and sophisticated. Read other reviews or the product description for the long list of features and functions. In that respect I would put this at the same level as one of the PC-based programs like PaintShop Pro. However, for my use on a phone (mine is a Galaxy Note II) all I want is the ability to correct color, contrast and the such, and to easily crop photos. This does those and is easy to learn and straightforward to use. Considering how clumsy I am navigating and working with finger swipes the ease of use is important to me.<br /><br />There are a few features missing that I would love to have. At the top of the list is the ability to rotate in small increments. Also, some features that are not terribly important to me personally do not seem to work. For example, I cannot post an edited photo to my facebook timeline unless I save it first. Sometimes I just want to apply an effect to a photo for fun (and there are plenty of great ones in this app), post it and revert back to the original photo. I do not like having to commit an effect to the photo permanently. However, as I said that is not a show stopper for me.<br /><br />What is important is I can now quickly crop, correct or enhance a photo on my phone without having to transfer it to my laptop for those tweaks. Before this app I had to use my laptop. Now I am free of it.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a professional grade application that rivals some I have used on my PC. That it's not only free, but relatively stable and so full featured amazes and impresses me. I definitely recommend this app if you are looking for a photo editing app for your phone or tablet.
B0013ND30M|5.0|If this were Harry Potter I would give this purchase an E on its OWLS. An E for Exceeds Expectations. I fell in love with this Disney movie all over again. Can't wait to watch it again and watch some special features!!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I've just recently discovered Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, and he's got me hooked.  This is book #2 of the series and another solid installment -- great characters, great action, and a great ease to the writing style.  It's a well-conceived adventure that pulls you in.  The book is quite long, but that just gives you more time to enjoy it.
B005ISZRES|2.0|When I downloaded the free kindle version, it said that this book contained real page numbers, but it only had the \\"location\\" thing. This was a bit discouraging, and I must find a version with page numbers.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I was so excited back when this album originally came out in 2002.  Neil had gone through his own personal Hell and back, and the guys all got back together to deliver this very emotionally-fueled cd.<br /><br />It was well-recorded, but mixed and mastered way too hot.  In part because of the 'volume wars' of the time, but also because of the mixing and mastering processes themselves, which even the band were not happy with.<br /><br />From the get-go, I loved the songs. They are supercharged with Neil's experiences, observations, pain, anger, and reflections.  There is some very good material here that's worth listening to, I see it as a unique Rush album due to how what it was born from tragedy and triumph.<br /><br />Now, Rush gave us the great gift of this remix of Vapor Trails, by David Bottrill!  He did, IMO, a fantastic job.<br /><br />If you do a direct comparison of the original and the Remix, the original 'seems' to be more visceral and ballsy.  But really, it's more mud and compression than anything, especially when you hear how the Remix opens up arrangements.  There are a few folks out there who prefer the original mix still, but most seem to love the Remix.<br /><br />I know that for myself, I had to listen to the cd twice before I 100% decided the Remix to be superior.  I love that you can hear so many more vocal details better, more of what Alex is doing and more guitar tracks, and Neil's drums are much clearer.<br /><br />It has been a long wait for what I felt was inevitable; that Rush would remix this album and give us what they had intended.  I think you'll find that if you liked this album before, that this remix will move it up your list of Rush albums a few spots.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|this is most definitely one of buddy's best I would recommend this to anyone who listens two BLUES! this is a must buy
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Totally shocked how great a movie this is. I highly recommend you watch this movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Not as far as action or scares like other movies but as far as touching ones heart, this is the movie too see. The fact that it's based on a true story is also unbelivable. Keep a supply of tissues when you watch it. Can't recommend this movie enough. Very happy to see that Richard Gere had the foresight to realize that the script he got was dealing with greatness and he was smart enough to take the role.
0553814826|5.0|This was a gift for my son.  I did read parts of it and thought it was superior but I don't know what he thought of it.  I was hoping it would help improve our relationship.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|Very different from your standard Will Smith movies. His acting was very robotic but that's what the role called for. I waited to get this movie on redbox due to all the bad reviews. But I have to say I enjoyed the film. It keeps your attention. Not a holy cow great film but worth watching. Now I do have to agree with the reviews on Will Smith's son's acting. I was very surprised especially after seeing him in Karate Kid that his acting was this poor. Everytime time he spoke his dialogue it seemed like he was reading it off a script. Very unnatural and awkward. His english pronunication was also bad. What happened to this kids acting. If he wasn't Will smith's son I doubt he would have ever been cast in this role. Whenever I see that Will Smith is in a movie I always expect a great film. This is not the case with this movie but worth seeing for a redbox price of $1.30
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a month, that's how much I love it! All my favorite super heros are in full bloom and I can't wait for the next one to arrive soI can purchase that one too!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Simply Amazing- just buy and read it.<br /><br />Amazon needs more words to publish my review, but all I need to say, just purchase and read it. It is a book worth every penny.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This movie is very special in that it tells of the life of the hobbit before all the other craziness happens in the other movies. I appreciate how the hobbit comes to view the dwarves as comrades after all the trials they go through. I'm gladd I have it, but I love the LOTR better.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|well noting to declare, it's a usual game from angrybirds ok fine good funny another word for this anoying rate
0060853980|5.0|An awesome book which made it an easy read. It is also very funny. I enjoyed all the characters. You should really read this book!
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Ok, so I'm a big sci-fi lover, so a bit biased.<br /><br />BUT, that's not to say that I'm no fair and balanced. In fact, watching movies is something I do every day, its the one thing that takes my mind away from work at the end of the day. So its not easy to impress me as I've probably watched more movies that many of you put together.<br /><br />BUT, this movie was amazing. Special effects that were mind blowing, story that kept me hooked for the entire 2 hours and its the first movie ever, that I basically (daily) read the box office results to see if it made a ton of money or not, just to know in advance if a second movie was going to come out or not. Also, first movie in my life that I watched twice at the cinemas, nothing else moved me to do this.<br /><br />Anyway, I could go on and on about how good this movie was, but really, the only thing I want is that Del Toro makes a second one. I so want to see a sequel or prequel or whatever as long as it has Jaegers!<br /><br />Lastly, if anybody wants to see one of the classic Japanese cartoons that would have likely inspired Pacific Rim, check out \\"Massinger Z\\". As a youngster I used to watch that cartoon and it was excellent.
0767817478|5.0|I love this movie a lot about Godzilla with Matthew Broderisk and Jean Reno. A lot action and fun all around, Yes! .. but, I love the old Godzilla from 1956 just alittle more and I also like the very first Godzilla movie, which was in Japanese from 1954 version. As a kid growing, I guess I saw all old Godzilla movies Still this Godzilla is fun to watch. Fun, fun .. more fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The set up was really easy and it plays youtube videos perfectly. Adding the videos to the queue and playing all the videos from playlist was really easy. And you could share your playlist with others as well. If you start playing video using one device (ex your smartphone), it can be controlled by using other devices on the same wifi network.<br /><br />I know there are many complains about not having more apps. But for me, i bought it just to watch youtube videos and netflix and it served that purpose. You can't go wrong with this device.
B000002KIE|1.0|I'm giving this album a one star rating, not because I think that it's truly deserving of one star but because of how incredibly overrated it is.  Revolutionary?  Yes.  Great?  No.  You have a collection of mediocre material here when you really take an honest listen to it.  Nevermind who they were or what they stood for or what influence they had.  All of those things are what makes this an important event album and what ultimately makes this one of the most overrated albums of all-time.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is nothing like the movie FYI.<br /><br />The story is told from survivors of the zombie take over so there isn't a real 'flow' to the story like a traditional novel. Which for me was a great approach answering most of the questions but still leaving some questions unanswered. Additionally there are the personal stories and the stories about macro things ie government, armies etc.Also the book isn't too graphic or gory, but does have some strong language depending on the character. He social commentaries were a nice twist.
1476727651|4.0|I have read most of King's books, but in maybe the last 10-15 years I became less enthusiastic as they all seemed to go strong for the first 2/3 then the last third was weak. This book kept my interest to the end, even keeping me up too late many nights while I tried to finish it. My only complaints were that the ending was not fulfilling; I wanted and expected a big showdown between \\"good & evil\\", but didn't get it. I am hoping we will get another book featuring Abra, as she is a very interesting character. The other thing I didn't like was the title! Dr. Sleep was only a part of the story - to me it was more about fighting the evil inside yourself as well as the evil in the world. All in all, it was a good read and I would recommend it to other King fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for kids safe cool awesome. It has a lot of challenges and goals for kids. It is like the movie but better
0061906220|5.0|My son's preschool class read this book and he talked nonstop about it! I bought a copy for home and he loves reading it. He will read it by himself to me and sings the song. Great book for 3-4 year olds. Great fun. Even though he knows the book by heart- we have fun \\"reading\\" the book in the car and still laugh and have fun with it. We change the away we sing the songs and it makes the same book different each time we talk about the book!! It's also nice he can read the book by himself.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|I bought Warchest after reading Mustaine, which I highly recommend if you'd like the true story about Dave, Megadeth and his ruckus relationship with Metalica.  Warchest is an awesome compilation of Megadeth's work.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well written , non-repetitive book (many of these types of books are repetitive and should end long before they do).  Motivational read that allows career-women connect to someone who has experienced exactly what they are living
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoy zombie movies so was curious about this book.  It's a pretty good read and a novel concept acting like this was a real help book.  While it was interesting that so many different people were interviewed from diff. countries wish it could have been just a little more detailed, some of the interviews as I was getting into them would just stop.  Kinda like a lot of mini stories.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|With the loss of two major stars, I wonder why t happens. Are the actors wanting to leave such a series after three series when it is so popular, or are they just being written out? I'd like to know, for they WILL be sorely missed!!
B002RI90WM|5.0|This very human story seen through the eyes of a loved dog often brought tears to my eyes. A skilful inclusion of the racing car world set against a family tragedy with a very uplifting outcome .
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good read and nice characters.  Story line is a little predictable but still a pleasure to spend time on.  Will look for next book.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Long a Reacher fan, this us by far the best. Better than a ride on the tallest, fastest roller coaster.
0788811002|4.0|its okay, i liked it, its disney.<br /><br />Pros:<br />its cute, has funny moments, suspenseful, my daughter loves this movie<br /><br />Cons:<br />seems like a 'quick' job, artistry is not as good as the first, i hate that she seems like a different pocahontas in this one, awkward. i guess thats because she;s in a new land? i dont know, i just wish they would have done a better job.<br /><br />--side note: yes, the first london song, sounds like the belle song from beauty and the beast. lol. i always want to say 'bonjour' ;).<br /><br />anyways. my daughter loves it, i like it, its super cute. its a must see. i just wish the artisty was as beautiful as the first one.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|The whole idea behind this movie is Earth has evolved to kill humans. Well, Humans haven't been on Earth for 1000 years, so how does it still evolve to keep something away that's not there?<br /><br />To run with that, the only things that actually attack's Will Smith's kid is a slug..seriously, a slug....and something from a different planet. In fact, an animal FROM EARTH actually deliberately SAVES the kid.<br /><br />The other part is they are trying to weave Moby Dick into the film and it doesn't work. They throw out \\"Look Dad, I'm reading Moby Dick!\\" and then design the inside of the space ship to look like you are inside a whale. And they say \\"Look, a real book! and It's Moby Dick!\\" And that is about as far as that reference goes.<br /><br />It's just horrible.<br /><br />I would say rent it just to see how bad it is.
B00D2ZF24O|2.0|I sincerely feel bad for M. Night Shyamalan, though the consistency with which he continues to release films, despite his numerous critical and box-office failures of recent past proves that he doesn't necessarily need my pity. Still, it must be difficult to go from being called the next Steven Spielberg to becoming the next Uwe Boll. Even when his films are not terrible, they are light-years away from the quality of his first few features.<br /><br />With all that being said, After Earth is not as terrible as you might imagine. It also isn't exactly great, but I would place far more blame on the Pinkett/Smith family for the biggest issues the film has. This became a family project, and I think that paired with Shyamalan's overly imaginative science fiction narrative led to a sillier film than necessary. Tamed down a small amount, this may have been a wonderfully adequate family film. Kids are less inclined to notice awkward acting or absurd plot twists.<br /><br />The glaring issues with After Earth have nothing to do with the polished visuals of seamless computer graphics. The story is even decent in its basic structure, though there are certain developments within the screenplay that take on a kind of logic which seems to come from the mind of a child. Animals suddenly act selflessly to protect a human for no apparent reason and a suit gives the ability to fly when the screenplay is suddenly backed into a corner: these are apparently normal occurrences in a Gary Whitta/Shyamalan feature.<br /><br />These are all forgivable and campy errors in filmmaking judgment, but the choice to cast Jaden Smith in the leading role was a mistake that can't be as easily ignored or dismissed. The film is produced by many people, but the majority has a blood relation to Jaden, including Caleeb Pinkett, Jada Pinkett Smith his father Will Smith, who has far too little screen time to save this movie. Jaden may be a good actor. To be honest, I would need to see more of him in order todetermine what kind of talent he has, but his performance in After Earth leaves a great deal to be desired. It is underwhelming to say the least. I hesitate to say more, because every way I try and word it will sound like cruel verbal bullying.<br /><br />For the rest of the review and more visit [...]<br /><br />[...]
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|What is all of the reviews downgrade involved with? Had a high budget with a well thought out timeline. Will Smith and his son complemented well. The boys acting is fledgling, but not bad; he did not have many lines anyways. Also, the boys facial expressions were appropriate and well practiced. I do not get the agenda with the bad reviews (maybe a scientology thing)? My criticism is: \\"a guy movie\\" for sure ;)
B007MG360G|2.0|It is extremely boring and I don't like the fact of kids playing God. Don't recommend this game for children. I was excited to get this but then I saw it and was deeply disappointed. I wasted my one dollar. Don't waste your money!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a family favorite, not only for our 4 year old but for us adults as well. Great movie! Highly recommend this to any family looking for a movie for movie night. My sons love this movie but probably not as much as me and my husband. I can't say enough about how funny this movie is, even after watching it multiple times I pick up new lines that are hilarious and I missed the other times watching it.<br /><br />Great Movie!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A slow start at first I didn't think I'd  like it. Turns out to be a page turner. I really enjoyed it.
0689835604|5.0|We love this book. My son request this book over and over again. The flip up activities are great! Reading this book over and over helped my son to learn body parts in a fun and interactive way. I would recommend this to any parent that is teaching their child body parts and who's child likes books! A must have!
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I loved every episode!! I'm so happy Meredith finally has the family she so richly deserves.  The extras are pretty cool too!!
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Purchased this DVD to help get a new movie into the rotation. The movie was cute and had a good story and my children really liked watching it. Not one of my favorite Disney movies but think it is still cute.
B005RJI67I|5.0|Again great addition to my Harry Potter set!!! I think Ihave enough to build the Harry Potter Christmas village!!!<br /><br />Word!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I have been playing this game for a couple of months now and LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I would give it six stars if I could. I had never played Backgammon and within a few minutes I was up and running. The difficulty modes make it an excellent choice for beginners or old pros. I love that you can play single player (against the computer) or have a two player game. This has been my &#34;go to&#34; game from game one and I play it every single day.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Legos friends was the best thing from legos for girls!! My niece loves them and I think she now has pretty much everything!!!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|So, if you have seen the first two, the third one is about the same, although they did vary from the theme just a little. Does this variation create a negative effect? No. It looks like they possibly varied it in a way to leave room for one or more additions. I hope so.<br /><br />The bottom line: Is it funny and did I like it? Yes it is and yes I did. I found myself laughing out loud more than once and I really like the characters, story line....everything.<br /><br />4 stars for this type of movie is a really good rating from me.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I try to delete it because it takes a lot of my memory out of my kindle fire the worst part is there is two dictionaries please make it possible to delete this dictionary (:
0062014536|5.0|\\"But maybe happiness isn't in the choosing. Maybe it's in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we intended to be all along.\\"<br /><br />With Lena and Julian well and truly into the revolution, Alex back as an almost completely different person and tensions rising even further between the Invalids/Cureds, Requiem promised an action-filled conclusion to this amazing trilogy and that is exactly what I got.<br /><br />The perspectives and narrative voice alternated between Hana and Lena, which I found to be really interesting. I had always wanted to find out more about Hana's life after the cure, although with the feelings she presents as the novel progresses, you are forced to wonder whether it was even completely successful. We also find out some shocking revelations about her part in other major events in Pandemonium. In any case, when the stories of the two former best friends did converge the story became even more intricately woven with conflicting emotions present in both the girls. A sense of calm acceptance is what I believe their final meeting to be, with each character coming to the realisation that although they may be different people to the ones they were before their experiences in the Wilds or with the cure, the strong friendship and bond still managed to show through to some degree.<br /><br />The story itself in terms of pace was just as fast as Pandemonium. There is more bloodshed and violence, some characters do die for the cause and there were certainly some suspenseful moments and outstanding revelations made - which made for a truly exhilarating reading experience. What I loved the most however was the way the reader can observe the relationships between characters, the sacrifices people make for each other and a unique insight into the human experience. The threat of losing your home and the people you love can change people so much; by driving fight into them to battle for liberty and the rights that they deserve. In a society with even more constricting and cruel policies to come into place under the new mayor (who also happens to be Hana's match), it is no surprise that people start to revolt even more than before in the hopes that the functionality of their oppressive lifestyle will decrease.<br /><br />In terms of the Julian/Alex/Lena situation, if you were worried about yet another love triangle situation - then don't be.In fact, you may find that with the addition of another new character the dynamics may begin to shift. In the end, I wasn't completely satisfied with the way that this got resolved, but I will say that change isn't always inevitable - especially when it comes to how someone feels about another *hint*.<br /><br />One thing that did throw me right at the end (literally) was the actual ending. After reading the last page I remember turning to see if the book was actually finished, and when I realised it was I was actually a bit shocked. I suppose in its defense there was a lot revealed earlier in the novel, but I was so curious to see what happened regarding a few delicate situations. In a way, I suppose that this isn't the type of series that you can wrap neatly in a box and tie with a bow, leaving room for further speculation with a poetic finish. But, I still wish that I had known in true finality what really happened.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION*<br /><br />In conclusion, even with the questionable ending, I still loved every minute of reading Requiem.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great followup to the first reboot movie.  The parallels and twists are entertaining!  And as the previous movies had, The Adventure Continues.

B00AEFY4CG|5.0|Had to buy it to keep it in my collection. Love this movie, never gets old. Great classic and story line. My favorite actor.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I started the Fault in Our Stars. My cousin recommended it but didn't tell me what it was about. I found myself rapidly drawn into the characters. They are very well written and the book does a phenomenal job of building the characters and making you care about them.<br /><br />There were a lot of very fun turns in the story, and I loved every second of it, but I could see the end coming about half way through the book. That said, the predictability of the story did nothing to spoil my enjoyment of it, and this is one of very few books which has had the ability to bring tears to my eyes in quite some time.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it!
B000IDEORY|5.0|Great movie, had to buy it to keep it in my collection. Great dancing, music and story line. My favorite actor. The quality of the movie was good.

B00FN811SY|5.0|So far I can only use this app on my mobile. (galaxy 3) I love it. I love having not only this perfect translation but also the other translation for comparison and study. I cant imagine a better tool for bible study as a family and personally. Except, I would love to have it on my Kindle Fire. My kindle goes everywhere with me and it is much easier to read from and use than the smart phone since the screen is bigger. I understood from the annual meeting that it would be coming to Kindle. I cant wait!
B00EY8ARYS|5.0|It appears to be a lot of fun and the action is brisk.  I look forward to future episodes.  They are going to be interesting.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|It was a free app of the day so I got it. So far so good. Now I am just writing this so three ap won't prompt me again.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Bottom line, Steelheart is a series I will not be returning to.<br /><br />Characters: I've always felt that Sanderson's biggest weakness was in the depth of his characters, who are always a little archetypal, but made interesting by the fantastic and detailed world created for them to interact in.  While this worked in the highly developed and dynamic world of his adult Mistborn series or could be forgiven in his new Young Adult Rithmatist series, it was to his detriment--and to me, failure--in this new book, Steelheart.<br /><br />The world of Steelheart is by no means unique.  Epics are the typical \\"supers\\", \\"specials\\", \\"powers\\" that have always graced comic book pages, as well as its post-apocalyptic setting.  This may have been a golden opportunity for Sanderson to really develop his characters, having such an established world/setting, but no.  Instead we get David, the teenaged metaphor-deficient nerd warrior and the team of Reckoners (who are cardboard cut-outs of the Mistborn band), featuring Megan, the frigid, flat female character whom the protagonist still inexplicably falls in love with; the wise, grisled veteran/teacher hiding a powerful secret; the gentle, comedy-relief thug; the religious/spiritual philosopher, the researcher, and the inhuman villain who really is \\"pure evil\\" (*yawn* not even Darth Vader was \\"pure evil\\").<br /><br />I think there were two major institutional failures in the creation of this novel:<br />1) It was meant to be a comic book.<br />2) It was meant to be teen fiction.<br /><br />Plot:  I've read a lot of reviews expounding on the fast-paced, action-packed plot that \\"read like a comic book.\\"  The fact is that Steelheart was a comic book without the advantage of dynamic illustrations or the nostalgic charm.  I was constantly bored by the long, drawn out descriptions of the set-up for the Reckoners' missions.  The driving action and the tension was often halted a dead, mundane halt while David \\"nerded\\" over guns or his \\"romance\\" with Megan.  I found myself skipping pages and pages of \\"action\\" and not missing any vital plot information.<br /><br />Genre:  Sanderson made a mistake I find a lot of authors do when specifically marketing to a teen audience--THEY DUMB IT DOWN.  The protagonist, from which the entire book is told in first person POV, is dumbed down to a teenage boy who forgives bitchiness for amble breasts and gets really annoyed whenever he's called a nerd.  The villain, Steelheart, had less humanity and less personality than Hitler.  His defeat was just about as anti-climactic as Hitler's too and could be seen so early in the novel, it made reading the rest of the book a chore.<br /><br />True, I may not have been the intended audience for this book, but if this was supposed to appeal to teenagers, I feel insulted on their behalf.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It was better than expected all of the way through to the end. Very good, lots of sad and somewhat happy moments. Good read.
0312330537|3.0|I loved the first part. Some say it the first 400 pages - and maybe they're right about that. What I loved was how India became alive to me. A place which on the surface seems crowded and poor is really very interesting and portrayed lovingly. At one point I really believed living in the slum could be just as good as anything else. I also like the thoughts of Lin, as he leads his internal discussion about what he has done and how he feels about various issues. I think this internal conversation shows humility and humanity.<br /><br />The second part is close to boring - it's seems like the most interesting things to be said about India and the Indian people has already been said in the first part. But what is most disappointing to me is the development of the Lin character. The reason for the disappointment has a lot to do with the joy I had from the first part of the book - I was kind of expecting some development based on the insights he'd shown in the first part. Instead, Lin lapses into crime and we get this whole Afghan adventure which is not really essential to the overall story or to Lin. At this point the internal conversation in Lin becomes more annoying, since there is an acute mismatch between his actions and his thoughts. It's simply hard to believe that he can be so causal bout his gangster-life and so soul-wrenching in his thoughts. At some point Lin claims that he has never killed anyone, but I find that hard to believe since he stabbed another gangster in the back just a few pages earlier - and that one certainly didn't survive. I find this self-deception to go deeper than the Lin-character, the author himself is also smitten (I think).<br /><br />Some reviewers claim that Lin is made out to be a hero. I don't think so, in the Afghan adventure he doesn't do all that much. If there something uncanny about it, it must be the enormous adaptability of Lin - he can fit everywhere and with everyone. He also loves and likes everyone, often at first sight. The other characters are remarkably interested in forming fancy sentences, echoing the inner conversation of Lin. That in itself makes the other characters less likely, they seems to be more like mouthpieces. Only Prabaker and people related to him seemed to be genuine. I was also disappointed that Lin accepted the philosophy of Khader. The idea that everything moves towards complexity completely violates physics (2nd law of thermodynamics) and I wouldn't have expected a guy who seems have all kinds of knowledge to miss that.<br /><br />All in all, the book should be shorter and Lin never showed the potential for development that I hoped for at the beginning of the book.
B000GIXIGY|5.0|It's one of my favorite groups and the memories I have of seeing them in Upper Darby!  Loved them and their music!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie showed the incredible bond a person can have with their pet. I have three dogs and don't really see them as pets but as my children so I can relate to the theme of this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|very good it's just what I want!! I have it! if once I get more I can creat a whole world !!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Amazing! Beautiful prose about life, love, and endurance.... overcoming the tough times to become what you were meant to be from day one.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really fun game but sometimes I wish that there is no black monkeys things. This is my opinion
B008JD7VZM|2.0|My son is very into Minecraft so, when we saw this, we thought it would be perfect for him.  When the item arrived, we were SHOCKED!  It's TINY!  The whole box is only about size of a small Kleenex box.  It does actually contain 400+ pieces, most of which are thumb-tack size or smaller.  The picture in the listing is VERY deceiving & $50 for such a small item is WAY overpriced.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really loved it, a must read! Go buy it now! I'm just trying to write 6 more words, bye
B004JHYRYU|5.0|I had seen the movie at least three times in the movie theaters and own the DVD.  I had to read this book.  A perfect story of two individuals from different walks of life, pre-World War II.  A must read for those who know the history of the British mapping North Africa before the war.  The book brings to life the love story, the love making, the lust these two people had for each other.  The book also develops the perfectly through the final pages.  I love the fact that this book has flash backs in the main character's memory, which is vividly brought to real life.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|With a cast like this you're bound to get some good action. There are more stars besides the ones who are listed on the front, too. The plot's engaging enough for them to have made a sequel from the surviving members of this cast, who I won't name to spoil the plot.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Great DVs and fun to watch.  Enjoyed each episode immensely.  Will watch episodes more than once.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|I saw it in the theater and was in disbelief that Sean Penn could transform himself into Mickey Cohen. I was SO glad there wasn't any product placement, so to speak (Chesterfield cigarettes, Orange Nehi), but product placement from that particular period. So, some of the facts are wrong. It's still an entertaining picture.
B000002AGE|5.0|What can I say.....This is their best Album !! Jaco was amazing !! Since his death in 1987 there has been a large hole in the Bass  world
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This time, it's Denzel &#34;freaking&#34; Washington as his actor of choice in front of the blue/green screens to create great cinema. You really didn't think they flew the plane upside down, did you? There are some good lines by the other members of the cast you might hear quoted somewhere.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Yes fans already knows how great this album is. Partrick Moraz certainly added a different flavor to the band. Released in 1974 it was ahead of it's time
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I liked this book quite a bit and see am now compelled to go back and read the song again. With the additional family info, it may prove to be even more interesting than y the forest time. Highly recommended read!
B0057VDGNK|4.0|What's there not to enjoy about this!<br /><br />The movie was great<br />The jacket is awesome<br />Reminds me of Hotline Miami<br />The beats are good and just \\"mysterious\\"<br /><br />Awesome stuff
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Ken Follett  rocks. I love all the Ken Follett books I have read. His historical books are so true to life and full of interesting people along with edge of your chair suspense. I would give this one 4 1/2 stars.
0920668364|5.0|Before I became a parent, I used to find the mother in this book a bit creepy. Now that I am the mother of two beautiful, happy, living children, as well as one more little girl who was already gone the first time I got to hold her, I see this story in a different light. Robert Munsch wrote it as a tribute to his two stillborn babies, and it gives a beautiful, sweet, timeless voice to the grief and love that we parents of those lost babies feel.<br /><br />From Mr. Munsch's website:<br /><br />\\"Love You Forever started as a song.<br /><br />\\"I'll love you forever,<br />I'll like you for always,<br />as long as I'm living<br />my baby you'll be.\\"<br /><br />I made that up after my wife and I had two babies born dead. The song was my song to my dead babies. For a long time I had it in my head and I couldn't even sing it because every time I tried to sing it I cried. It was very strange having a song in my head that I couldn't sing.<br /><br />For a long time it was just a song but one day, while telling stories at a big theatre at the University of Guelph, it occurred to me that I might be able to make a story around the song.<br /><br />Out popped Love You Forever, pretty much the way it is in the book.\\"<br /><br />[...]
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I enjoy the different sounds and that I can make my own combination of sounds. Then the volume can be controlled on each sound so you really get a personalized effect. I listen to it as I go to bed each night.  Very relaxing!!
B00EDR5N58|5.0|This album is amazing and with the addition of the artwork just makes it that much better! The artwork is unique and truly something worth the price.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is one romance that should never end! Castle is always an excellent blend of cop show investigation, character pathos and human silliness! Nathan Fillion is one of the most entertaining actors out there and Stana Katic gives him a run for his money. The minor roles are real people with dimension and are all portrayed amazingly by the kind of quality actors we wish we could see in every role. Castle and Beckett retain their charm well , even after they finally give in to their mutual attraction. A must see for almost everyone! Not good for young kids.  Murder in every episode and the crime scenes can get very grisly.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This is an old classic movie that recommend to anyone who likes action movies , one of Michael bays classics.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The gift of a new time line given in the most recent version of Star Trek is apparently going to be milked for all it is worth. Here we have the reshaped story of Khan and what he did to our beloved Enterprise crew. Though I admit the new crew is less dignified and military minded than the original series (and it's movies and spin-offs), the changes initiated by the previous movie's story can explain it. Mind you, my take on the result would have been a MORE disciplined military state, but you can't have everything you want. I actually like the more extreme entertainment levels we get with the resulting characters and their crazy antics. If you haven't seen \\"Star Trek\\" from 2010, see that first to re-orient yourself to the newer vision. If you have seen it and liked it, you will most likely benefit from a reckless dive into the sequel, \\"Into Darkness\\". Go get it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So I've played Subway Surfers a long time, and the one thing that goes through my head every time I play, is OMG! I don't want to get caught! Like, every time I play, I feel naughty for spray painting on the wall, so when the sheriff sees me, I'm gone cause I don't want mom to find out! Anyways, great product, and it's free! Now, for my ideas... So, first, I was wondering if it would be possible to save themes? And I know I'm not a tech geek or anything, but I know that it involves a lot of data to save a theme. So saving every theme is out of the question. But maybe saving your top three is possible? And you can replace your theme anytime, but once you replace your old theme, it's gone. And maybe after the world tour is over, we can download an old theme we've played before, but since you guys need revenue to keep all these updates and such going, maybe 99 cents to buy an old theme if we missed it? But if we get a new device, we can still download the theme we buy, but since we paid already, we don't need to anymore? And a theme idea... Puerto Rico!! I really want that theeemmmeeee!!!! I'm telling you, if that theme ever pops up, I'm never updating my subway surfers again. So... Yeah. Thanks for reading all this, and keep those updates coming!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Way too violent a film.  This was a real downer, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.  I'll read reviews more carefully next time!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I read at least 6 hrs a day &like the fact  I don't have to stop & charge my kindle every couple of hrs.
B00B9366VO|4.0|I enjoyed watching this documentary about the heyday of a recording studio.  David Grohl did a great job telling the story about the Verve control board and all the great bands and music that was made there. I'm glad he's putting the control board to good use.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|i know what your thinking its a review same old same old amazing stuff that almost always appears in a review, but this review is truly manific (in English magnific) (that is Latin i think) this book is about a boy who just can never stop doubting himself but i wont give away any more.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A friend of mine said this reads like an action movie on paper. That description isn't too far off. That's not entirely a bad thing, if you know what you're getting into.<br /><br />I read this book because I had seen the \\"Jack Reacher\\" movie and liked it. I understand that people had issue with the casting of Cruise but I didn't mind it so much. Having read this, I feel that he portrayed the character pretty well. Sure he's not built like Reacher is in the book, but I think he captured everything else about the character well enough.<br /><br />This is a decent murder mystery story. Usually with these kinds of stories I've got the it figured out before the book ends, this one kept me guessing or changed things just enough that I was surprised. Some of it's predictable, yes, but again it's \\"action movie on paper\\" and that alone means some of it's going to be predictable.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book, and I'll be rotating the rest of the books into my reading rotation. They're good popcorn novels, nothing wrong with that.
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is so funny! I remember watching it as a kid and not understanding the jokes but now I do which makes this movie even better haha
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Loved Jack Reacher! He is a complex character that successfully navigates a complex plot. I plan on reading more of the series.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|is okay but not too many options so I will wait for better one comes out  just wait for better one
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow-up to the first book.  Complex connections of several families through major world events and their unique perspectives made for a great read.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Wow - excellent Roxy Music catalog remasterred, reissued with additional tracks (I will never understand why they did not include every track released - right now most people buy only tracks online, so people like me that still buy CDs are collectors, but we are not dumb).<br /><br />Nice package, nice remastered version (good ones to be honest).<br /><br />I wish they could release a similar box set with Brian Ferry works.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like the game, but it won't upgrade<br /> Won't stop asking me. It gives me no choice to do it or not every time I go on it it ask to upgrade. Very irritating
0345803485|1.0|There was a lot of hype over this book. To be honest, I was disappointed. I thought the story needed lots more monsters, ninjas and robots.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the books. It was a great story from start to finish. The ending was exactly what I hoped for. The book is geared towards teenagers and above readers. There were times in the book that I really wanted to slap Katniss and times I really loved her. I would recommend the book
B003O86FMW|5.0|Now I have to read Mockingjay to find out what happened when they were extracted from the arena.  Is Peeta still alive?  Will they ever see each other again?  Will Katnise finally get to be with Gale?<br /><br />Must read on....
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|People run hot and cold on this cult classic, love or hate.  I fell in love with it on first viewing back in the early 70's and that feeling has not diminished over time.  The message of embracing life, with all of its flaws, is an uplifting one and we all need to be reminded of from time to time.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This is a story that holds your interest from start to finish.  Cary Grant's character is mistaken for someone else by the villain, played by James Mason and the story unfolds with a pursuit of Grant by Mason across the country.  Near the beginning. on a train, Cary meets Eva Marie Saint who is -- at this time -- a Mason accomplice.  Her allegiance changes over the course of the picture, as you would guess.  Particularly great are scenes on the Illinois prairie and at Mount Rushmore.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Because they took time to blend the old with the new in a fantastic fashion. From a 64 y/o original show watcher.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We were anxiously awaiting this release.  Our only complaint was that we accidentally bought the Blu-Ray/DVD combo and for some reason it would not work in a DVD player.  Fortunately we had a Blu-Ray player too.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|So realistic, you can taste and smell the bush.  With such a difficult life, it is a miracle the family survived.  This a beautifully written book, and a fitting PS as I just returned from a safari.
1423101502|5.0|I was working in a middle school and one of the students was reading the first book.  My kids had the set so I picked it up at home and got hooked on it.  This is the last book in the series and was worth getting.

I am a die hard Percy Jackson fan, die hard Harry Potter fan, and a die hard Lord of the Rings fan. If you like mythological books with gods, magic, and courageous wars and chatacters this book was written for you.<br /><br />My Favoite Titles<br />Harry Potter<br />Percy Jackson<br />Heros of Olympus<br />Lord of the Rings<br />The Giver<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes<br />Chronicles of Narnia<br /><br />Thanks for eating this with your nasty little eyeballs.<br />Peace Homie
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I had to choose a book for an English essay and I decided to give this book a try. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes romantic or even action books. This is the best book by far and I think Nicholas Sparks did an amazing job of captivating the reader and pulling them into the story and making them feel like they lived it. It brought smiles of joy and tears of sorrow, but it was by far, a must read!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to this show.  It has everything I enjoy.  It has drama.  It has humor.  It has romance.  It has clean language.  It has history.  It has adventure.  It has politics.  It has a great cast.  It has authentic costumes.  It has wonderful story lines.  It has superior acting.  It's just great British television.
0385344228|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS GOING TO BE SPOILERS FROM THE GIT GO. SO YOU PROBABLY WANT TO GO AWAY IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT AND THINK THAT YOU WILL.<br /><br />I liked it but.........<br /><br />There is a lot going on with this book.  It really isn't what I would normally consider a mystery: a who done it.  There is only one person who is considered as a possible perpetrator during the entire book.  There is only one other \\"fair\\" possible other perpetrator and early on most of the evidence seems to point in one direction.  If you are the kind of person who reads mysteries regularly you \\"know\\" that the person we are all looking at can't be the killer.  That might be one reason it kind of felt that this book wasn't playing fair.  On the other hand if you don't look at it like a murder mystery, but rather as a character study of the narrator not the criminal, then it is entirely fair.<br /><br />One of the major themes of the book is an insistence of the \\"biology is destiny\\" idea.  Is there such a thing as a \\"Murder or Warrior\\" gene and does it continue unabated through the(apparently only male)generations,skipping a generation here and there?  Perhaps, but the perp. in this book is far beyond any Warrior/Murder gene.  What he is is a sociopathic serial killer, not at all the kind of person who is a result of a Warrior/Murder gene as the author defines it.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that the narrator is a professional prosecutor and yet his family loyalty is completely and totally absolute.  There can be no question in his mind that his son is innocent no matter what the evidence is against him or how the after effects of the crime play out.  In the end the father who comes from a hard and brutal family history turns out to be less able to see the truth than the mother who has been brought up in a sheltered and protected(at least according to the narrator who is the father)home.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that I like quite a bit is the trial and the preparation for the trial.  I have been in a lot of trials (none this spectacular) and the preparation rings true.  The way a defense attorney prepares and the way he must conduct himself in the trial in order to win is very well portrayed and quite believable.  Of course one must realize that his was a prosecutor who was writing this book so one needs to take with a grain of salt his prejudices and opinions of defense attorneys, but then that would I guess be the willing suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy this work of fiction.<br /><br />On the whole a pretty good book, just not a murder mystery in my opinion.
1452126577|5.0|I love Grumpy Cat mostly because he says thing I wish I could say as I feel the way he expresses himself.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Because of the series. The screen did freeze up one time, but don't know if it was the player or disc. Still got video and was satisfied.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great read!  Not as good as Dragon Tattoo. But still a fantastic book. Everything about Salander has you cheering for her.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Gary Cooper is great as always.  The story is very good, has the same theme as Atlas Shrugged, but on a smaller scale.  As Atlas Shrugged is global, Fountainhead is on a smaller scale, in a city between just several men.  Fountainhead came from the definition:  an original source of something.  And the source is your mind, that's your property that no one can have.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|Great movie. Received it in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  Great movie with Nicolas Cage.  My 10 year old who is a Marvel super heroes fan loved it.
B000V9D0OS|5.0|A big AFI fan, love this album. Would definitely recommend it for anyone interested. Been listening on loop all day.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Seriously forget her style (even tho I love it) but her album is just f****** amazing. Check it out! Is worth every penny.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun app, great for all ages.  I would recommend that everyone gets this app.  I have had no problems with this app.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I originally contacted the manufacturer about the dimension specifics for this product because I wanted to do something a bit different. I work security and use a 5.11 MOAB 10 as my back and forth to work day bag. One of the tools I bought for use at work was a 4D cell Maglite. I usually put it into the main compartment, but it was running the risk of damaging anything I had inside. Enter the molle system on the outside of the bag. However, there wasn't anything available that would do the job. Then I looked at this neat little Nite Ize and had an epiphany! I could weave the belt loop through the molle straps! And lo and behold, it works! I'll post a photo of me using two on the side of my bag to hold my Maglite safely and securely. This product was worth every penny.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Love the bomber-style numbering layout, love the color, and the automatic function of the watch gives me something to appreciate about the mechanics rather than &#34;oh it's quartz&#34;.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|I really liked the first two singles for this album, so I was expecting to be satisfied with the whole thing. I love it! Very different sound, that's for sure, but I'm a big fan of this 80's vibe. If I had to say something negative, it'd be that the CD is way too short. 33 minutes? Come on guys! Other then that, bravo :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game can be addictive. I love it, but productivity has taken a HUGE hit. I would be willing to pay extra to have one that is add-free.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a great app. I use it almost everyday. Especially for school when I have Physics and Maths. I like it more because it has the scientific calculator
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|WOW,  WOW AND WOW...It was better than expected. Love this program. Can't wait for Season 3 to be available. Homeland...enough said.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This one also said that the file was corrupt when I attempted to download it. Did not try a second time.
0312330537|5.0|Mr. Roberts' prose is like no other - the fact that this is a true story is mind-boggling. This book is by far the finest novel I've ever read, and this comes from an English Literature Major!
034537410X|5.0|I first read this book in 1991 after it was originally published.  Changed my life forever to realize that an entire reality awaits to be cultivated through awareness of dreams and lucid dreaming.  My first few lucid dreams were profound and opened my mind to the possibilities that awaited.  LaBerge presents the scientific research and applied techniques him and his colleagues worked on at Stanford University.  He touches on the possibilities for exploration, physical and mental healing, exploring archetypes and mythology, among other aspects.<br /><br />Highly recommended as one of the original sources of Western science and research into lucid dreaming.  While his research was a 'wakeup call' for the West, this practice has been with us for thousands of years, and is still active in many cultures.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I liked this app at first for a while. Very convenient when I was on the go and whatnot, kept things organized. However, it updated itself one day and deleted everything I had in there. That may not seem like a big deal in some cases but when your a college student and on days when you have to carry all your books and can't fit your laptop in your backpack, having this app on your kindle was very helpful. I used this for the better part of 3 semesters along with a fair variety of other things I used this for. Just tried to save a new note and it didn't keep it. Looking for another app that won't delete my stuff on me when it so chooses to.
B001FES0J8|5.0|This is one of Queen's best albums in my opinion, and this is a wonderful vinyl pressing! Great tone and clarity, durable vinyl, definitely a good buy. You can't beat Killer Queen, but this whole album is amazing. Shame on you for not already having this record!
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I loved this game til this morning when I went to play it said there was an update required. When I followed the links to get the update there was no way to actually get the update. I now can't play til . I get this 'update'. Please fix this problem.
B002A32I78|5.0|This vinyl pressing is has great clarity in my opinion, the vinyl itself is thick and durable as well. Im not sure if its 180 Gram, but its not at all flimsy either way. Any decent La Roux fan with a record player should definitely pick this one up.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I've always loved mysteries like Columbo growing up as a teen and would recommend it to all my friends who love a good mystery!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found these artists on YouTube.com, bought the able, and was smiling like a Japanese tourist from start to end.  The album happened to reach into my heart and re-inspire much of my love for classical music.  Bravo. Well done.
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|A very nice and wild ride.  Set in a snowy paradise, if you love &#34;man vs nature&#34; suspense/action , you'll love this movie!!!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Liked the story a lot.  Acting was great.  There was way too much violence, and way too much blood spurting.  Not recommended for children.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game it so funny it can give you a good giggle have a good laugh and get this game!!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is the greatest game I have ever played.  I absolutely love it.  My grandchildren love it too. I can't imagine anyone not just falling in love with this game.  Sometimes I would like to choke those announcers.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The 1st time I played it I deleted it stupid old me:) so I downloaded it and let my friends play it it scared the shot out of them.
0446547654|5.0|I absolutely love Nicholas Sparks novels and buy them as soon as they are available for purchase! I own them all!
1476734941|4.0|Like I said before a diet book is only as good as the readers dedication to doing it.  No magic pill here.  Good advice and commen sense.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love the Supernatural show. I have every season & will get all of them as long as the show is still made.<br />I would recommend it to everyone who is not easily offended by inaccurate religious things.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|A potentially toxic human child is set loose in Monstropolis.  Mike & Sully must work to return her without getting caught by the authorities.<br /><br />Detailed animation add to the action, humor, and characterization.<br /><br />Talented voice acting help with the character ant plot development as well as humor which is common throughout the film.<br /><br />While there are many site gags, subtle background humor is also present which may not be noticed during the first viewing.<br /><br />Overall a fun and hilarious ride!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|How could anything of hers get better.  It just does. Love her words and sound. Like an angel in my room.
0425266060|5.0|Very good!!! This trilogy is attention-getting! It's similiar to Fifty Shades, but the plot is much more in depth. I would recommend this to any Christian Grey fans:)
1567184855|5.0|It's hard to come to the end of his books...so I was so happy that he kept them coming.  When you have lost a Loved one, these are the books to read. Thank you Michael Newton.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Once you begin watching this series, it is difficult to stop!  Very enjoyable and entertaining.  Looking forward to the 4th season of the series beginning in January, 2014.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I tried to read this book with no preexisting expectations. It wouldn't be fair to me as the reader, nor to Mr. King as an author. Was I successful? Of course not. I've been reading King since before I was a teenager, and he is one of my favorites and The Shining is one of his best books, so for me to crack open a tome that is a sequel to one of his most horrific and maddening tales without at least a small amount of desire to go on yet another dark ride was impossible. I was hoping for this journey to be similar to the first, but different enough to have its own spirit and to be more than just a carbon copy of its predecessor. I also secretly hoped that this story would be as good as The Shining. I knew this was a long shot, so at least I could keep this feeling in check.<br /><br />So, were all of my hopes and dreams for this novel fulfilled? No, and I knew they wouldn't be. Was this a great story that was worth reading? Yes, I think so. There were many questions that I didn't get answers to and many avenues I was hoping this story would go down that didn't, but Mick was right when he said you can't always get what you want. I understand now why King doesn't usually write sequels. His writing is so rich and layered, that he'd never be able to cover all the ground his fans would want. Sometimes leaving a sequel up to the mind of the reader is the best way to go. I won't say either way how I feel about that with this book, but I will say this was a great story that even the most diehard Shining fans should at least be able to enjoy.
B00025ETIW|3.0|When receiving the CD I found that the case it came in had a very large crack. The CD was fine.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|TEMPLE GRANDIN IS AN INSPIRATION TO ALL PEOPLE.  SHE HAS SHOWN THROUGH HER LIFE THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO, WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.<br /> ANYONE WHO KNOWS SOMEONE OR HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM AND OR ASPERGERS SYNDROME WOULD FIND THIS DVD/BOOK VERY ENLIGHTENING,  INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT.<br />  I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL
B0044KU7KU|3.0|When receiving the CD I found that the case it came in had a very large crack in the middle. The CD was fine.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I tried side loading the program mentioned in a previous post, it worked flawlessly. Downloading this program from 1mobile made it easy, and the program of course is great!!
0142421715|3.0|The book, Crossed, is a satisfactory book filled to the brim with adventure and romance capturing the reader's attention. The use of two narratives throughout the book is a fascinating idea, as this allows a chapter to include a 'cliff-hanger' towards the end, maintaining the reader's attention. The use of poetry is clever, seeing the reason for Cassia desiring the revolution named \\"The Rising\\" is from a poem given to Cassia by her grandfather. Despite the admirable work put into Crossed, there is one flaw. The book would race through essential topics, thereupon referring back to that topic. However, the reader would not remember the section clearly because of how unnecessary it appeared at the point when they read it . Crossed is recommended greatly to others of any age because it is well written and full of shocks.
B003G4W49C|3.0|kindle is nice application to read books, got this on recommendation of my brother, haven<br />read yet, but hear it was going to be a movie
