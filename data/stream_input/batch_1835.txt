B009GX7IRA|4.0|I am a huge fan of NCIS. Season 10 was turning out to be one of the better seasons in the last few years. They knocked it out of the park this season starting with the finale of the Dearing case from Season 9 and going full steam from there: a strong cast, complex plots, a great combination of whit and drama. They included another episode with Gibbs's ex-wife, Diane, played by Melinda McGraw. She is very funny, and the scenes with her and McGee (Sean Murray) are some of the funniest scenes in many years. Plus, Mark Harmon is awesome in this show.<br /><br />The only disappointment would be the final episodes are focusing once again on who DiNozzo is sleeping with. It would be nice to keep the focus on crime solving.<br /><br />KUDOS to  Mark Harmon for creating one of the most captivating characters and performances on television!

B0059XTU1S|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film.  Nobody can do this kind of mythic drama like Peter Jackson and his phenomenal (and huge) crew.  I thought I would miss the characters from the previous trilogy but I fell in love with the dwarfs from their first entrance one by one into Bilbo's gorgeous home.  What a fascinating and varied group! Their song around Bilbo's fire blew me away!  Some of their adventures fighting goblins and Orcs went on a bit long in my view, but  every scene was a visual treat.  I'm not a big 3-D fan, but I found it worked in this instance without seeming like a gimmick. Also, the back story lacks the intensity of LOTR, nevertheless, it won me over and I look forward to prolonging the Tolkien journey two more years.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I really wanted a wireless gaming headset, and I was looking around for one that fit my price range.  This headset stood out to me as a cheap option (it was $99.99 on Amazon at the time), so I took a plunge.  It was pretty great for the first week I had it - I could walk around the house without dealing with wires, and still listen to music and converse with friends on voice chat.  The sound quality was pretty good, and most of all: it did not hurt to put them on with glasses!  These headphones were loose enough to feel comfortable and stay on my head.<br /><br />However, just a little under a week after my purchase, my left earmuff clearly started feeling looser.  A day later, a screw on the left side came loose and I could see a dangling wire.  Shortly after, I noticed that no sound was coming from my left ear.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon about the issue, and I assume this was just bad luck on my part.  They issued a quick replacement, but it seems that under normal usage (I was gentle with this set!), they still managed to break in about a week.  I'll revise my review if my next pair manage to hang on for longer.

B008G59IBI|5.0|This album really did it for me in a way the other two didn't so much. Perhaps it was because I was drunk. It at least helped with the lyric hangups (I didn't even bother following along with the lyrics booklet this time). \\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\" was strangely awesome to me. It was like the sprawling nonsense they released on American Idiot and 20th Century Breakdown, except they weren't making a failed attempt to be totally deep. I think it's my favorite song out of the three albums.<br /><br />This is a case where I would say quantity is appreciated over quality. I haven't really cared for much that Green Day has released in over a decade, yet this is the first band I ever loved and they've never stopped being able to construct good songs, so I'm thankful we suddenly got three albums worth of nice songs in three months, and damn pleased the last one is the best.<br /><br />And heck, I would even be glad to purchase that \\"Quatro!\\" album with the leftovers...

0345529057|5.0|great combination for the first four books in the series. love the paperback format and packaging.  great books if you enjoy the tv series
B004YM6JLO|5.0|GREAT!<br /><br />It was great. I got it safe and sound. The cover and the inner things were great. I loved it. Vampire diaries is one of the most favore and fasinating dramas I watched.<br />I live in Korea, but my some of my friends watch it,too.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Great book! I've never read a book this good. It took me straight into the adventure. I loved it - cover to cover. BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I've had this for a long while. Serves its purpose; however, it gets very smushed when you leave it on your umbrella stroller. Just a quick stretch and you can still use the drink slots. Good purchase.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I have four copies of this film and it remains one of my favorites of all time, but this package has so many extras that I seen, but not owned. I personally feel that this collection is worth every penny.
0553583182|2.0|I've given this book two stars because while I personally found it pretty useless, I'm sure others may benefit. Basically, I feel that if your familiar with the secret, the law of attraction, the power of prayer, and understand that your thoughts are important and should be spent thinking positive thoughts rather than negative ones, basic concepts, than like me, your probably wont find this book enlightening. In fact, I didn't find anything relevant until the last couple chapters of the entire book which also wasn't necessary to read. The subconscious mind is a very powerful and fascinating subject that should be studied and no doubt has a profound power to heal. However, for me, this book was not a resource I was hoping it would be.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Pretty predicatble but a lot of back and forth relationship issues between a college age girl and a 'bad boy.'  E
B0050SYS5A|1.0|POS!!!!!!!! kinect wont even recognize me. The kinect will move up and down and ask me top step in front of the screen.
B000002MK8|5.0|what can i say. LOVE HIM. but this was shipped quickly and packaged properly, starting to replace my cd's that are worn<br />out so i will be back
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Mandatory reading for everyone.  I wonder what a difference it would make if we all read this book every December 1st.
B004NYQYNQ|3.0|Well done, yet overrated.  Rolling in the Deep is a certified hit.  Too bad a majority of the album doesn't hold up as well.
B00797MB0O|4.0|The first 45 minutes of the movie the Mavis character gets redundant as the movie rubs her neurosis in your face so hard you begin to believe that Charlize Theron is not beautiful (this takes time to develop). The second half of the movie falls short of redeeming the protagonist but does make her human. Overall the film was enjoyable.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|I bought this to run an ESXI host on the cheap for some test virtual machines. It is currently running a 2012 server, 2008r2 file server, windows 7, and a pfsense box without any issues (granted they have low load as it is not a production box).
B009AMANBA|5.0|An education in American history and in modern filmmaking. I'm no expert in either of these areas but left the big screen venue feeling intellectually satisfied.<br /><br />I did detect some strange anachronisms, though, namely the overtly \\"feminist\\"(yet conspicuously prissy), Mary, and an unnecessary concluding scene with Tommy Lee Jones (yes, he should get an Oscar) and Mrs. Lincoln's the African-American assistant at 1600. I think Speilberg made his statement without any semi-patronizing confirmation of Thaddeus Stevens' motives and vision.<br /><br />I was most impressed when I learned that, yes, the problems continued after the Emancipation Proclamation and it took a mass of political battering rams to \\"codify\\" the new way of Life. An adjustment to the white guy/slave holder-written Constitution was needed. Lincoln was willing to risk impeachment over, not necessarily illegal, but \\"corrupt\\" maneuvers, to influence the other side.<br /><br />All actors do very well. However, the child \\"Todd\\", despite his battlefield play attire, and his childlike glorification of the monsterous conflict not far from his door, a tragedy which seemed to have no end, comes off just a little strange in his last scene (in public on April 14th): his reaction to the tragic announcement simply stretches credulity. [no spoiler here!].
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Not much point in having this installed since you can't see a majority of the News Feed. can't believe they released it like this. hopefully they get a fix done soon.
B006J420UE|5.0|completely satisfied with this product orders arrived the day stipulated ... agree with the request if this provider would advise
0765365278|3.0|I would have rated the book higher for being a well-written book, but the Publisher really messed up, so far I have 4 bookmarks so I could easily find the pages where they are, not where they needed to be. Author would have received a 5, Publisher a 1 so I split down the middle and gave a 3.
0062213423|2.0|i like th book but the binding broke the day after i got it and i am 13 and i wish i this book for a while but i dout it now
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is one of those books you can't put down till  you are done reading.  Captures your full attention from the very first page.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I cannot say enough good about this movie. I had missed it in the Theatre, and was upset. I HIGHLY recommend this stunningly filmed, and family friendly movie. I am so glad i caught it on Starz, and came to Amazon.com to purchase it in Blue ray/3d/dvd 4 pack combo. I would wish that every family would spend a couple hours watching this interesting, beautiful, addictive to watch film. I hope with all my heart they make a follow up to the movie.<br />I am sure many folks that missed it at the theatre, will appreciate it on film in their own home. Our new 3D television makes watching this in 3D, an added bonus. I appreciate the blue ray with commentary too. Draws your attention to what you may have missed the first time around. Makes a wonderful gift to give or receive. HIGHLY Recommend.AAA++++++
B005LAIGTG|5.0|Great decision i love this movie it is an awesome love story made me cry. Good movie! Movies was like new.

B00003CXAA|5.0|What a great trilogy full of adventure!  It is not geared to audiences younger than 18 years of age.  I suggest parental discretion.
6304806418|5.0|I just love this movie...the music and Antonio Banderas and Madonna!  Like the history to it as well.  Buy it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I give all movies 3 stars unless they are stellar.  You will enjoy watching this movie and it was worth the price paid.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I felt the movie was a bit boring and overly sci-fi. I wasn't drawn in to the characters rage or struggles because it just wasn't exciting or engaging enough.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|Its a five star CD because of the musicians that played on it and the music that came out of it. You have Herbie Hancock and Patrice Rushen among the keyboard players. You have Marcus Miller on bass. And don't forget the two headliners...Benson and Jarreau. You can't lose with a combination like that.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Jun Do lives a circumscribed life in North Korea.  As the orphan master's son, he was often more brutally treated than the other boys in his father's care.  When he escapes, he goes on to a series of naval exercises, ultimately becoming a master kidnapper.  And he does it well.  They sail into another country and kidnap the subject targeted in their orders.  Jun Do is an operative of the government until one day, an opera singer touches him in the midst of his operation.<br /><br />This is a book that touches deeply.  It has been a few weeks since I read it, and it still sticks in my mind.  As a devoted reader, this is a jewel of a characteristic.  I felt I could really come to an empathy for the claustrophobic reality of life in North Korea.  I came to empathize with this automaton, this brain washed man who performed the monstrous without compunction.  His entry into his own conscience is a masterful piece of writing.  The book is a masterful work into a reality unknown to me.  That is high praise indeed.
0143038095|4.0|very good condition and price is very fair<br />I would come back again and search for what<br />I prefer<br /><br />thanks
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son got this to read on his kindle from school. He loved this series of books. All three of these books are good for kids reading in an AR program.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|this is a well designed knife with the exception of the factory sheath. at first i was skeptical on the reviews that the sheath dulls the knife, when i opened the box the knife was sharp but not shaving sharp. its sharp enough to cut a a piece of paper, but after taking the knife in and out of the sheath for about 15x it won't even bite through the paper. the first modification that i did was i sent the knife to a professional knife sharpener to do a convex edge. i paid about $15 for the service and i have to say it was worth the money. after thumping and splitting wood it was still shaving sharp. as for the handle i think its really based on your preference whether you change your handles to micarta or not i suggest change the hardwares to stainless steel. DO NOT put nylon locking nuts because it will come loose when you really thump on it. i suggest to go to mcmaster.com and order the FLEX-TOP locknuts it will really hold your screws in place. and lastly about the factory sheath if you are planning to buy a kydex sheath that will be compatible to the ESEE 5's molle it will be a waste of money. thats $40 for the kydex sheath and $65 for the molle attachment plus S&H its already more that what you paid for the knife.so i bought the SPEC OPS BRAND COMBAT SHEATH \\"6 inch long. its pretty much the same concept but better. it has 1000 denier nylon which has a high abrasion resistance compare to ESEE's cheaply made nylon which i think only has 300-420 denier. all in all the total $$$ that i spent on the knife and the upgrades is roughly about $115. 50 bucks less that ESEE 5.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|I really like this movie because there are these heroes in it protecting the world behind the scenes.<br />I wish that we as a country could have all this good stuff going on in the background of our lives.

0547884591|5.0|4-Hour chef is an amazing book! I care a little about cooking so getting better at that has been great but the meta-learning sections are life changing! Ferriss is the guru for all those who want to advance beyond the standard life.
0345525558|5.0|Excellent story that deal with real life feelings.  It is a tender and heart wrenching story.  Beautiful. I would highly recomment this for anyone.
037571457X|5.0|The book and the film are both entertaining, touching reflections on the history of events that are usually presented to Americans in a simple black-and-white clash. The events of the 1979 Revolution, its aftermath, and the Iranian peoples attempts to live in this society are all extraordinarily complex, but I couldn't think of a better way for an average person to approach the subject than seen it through the eyes of a coming-of-age girl.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ALIQ5E6 From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa: A Crash Course in 2,000 Years of Middle East History]]
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Lindsay Lohan was fantastic in this movie, and Quaid and Richardson were excellent in supporting roles.  I enjoyed watching the bonus features showing some of the behind-the-scenes activities and &#34;how did they do that?&#34; explanations.  In my opinion this re-make was much better than the original with Haley Mills.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am not very good at playing games because I am legally blind, but Angry Birds is worth the extra effort I have to make to play it.  From someone who claims to HATE computer/video games, I like this one!  I must add that I am partial to Amazon.  I have NEVER received anywhere, the service, promptness, and the benefit of speaking with a real person when I must call Amazon (which has never been to place a complaint).  While their prices are usually the lowest, I would rather pay more to get a product from Amazon, because I know they stand behind all of their products and they have the best return policies offered by any company out there.  Even when it is not their product, but an item sold under their \\"umbrella\\", they make sure you receive the same service THEY offer.  You cannot go wrong buying from Amazon.  (My daughter is a liver transplant surgeon and does not have time to go to stores to shop. She buys all her gifts/items from coffee and cinnamon chips to my Kindles, online and only through Amazon or companies under the Amazon umbrella.)<br />Sue R.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Actually enjoyed Donald O'Connor's dancing more than Gene Kelley's.  Enjoyed seeing Debbie Reynolds in one of her earlier roles.  She held her own!  Good family entertainment.

0385535147|2.0|if you dont normally read Grisham you probably will enjoy this book but to me it seems like this one was cranked out by the Grisham factory in contrast I just listened to the latest Theodore Boone book and found that very captivating/enjoyable.<br />I got the unabridged audible version and the narrator was fine but I was very disappointed in the story.. I found it so predictable that I solved the mystery halfway through the book including plot twists. I wondered a couple times while going through this if I had read it already but it just came out??
0385528752|5.0|I'm in the community health portion of my coursework and this book provides excellent suggestions for not just a future nurse, but anybody who works with people, companies, etc. to enact change.
1419702238|5.0|I gave five stars because the process was fast and easy. I recieved them promptly and I had no issues at all.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Record came in box marked fragile and was in tact when I opened it. It shipped quicker than expected and was in original wrapper as well. I'm giving it as a meaningful gift, so I am happy with the shipping promptness and condition of the product. I definitely recommend this vinyl. It's a good buy, and well worth the cost.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|One of the best, I must say. Charles Dickens just blesses my heart. When I read a Christmas Carol, I was truly touched; anyone reading this story should grasp the concept that we all need to love one another: That includes sharing, helping, and just being kind. The best way of getting it over to the reader that as a person one should live so that a happy afterlife is ensured is the ghost voice of Marley, Scrooge's partner. Marley had lived as a tight grasping old man, just like Scrooge. He died, and Scrooge is the heir. Scrooge takes over, but he is NO BETTER than Marley. He is such a greedy, stingy person that even the dogs hate him! He has not friends--PERIOD. And then...one day...<br />On Christmas Eve, Scrooge's nephew drops in to invite him over for a Christmas dinner. In his usual manner, Scrooge dismisses the young man with his usual 'humbug' word.<br />That night, he is visited by Marley's ghost. Scrooge is not a scary man. He talks to Marley as if it is nothing, but inwardly he is a bit shaken. What really scares him is when he is told by Marley that he will be visited by the ghosts.<br />Marley is right.<br />First, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past. Then the Ghost of Christmast Present. And last...and scariest...of all, is the Ghost of Christmas Future. In a short while, he shows Scrooge what will happen to him if he does not change his way. And he shows Scrooge his own grave! Imagine being shown your own grave! In the end, Scrooge has a complete transformation. He is no longer stingy or greedy. I like to think that he devoted the rest of his life to helping others. Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but I sure do think that this little ghost-like story is one of the best!
B0002DKCMG|3.0|If you don't set your expectations high...this movie is just the ticket!  Entertaining, funny, juvenile, and insane, Eurotrip makes for a silly movie that will make you laugh at the outright inappropriateness rampant throughout the film.
B007DIQC90|4.0|The entire CD is good listening... from the upbeat \\"Mountain Sound\\" to the sensual \\"Slow & Steady\\". I would compare the music to Mumford and Sons but the female vocalist makes it unique. Would highly recommend to others
B004YM6JI2|5.0|It came faster than expected, and was cheaper than I had expected being the most recent season released.  Well worth the money imho.
0453005071|5.0|i am a huge stephen king fan. i have 52 of his books so far. i bought this book because i wanted the book Rage. it was so much cheaper to buy this book with 3 of his other works in it than to buy Rage by itself which is super expensive with it being out of print. happy i bought it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Thanks to the release of Prometheus, my interest in the Alien saga was reignited.  I have enjoyed watching the old films in this remastered format and for the price Amazon this for, the deal was too sweet to pass up.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|i love all the studio ghibli films. this one is a really great one about a pilot who turned in to a pig. i love michael keaton as the voice of porco. good movie.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|A few less dazzlers than I expected. RiRi is always entertaining, she's the new 'Prince', and besides that she's beautiful to look at.
B002LII6KA|5.0|i bought this for my mom for christmas because she LOVES the matrix. i havent given it to her yet (obviously) but i know that she will be super happy. its got all the footage a matrix fan could ask for in one set. pretty cool.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is just great I liv the mixture of little big plannet 2 and angry birds (minus the birds) you've done it again rovio good job
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. The action was great. There was also a little bit of comic relief. My only beef with it was that they didn't get Edward Norton to do The Hulk. There have been several different guys that played that past, and Norton was the best. I think I also liked the individual superheros films better than this one. Overall, this movie was a lot of fun. I think that any fan of The Avengers, or superhero movies in general will enjoy it too.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works as advertised. I use it with both Kindles and as a USB connector on my PC. Everybody should have an extra for travel and to use with car-chargers. Great!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great package. Everything you could want in one box and real good quality. I will be letting all my friends know about this.
0061992860|5.0|I have the large version and thought that is what I was ordering.  So it is my OWN fault!  Great book!  Will give to son for Christmas to use when he is backpacking and might get me a small one too
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|This is one of my very favorite scary movies, I just loved it and have watched it with my son and again with some friends, Recommend to get this DVD to any Horror Buff!!
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|I gave this to my son for his 24th BD. He was wowed by the idea it would work. The wand actually only works with some systems. He has a SMART tv and the wand will not work with it. It does work on his older tv/dvd combo. I am disappointed since they mainly use the SMART tv.
B009MO57H6|5.0|My very fave  heroine, Alice, She nails it again and always watch her movies several times over. Am so glad they made another Now hope for more of Alice!!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|amazingly addictive and hours of great fun creating new things ...money well spent. although it can be tricky at times it really makes you think hard
1442337966|5.0|This book goes beyond the knowledge one acquired in &#34;The Secret&#34; and helps to deepen the message Rhonda Byrne is trying to get across. I like the audio version, because this way I can listen to it while driving - whenever I need to remind myself to remain loving and positive.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was a movie I watched as a kid and its just as good as I remember and ot holds very god hidden meanings. I would say this is a good buy for anyone who like this type of film.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I bought it for a 12-year old boy that loves Lego and he's very happy with it. I like the features, like being able to adjust the rules or come up with own ideas, which has become rare in this day and time. It allows creativity not just with building during the game, but also to come up with additional ideas what else could be build - great for kids!
B009SSGBOE|5.0|New Fagen music should be greeted by mankind with all the fanfare of the return of a Holy Comet - not just because it is rare and beautiful, but because it is timeless in a way that defies human comprehension.  When you listen to this album, you step through a door in reality, not into the past, but into a special realm carved out by Fagen where time has no meaning, and each carefully shaped note hangs in the air like an eternal snowflake.  You can move through it over and over again, find new nuances perhaps, but it never grows older - only you do.  It's music that in the real world merely laughs at the process of entropy as it grinds down the mountains without dulling its edge in the slightest.  A recording like \\"Deacon Blues\\" sounds newer today than in any summer day of 1977, and somehow any recording on this album could sit beside it and easily claim to have been recorded the day before or a million years from now.  Perhaps you'd have to have lived the vast bulk of your life with Fagen's music as a recurring soundtrack to understand it, but nobody could possibly explain it.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I have been a fan of director Wes Anderson for many years. It's not the promise of a blockbuster and fat paychecks that lure big names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, and Bill Murray to star in his movies - it's his ability to so brilliantly portray the absurdity and wonderment of life, and more specifically in this film - childhood. Moonrise Kingdom is a work of art and quite simply beautiful to behold. It sucks you right in and you forget the world outside your screen. I dislike writing detailed reviews of movies because of spoilers but I will say that this is a fantastic film that audiences of all ages will adore!
1439152802|5.0|This is the second Kate Morton novel I've read, and I can state that she is wonderful at what she does:  recreating another age and another time and depicting families with all their complicated relationships.  \\"The Secret Keeper\\" is set in today's England and the England of the late 30s and early war years going back and forth to tell a story of a long hidden secret of a woman who is old and the daughter who wants to know the meaning of something she'd witnessed 50 years earlier.  It evoked for me the love between a mother and daughter and the grief along with remembered joy at losing that mother after a long life.  I highly recommend \\"The Secret Keepers\\" as well as \\"The House at Riverton.\\"
B00000GAMF|2.0|I really like this CD, have been a fan of Marillion for a long time. But EMI did a poor job on quality control when it came to the liner notes. The covers (front and back, and inside front and back) are correct, but the inside pages containing the lyrics or not for Brave, they are for Holidays in Eden. I thought this was a fluke.. but got a second one and it had the same problem.  Not sure ow wide spread this problem is, I have been unable to get an answer. So if not having the proper liner notes is not a problem get this one..if not having the proper liner notes is a problem beware when ordering. But get this if you are a Marillion fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was not too hard but challenging. It had an entertaining story line and only cost a few bucks.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I love this movie and so does my husband.  I bought this for him for Christmas.  The digital copy is awesome, we can watch via the tv, laptop, ipad or iphone.  It is great since we travel alot.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I could see myself in a cafe somewhere Europe listing to him and the band and enjoying every moment.  in He still has it!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Great movie- love the digital copy, makes it easy to watch when traveling.  Also you can view through Itunes or Flixster which is nice.  Gives you choices of what device to watch it on and depending on internet access can make it easy to view on trips.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites, I can watch it again & again. Was 12 years old when Secretariat won the Triple Crown  and not really tuned in to horse racing. Great movie and I love the horse they chose to play Secretariat
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great family movie, especially for mothers and duaghters who may not always see eye to eye.  Great moral and love the idea of strong mother-daughter theme and not having to rely on 'prince charming'.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is not only a great album, but also a great buy! Plus the digital book is awesome. I would recommend buying this album for all the little monsters out there!

B002MO05YI|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones does another great acting job in this movie.  I read the book some years back and I thought the movie did an outstanding job of  delivering the story to the screen.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Bought for a gift and my husband loves this movie.  It is great that gives you an option of digital copy so you can watch it on ipad or computer when traveling.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I saw this movie at a theater and liked it so well I decided to purchase it as a gift for a friend.  It is a funny, heart-warming tale which I highly recommend.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of the Christmas Carol.  The digital copy is awesome- allows us to watch it through Itunes and our iphone, ipad, or laptop.  This is great since we travel and don't always have access to internet to stream our movies.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and purchased it as a gift for a friend.  It is funny, a little suspenseful, and thought provoking.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate this movie.
0307887960|4.0|I got this book for friend and he's very pleased - trying to get everyone to practice the diet.  Key word: trying!!!
B008O2T3O0|5.0|A very well sung Rigoletto though I wasn't throughly thrilled with the staging. Somewhat mimialist back alley. Still prefer the Pavarotti filmed version. I believe this is an Opera that lends itself to be filmed as a movie. However that being said, for the $8.99 price I was able to get thru Amazon, it's a 5 star bargin.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|amazing movie. I really enjoyed it. Has some crazy twists in it for sure. If you love action and a deep story line then this movie is for you.
B007SGM084|5.0|At first, I thought that this was a porno book...but as I read further, it was a beautifully written explicit love book.<br />I had to finish all three books as quickly as I could.<br />I hope to read more from this author.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|It is the best to listen to music of the Beatles with an LP.It was good to purchase.It is the LP which you should buy.
B003QUPQUA|5.0|A great book if you have difficulty finding opportunities to listen to Japanese conversations.<br />The format of the practice exam is EXACTLY the same as the JLPT.<br />To be honest, I found the level of difficulty from this book to be harder than the actual N3 test.<br />I will definitely purchase the N2 level Practice Problems next.
B002EB439W|5.0|I saw the movie and enjoyed it.  So I purchased this so I can view it as often as I like.
B000WGYMAQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals. Being able to see it on blu ray was great. The songs sure do stick with you and I love the extra features and the back ground story on how Rent came to be.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I'm a Loreena McKennitt fan of many years.  Another beautifully put together album from her.  And another awesome addition to my collection.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I love Angry Birds and I thought this app would be fun but the ads got in the way. Every 10 seconds or so an ad would play. It got so annoying that I deleted the app. So disappointing.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|As everyone has noticed, MX plays for 20 seconds and then stops. No crashing just stopping. Email us when ready. Thanks
B002SSUQFG|5.0|As my title says, the self winding feature was the major reason in my book, for getting this watch. I've always admired Seiko's innovative approach, but I thought they were out of my price range until I found them on Amazon. I'm amazed that for around 65 bucks I can get this kind of quality. The watch and the band have a genuinely quality feel to them. I have had the watch for a few weeks and worn it everyday since it arrived (I even sleep with it on) and I can't find one negative thing to say about it. I did have to look online to find out how to set the date and day (the stem has two positions, two &#34;clicks&#34; outward, if you will. That was easy enough, but I didn't realize that winding backwards while in the &#34;date&#34; position was the way to move the &#34;day&#34;) Anyway, I really want to buy another of these in green (I vacillated between the black theme and the green. Black won out because it goes with more of my wardrobe). Hopefully, when I can afford to, they will still be available. Bottom line: Love it!
B0034G4OUO|1.0|good actor but the rest are poor actors  and poor director poor writer should of been better blah blah blah
B006YXTRHY|5.0|On a wet day in the Pacific Northwest it's nice to have the ability to &#34;go to the movies&#34; and never leave the comfort of your home.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A Good fit with the series. Got the 3D but no TV yet, It will be the first one watched!
B0045XICB2|5.0|On a wet day in the Pacific Northwest it's nice to have the ability to &#34;go to the movies&#34; and never leave the comfort of your home.
B0095R64AO|5.0|I had low expectations when I started this movie, due to the low ratings it was receiving, but after watching it, I have to say it exceeded expectations! 4 of 5 stars, which is a good movie! Worth watching at least once! Good overall performances by all the actors, you'll love the characters and the story right away. I found myself laughing throughout the movie, this movie is better than a lot of comedies of today that have a drab love storyline of fall in love, problem arises, then the characters make things better. The story line in this movie is great and I found myself relating to a lot of the happenings and actual things couples go through if you ever have been in a relationship. I highly recommend, give it a shot, you'll be surprised that you actually enjoyed this one!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the last book to this trilogy. I always love a happily ever after. The characters were very inritiguing especially Christian.  I like how the author shows how Anastasia was able to change Christian.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|After 3 great albums by The Killers, I was actually expecting them not to live up to their past, boy was I wrong, this may be their best album yet! Such a diverse group of songs, I love it! 80's influence, and also they get back to their roots a little bit too. I feel they continue to mature and are comfortable in their sound, which isn't a bad thing, cause they combine their music with such great lyrics, you can't resist!  I can't find a song I don't like on this album. I recommend the extended album with the 3 extra songs, cause \\"Prize Fighter\\" is a GREAT song also, you don't want to miss out on a great Killers Song!
B0020M99LC|5.0|I have seen this before but a friend hadn't so we ordered it to watch before going to see Skyfall. Worked well streaming through a laptop.
0345529057|5.0|Not since I was a kid first seeing the very first Star Wars movie have I ever felt like a universe was opened up to me. This series of books is beyond words, the kind of books I will be reading and re-reading because they are that good.<br /><br />The story and characters are fantastic.<br /><br />Thank you for opening up another universe in which I can loose my self, immersing in the rich pages of these books.
B005USZML4|4.0|My 10 year old son was reading this so I figured I would give it a try. Found it to be a good read would definitely recommend.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I like to watch MI series; worth watching this one too. love Dubai scene and India scene. some part of Indian scene is not real though....
0446580848|1.0|I've read and enjoyed all of DeMille's previous work but I found this book very hard to finish. Hope this isn't a sign of things to come..
0756666937|5.0|This is a great book for those Lego lovers in your life! All three of my children love Legos and I bet we have thousands of dollars worth of Legos in our home! But for Christmas this year, I wanted to get a big tub of Legos to encourage my kids to create and make up their own inventions, instead of the usual sets that you can buy that come with directions. In order to promote my kids creating on their own, I purchased this book to give them ideas. It is a huge book, hardcover with tons and tons of pages of colored images and ideas!! This is most definitely worth the money!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am an avid reader & love sampling various authors. Because of the reasonable price on this book, I sampled it & just finished reading it. WOW!! I rarely read a book that I just simply cannot put down. Sleep usually gets to me first. But I really could not sleep until I finished this powerful book. I was up VERY late last nite & it was worth it. A geat love story but so much more. A great psychological thriller as well. The issues were deep & powerful & I will now search for more stories by Jodi Picoult. Thanks Amazon!!
1607066017|4.0|Writing cosmic stories must be incredibly difficult.  On the one hand, it seems a nearly impossible challenge to execute a storyline that doesn't borrow from Star Wars, Star Trek, John Carter of Mars, etcetera.  On the other hand, if an author does somehow deliver an original plot, the characters must also seem familiar yet different.  We don't expect space characters to sound like us, to look like us, or to talk like us, yet if they stray too far into that for which we cannot connect, they lose our engagement.<br /><br />Brian K. Vaughan certainly had his work cut out for him with the first volume of Saga.<br /><br />The storyline is tried and true: two soldiers from opposing sides fall in love, have a baby, and must now escape the wrath of their respective armies.<br /><br />As a huge Vaughan fan, I couldn't wait to read Saga.  After hitting the jackpot and winning a free copy on GoodReads.com, I devoured the book the day it arrived.<br /><br />My feelings about this first volume are mixed.<br /><br />As with Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina, Vaughan has given us some charismatic, interesting characters.  Marko, Alana, baby Hazel, as well as various bounty hunters, ghosts, and television-headed royals, create a cast for whom I want to know more.  There is plenty of conflict, both external and internal, and the interpersonal relationships are rife with both passion and hatred.<br /><br />But here's where Vaughan loses me a little: this is a story that, for the most part, is full of very human characters that happen to be ... well ... not human.  They love to use the \\"f\\" word, they take God's name in vain a lot, and they apparently rode school buses.  Now, if this were on Earth, I wouldn't be as distracted by it, but why in the world do \\"aliens\\" know the \\"f\\" word?  How are they familiar enough with \\"God\\" to take His name in vain?  And school buses?  Really?<br /><br />And though I'm far from a prude, there's a lot of nudity and sex in this thing.  Vaughan has always pushed the boundaries within this medium, and, for the most part, I've always found him to put the story first and remain tasteful.  In this case, though, I get the feeling some of it is just for shock value.  There were times when I wasn't quite sure how the overall story was being served by some of the things on the page.  I<br /><br />So that's what bothered me a bit about Saga.<br /><br />However, make no mistake, it's a fast, entertaining read, and the characters are extremely layered and charismatic.  Vaughan has several plots going, and I don't doubt for a minute that Saga will soon be epic in nature.  Furthermore, Fiona Staples is extremely talented and her artwork is both beautiful and horrific.  Her particular style suits this story well.  Her humanoids are organic and plausible while her monsters maintain an air of biological credibility.  And, if you're familiar with my reviews, you know a good colorist always gets my praise, and Staples is yet another example of an artist that deserves our commendations.  Her colors are muted, but they are still so pleasing to the eye, and when she does give us some bright colors, watch out!  She doesn't miss the opportunity to make those vibrant colors count.<br /><br />All in all, Brian K. Vaughan seems to be an author who works best when his fantasy is rooted on Earth within the here and now, but I cannot fault the man for trying something new and putting himself out there.  Any artist who leaves his comfort zone will always have my respect.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not sure I'll stick with Saga.  For one, the sex and nudity were so graphic I wasn't comfortable having it sit out on my nightstand with my little ones running around.  Secondly, the very trendy human dialogue just proved too distracting.  But, I admittedly want to know what becomes of Marko, Alana, and Hazel, so maybe I will stay onboard after all.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Andropiaushed the boundaries within this medium, and, for the most part, I've always found him to put the story first and remain tasteful.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|I purchased this because I am a fan of Joss Whedon, as well as Nathon Fillion. I'm also quite familiar with Neil Patrick Harris through his many works, from Doogie Houser(?) MD forward. After watching this; however, I'm a bit confused as to where the hundreds of five-star reviews are coming from. There wasn't anything particularly bad about this, it had its moments for sure, but there's nothing particularly great or groundbreaking either. Like pretty much everything, it's not for everybody, so if you're interested in anything this has to offer do, yourself a favor and try to find clips or the whole thing for free somewhere first before purchase.<br /><br />The characters were well thought out, I think I actually liked all of them for the most part, but for me the only piece that stood out with the storyline was that it was told through song; an interesting format to be sure. The hero/villain role reversal was nicely done as well, but could've used more depth IMHO.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr. and the second does not disappoint. This movie with the evil Moriarity is a bit darker in tone than the first movie but still had it's lighter moments.
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie is great.You would like it to i'am sure.If anyone has seen taken two that one was not as good.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I still love this movie over the sequels. I think the kids in the movie are great and there is a great chemistry between all the actors. Just be warned that this movie may be too scary fo young children to watch.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book is an amazing love story. If you love the notebook you will love the lucky one! Nicholas sparks is truly a great author!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was confused when I started reading the book. I realized that it was being narrated by 2 people and then it made sense. I really did expect more. The book is a great read, it just wasn't what I expected. I would have liked to see more towards the end. I do recommend it to others who like to read suspense.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|This was a good production of an old classic, but I wouldn't show it to young kids as it was rather scary.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I am so happy to have a new Aerosmith album, after 11 years of waiting.  They have been my favorite band since 1988.  That was 5th grade for me.  I am not disappointed with this record.  There are tracks that remind me of every Aerosmith era.  There are tracks that take you back to the 70s, and obvious attempts to have another hit single.  I am tired of reading reviews where people complain that Aerosmith does not sound like they did in the 70s.  Of course they don't.  Why would or should they?  They have evolved.  If they had not, they would never have survived.  Please give up guys.  You are not going to get another Rocks or Toys.  If you ask me, their best effort was Pump; an album they did not record in the 70s.  It was the first record they did sober, it won their first Grammy, and it is their only studio album to contain multiple top 10 hits.  Music From Another Dimension is masterful in a number of ways.  It loses points however, in that it is not so cohesive.  I would have made this into a double album: a disc for the older sounding songs and a disc for the newer sounding ones.  I just hope they can squeeze out another record before Steven Tyler turns 70.  Aerosmith still has it!  I hope they get the hit they are looking for.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This series is comic genius! I could watch every episode over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I was so excited when I discovered Mumford & Sons had a new cd out. I loved their first cd and this one is awesome too. I'm not very good at describing music but it seems like this cd is different from their first, not bad, just different. If you liked their first cd then you'll like this one too, for it's own achievement.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time I play it so much my high score is 156456 I
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Small easy to carry and does the job. Don't expect surgical results but will liven up a dull blade. and is compact and portable.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I've been a fan of the Alien the series, and I love barrowing my sister's Alien Quadriligy, but I always wanted my own. I've seen all four movies several times on standard, but nothing compares to the crisp sound and the beautiful picture of the blu-ray versions
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Outstanding, I have yet to finish the book, reading 4 at the same time.  However on what I have read, it is a must read for every couple no matter how long you have been married.  I wish I had read it 13 years ago.  It is never too late to love you spouse MORE!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I was a nerd/geek/dork before it was &#34;cool&#34; to be so. I was one of the only girls my age to have comic books and play superheros with the boys in my neighborhood. I progressed to fantastically nerdy/kitschy stuff like &#34;Buffy&#34; and &#34;Angel&#34; in high school and college. So finding out that A) There was a massive superhero movie that was B) Directed by Joss Whedon... this, my friends, is the equivalent of Nerd Nirvana. Fans of Joss will easily be able to pick up on lines that were clearly penned by him (&#34;He's adopted.&#34; is just one example). I am so thrilled that all of the actors have signed on for the sequel, AND that Joss will be directing that as well.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition) was a perfect choice to replace the old one my daughter has. The old disc is damaged & can not be played anymore, so I bought this one to replace the old one. She loves the series & watches them over & over again.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|perfect. love this movie and anyone who hasn't seen it should order it... packaging was fine, quality of movie was perfect. thanks!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Jack Reacher's character in the book is well thought out and portrayed.  He is an amazing soldier with physical abilities that wer fun to read in the novel when he takes on the bad guys.
B00936A0RU|4.0|I decided to purchase this dvd because it was based on a true story.  I also wanted to see how the role of Shia Labeouf would play out, from playing the role in The Transformers.  He did good.  It was a long movie, but it had a good plot.  The togetherness of the brothers sticking with each other and not going with the corrupted bad guys.  I would recommend it to purchase.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Product arrived a day earlier than I thought it would.<br /><br />This game is fantastic. It requires some cognitive thought as you try to block your oponent and keep from getting boxed in. I think this is a great game for people who are great with spatial concepts and mechanical thinking.<br /><br />I definitely reccomend this!
B005LAIIPS|4.0|It started out slow but as the movie continued it got better.  I don't feel that it was as good as the other &#34;Bourne&#34; sequels, but it will do.  I feel that it would have been better if Matt Daman was in this one.  After all, I think he was the one who made the movie.  All in all, this sequel was good.
B008CP93S0|4.0|I like it! I really don't have anything else to say. I still need to write more words, what a pain!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I truly enjoyed &#34;The Expendables 2&#34;.  It started with action at the beginning and throughout the movie. It keep you focus and never boring.  The actors made it great to enjoy.  If you like alot of action, this is the movie to buy.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This is a must have if you love pinball and want to play on your Android. The free version gives you three great machines...the Wild West one is probably the best. The ads show up right on the scoreboard, which is a little annoying, but come on people...it's a free game and a good one. The graphics and physics are great and the sound is superb. Aging myself but this takes me back to 1978 when pinball was king and Space Invaders changed gaming forever. So far, it's the best pinball game I've found for Android. Don't tilt!  :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|Nice photo and scene selection. This puzzle game is challenging on any level.  It exceeded my expectations! Better yet, it's  free!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It's always nice to do a little extra with Photos. Worked great and so much fun. I think I will take a close up snapshot of my cat Itzee and maybe draw a birthday hat on her and save it in my album. Thank you.  *****
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This has come to be a very handy tool.I like how you can look back in the history thanks for the free app.
B008OOYALE|1.0|i wish i could get to all these complaints but unfortunately it crashes every 10 seconds and thats just a little more tedious than i can stand. so unfortunately ill never know the frustrations others have mentioned... i don't think it's compatible with the droid x2
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Could not wait to get Van Morrison's new CD. If you love him you will not be let down. If you are new to his music I would say wait and buy some of his older work and then this CD. It arrived on time and well worth the price.
1432794426|5.0|Thank you Dr. Moriarty for writing 'Defending a King, his life & legacy'!<br />I bought your book a year ago and although I already knew the bigger picture there were still lots of things I didn't know, especially the stories that Michael's bodyguards shared with you ... Some of them were very painful to read but there were also sweet little stories that put a smile on my face. Your book is a true confirmation of what a beautiful man Michael really was. It's a must read for everybody who wants to know the truth.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I think I knew I would love this album as soon as I bought it. I love anything Taylor Swift does and this album was no exception. I think some of my favorite songs have to be 22, I Knew You Were Trouble, Red, and Begin Again. If you are a die hard Taylor Swift fan you will more than likely love this album as well.
0761163808|5.0|This book is amazing.  The images appear very real. I purchased this for my son but my older brother enjoys it more than him.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|This is a great thriller with high suspense.  I never suspected the ending and I am usually very good figuring them out.  Very well written an acted by both Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan.  Cudos.  I highly recommend.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|A soothing, wonderful holiday album that's quite elegant, if that makes sense. The classics are recognizable but different enough so that they sound nearly newly written. It'll take you back to reminiscing about Everything But The Girl...That wonderful early stuff. Buy it....
0803729227|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and think it perfet for young children.  The rhyming is delightful, the art is super and it demonstrates how helping one another can be a good practice.  This is a really good book in every aspect.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I rated this book four stars because I enjoyed the style the author choose between funny chapters and the serious chapters. I personally knew a family who the children were put into a Catholic orphanage in the late 40s here in the states. They told horror stories of their mistreatment, understand more thanks to this book. Very sad.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I enjoy this movie time and time again.  I appreciate the references to old Hollywood and Eli Wallach is delightful.  It is romantic,<br />amusing and heart warming.  I recommend this movie.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|love this app so much I have it both for ipad and now kindle I am so happy that they added curling iron's and other fun things but. this app is worth .99 cents
0230749356|4.0|The art is super and the story is written wonderfully well.  There is one part which may be a little scary for young children. Other thann that, I highly recommend this book; it is a lot of fun.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|[...]<br />This is the second in the Night Huntress story and once I started it I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Four years after leaving Bones, Cat is working for an elite branch of the government hunting down vampires.  She has grown into a powerful woman, who doesn't take crap from anyone.  She is using the skills that Bones taught her to capture or kill vampires.  The department that she works for uses the information that she gathers to learn more about this race.  I love how well these characters have developed since the first book.  When Bones walks back into her life, Cat realizes that she can't live without him and everything else is secondary.<br /><br />How will her team take the news that she has a vampire lover?  Not as well as you would think. :)  Throw in an assassin that is hunting down Cat and a jealous team member and Cat has her hands full.<br /><br />I never thought I would be able to get into Urban Fantasy and I will be the first one to admit that I was wrong.  Check out these books and dive into a world full of passion with two characters that explode from the page!
1405093056|4.0|The art is delightful and is written wonderfully well.  There is one part which may scare young children. Other than that, it is delightul and creative.
B007MJKOY4|2.0|not a very good movie. just as dry and boring as you'd imagine british spys to be. : ) .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've had this book in my cue for months just not ready to dive into something so heavy just yet. I will go ahead and say that I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.<br /><br />John Green made it so easy to connect with all of his characters. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are now my two favorites and I don't think I will ever forget about them. It was ridiculous how much I fell in love with these two. Hazel was especially funny even when she wasn't trying to be. Augustus was all kinds of sexy; the kid is well beyond his years.<br /><br />I honestly knew I was going to love this book a couple of pages in. I laughed at the awesomeness that was Hazel Grace, Isaac and Augustus. I also cried for about 4 chapters straight (probably more). At the end I wanted to get all Hazel Grace and contact John Green with some questions I felt like he needed to answer :).<br /><br />Overall GREAT book that I will no doubt have to read again. The Fault in Our Stars is top 3 for me for sure.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|better than the bumper protectors I've been using. A bit more substantial, but still small enough to slide in and out of my pocket. Read up on warnings and these types collecting dirt underneath, so I'll clean it occasionally.
0761169253|5.0|Well written, easy to read and understand book on unleashing your creativity by borrowing from everywhere around you.  Recommended for teenagers to mid career professionals.  Great gift idea since this is not the normal book that I read.
B000UBJYII|5.0|I like it, Ilike Ray Charles and his friends.<br />I cannot explain more. It is art.<br />so if you like Ray Charles, buy it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was intrigued by this book from the first page!  It was hard to put down - and the photos added so much!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Great album except for a couple songs.  I mostly bought them cuz I really wanted to support the group. Awesome!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book and thought that it was very entertaining.  I thought it was going to be a little longer, but I guess I just read it quickly.  Overall it was a nice book.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book. Great plot and suspense. I stayed up too late many nights because I couldn't put it down :)
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She is their number ONE fan. So she wanted this to add to her collection of Rage music. She kept reminding me that this was being released Nov. 27th so I had to be sure to get it for her before it sold out. She was absolutely thrilled!
B008F9E306|4.0|I had to put how I feel about this album in one sentence, it would be this:  Trouble Man is a hard hitting album that doesn't let up, and because of that it might be worth buying just a few tracks instead of the whole album.<br /><br />I grew up loving rap artists like, Dre, Tupac, C-Lo, Ice-Cube and like current artists like Lupe Fiasco, Common and Atmosphere.  One thing I liked about TI's previous work was that his music was like a combination of good modern southern rap and old school 90's hip hop.<br /><br /> After listening to the first song on this album I was pretty excited, as \\"The Introduction\\" is a great hard hitting song with A LOT of soul.  It's actually probably my favorite song on the album.  It encompasses TI's troubles and issues in the past few years and how he has worked through them and come out on the other side.  I love how it talks about Rap history as well as his history in the game.<br /><br />TI is quoted on Wikipedia as saying that this album is \\"harder\\" then most other stuff coming out right now.  He is right, and as he also says it is a creative album, but when listened to all the way through the melodies are quite similar,  the bass rumbles in a similar fashion, and his rapping starts to sound monotone, especially when compared to his other albums.  My two favorites are \\"Paper Trail\\" and  \\"Urban Legend.\\"  Both of those albums have great tracks on them, like \\"Motivation,\\" \\"Chillin With my B&T*H, \\"I'm Illy,\\" \\"Get Loose\\" and \\"Live Your Life.\\"  I don't believe there is a hit on this album that will find the success that \\"Live your life\\" did as there's nothing that gets me tapping my feet on this as do many of the tracks on his other albums.<br /><br />I will say that the tracks I find the best on \\"Trouble Man\\" are in his collaborations with other artists.  TI has always made great songs when paired with other artists.  Although there is nothing as good as his work with Rihanna and Timberlake, there are some nice tracks that feature his work with other artists:<br />\\"G Season\\" Featuring Meek Mill is a great track with some bounce to it, a great droning bass in the background and just makes me wanna jump around.<br /><br />\\"Wildside\\" featuring A$AP Rocky might be my least favorite collaboration on the album.  The catchphrase about \\"smokin' weed\\" just isn't that catchy and the song drones on the whole time.<br />\\"Ball\\" featuring Lil Wayne has a catchy beat to it and really well mixed but Lil Wayne and TI sound very similar to each other.  The song is saved by some nice variation in the bridge/chorus sections and really nice mixing.<br /><br />\\"Hello\\" with Cee-Lo Green is my favorite collaboration on this album.  Cee-Lo's singing really fits the song and, meshes amazingly well with TI's work.  The juxtaposition between the verse's and the chorus with Cee-lo is awesome!  If you're going to buy one track on this album I'd say it'd be between this and \\"The Introduction.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wonderful Life\\" Featuring Akon is my second favorite collaboration here.  This song is right up there with the track between TI and Cee-lo and it really reminds me of some of the early Wu-Tang clan work.  The song also has a great message as he talks about raising his kids up to be adults.  I like that TI has taken on the part of being a role model for others after his trials and tribulations, and this comes through strongly in this song.<br /><br />\\"Can you learn\\" featuring R Kelly, A nice track, but disappointed me a little bit compared to the other collaborations on the album.  It's a song of redemption for TI as R Kelly asks \\"Could you learn to love a troubled man.\\"  For some reason the chorus and verses don't gel with each other particularly well here.  I'd give this track a pass if you're going song for song.<br /><br />\\"Sorry\\" featuring Andre 3000, A hard hitting track that gets very droning and boring after a minute.  The chorus and verse aren't varied and the rhymes come in a very monotone manner.  Pass.<br /><br />\\"Gunsand Roses\\" featuring Pink, This track works well.  Pink brings a great style to the chorus and it blends greatly with TI's style.  This one really \\"rocks\\" in its own way and is well worth a listen.  It's probably the \\"softest\\" song on the album and is really the biggest variance from the rest of the albums \\"hard\\" manner.  It's really a breath of fresh air.  It reminds me a lot of Lupe Fiasco's early work.  Which is a good thing.<br /><br />The other songs on this album are mostly very hard hitting and maybe not necessarily bad, but it's just not my thing.  I tend to like hip hop that has more variance between the verse and chorus that provides some subtlety for the listener and TI by himself largely doesn't do that besides \\"The Introduction.\\"<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between buying the whole album or just a few tracks, I would go through the Collaborative efforts on this and see how many of them you like.  There are a lot of tracks here, and it may as well be worth getting the whole album for ten bucks then buying seven or eight tracks, but if you listen to the snippets and only connect with four or five as I think many people will, then you'll save some dough.<br /><br />Overall a nice effort by TI.  In interviews lately he seems to have taken on a mature role in the rap community, as a role model and mentor and it comes through on this album, which is great.  There are a few gems here, but if listening to the album all the way through there's not always enough variance for me.  Recommended if you're willing to go through the album and wittle down a playlist of your favorite tracks.and Roses\\" featuring Pink, This track works well.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|I love this book!! Illustrations just make it that much more fun!! We should all take a look at ourselves like Mr. Scroog was forced to!!
B0049VZ222|4.0|Love the Walking Dead series. I often miss it when it comes out on Sunday nights and buy the Amazon Instant Video version on Mondays so I can watch it ASAP! The instant video interface is easy to use online, on my TV, video streamer or XBOX.
B00280LYIC|5.0|A page turning adventure about a boy who's father is Greek mythologies very own god of the sea Poseidon. People of any age will thoroughly enjoy this book.
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|My kids wanted to watch the original Jurassic Park and for some reason we didn't have it in our collection. Based on the other prices on the Internet for the movie, I couldn't pass up this one, especially when it comes with a digital copy for use on portable devices! Even though the listing specifically mentions that the movie comes with a digital copy - either a separate disc or an insert with a code for the digital download...well, it doesn't come with either!  Not a deal breaker, just wanted to provide a little expectation management for future buyers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- just like I remember it<br />- excellent video quality<br /><br />CONS:<br />- audio seems a little low
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great to have all the episodes in one place! This series should have continued, but then having good tv just can't be allowed...
B004HO6I4M|3.0|of all the computer animated movies out there...this one is my least favorite.  it's ok - it has some funny moments - young children will enjoy it...adults might want to find other things to do while the kids are watching it...it's not bad but it's not great either...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've been trying to download  video to my android but it never worked with other products it would start then say it failed,but with tubemate i can download fast and great quality. I recommend to everybody.
B004EPZ034|5.0|who knew - my mom LOVES the chipmunks!!  (how cute is that?)  i bought her all three movies for mother's day this year and she was thrilled!  my dad joined me and mom for a chipmunks marathon - and we giggled for hours!!  these movies are fun for any age - and having grown up watching the original...i have to say - i love the new movies even more!!  as a kid - i found the chipmunks annoying and wasn't a real big fan...until now!  if you have kids and don't have the new chipmunks in your dvd collection - you're missing out on the adorable fun!!  :D
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a very interesting book. I had no idea what to expect and found it initially confusing but fascinating.I loved the way it all came together in the end. It is thought provoking especially about the influence of corporations on society. The characters are very interesting and the plots have lots of twists and surprises.It is an interesting blend of historical fiction and science fiction.I recommend it and now want to see the movie
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|it's a cute movie.  there are plenty of other computer animated movies i like a lot better - but this one has its moments!  chris rock as the mosquito...OH MY GOSH!!  HILARIOUS!!!!  he cracks me up anyway - he's fantastic in this movie!!!  would i run out and buy it tomorrow?  (i actually own the dvd...)  nah...it's one of those that if you collect animated movies - you should add it...but only at a decent price (i paid around 10 bux for mine - wish i had only paid 5...oh well...)  - again - it's a good movie...worth watching once...
0316228532|1.0|A small view of the lives of some very pitiful people.  Generally a boring book.  I do not recommend this read.
1419701533|5.0|I bought the series for my 9 y/o daughter who wanted these books.  She hates reading but she read one and didn't put it down.  I received the ones I ordered and also got two free books.  Two books had writing on them and stickers on the cover.  I don't care that they are used as long as my daughter gets involved in reading more.
B00003CXCT|1.0|i accidentally bought the star wars special edition, it was a huge dissapointment. i was actually on the side of jabba the hutt(by showing a scene with him offering han solo a last chance to make things between them better,but he's just a dirty lier,& thinks that because he's lukes friend he's freed of his obligations)the dialogue from the snow creature made no sence as it sounded like the tantan was getting slaughtered ,but it kept panning back to show the abombidable snow monkey eating it in episode 5, the emperor was unviewed until episode 6 before,but now he's seen in full view on episode 5 when vader calls him from his destroyer(before he was a mysterious person pulling strings from behind screen,but no facials until episodes 3,or 6, the band in jabbas palace just sucked anyway (didn't deserve the music spotlight),& finally the entire galaxy rejoices when the empire falls,but they couldn't help the rebels before at all. the only things improved on the special edition were the battle scenes(space,& land),& the view from the snowspeeders on hoth were transparent when looking out at the land below before. i agree with south park that george lucas should not screw with a success (he shoulda just left the story alone,but made the action scenes better) if you discover a way for me to e-mail this to george lucas every star wars fan would be grateful(the special edition almost makes me embarrassed to be a fan)the scar of the special edition'll always be there but it would be less significant if an edition with better fight scenes,& nonethreal snowspeaders only(the story left alone).the story(terrible),& the action scenes(awsome) are equal to episodes 1-3.after watching all 3 of the family guy,& robot chicken star wars commentary,& behind the scenes i've come to the conclusion that everyone just pussed out,& told lucas what he wanted to hear. it looks like I have no choice,but to watch star trek(blasphemy) for a halfway enjoyable space opera. now that disney owns lucasarts (for the small fee of 4.05 billion)maybe the quest for the almighty dollar is over,in the form of SE bastardizations(however unlikely). maybe lucas selling out to disney was a good thing.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a little adventure. Possibly the best book I have ever read.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|It was in good condition and timely. I liked the quality of the picture and there were no glitches in the movie.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro!!<br />The presentation of the box is amazing. Inside there are a few photos about the characters.
B00023BLXK|4.0|It was in good condition and timely. I liked the quality of the picture and there were no glitches in the movie.
B004SIP7US|5.0|A very good film by Martin Scorsese! One of the best directors! Great actors in a good story about America roots.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Fantastic show! Incredible acting and writing. The story line will keep you on the edge of your seat. there is nothing else on television like it.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Quik ship! Great movie!! This movie is in my top 5 favs! Good price for BluRay too! Can't wait to do more shopping.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|&#34;The Expendables 2&#34; (2012) delivers efficient comic-book heroics with self-deprecating flair — easily surpassing its dull predecessor. Sly and the Family Retro reunite for an action-filled summit meeting that benefits from a tighter script and Simon West's assured direction. Jean-Claude Van Damme makes a worthy Stallone adversary. Though scheduling conflicts prevented Jet Li from delivering more kicks, another star-filled sequel is in the works.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|I like to play this game with a group of friends while having a few cocktails. The premise of the game is similar to Apples to Apples or Balderdash, someone is &#34;it&#34; and they have a card that everyone is playing off of. This game has a large variety of photo cards that people play off. Its very unique and can be very entertaining as well. I would buy this again and recommend it ot others.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I bought this microphone as an upgrade to to the internal microphone on my Nikon d5100.<br /><br />Upon receiving, the first thing I did was test it with the camera (which has 3 built-in gain levels) as well as directly plugged into my computer. My conclusion? While the sound quality was significantly better than the camera's onboard mic, there just wasn't enough gain and even though the mic is powered by a battery, it still sounded too quiet for my liking.<br /><br />Additionally, I found the long cord (20 feet) added a hint of line noise to the recorded track; so even though my voice was clearer, there was a hint of white noise if you listen carefully.<br /><br />I should also note that the clip for the mic is fairly large -- almost bobby pin-sized -- and not one that you'd want to use for applications where the mic needs to be as discreet as possible.<br /><br />My suggestion would be that if you're on a tight budget and need a long cord for your application, this might be an acceptable solution. For me, it just wasn't acceptable. I'm going with a $50 handmade mic from Giant Squid Audio Labs and a cheap external recorder if I'm more than a couple feet from the camera.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|It got here very swiftly, but I am still trying to learn how to use it. I don't have four more words
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the game.  G5 is always a good time.  Its just the right difficulty.  I can play the whole game in two relaxed evenings.
B00914JWSW|5.0|On the basis of of one tune, track number five, &#34;I Think It's Going To Rain Today&#34; is one of those songs that transposes the listener to the lyrical context of the tune in accordance with the melody.<br /><br />No better rendition in the wild exists than early Neil Diamond. No person sings it better: Nobody.<br /><br />Diamond was young and hungry when the album Stones (that contains the track I am delving into here),  was released and very, very talented: singing the sublime drama of the content of the tune extracellularly.<br /><br />A very rare instance where chills vibrate the marrow of the bones. The guttural, low lamentation of Diamond's version stands the test of time: a classic.<br /><br />Having stated that, Barbra Streisand's rendition (track five) is very good. It is a clean vibrant rendition of classic Streisand clarity. Her voice portrays a youthful quality and the expressed lyrical intonation is strong and charming; however, the impact doesn't achieve what Diamond's version does.<br /><br />Now, for the detestation. Both of these performers have tremendous egos (I'm not sayin' it's necessarily bad), the point I want to make is that in this tune, the craft of Streisand stands the test of time. Her voice carries this tune with depth and clarity (I do sense a lack of passion); whereas Diamond's ego won't allow him to fold and rest / savor his remarkable journey. His voice is faltering. . . .<br /><br />You might ask why I compared the two in the first place, why bring Diamond into the fold. . . .<br /><br />It's the tune, &#34;I Think It's Going To Rain Today&#34;. The emotive power of the tune [perhaps I've lost you--the reader.] The point I am fumbling with is that the tune, by its nature, has such a powerful presence and these two singers chose to deliver their interpretations onto their respective albums. I chose to meld the simile because of the emotive power of the song.<br /><br />By the way the song was composed by Randy Newman.<br /><br />Streisand's version compelled me to recall; revive the memories of times past. This is what music does and cause fumbled recitations as I devolve.hat music does and cause fumbled recitations as I devolve.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Great CD - refreshing new music and talent to boot from this young man.  He should go a long way.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I would find it hard to imagine many folks who have not had this title etched in their minds.  If you have somehow missed this landmark, you owe it to yourself to experience it.  If this is familiar territory, then YOU owe it to yourself to buy this deluxe package to get the DVD features that accompany the album.  I have a renewed respect for this masterwork, and I have a new endearment to know more about the creation and the craftsmen behind it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it's does the job I need it too keeps my serated Kershaw nice and sharp.<br />Light weight, fit's on my key ring, love it.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Whoa!  Clint has performed a modern masterwork with this piece.  I was enthralled to witness his character development on this journey through modern prejudice ~ through tolerance ~ to celebration of humanity. Clear your calendar and your head trash and some heart space to navigate the territory that Clint redefines here.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Season 2 is even better than Season 1! Great story lines, twists and turns! I couldnt wait to see the next one, going thru 3-4 episodes at a time. This series is my go to when my DirecTv is out or I just want a lazy weekend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was downloaded for my son onto his tablet and it worked well with the very low quality tablet. I'm sure it would be better on a better quality computer too.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love the Veronica Mars series, so sad that it ended after only 3 seasons.<br />Veronica is whitty, sarcastic, smart, and fun. Every episode has its own mystery along with the season long mystery. I enjoyed them all! Great acting, great writing, not sure what went wrong to end it!
B0033807C2|5.0|This book was truly amazing! I had a rollercoaster of emotions reading it, but in a good way. All the characters were so great and I'm so glad i got to read it!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Great show if you like action and dont mind watching your favorite charactors get killed off! Very few people are safe on this show!
B0033807E0|5.0|I have fallen in love with this series and am so glad that I get to follow it. Rick Riordan has inspired me (because I want to be an author) and You should read this too! (oh and I LOVE MRS O'LEARY!)
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was pretty surprised at how good this movie was. I hope they keep making more of these. This movie was a lot better than say Resident Evil, or the last Mission Impossible. You can tell that some serious love went into making this and it wasn't just a lame attempt on milking the Halo fans out of their money.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Hey! The CD is awesome, great tunes.<br />But when i opened the package, the cd wasn't secure, it was tossed around, the top of the case was cracked, not a big deal, the album still worked perfectly.<br />Just could've been packaged better.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Thought it would be a light comedy with a fuzzy bear.  Turned out to be an unbelievable story and romp of raunch, dope smoking, and beer guzzling which I can watch with a couple of college age idiot buddies, I wouldn't have liked them though especially a loser 30 year old and a stuffed bear. I turned it off digusted and have no plans to finish it, what a waste of time.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am a Mac user who constantly edits video so I need a really precise mouse. This mouse was so easy to install, I plugged it in and BAM! it worked. Unfortunately since I have a Mac I cannot install the drivers and edit the additional buttons and colors, etc. but it makes the perfect mouse for everyday use as well as professional use. I am not a huge gamer, so it is a mouse for everyone. For the price you cannot do better.

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I remember several years ago when I was in American Literature, one of our assignments was to read the first chapter of this book. I'm not a reader, however, when I started reading this I couldn't stop and I came in the next day with my homework and the next few week's homework assignments done as well. I love this book mainly due to the fact that it balances out Drama while also telling you a bit of history of the Great Depression while also making it easy to read, unlike &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; which in my opinion is very difficult for me to read.

B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I will say it took me a little while to get use to using this app....there really aren't a lot of instructions for using it. After playing with it for a few hours (yes it does take a few hours) you can really see the many uses of it. I decorate for Christmas as a job and I have found his app to be a wonderful tool to use as an idea book. Since I have the older version of the kindle I had to upload photos to \\"decorate rooms\\" on the app but I'm sure using the latest kindle would make this app even better to have.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|It is a very good movie. We enjoyed it and would recommend it to everyone who would enjoy a family movie.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|There are so many excellent reviews on this release that all i really need to say is \\"What are you waiting for?  Buy it! \\". At the price it is now, this set is a steal. Don't pass it up.

B008F9E306|5.0|Tip gives the perfect balance of music on this album. I feel as if he gives us a little something from every album he has made so far with some new sounding songs also. Perfect blend of music great beats greater lyrics. T.I. DELIVERS BIG TIME on this album!
B000I8G5NA|3.0|A good movie, but not nearly as good as the first. Like that they brought Kay back as he's the better lead.
1558908846|5.0|A wonderful, quotable movie with an original story line.  The big robot and the desert people are a jolly good time.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|The old Disney movies are the best. I love this movie, it's one of my favorites & I hope my son enjoys it too when he's a bit older.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|Gary Clark Jr. is a triple threat. He's an exceptional lyricist, great guitar player, and a very good singer. I really like this Texas rock album although I am magnetized to The Life every time I listen. Overall, this album is great, very well put together and very professionally made. Get the deluxe version, the ending song culminates it all and is very beautiful. Overall, Gary Clark Jr. has created something very special and this is definitely in my top 5 albums for 2012.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|DVD set was priced well and good quality.  Enjoy the show and would recommend it to others.  Can barely tell it was used
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the game it's really fun. I just wish they would. Let you just play<br />without asking you to buy stuff
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Great show!  I look forward to buying the next seasons as well!  Discs in good condition and priced very fairly.

0670026182|5.0|Followed the blog for ages and was so happy when word came out of the cookbook.<br /><br />Absolutely love it. Have made several recipes so far and all were great.<br /><br />Katie has managed to make this a great collection of recipes as well as a great coffee table book because of the fantastic photography.  Highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing.<br /><br />I look forward to the next one!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book was awesome and I highly recommend you to buy it<br /><br /> Awesome Book and I think u should buy it
B0079J28NW|5.0|I like this DVD, it is very colorful and plays nicely in the blu-ray format. If you like the Beatles this is something to have in the collection as it is a little bit more on the goofy side of them and really show cases their depth. I would recommend this DVD.
1400069289|2.0|I'm at a loss to explain all of the positive reviews for this book.  To me, the author seemed to cover the concept in a superficial way and filled in with narratives from sports, business and AA, most of which did not really interest me.  While reading the section on Tony Dungy, I kept wondering what methods all of the teams he was losing to were using?  The examples and anecdotes seemed dumbed down and over-simplified.  The entire book read like an extended Sunday supplement article and probably could have been shortened to about that length without losing much.  If you looking for information that will be of direct benefit to you in breaking bad habits or starting new good habits, I think you will be disappointed in this book as well.  It's an interesting topic - there are probably better books out there.
0345803507|4.0|Not particularly well-written, but a great read for entertainment purposes! Just what I needed at the end of a long work week.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love the book. I was so worried about the ending but turns out great. So glad I have been able to read this.
B0042816YK|5.0|A movie that I will watch many times...which is why I bought it!  Many 'jewels' of thoughts of life, challenges, and goals are spread throughout the movie.  I get something a little different each time I watch it.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is a great movie series.  It came on time.  It was a Christmas gift for my daughter last year. We are very pleased.
B007NZDES0|5.0|This DVD met ALL my expectations. It's great!! I will be back. It was sent and arrived in a timely way.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the sample and the sample does not do anything for the rest of the story.<br />It is in my opinion poorly writing, but the story is pretty crazy!<br />I deffently has the moments that take you off gaurd and those other moments! (lol)<br />Nice read.
1601251505|5.0|I began playing Dungeons & Dragons back in the 80s and whiled away much of my teen and college years enthralled with the game.<br /><br />My kids are starting to get to the age when I fell in love with the game.  We had a rainy weekend a while back and I decided I'd try to introduce them to roleplaying.<br /><br />Kids play make believe and roll dice?  Go figure it was a huge success, so I decided to look into the modern day rules and start a campaign with the family.<br /><br />I took about a 20 year break from the game and never really read any of the rules after the original AD&D.  I started looking at 4th addition D&D rules and was hugely disappointed.<br /><br />The 4th edition classes seem to have lost all sense of balance.  Each class is far too powerful even from first level.  There really seemed to be nothing for your character to strive for.  The rules and game just didn't feel right at all.<br /><br />I stumbled on Pathfinder purely by accident while reading other peoples reviews of 4th edition D&D.  I was a little surprised to find that there were lots of D&D fans that felt the same way I did about the most recent D&D rule set.<br /><br />The Pathfinder interpretation of the game feels right.  It is a good adaptation of the original game.  To an old timer like me \\"skills\\" and \\"feats\\" are new.  I realize this was probably added in \\"3.5\\" which I never had any exposure to.  But I like these new game mechanics.  The progression of the character classes seems solid.  Although I haven't done any serious play with the rules, the class balance seems well done.  Frankly even better than the original game.<br /><br />I have a campaign sketched out in my head that I'll be running the family through over the next six months or so.  I will be running it on the Pathfinder rules.  Having only really played one roleplaying game in my life ( D&D ) and having loved that game passionately, I had a real hurdle to get across in abandoning the D&D rules.  But the Pathfinder rules are more true to what I remember.<br /><br />Big thanks to the folks at Paizo publishing for keeping the tradition alive!ules are more true to what I remember.<br /><br />Big thanks to the folks at Paizo publishing for keeping the tradition alive!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I've read all 3 books twice  because I loved them so much. I was glad that I caught on to the hype of the books in the beginning so I could encourage others to jump on the band wagon.<br /><br />I liked this book. While it was not my favorite I loved how the story ended. Ana got her happy ending with her fifty shades of f@$&ed up ;)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Didn't see that coming! Very different from the other novels! I loved the development of the characters and the story. I would definitely read this again
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two is my favorite book of the trilogy. I loved  the story line in this book and  I enjoy the connection the  characters have. I feel that as a reader, I was able to get to know  more about not only Ana and Christian but the supporting characters as well. I would recommend the trilogy to others but also tell them book two is the best.
B005SS2QXS|3.0|Not really happy with it. Catches dust fast and as soon as something on it, your phone will look like a 10 year old phone. I cleans up all the time. It does protect your phone. Nice protection on the corners. My kids drops my phone all the time and this case keeps it undamaged.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was my favorite of the two so far. I love the twist an  only saw small parts of it coming. I really was surprised by the twist. It was wonderful and I can't wait to see how the tail of Eva and Gideon ends.
B009JBZH54|1.0|It happens to me too!! I bought this for my husband as Christmas gift. Before I buy, I checked the reviews and saw some people received missing disc box set. I joked to my husband that not sure if we would be that \\"lucky\\" to get this. And turn out we are!!<br /><br />We received this yesterday and the box set has two Dark Knight Rises special features discs. No movie!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is well worth the heavy eyes from lack of sleep and red swollen eyes from the tears. It makes you want to scream for good and bad reasons. Nothing about the book is bad but bad reason  in the book make you want to scream. There is a happy ending somewhat and the second it just as intense. PLEASE READ!!!
0156027321|5.0|Delightful and thought provoking book for all ages.  The reality of the natural food chain is a bit difficult to abide, but truthful nevertheless.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book it was intense and while some aspects might be hard to believe or even criticized, I was able to let my mind wander and embrace all that is Ana and Christian. I won't lie there were parts I found unrealistic but that's the  idea of romance novels and erotica, to believe and fall into the unimaginable.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I saw this when it first came out and then went ahead and bought it when it went on sale. Love it! Absolutely hysterical!
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm a Fifty Shades girl and I think this topped it. I loved the book and the story line. There were some similarities to Fifty Shades but I found  myself intrigued by what was happening and what was going to happen
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The action was minimal. The story line dragged, and dragged, and dragged on. The 3D effects were so-so at best.<br />So if I can rate it a half a star just because I would.
0891419063|5.0|Creeping real war story that you start reading and you can not stop until you end the book... BV so far, with good reference support that goes beyond personal telling.
B004OUZKM0|5.0|I totally enjoyed this Christmas time favorite in 2D, but in 3D it was absolutely a magical, fun fantasy to wrap yourself around on a cold, snowy night with a cup of your favorite hot chocolate with your children. Fantastical!!!
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|this was more then i though its cool and very happy at how fast it came. would for sure buy more
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Deceptively easy at the lower levels yet difficult enough to be challenging.<br /><br />I play on a kindle and the whole family has become addicted to the game.  I can see buying more puzzles at when the free portion is completed.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Love this app.  Use it daily as I'm usually on the go.  Love the PDF reader that comes with it too!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle's voice is exquisite she sings with such feeling.  Even the rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow which is different than the one we're used to is great.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I love this app.  I use it daily, as I'm usually on the run.  Love that it also has a PDF reader.
0765342294|3.0|It was only OK as a story. Interesting premise, though.<br /><br />The book was new - I forget where I heard that this was a great book - I wouldn't have been unhappy if I had forgotten to buy the book.
B0083DJWGO|1.0|The concept of things increasing in value with small probabilities is well-known. Words used for this concept include: good luck, lottery tickets, a home run, teenie (a low-delta option), eureka moment, ten-bagger (a stock that can increase in value ten-fold).  Having good luck, winning lottery tickets, is great, but  how to achieve this is not straightforward, and certainly not simply by being long lots of them.<br /><br />Lots of investments offer large returns with low downside, why penny stocks and long option positions  have lower-than-average returns (and distressed assets are not better-than-average), as lazy investors chase instant riches. Contra Taleb, it is not the quantifiability of lottery tickets or the fact that they have a maximum payoff, that makes them bad investments: things with lottery-ticket type qualities with uncertain parameters such as internet business opportunities are generally a fraud with a poor expected return, and things like IPOs, or analyst disagreement (which have more of what Keynes and Knight called 'uncertainty'), are intuitively riskier and have lower-than-average.<br /><br />He doesn't identify key attributes of attractive antifragile opportunities, just implies they are the ones that unlike options and lottery tickets, work well. In fact, he's anti-theory, so one supposedly finds them by random sampling (aka 'trial and error'). That's a strategy statistically proven to underperform, catering to the biases most investors have, why both day trading bucket shops thrive and  low volatility investing works. As a self-help book it's like someone saying you should eat more sugar, a strategy many will find highly convenient.<br /><br />The book is really a big spread argument that it's good to be long gamma, bad to be short it. Gamma is the essence of an option, why there's 'time decay' or theta, a predictable expense that anticipates the payoff times the probability. Whether or not this theta is adequate for the gamma is whether anoption is priced fairly or not, and generally people pay too much for gamma, why historically the VIX has been about 1% higher than the SP500's actual volatility, and this implied volatility bias has been even higher in the tails. Being long options (positive gamma), especially out-of-the-money options, has been a losing strategy.<br /><br />One key to understanding Taleb is the Freudian concept of projection: he applies his greatest faults to others. For example, he defines the \\"Joseph Stiglitz problem\\" as cherry-picking his prior statements to claim they predicted something when they did not,  referring to Stiglitz's ill-fated Fannie-Mae prediction and subsequent recollection of calling the 2008 financial crisis in a later book. Yet Taleb himself did the same thing, as he criticized Fannie Mae for not understanding the embedded interest-rate option in their mortgage portfolio, but then claims he accurately predicted Fannie's failure. Prepayment risk is very different than collateral risk, and Taleb mentioned nothing about collateral risk prior to 2007, and instead alluded to the prepayment option problem. It's like a guy who says corn prices might increase because of  risk from floods, and when a collapse in the dollar causes it's price to rise, states, 'I told you so.' Hindsight bias, name dropping, hypocrisy, and pretentious mathematics are Taleb signatures he sees everywhere in others.<br /><br />Another key to understanding Taleb is that he has a French post-modern style, writing to impress rather than explain. He provides hundreds of loosely related anecdotes, reminding me of the Talmud quote that 'when a debater's point is not impressive, he brings forth many arguments.'  One can find a lot of Taleb to agree with, but only because he says so many inconsistent things.<br /><br />Then there are the many confused or dubious assertions.  For example, how can one be sure that Black Swans are both impossible to quantify and highly rewarding? Isn't that untestable?Isn't Popper one of his favorite philosophers? Do most economists and risk managers really not understand that the function of an expected value is not the same as the expected value of a function?  His absurd equation for fragility has a couple of subjective parameters that would make them impossible to compare one strategy or portfolio to another, and equations with unknown parameters are like bad haikus, or rather, very helpful if you want to impress the mathematically challenged.<br /><br />Taleb often suggests it is good to be long volatility, things that gain from greater uncertainty  (see his YouTube on this here). As the VXX has shown, while this has nice covariance properties with the stock market (going up in 2008), it has a horrible long run return. I bet many of the unfortunate investors who have ridden the VXX to zero over its existence have a copy of The Black Swan on their bookshelf (and you can extrapolate it backwards, and even if it started in 2006 it would be a loser).  The 'long vega' bias simply isn't a good one unless you qualify it more concretely.<br /><br />He notes there's a sweet spot for most medicines, and that some exercise is good for you, not in spite of its stresses, but because of them.  But if the key to benefiting from the 'right' amount of medication is dosage, how does one find this dosage? Trial and error? That's how most animals learn, but it's pretty inefficient in general, I certainly don't want my kids figuring out most of their life lessons that way, because it's very time consuming and costly. Surely, a 'moderate amount' of trial and error is essential in everything, so one is left with nothing.<br /><br />He still thinks Portfolio Theory, and most Economic Nobel Prize winning research, is predicated on distributions with fixed parameters. It isn't. Further, as much as he hates the Nobel prize in economics, he doesn't hesitate to put its imprimatur on the back blurb of his book (a recommendation from Danny Kahneman--Nobel Prize Winning Economist it notes prominently).<br /><br />As per correlations being stochastic and so uninformative, he is wrong again: they are highly predictable, as high beta portfolios formed using past data create portfolios with higher future betas. The same is true for low volatility investing. They aren't perfectly predictable, nothing is, but that's really a straw man argument.<br /><br />A good amount of gamma or convexity, like having just the right amount of medication or specialization, is a good thing. Yet the right amount can be positive, negative, or zero, in various contexts. Many good things have negative gamma, such as the strategy of being nice to strangers: it has great downside, such as when you naively interact with an aggressive stranger, yet being nice is a good default strategy. Then there are things with no gamma, such as brushing your teeth everyday or simply being polite, which generally doesn't have a lot of effect either way in your life any time you do it, but over time is quite salubrious. Noting gamma per se, especially large gamma, doesn't tell you if something is good or bad, rather, just that it could be really good or really bad.<br /><br />You can price gamma and it's not free, so the question is always whether this price is too high or too low. How do you price things that respond hydra-like to having its head cut off? He doesn't talk about how to identify undervalued opportunities, and instead encourages people to keep doing what they've always done, waste money on poorly researched lottery tickets (oops, Black Swans).
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game has so much to do and graphics are awesome. Buy it now! If you like MMO's you will love this.
B001BW02B8|5.0|This is one of my favorite maroon 5 albums. I think that this is really the last album before they went really big - still has a lot of heart and soul to it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The music on this CD is very cool. It's the way I remember it back in the 70's. I just got out of the military and rocked all through this time frame.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Bought this because I purchased a 2012 Macbook Air. I had an old 13 inch MacBook Pro charger that I am now using for a backup charger. I am glad apple priced it at a reasonable price - $10 and not the typical $30+ that they usually do for any adapter.
B00006AW2G|5.0|&#34;Let it Bleed&#34; is the album I remember the most. It played at every party I attended during the 70's. I love the music on it. And I listen to it at least once a day.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|it works great, I have used bus powered drives with it too...<br /><br />Just sad that it costs so much considering it used to be on most all Macs.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is great.  You have to prtotect a base from baloons.  Greay strategy skills are required.  The old bloons games were good but now there are new towers and upgrades.  Well worth it!!!<br />PS it works perfectly on the kindle fire
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very happy with the last book! A real page turner! Hope I can find something as good as this series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it is spool amazing! Pinterest is ofcourse a great thing but to make an app out of it is even better! words cant describe how much I love this app!(:
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Excellent game. The only game I play at least once a day for over a month now. Yes, I have unlocked all levels and I STILL play the game.<br /><br />Excellent movement on the back-flipping guy... always a challenge.<br /><br />I would avoid anything higher than 'easy' level, too difficult and have to press buttons way too fast - which ruins the graceful beauty of the flip. To increase your difficulty, stay on easy and add a second style of flip to the routine and then try double/triple flips for very high scoring.<br /><br />Terrific game...
B009ZE27US|4.0|its a funny thing I tested it with my sister and said she was 48 lol. That's not even close.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Worked well. Charged my iPhone 4S and iPad 2  2x's each on a full charge.  Used it for a month while traveling. Love it.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I know that the Frank Miller Graphic Novel didn't do as well as people might have liked, but it does have a strong following. And as evidenced by other fans of the original work this film was a strong adaptation of it.<br /><br />One thing that it misses is the internal monologue that usually follows a Batman Graphic Novel or the comics, but to say that being missing is a deal killer is rather strange. No other Batman video offering that I have seen gives you that internal monologue. That includes the Nolen films, the Animated Series, the Animated Series movies, and the various shows and films that he was a character in.<br /><br />So saying that this being missing kills the movie is strange since it's rare to see it outside of print. It's like complaining that this grapefruit tree sucks because it doesn't grow oranges when no other grapefruit tree has ever grown an orange.<br /><br />But back to the movie itself. While it's strange to hear a Batman voiced by someone other than Kevin Conroy, Peter Weller still does a wonderful job of being the gritty voice behind the mask. You really can believe that this is Bruce Wayne many years along from the days of his prime.<br /><br />The film moves along with the same speed as the Graphic Novel and doesn't bore us with any slow points. It takes a little while to build up but once it gets its head of steam, it doesn't stop.<br /><br />I honestly can hardly wait for the second part to come out and I hope that they're planning to do the sequel work of Miller \\"The Dark Knight Returns Again\\"
B009NQKPUW|3.0|There was way too much going on, and not much portrayal as far as the characters as to who they were, etc.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Great production, a bit less high energy from 1st album, lacks Joe B's input and voice, Hughes is great, but too much so on this release.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|g5 has really been upping their game with better graphics and storylines....much more like alawar's quality. really enjoyed this one!
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|Dice rolls heavily favor computer, to the point of the artificial player getting rolls like double 5s 2 or 3 times in a row. The graphics, game controls and flow of the game are great, and for 2 real players it would be a good version to play but 1-player vs. the computer is a waste of time. The &quot;difficulty&quot; of the game is controlled by manipulated, unfair dice rolls,  such as excessive doubles, rather than any attempt at AI. Waste of money.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter loves the new 'girlie' legos.  This project was fun to build, colorful and had all those amazing touches (flowers, etc) that set Lego Friends apart!  So glad she has her 'own' legos now!
B0058A119G|4.0|Anyone who knows me knows that Barbra is GOD!  But I thought this CD was flat.  It didn't give me chills or moments of grandeur.  I listened and just said, &#34;Eh, she's done better.&#34;  I gave it four stars because the music of the Bergman's is quite brilliant and I appreciated Barbra bringing their music contribution into the spotlight.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are numerous features with this Bible app on the Kindle Fire. I have been using the ESV Bible and reading through the Bible this year. I have about 10 more days to go. One feature I especially like is that I can listen to the Bible also. The reader reads with expression. It has been very enjoyable to use this app.
B009FB3WQ4|3.0|Ok.  Pretty good performances.  Well, Stevie at the end with &#34;People&#34;....ah.....I don't think so.  Definitely not the best song for him.  The surprise of the evening was Faith Hill singing &#34;Send in the Clowns&#34;.  What a knockout performance.  Barbra's two songs were excellent, as always.  But if she won an award, or if there was an award, why wasn't she presented with it....or introduced before she sang....or SOMETHING???  She just ended up being just another singer instead of taking a bow for her achievement in receiving the tribute.  I felt cheated.
B007YH3DV0|1.0|I bought these books on December 4th and it says it won't get here until Beginning of January. Nothing should take more than 2 weeks.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I love Susan's voice.  It goes right through me.  But what is up with the versions of the songs chosen.  Plus, the orchestrations didn't seem to fit the songs.  To top it off, it's not just stage music, but movie music, too. The orchestrations did not fit her voice or enhance it in any way.  In fact, the orchestrations, at times, made her sound bad and overpowered her.  But I still love you, Susan.
1419705849|5.0|The ordering process was easy.  The order arrived on time and I received updates along the book's journey.  My son loved the book.  All is good!
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Not much of anything to brag about. My expectation was that this movie would be as good if not better than the first three.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|This program on my my first gen fire produces a sound pause or gap in noise as it plays what appears to be a sound loop. Imagine trying to sleep to white noise and every 15 seconds there is a pause in the sound. It drives me crazy and until this flaw (which I see also appears on the hd fire) is fixed, I do not recommend buying this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Forget the movies just read the books. The characters really start to take shape but you have to get the last book to really find a conclusion.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|i liked this as it was a mystery game with clues, the only frustration was that it kept leading me around, from place to place, back and forth to the many different areas, eg, the church, lake, woods, village.<br />Apart from that I enjoyed the experience but thank goodness there was a free hint button which I used a lot.
B005LAIISA|5.0|WE GOT THE  DVD ON TIME AND PACKAGE WAS VERY NEAT AND SECURE. CAN'T HARDLY WAIT TO WATCH THIS DVD.
1423140605|5.0|This book is absolutly amazing!!!! Rick is such a talented writer and he never fails to impress me!!! I loved this book, as I have with all of his creations and I was instatly captivated, by the \\" eyes glued to the page\\" kinda plot and how it all makes sense and the story flows so well. I really hope that there is a next story in the series as there is a great cliffhanger in the end which I hope will be answered shortly:) Im not going to spoil anything in the book for those of you who have not yet started however I do urge that you get the book underway ASAP. Its a story you cannot afford to miss. After scouring the internet to see if there was in fact another book in the series I discovered that I had missed one out; The lost hero. I was slightly dissapointed that I had missed one out however I didnt seem to matter much as the story flowed rather well. I do advise that you read all of the books however because who would want to miss aother great adventure:)Well thats my reveiw done. Hope that you all have a great time reading this fantastic book, I did!!!!!!!!
0525953728|5.0|Forget about politics because that has nothing to do with this being a great book.  Use to be you could get the facts from the news, not the whole story all the time but at least some reliable facts.  Not today and that's why it is nice to see book like this one on the market.  Getting the perspective of this Navy Seal goes a long way to understanding what actually went down.  Every person that I've talked to has enjoyed this book and it didn't matter their politics.  I know I enjoyed it.

0451450523|4.0|Beagle's mastery and clear love of language is enough to make this worth your time. The prose in this book reminds me of Jordan (The Chicago Bull) at his peak--an artist for whom the game has slowed down and everything seemingly comes with an enviable ease. I understand that the book did not, in fact, come easily to Beagle, but in reading it I imagined a writer having the words gathering to him in a flourish, as one wonderful sentence moves into another. The trajectory of the story brings to my mind Homer's Odessey and Shaw's The Black Girl in Search of God. The reader happily suspends disbelief and witnesses an unequivocal hero interact with people and places along a journey of self-discovery and transformation. If I were an underlining type of reader, my copy would be laden with ink, but I read in bed more often than not, under the dim light of my iphone, so my copy is bare. A shame, because I'd love to share a few of the lyrical gems I marveled at as I read the book in this review. What I can relate is that the book is an enjoyable wandering through a landscape both playful and heavy, and that The Last Unicorn is absolutely worth reading.

B009O07NBQ|5.0|Truely an equal to the original. It completely meets all my expectations. I love the tie of completely new scores with old favourites that relate to characters that also appear in The Lord Of The Rings. Already this soundtrack is one of my favourites of all time. Highly recommend this to all fans of good music scores and of course all The Hobbit and LOTR fans.

B007RRFUHM|4.0|A few of the songs are top notch.  Like most first albums, the filler does not live up to the excitement of the cream of the crop.  Love her voice!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I got this CD for one of my roommates and she loved it! We've listened to it countless times and we have not been disappointed!
B004HX4RT6|3.0|This game is fun and works as advertised premium versions are better animated and offer a better game experience but you get what you pay for.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A must read for anyone who loves mystery novels.  This is the 1st book I've read by this author.  Will definitely read more from Gilian Flynn.
B009GESJH2|5.0|i am a huge kid rock fan. he covers all generes of music...all of which show how much talent he really has.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie was definitely worth watching. The 3D wasn't exceptional with this movie, but it was fun to watch. I always get the blu ray/dvd combo pack, especially when it's the same price as the single packs.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Such a fun, cute, and addictive game. Full of adventures! Makes me want to own all of the adorable movies. Great
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had only ever seen this on dvd on a 720p tv. Watching on blu ray on a 1080p tv is like watching it for the first time all over again. The picture is amazing, the 3D is definitely noticeable.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Powerful drama.  Storytelling at its best.  And I don't like ANY kind of fighting or violence.  The family dynamics and the healing that takes place is so profound.  Highly recommend this.
B005IQZB14|5.0|For anyone who has a love of hiking, especially, I highly recommend this book.  It will have you laughing, crying, and amazed at all that the author overcame.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book that I have ever read in my whole life. It is so repetetive, the caracters are so plain, the dialogs are so poor, the structure is just unbeliavable. She flushes, se rolls eyes, she has an orgasm just by being looked at. A waiste of time and money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|well organized and responsive interface. good custom options for a free app. highly reccommend fo the on the go solitaire players.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I took my 6-year old to see this movie in the theater.  She was a little scared during the movie.  She loves Merida and wanted the movie, even though she is almost 7 now, the scenes with the bad bear still scare her a bit.  The movie is rated PG rather than the typical G, so just something to keep in mind for younger ones!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love being able to write myself a reminder, make a grocery list, save a picture and a arrival link all with the same app. It's taken the place of four of my former favorites.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love every bit of the book. Can't wait to read more. Christian grey is the most interesting character. I would highly recommend reading this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great hide and find also mini games great graphics too worth the price to purchase full game for the full effect
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I still am mesmerized by the voice she has. Who'd have thought this unassuming plain, shy woman would be belting out songs as she does? Love her. I've been a fan since the first time I heard her.

B009MFHFP2|4.0|I did not immediately warm to this album but additional listenings has shown its beauty and humanity. Pure Ben Harper.
B002WTOXUK|4.0|We noticed that our cable TV's ratiing system gave this movie four<br />stars, which is pretty unusual, so we watched it.  Not sure we've ever<br />watched a South African movie before.  It was nominated for four<br />Oscars.  It's extremely violent -- anybody who has problems with<br />repeated and gory violence shouldn't attempt this.  It's well-acted<br />with moderately good production values for this kind of aliens movie<br />-- definitely not Spielberg, but not Dr Who, either.  It uses the way<br />humans treat a group of stranded aliens as a metaphor for racism and<br />bigotry among humanity, and shows one man, who has been sent in to<br />prepare the aliens to be moved to an even more basic camp than their<br />current slum, coming to see them as fellow beings as he suffers<br />through horrible 'adventures'.  I loved the gripping documentary style.  We couldn't stop watching despite the horrific violence.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I learned, on a much smaller scale, that working in a downsizing company is not much fun.  But this is a larger story best summed up by the discussion between Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons near the end.  Are they just part of an imperfect system or do they have a moral responsibility beyond just letting everyone look out for themselves.  The one gap in the movie is that the eventual innocent victims of their actions are not visible.  The ones who throughout this country and other countries lose their jobs, homes, retirement savings etc.  A condition that we are still trying to recover from.<br /><br />This is a very well written script, well paced for a \\"corporate\\" story.  Kevin Spacey was never better and the rest of the cast was also strong.
1451695187|3.0|By the time I finished this book, I was convinced that two people had written it. For all his knowledge and expertise, Eben Alexander could not dummy down the neuroscience side of this book, but then at the same time, he could not come up with plausible names for the experiences that he encountered.<br /><br />Using terms like Core and Gateway are acceptable, but when we get to Realm of the Earthworm's - Eye View, Om (his name for God) and Spinning Melody, I was a bit convinced that I was reading something that was just being made up as he went.<br /><br />Being in conflict between his educational background and the perceived reality of his near death experience (NDE), Dr. Eben Alexander takes the reader on an adventure from the first day that he did not feeling well, to waking from a coma seven days later.<br /><br />There is no question that Dr. Alexander was admitted to the hospital with an e. Coli meningitis type of infection, but what happens during the seven day coma is what has me scratching my head. A man that has an extreme command of medical terms, conditions and science, who goes into medical school depth when trying to convince the reader that he does truly know what he is talking about, but when describing the ether world he comes across sounding more like a twelve year old watching Star Trek or Disney's Fantasia.<br /><br />Calling himself a C & E'er (Christmas and Easter Church attendance) when it comes to his religious experience, Eben Alexander had no preconceived concepts of near death experiences. Being in the neurological field, he has heard stories but had always discounted them. Now, he is apparently living one and as he tries to come to terms with his education and his personal experience - the reader is taken on a fantastical journey (that was an exaggeration) where he tries to explain cumbersome limitations of a body and earth.<br /><br />What I think was most disappointment for me with this book was the very end, where this whole book was leading up to a giant advertisement for a non-profit publicly supported charity lead by Dr. Alexander. Really? This was solely a moneymaker for your \\"charity\\". Dang - I have been duped! \\"No kidding\\", some of you will say, but I guess I was holding out hope that maybe, just maybe, there was something here to be learnedeading up to a giant advertisement for a non-profit publicly supported charity lead by Dr. Alexander.

B009KHDT0C|2.0|I had much higher expectations for this.  I loved all actors in it, but the story was basically the same you've seen over and over.  I was not amused.  Actually fell asleep, woke up, and knew exactly what I missed.
B007L6VR12|1.0|OK, am I the only person on the planet who hated Moonrise Kingdom?  At first, I was thinking , \\"Perhaps I am just dead inside\\", but my roommate wasn't crazy about it either.  She didn't hate it.  \\"I didn't have the violent reaction you did.\\"  But, when pressed, she said she would not recommend it to a single person on the planet, nor would she ever watch it again, and she also felt that, at 94 minutes, \\"it was really long\\".  When I saw the trailer, I could not have been less interested.  I loved Rushmore, and especially loved The Royal Tenenbaums, but I  hated The Darjeeling Limited, and hated The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (something I found particularly crushing since I loved some of Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach's previous efforts).  So, given the trailer, and TLAWSZ and TDL, I was not excited about Moonrise Kingdom.  However, it seemed like everyone said how great it was, and it got terrific reviews, so I finally rented it, thinking maybe it was just a crap trailer.  Nope.  The film is exactly like the trailer, but an interminable 94 minutes long.  The first 45 minutes, I hadn't gotten to the point where I was hating it, but I was not at all engaged.  Then, at around the 45 minute mark, there was about 1 second of a moment that resembled something moving.  I thought, \\"Thank Christ!  Perhaps now we'll find the heart that's been missing thus far.\\"  NOPE.  As the film wore on, I started mentally counting down the remaining minutes, gritting my teeth, and periodically heaving sighs.  Moonrise Kingdom plays up Wes Anderson's worst impulses, with nothing to back them up.<br /><br />Afterward, in full rant mode, I told my roommate that I was not exaggerating in the slightest when I said I'd found Hallmark commercials more moving.  Finally, I exclaimed, \\"I hate Wes Anderson!  We're in a fight!\\"<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom has a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  ?!?!?!  Miami Herald says, \\"Most of Wes Anderson's previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.\\"<br /><br />wrong, Wrong, WRONG!!!<br /><br />Ugh.  I WANT MY HOUR AND A HALF BACK!<br /><br />1 out of 5 stars because even the score and soundtrack annoyed me (unlike Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums).
B004V5A7K8|3.0|While it's a three star review, that is not at all to say it is bad.  It is, though, completely average.  It is something that will stay on my device for quite some time and be played from time to time.  It does have the 'cheap' feel to it, but if you want a nice throw back to Breakout, this is a good option!
B0075LTOR2|1.0|I own some older Japanese remasters of the Roxy catalogue as well as their now out of print box set, and also have original British import pressings for most of Roxy's vinyl LPs that I purchased when they were initially released.  I saw Roxy live twice in the 1970's and also had the privilege of attending one of the two now famous Bryan Ferry solo shows in 1977 at the now defunct Bottom Line in Manhattan (NYC) which featured both Manzanera and Chris Spedding on guitars, Mel Collins on sax, John Wetton on bass and Paul Thompson on drums (in other words, Roxy plus) and even had Jerri Hall come on stage briefly in a leopard pattern bathing suit.  For albums other than by Roxy, I own a variety of British, German and Japanese remasters, as well DCC masterings by Steve Hoffman, older and more recent MoFi gold CDs and SACDs, and various gold CDs issued by Audio Fidelity. While they all vary in quality in terms of sonic reproduction, I could not agree more with the conclusion of another reviewer, Eyolf Lund, about the absolutely atrocious sound of this box set. It is so harsh at times that it hurt my ears and makes it virtually unlistenable. The term \\"flat transfers\\" is often misused and abused.  The simple truth is that NO reproduction of analogue tapes can be made to sound good on CDs (or SACDS) without addressing in SOME manner the problems inherent in transferring their musical content to a very different and compromised medium such as the limited bits and bit rate reproduction on red book CDs.  It's true that there are many sandtraps in trying to hit a remastering hole-in-one.  One can remix as well as remaster and thus actually change the sound from the original, one can use advanced sound filters to get rid of tape hiss but then dull the highs, one can make the reproduction too bright by emphasizing the front instruments such as guitars, et al. Because of those problems, all of these potential solutions cost money and very much require the eye (for checking the condition of the master tapes or of their closest copies) and ear of an attentive and discerning CD mastering engineer.  In this instance, however, it is clear that NO money at all was spent on the CD masterings of these reissues and no veteran and respected mastering engineer supervised this project.  I even doubt whether these remasters were made from the original master tapes because it actually takes work to come up with sound this bad.  While I have often been thrilled and sometimes been disappointed by remasters, I have never previously felt completely gypped and made to feel stupid about purchasing a set such as this one. As a PS, I purchased my set from Amazon UK rather than from Amazon US and that is the reason why I am not listed in this instance as a verified \\"buyer.\\"
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I had my doubts.  Like many, I freely admit to loving, and still loving, the original Angry Birds.  Angry Birds Seasons, too, is still fun to this day.  I even have to give credit to Angry Birds Rio which proved to be more enjoyable than I thought it would be (though it's not on the level of the first two).  I never did purchase Angry Birds Space as by that time having three different versions that to this day still get updates was more than enough.  Being a huge Star Wars fan since I was born, I did have an excitement seeing these two come together, but, again, I had doubts.  Nevertheless, I blindly purchased it when it came out, and it brought back memories of firing up the original for the first time.  The visuals are top notch, the sound is superb and straight out of Star Wars, and somehow, someway, it even follows the Star Wars story throughout.  What's not to love?  I cannot recommend this enough, and assuming they continue to support and update this as they have for all other versions, you will be playing it for years to come.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|In my opinion its just fine the way this game is, its the best fps game on this market. If I were to fix anything it would be... to get money even in custom matches (because you can only get money in ranked matches). Probably not as much, but close. Don't think twice to get this game, its really worth it!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This Grisham work is an interesting read.  Not the common boilerplate that established writers often use late in their writing careerss, but somewhat like a refreshed &#34;The Firm&#34;.  It has several plot twists and turns you just don't see coming and you are rewarded with typical Grisham panache.  I certainly enjoyed the story and the style as this book is well worth reading.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Having watched Homeland on TV I have become totally hooked and couldn't wait to get the next season.  This is a TV series that captures today's realities.  The acting is compellingly good and the story line is well written.  Ten out of ten from me !!!  :)

B001N1DPDE|5.0|It is exactly as advertized and then some. the only complaint I have is why didn't they include the micarta scales? It is a great knife anyway. It arrived faster than I thought it would.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I LOVE Lee Child.  His writing is great - always excellent story lines, carefully crafted and totally satisfying.  This book did not disappoint (he never has) - it was superb !

0156012197|4.0|I've had this book around for ages and never read it.  I finally sat down with my 5 yr old son and started reading this.  I thought it was an interesting read, but my son thought it was incredibly boring...so I ended up finishing it on my own.<br /><br />The story is about a Little Prince who ends up stranded in the desert with a man whose plane has crashed there.  The Little Prince tells the man about the little planet he calls home.  Then he talks about the journey he took to get to Earth through a variety of different planets, each one inhabited by someone more silly than the last planet.<br /><br />The book basically is using all these different planets as a way to look at the strange things adults do.  For example one planet is inhabited by a drunkard (which wasn't all that easy to explain to a 5 yr old), one is inhabited by a businessman, and one is inhabited by a vain man.  The whole book basically looks at the things we do as adults (business, vanity, amassing power) and at how silly that looks to a child and at how small these goals are in relation to the whole world and life.<br /><br />It's a decent story but one of those that is so very obviously packed with additional messages that you can tell it's more of a social commentary than a fantasy story.  Which is fine.  As a children's book though it left a bit to be desired.  The pacing is very slow and many of the things discussed were things my son didn't understand.  For example drunkards and vanity.  It did give us a chance to discuss these things.<br /><br />Initially my son was intrigued by the idea of the Little Prince traveling to so many planets, but as time went on even he realized this was more of a social commentary than a story.  It got to the point where even he was all like, \\"Oh so now this planet is about someone who is selfish\\".  He got what the book was doing, but after he learned that each planet wasn't a cool new place but instead another example of adult foolishness his attention started to wander and I ended up reading the last twenty pages or so on my own.<br /><br />The illustrations are well done and match the tone of the story well.  The story is decent but obviously meant more as a social commentary than as a fantasy story.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent read, but not something I would read again.  It's more of a social commentary than a fantasy story, even my 5 year old recognized this.  The pacing is fairly slow as well.  The book has aged okay over the years but some of the terminology was out of date and I had to explain it to my 5 year old.  This is one of those classics that is interesting to read, but I didn't necessarily find it all that enjoyable of a read.d to wander and I ended up reading the last twenty pages or so on my own.<br /><br />The illustrations are well done and match the tone of the story well.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|This movie was way over hyped when it came out,Too much money was spent for WOW factor.<br />But its not as bad as as the reviews said it was. It reminds me of the origional Star Wars in many way.<br />If you find it in the discount bin its worth checking out.

1935670913|5.0|I have read the complaint that Locke paid 300 reviewers to write favorable reviews.  I have read his book and every word is golden.  I am sure that following his advice will result in more sales of your books.  I do not expect to sell 1 million books in 5 months.  But I do expect to sell a lot more books now than I would if I did not follow his advice in the book. Isn't that what it is all about.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I'd like to start by saying that I've never left a bad review on anything before but I've sunk $130 and countless hours of forum searching on these now and I'm still having the issues. What issues? Just google &#34;Logitech G930&#34; and then insert any kind of trigger word like &#34;sound&#34; or &#34;cut&#34; and you will see many, many variations of google searches that angry, disappointed customers have executed trying to figure out why these things don't seem to work properly. The sound intermittently cuts out, first of all. For no apparent reason, either. You can be sitting perfectly still and not even listening to something and they will randomly drop the connection. It gives you a tell tale beep to let you know when they fail. You will come to hate that beep with a passion if you buy this headset. You can walk around and stress test the range of the radio and they will impress you at times. But they still drop the connection in a most intermittent way. The popping. OH THE POPPING. These things suffer from popping &#34;shivers&#34;. I say that because they frequently just start popping in a pattern that almost mimics a shiver. I've tested them on multiple platforms and the worst thing about this issue is (sound just cut out... and back on) that they seem to work fine on some systems and not on others. Someone suggested on a forum that getting a USB PCIE card might resolve the issue by moving the headset to a separate bus. Guess what? NOPE! They work pretty great on my laptop, though. Which is fantastic for 1/2 of the time that I want to use these things.<br /><br />Dear Logitech, you suck.

B005LAII1C|1.0|I was expecting at least a few laughs, but this movie is not funny at all. I expected it to be crude and obnoxious, but still thought it would be entertaining like The Hangover or Bridesmaids. Nope, I was so bored with it I eventually turned it off.
B006H5120E|5.0|The use of 3D only enhances the beautiful sets and amazing special effects.  It doesn't over power the viewer with any of those over-the-top &#34;objects flying towards you&#34; type of 3D, but just provides an added depth that brings you into the film just that much more.  The fact that the 4 disc set provides a regular Blu ray option as well as the digital copy only adds to the value.<br /><br />It had been some time since I had last seen the film but watching it in 3D was like a brand new viewing experience.  Highly recommended as an addition to ones film library.
B00006LWSF|5.0|8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture, great CD!! If you own the movie, then you must have this CD too! Can't go wrong with  Eminem.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Yes it's mannered, precious, East Coastaphilic stuff, but I enjoy the acting and meticulous precision of Wes Anderson's films, including this one.  I'm rarely if ever emotionally affected but I love the recreation of the world through the eyes of someone with a unique vision.

B00AMBH70S|2.0|While the Bourne Legacy has all of the elements of a good movie, it lacks much of the charm of the earlier Bourne movies.  The actors do a good job, but the movie moves along unevenly, with meager action scenes interspersed among people telling us that stuff is happening.  Many scenes contribute little to the overall movie to the point that once the protagonists board the airplane, some unnecessary 'tension building' scenes just pissed me off -- oh no!  He couldn't find her on the airplane!  He looks there!  And there!  Oh, wait, there she is.  WHY IS THAT SCENE THERE.  The climactic fight scene ends with a whimper and an unrealistic burst of CGI, as does the movie itself, which left the both of us wondering, \\"That's it?\\"<br /><br />Basically the movie watches like the director/writer couldn't let go of any of the scenes he wrote.  This film could have been much improved.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The packaging is gorgeous. The top of the box is rounded, and it feels almost quilted. Once the box is opened, the egg rests on the left in its own little pocket, while the Blu-ray boxed set is on the right, with a little satin-like pull tab to lift it from its cutout. The packaging for the blu-ray is excellent, and the blu-ray quality is great. Episode 1 of Season 2 is in it's own little nondescript sleeve, and was a nice little bonus (it doesn't have any special features, but that is to be expected). All in all, a fantastic package. This will make a great gift for anyone.
0307719219|5.0|The success of this book mirrors the progress of the \\"inclusive institutions\\" idea it talks about.<br /><br />The author wrote about this stuff six years ago but did not capture the imagination of the general public. What Acemoglu does not know about growth is not worth knowing, he's the author of an excellent graduate textbook on the subject. But two transformational events have happened since 2006 that have made his ideas relevant and current: the financial crisis and, by dint of having survived it well, the emergence of China in the public's consciousness as a financial superpower.<br /><br />My prejudice has always been that, warts and all, our pluralistic, capitalist, free-market system works very well. With an eye on the recent performance of markets and the increasing and often justified perceptions of stagnation and inequality in our western society, however, many people these days argue that there's another way and that China holds many of the answers. This is the book that gives you all the ammunition to demolish that theory. I think that is the secret of its massive success.<br /><br />But that's a mere bonus, and the theory itself is quite beautiful. Here it is, in ten quick bullet points.<br /><br />1. You can totally forget about growth if nobody holds the \\"monopoly on violence.\\" You get places like Somalia, Afghanistan etc.<br /><br />2. There are two types of politics: inclusive and extractive<br /><br />3. There are two types of economic institutions: inclusive and extractive<br /><br />4. Extractive political institutions often don't care at all for growth or innovation, lest a new order arises and the new order challenges these extractive political institutions. The author quotes examples from English history where kings and queens stifled innovation in weaving, Austrian history, where the king did not build any railways and Ottoman history where the sultan pretty much banned books.<br /><br />5. Regardless, growth has occurred in history under extractive political and economic institutions. The Soviet Union provides such an example. The manner in which this was achieved was not through innovation, but through the reallocation of resources from less productive activities (agriculture) to more productive activities (industry). The Soviet Union grew for 30 consecutive years at 6% per annum on the back of this planned reallocation of resources (eat that, China!) and was fully expected by nonpartisan observers to overtake the US economy by the turn of the 20th century. This never came to pass because once the resources had been fully reallocated there were no further productivity gains to be gleaned and thus no growth to be had. The negative side of extractive economic institutions reared its ugly head, as people simply refused to give their best if they could not enjoy the fruit of their labor. Draconian punishments for people who shirked their duties could not compensate for the lack of personal incentive and the Soviet empire crumbled.<br /><br />6. The combination of inclusive political institutions with extractive economic institutions is typical of empires and it can work for a while. Rome is the example here. Rome was a republic, but was a ruthless extractor of wealth from its empire. It grew, but only by increasing the size of the empire, as the economic agents (the conquered lands) did not really push the boat out just to send the whole harvest back to Rome. So when Rome stopped expanding at the necessary pace, that was the end of growth at the rate that was necessary to support inclusive political institutions (lots of guys in Rome sitting around pondering on the greater issues in life and citing poetry to one another). What happened next is the political institutions reversed back to extractive, as factions in Rome fought each other for the loot. Significantly, this occurred hundreds of years before the empire itself fell. But it was at the core of the decline.<br /><br />7. The combination of inclusive economic institutions under extractive political institutions has also been tried and ultimately fails if there is no success in transforming the politics. Venice is the example here, and China is the current laboratory. The idea here is more subtle. The inclusive economic institutions go away and do their thing and produce growth. The Venetians ploughed the seas and dominated commerce thanks to the invention of limited companies. The Chinese have set up the factory of the world by partnering with foreign manufacturers. This has brought serious wealth to both Venice and China. Trouble is, the fact that the political institutions are extractive means that the speed limit is lower. Intellectual property rights (not mentioned by the author, NB) spring to mind in China. You would not invest in an idea in China, because you just don't know that a government controlled company won't take it from you immediately. The lower speed limit means you at some stage hit a limit on growth. At that stage, you get reversal. China, for example, is stuck assembling phones designed in California. (again, the author is not stupid enough to write this, he wants his book to sell in China too) The authorities in Venice (the extractive political institutions) closed down the right any layman had to be part of a limited company and wrote in a \\"libro d'oro\\" the names of those who could. The extractive political institutions reversed the progress and forced the economic institutions to go extractive.<br /><br />8. The main hindrance to progress is that there is a strong vicious cycle between extractive economic and extractive political institutions. The \\"Iron law of oligarchy\\" states that another oligarchy will succeed the overthrown oligarchy (fortunately, it is not truly an \\"iron law\\"). If the inclusive economic institutions are not producing enough to feed the beast, their masters fall prey to the extractive political institutions they are perceived to be challenging. If they are producing too much, too quickly, they are usurped. And to get there in the first place is a rather large challenge to begin with. On the positive side, there's also a virtuous circle between inclusive economic and inclusive political institutions. Acemoglu quotes as an example the case where FDR thought 56% of the popular vote was enough of a mandate for him to stuff the Supreme Court with his own guys. Did not work for him.<br /><br />9. More often than not, unfortunately, the starting point of societies is some sort of king lording it over a bunch of subjects. So you start with extractive politics sitting on top of extractive economic institutions. How do you make any headway? It takes all of the following: (i) a benign monarch / king / bunch of \\"elders\\" / dictator / potentate / senate / whatever / who \\"gets it\\" (ii) some kind of plurality on the ground. Like maybe layers of power, or a variety of tribes or a variety of jobs people do. Or some type of nominal alternative (even dormant) power structure left from years before. That way there are many \\"interests\\" on the ground that both push for change from many angles, but also fail to move things in any single direction after change has occurred (iii) a significant transformational event, such as the discovery of America that enriched the merchant class or the black plague that made labor so thin on the ground that it was able to negotiate better terms or at least led it to revolt and plant the seeds of transformation later. What happens next is you travel a few yards toward more inclusive institutions and with a bit of luck you don't give up that ground later. History is not destiny. The UK did not have to become a pluralistic economy, it had all of the above and good luck, and it got it all at regular instalments. An important point the author makes is that the same events work for some and don't' work for others and the difference on the ground that made it click in England but not in Austria could be truly tiny. You really need the luck. That said, once you get your \\"first down\\" things get easier. The guys on top have less of a good thing to defend and the guys at the bottom get a better idea of how much there is to gain!<br /><br />10. The best way to get there, though, is to send a bunch of guys from a highly developed place, who command the latest technology, to a sparsely populated remote land where nobody is around to challenge them. Provided there isn't enough of them to go around, the extractive political baggage they bring gets checked at the door as they all need to knuckle down to work to avoid starving. The author quotes North America and Australia, but Magna Grecia is a fantastic example from antiquity, when Spartan settlers (Sparta being the Soviet Union of its day) set up some very inclusive cities in southern Italy and Sicily. Does not work nearly as well if they land in the middle of a highly evolved and densely populated extractive civilization, on the other hand. The temptation there is to exterminate the local leader and sit on his throne. It's pretty much what the Spanish did in Latin America.<br /><br />AND THAT'S REALLY IT<br /><br />Acemoglu is not happy to just discuss his theory, he also spends some time going over alternative theories, such as the theory that the tropics are not conducive to growth and such like, but dismisses them in a manner that is polite enough not to offend. Proponents of such theories even praise him in the jacket of the book. There's a single exception. He spends quite some time toward the end of the book to deal with a theory he considers pernicious. He takes issue with the idea that if we trade enough with the Chinese they will get rich enough that they will come around to espousing democracy. Or that if we install democracy in Iraq the locals will pick up where we left off. He applies the tools discussed above and as far as I'm concerned he succeeds in debunking one of the main pillars of modern western policy. Things basically do not automatically get better merely because people are exposed to our ways and / or get richer from dealing with us. If their institutions are rotten, we're just wasting time. And by dealing with them, we are supporting those rotten institutions.<br /><br />There are things about the book I don't like so much, I must admit. I think they all result from the fact that this was a second attempt to get the ideas across, so the author had to go lowbrow. Reading the book sometimes feels like you are on a Chinese tour bus. Pommes frites under the Eiffel Tower on Monday, chocolates opposite the Commission in Brussels on Tuesday, tour of the canals with optional visit to the nightspots in Amsterdam on Wednesday. It's fun, but the author cannot possibly know the history of so many places well enough. So he exposes himself unnecessarily to pedants who happen to know the specifics better and get stuck on detail. I refer you to the negative reviews for more.<br /><br />The other beef I have is that in the spirit of Jared Diamond, he does not actually take us to Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam, but to some really basic places instead. The idea is the places he examines are so simple that there can be absolutely no doubt it's his explanation driving things and not something more complex. But I, for one, would like him to get the tools out and apply them to somewhere more fun. I'd bet my house he's thought about all these things so deeply because he comes from Turkey, which not only picked up the baton from the Roman Empire he likes to talk about, but has had two revolutions in the past 100 years, one to overthrow the Sultan and a more peaceful one to get rid of the generals. I guess the author is scared he may bring prejudice to bear if he looks at his homeland. Or that they know where he lives.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a seminal book. It's a chance to tell your kids you read a classic when it came out.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it enough.g too much, too quickly, they are usurped.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Every once in a while I'm faced with writing a review for a book that has left me speechless. I fail to form complex thoughts about Hopeless. I just want to string together adjectives and hope that they can capture a fraction of the emotion present in this novel.<br /><br />Tragic<br />Emotional<br />Sexy<br />Sweet<br />Unimaginable<br />Sassy<br />Smart<br />Heartbreaking<br />Magic<br /><br />There you go. In all honesty, you won't comprehend the intensity of the story until you read every.single.sentence. The plot is that engaging and complex. It will grab on to your heart and never let go. I'd say that it holds you to the last sentence, but that's not giving it enough credit. I still can't get the characters and their struggles out of my mind. Be prepared for a hopeless hangover.<br /><br />Lets start with Sky. A sweet, sassy and sheltered 17 year old. No TV, Internet, phones. She's been home schooled her entire education. But now? She wants to experience high school for her senior year. Boys, friends, parties....the whole shebang! As promised, it's no walk in the park. Rumors run rampant. She doesn't give a second thought to the rumors, and is actually a tad entertained by them. Then she meets Holder and her world is forever changed. Maybe she cares about what he thinks? Maybe he will be the first boy to make her feel, to want. But he's kind of odd....very intense and has slight stalker tendencies. Being stalked by an uber sexy, charismatic guy can't be all bad right?<br /><br />Holder is perfectly imperfect. He's brooding, moody, complicated, sweet, sexy and oh so yummy. He's clearly attracted to Sky, yet something is holding him back. The truth behind his hesitancy will shock the very foundation of their lives. He slowly pursues her. Holder makes a game of their \\"firsts\\", which is one of the most endearing elements to their relationship. The firsts don't count, unless it's between them. The slow build, the sweet banter and the yummy firsts will make your heart skip and beat and fall in love with Holder more with every encounter.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover not only rocked my world, she seems to have knocked it off the axis for a bit. My mind keeps wandering back to Sky and Holder's world and the many events that lead up to the most amazing conclusion to the story. If you love Colleen's writing and are skeptical if she can deliver a third time, rest assured. This woman has mad skills and you'll be shaking your head in wonder upon completion....then if you're like me you'll consider starting over at the beginning.

B005MMYHFK|2.0|Check out the Merlin TV Series, it is much better than this Camelot! The actors in Camelot do a good job at playing their characters, but storyline progresses much to quickly. The characters have to spend time explaining past events that should have had episodes dedicated to them. The worst thing of all is that this looks like a very low budget movie! Films based on history nearly always require huge budgets in order to be good.

Disc 1 has many extraordinary concert moments from the bands beginnings and early years.  But for this Zephound, it is Disc 2, with the band in it's heyday playing blistering rock and roll before mamoth crowds that just had me slackjawed.  No one can describe any of it to you. You simply have to buy this if you have not already (shame!) and witness these great moments in music history by the greatest band who ever lived!

B00064X3BI|3.0|I'd like to start off this review by saying that \\"Slowhand\\" is one of my favorite Eric Clapton albums of all-time, and that the four bonus tracks added to the origional studio album are very nice to have as part of the \\"Slowhand\\" album. My problem is with disc 2. Don't get me wrong, the show presented here is a very good one and I'm extremely happy to have it, but I'm unhappy with it for several different reasons. First of all, this April 27th show wich was recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in London is actually the final show on the \\"No Reason To Cry\\" tour, as such it should've been a part of a deluxe edition of \\"No Reason To Cry\\" instead of the \\"Slowhand\\" deluxe edition. Also, if you perchase the 2CD deluxe edition you're not even getting the whole show. You'll have to buy the \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" if you wanna get the other five songs performed during this show but not included in this 2CD edition. I don't know anything about the contents of the \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" so I can't advise you weather to pick that up or not, but I feel like this 2CD deluxe edition is a bit of a rip-off to the true Eric Clapton fan who's gonna spend their hard earned cash on it. Finally, for those of you that do not own the \\"Crossroads Vol. 2 (Live In The 70's)\\" Box Set, there are five tracks on disc 3 that are obviously from the \\"Slowhand\\" tour since four out of the five tracks are from \\"Slowhand\\". That should've been the show included in this 2CD deluxe edition _IN _IT'S _ENTIRETY instead of the earlier Hammersmith Odeon show. So in closing, if you're a true Clapton fan ofcourse you're gonna want to pick up \\"Slowhand Deluxe Edition\\" ASAP, just remember that you're not getting a complete concert on disc 2, and that the record company scrooed up by including the wrong show to begin with. I hope this helps you make a wise and informed decision about buying this or not. Thanks for reading. PEACE!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and was worried about how it would perform on it. I must say after downloading it and trying it out, I love it! It's loud enough for me to hear it in my sleep, I can set my own music as the alarm, and I love the option to do a math problem or other options before you can snooze it.
B000002TWN|5.0|I probably listen to this album, or at least songs from it, every day. My favorite song of all time is now \\"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\\" which I have listened to hundreds of times since I first listened to the album in January 2012. It is now December 2012 and I can't remember the last day I went without listening to Brown Sugar or Voodoo. The music is just that good, and I haven't been this captivated by music since I first heard Motown. The album possesses a magical quality that merits hundreds if not thousands if not millions of re-listens.

Also you can't edit pins/boards as easily on the mobile version.  I would actually give it 4.5 stars b/c I really like it, but it loses 1/2 a star b/c of the profile managing issue.

B0084I9QI2|5.0|I am a huge fan and have been for many, many years. I'd already purchased the 25th anniversary cd, returned it and purchased this edition when I realized that the dvd of the Wembley Bad concert, a poster and additional information was included. It was well worth it to me because i've always enjoyed listening to his music, hearing his beautiful voice and dancing around the room. Both the original, which of course was a known entity and the second cd were pleasures to hear. I learned more about him due to the booklets and to me, the more true information on this fascinatingly talented man was a plus. I will continue to purchase MJ material whether it be cds, dvds, books, etc. He was brilliant and I am sorry that he's no longer with us. I recommend this to any MJ fan. They will not be disappointed.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|We love the super hero movies and are impatiently waiting for the next one to come out!  Thor is one of my favorite heros and movie.  I bought this for a great price for my daughter and she is thrilled.  She can play it on her dvd player, blu-ray player, computer and tablet.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I've already watched this 3 times.  Once on my own, then with my wife and then with my daughter.  It is a sweet film and I really enjoyed the archery scenes.  I am an avid archer and the archery scenes were very realistic.  Get this dvd and enjoy it with the family.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've been using this app for a few years now.  I've tried others but I always go back to this one.  It's by far my favorite card app.  Easy to use and I love being able to put any picture I want as the background and back of the card.
B009MF56GC|4.0|A most enjoyable movie, although Sylvester Stallone is getting past his due by date, Jason Statham is an excellent backstop for the movie.

0061733199|5.0|I found the manual quite complete, easy to read and full of extremely interesting suggestions. It's a must for all those involved in survival activities!
1452101426|4.0|I bought this for a preteen, and it's a bit advanced but still a lovely book.  The book has hundreds of illustrations and many storyboards, but I wish they would have had fewer but larger pics on the storyboards.  Many of the storyboard pics are far too small (1 inch by 2.5 inches).  It would also have been helpful to have a few digital compositions which show the steps of creation from drawing to final product (i.e. armature of a figure/face to completed character).
B000M5NRLC|4.0|I only wish i'd paid the couple extra bucks for the High Definition version. Great movie for the whole family.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found this story a bit drawn out and too long to get to the end.  The characters were interesting but I was not excited about the way it ended.  I have read books by John Grisham in the past but I am not thrilled about The Racketeer.  Sorry folks.

B0084PB97G|5.0|about this till I heard it. Still as good as always, is Mr. Womack. The first thing that got me was opening line of the title song, it was elegantly beautiful, simply so. As I listened to the rest of the album, I noticed that the sound that stood out the most, to me, was his voice. The electronics & percussive effects that other people were complaining about didn't matter except that they were an apporopriate accompaniment to his striking voice. I found I liked the direction of the album, and listen the it all the way through at least two or three times a week, and at least a portion of it every day. The mans' soul remains intact, his work shines, and his voice takes you places, places you may have been to long ago, where you find some interesting and welcome changes.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I ordered this Sunday and received it Tuesday with Standard shipping. It came unopened, like it should have, and not damaged. I haven't watched it yet because it's a present for my boyfriend, but I know it will be good. Such a great deal too $20 for 4 different formats, so awesome.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Same as another reader, I was loving the book and kept telling my son he had to read it.  Just finished it - what a disappointment.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I rented this film expecting an action flick and what I got instead was a scientific thriller that just didn't make any sense to me.  There was quite a bit of talking while Renner's character, Aaron Cross pops these pills in between brief action scenes.  I'm a pharmacist and couldn't really understand what Renner was taking these pills for?  I assume it had to do with a virus, but this in itself didn't make much sense.  Also, how Rachel Weisz's character plays a role in this plot too confused me.  Overall, I would pass on this one.
B001DF68MA|3.0|I bought this for my son who was under one at the time. As soon as he fell asleep he became dead weight, and since there was really no sides to this he would look as if he was falling out, and made the ride a bit unstable for me. I didn't feel comfortable enough to ride with him since he couldnt tell me he was tired or not. I would suggest this be used with a kid big enough to express their emotions but keep in mind its up to fifty pounds. I ended up buying a trailer, so I don't use it and intend on selling it.

1610390938|5.0|Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have done an great  job at providing the reader with excellent empirical data and statistics along with anecdotes that portray the complexities of both the theory and practice of anti-poverty policies in 3rd world- developing nations. Despite the fact it offers \\"radical\\" suggestions, they are also entirely practical. It is important to analyze ones environment- political, economic, and social- while coming up with theories as to why they are poor.<br /><br />The focal point of their argument emphasizes that, much of anti poverty policy has failed over the years because, as a condition, being poor is not well understood. Powerful nations need to purify their intentions and reevaluate their foreign aid policies; if implemented correctly they could lead to a better working economy and solid working government. At the end of the day, the authors understand that, realistically, solving the problem of poverty will take time and we must be patient. But there are a few factors involved that could help make this process easier. The authors are practical visionaries who offer innovative ideas for the poor. In addition, their book serves as a great guide to those who are trying to help the weak around the world.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love all the Toy Story movies, and this one completed my collection. The DVD seemed to have some problems at first (very bad skipping), but it must just have had something on it. Once I cleaned off the DVD, it worked perfectly and I haven't seen any problems since.
B0055S348W|2.0|Because this product exceeded my expectations on my HTC EVO, I made the mistake of not attempting the test version first.  Fails to find printer on same wifi Network.  See other product review to same point.  Thinking I was savy enough to surmount that problem, I ordered it and should not have.<br />Further research shows that the PrinterShare people hope to solve issue sometime, according to their tech support Dept.  Does not appear to be way to return/obtain refund so will hold out hope for working solution in future.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is a great movie, and I've loved it for a long time. It was great to finally get it on DVD, and the DVD is in great shape.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Discovered this one night at a friend's house; the game is great for a small game night - and is a great mix of strategy and competition.  It moves quickly - you can easily play 2 or 3 times in an evening in order to settle the score.  I like it because its really quick and easy to learn how to play but the play is varied enough that you won't easily tire of the game.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Great CD, but ordered 2 by accident and cannot get info to return.  When I click on appropriate item ordered and continue, it asks me #, but doesn't give you an option to put in &#34;1&#34;, only to select their pre-written reasons for returns, therefore, I cannot complete the form and it doesn't give you an option for &#34;chat&#34; or to e-mail Amazon.  Very disappointed...so how can I contact to return?????

B002VHI8FE|5.0|Would recommend go anyone who is looking for an awesome fantasy book. Good for beginners too, its not hard to read like lord of the rings or something
030758836X|4.0|The beginning was a little slow for me but once I got to the second half I was hooked.  The author kept me guessing till the end.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We have our camera, a short tripod (the little Joby style), a couple lenses, several batteries, several SD cards, battery charger (car and wall), a camera remote, even our old point-and-shoot camera, and lens cleaning pads all organized nicely in this backpack and there's still plenty of room for more!<br /><br />We have taken this backpack on several trips and it doubles nicely as a carry-on... we stuff in magazines, books, socks, and other small items along with the normal camera equipment mentioned above. So it's big enough to put in all the stuff we need, but it's not heavy and doesn't feel bulky. The straps are as comfortable as any backpack straps I used in college.<br /><br />I suppose the only \\"con\\" I would give this bag is also the same reason I love it so much. It's not great for a simple around-the-town bag or on small hikes. For example, we did a short hike in Zion's National Park this past summer and I had a water backpack on (it was 100+ degrees outside so we didn't want to get dehydrated!) and I tried to put this backpack on as well. I ended up just carrying it in my hand most of the time because it was too big and was keeping my back sweaty. So on those short excursions I wished I had a smaller bag that just held the camera and the lens I wanted. But I don't think that's a reason to knock off a star... just a simple suggestion for any non-professional photographers like myself.<br /><br />If you thought this review was helpful, please let me know!
B0058YZFDK|5.0|Ok, so I won't give you a long review, this is my second pair of Merrell series shoes.  I picked this model because of its feature for being windproof.  So I am using these as my winter running shoes.  So far they have repelled the shallow water puddles also; I avoid the deeper ones.  These have shoes fit true to my standard shoe size, I like the natural wide toe base and yet be quite snug around the foot to limit slipping.  A word of caution for those looking to change to these, I will only echo what many other websites and people have said.  If these shoes are your first barefoot experience, give them about 3-4 weeks for you feet to get used to how they will move with them and then gradually build up your running distance.  I am currently running 6-7 miles with zero issues in my back.  Lower back pain was something that would normally limit and slow down my pace with standard running shoes of different &#34;arch&#34; support; but now I am just getting general soreness in the knees and hips from trying to build new muscles.  For people that have chronic LBP, please try walking around barefoot and allow your body to fix the alignment issues you might have in your body.  Alignment starts in the feet, then ankles, then knees, then hips, then your back; but it all starts in your feet.  I will continue to purchase this brand of shoe.  I use my old merrells right now for lounging around and running errands.

B009ANAQ4S|5.0|I've always liked Van Morrison's music but not enough until \\"Poetic Champion's Compose\\" to make a purchase.  I bought it and fell immediately in love with the music, the melodies and the distinctive voice.  I bought the CD in 1986 in Shefford, Bedfordshire, England and it was the start of a lovely musical journey which continues in 2012.<br /><br />The soulful sax and the jazzy feel were right at home with me.  Since that time I've bought many of Van's discs and now MP3s; and each one was a joy but this latest is truly beautiful!  I love all of the tracks and have a special feeling for them in this order: Goin' Down to Monte Carlo, Close Enough for Jazz, If in Money We Trust, Born to Sing, Open the Door (To Your Heart), Pagan Heart, Educating Archie, End of the Rainbow, Retreat and View and the wonderful Mystic of the East.<br /><br />Let me tell you a secret; you can mix the songs up any ol' way you want and you'll have a winner in every iteration!  Take it to the bank mes amis, it's golden truth.  Better still, just purchase \\"Born to Sing: No Plan B\\" and indulge you and yours with the heavenly goodness found therein.<br /><br />While you're at it, pick up \\"Sunken Condos\\" by Donald Fagen and you shan't be disappointed with that purchase either!

0486211045|4.0|Its a great beginner drawing book for the aspiring artist that need to work on the human figure and constructive movement
0465011047|4.0|I can not say that I \\"liked\\" it, but it was well written and illuminating.  And \\"Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" was very depressing.<br /><br />\\"Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" is a first-hand account of life in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), that is to say North Korea.  Mr. Kang and his family were duped into going to North Korea after the war, and lived as good a life as could be hoped for, for a while, until the Party noticed that Mr. Kang's father was not adapting to the well-ordered and harmonious society as well as he should have been.  With this, the entire family was forcibly relocated to a \\"re-education\\" camp, where it appears that routine cruelty, a policy of enforced malnutrition, and the constant threat of arbitrary execution are considered \\"education\\".<br /><br />The depressing part is the truth in it.  That this is normal in DPRK, and for many reasons there is little to be done about it.<br /><br />The best use of this book; when someone whines about some petty infringement on their liberties, offer them this, and let them reflect on the difference between a real tyranny, and a trivial, government imposed inconvenience.<br /><br />Edward M. Van Court

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've read about a dozen of the self-published books on my kindle and for the most part, there is a reason that these books were not picked up by a publisher. After a few pages of reading most of these \\"novels\\", I tend to start editing the book in my head as I read it instead of enjoying it. Weak dialog, characters that are one dimensional or just plain uninteresting, and tons of grammatical errors are just a few of the reasons that lately I have been steering clear of books that are self-published on Amazon's website. When this book popped up on my recommended page, I nearly skipped over it but the number of high reviews caught my eye. The book sounded interesting, was only a few bucks, and the reviewers couldn't say enough nice things, so I figured I'd give it a try. . .<br /><br />Wow!!!! I expected so little but this book is probably the best I've read since \\"The Name of the Wind\\". Actually, it is written in a similar style as NotW, with a \\"chronicler\\" telling the story as it is told to him by the hero. The main character, Vaelin Al Sorna, is basically abandoned by his father at the entrance of a monastery. At this monastery, he and his \\"brothers\\" (other boys who ended up at the monastery for a variety of different reasons), will be trained to become Brothers of the Sixth Order, who are (very literally) defenders of the faith. Magic is at a minimum in this book, characters are very well-developed, and the author does a great job of handling how conflicted Vaelin is as he gains more knowledge and responsibility within the order -sometimes a good man has to do very bad things.<br /><br />Don't hesitate! If you are a Rothfuss or Hobb fan, you will LOVE this book!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Seemed like it was not an original but it worked well. One of the thumb pads on the analog came off after some game play which was disappointing, but battery life ok, and so was everything else.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun with the hints if you aren't yet familiar with type of game. But to really do more than a few basic builds, you need to spend real life money, repeatedly. Also, it keeps bribing you to post on Facebook your accomplishments for bonus point things, but the few times I tried, it failed to work. Might be my Facebook app settings, but I doubt it.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor, 2001 film<br /><br />Would two young boys climb into a biplane and attack a grown-up in those days? [Unbelievable.] Would those acrobatic pilots be condoned in 1941? [No. Low-level acrobatics are very dangerous in case of a sudden loss of altitude.] One pilot wants to be a combat pilot in the Eagle Squadron in Great Britain. Nurses give injections to soldiers, then an eye test. [Comic relief? Is it funny? Does it pad out the story?] Origami in those days? There is dancing in a nightclub. One pilot tells of his destination! [What about security?] The night scenes better allow recreation of the past. [Those who joined the Eagle Squadron had to travel to Canada in civilian clothes and hide their intent to avoid violating the Neutrality Act.]<br /><br />FDR talks about sending military supplies to Britain and Russia. [Both countries?] The Japanese plan a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor to cripple the Pacific fleet while they invade British and Dutch colonies. Admiral Kimmel is in charge of Pearl Harbor. We see RAF pilots scramble to meet the enemy bombers. One is shot down. We see a boxing match on one ship. [Another anachronism?] Naval Intelligence analyzes the Japanese messages; is it a trick? [Was Chaplin's \\"The Great Dictator\\" a flop?] What happened to those Japanese Navy ships? Would a woman travel unescorted in those days? Did woman wear two-piece swimsuits then? No tops for men? Naval Intelligence tries to locate the Japanese fleet. They listen in on a telephone conversation. Rafe returns! [Believable without a warning?] There is conflict between friends, then a bar fight. \\"Send MP's!\\" The Japanese prepare to attack at dawn. Decoded messages tell of imminent war.<br /><br />Airplanes attack the ships! \\"Get up!\\" The sailors react to the explosions and warnings. Ships explode from bombs. \\"General quarters!\\" Parked airplanes are sitting targets. Soldiers shoot their WW I rifles at attacking planes. Bombs fall. A ship capsizes with sailors clinging to the sides. The wounded get treatment. Two P-40s take off to fight the enemy. Others fire from the ground. We see CGI airplane combat. The wounded arrive at the hospital. The critical are admitted. One nurse is a casualty. The wounded are treated. \\"Go with God.\\" They try to rescue the sailors trapped in sunken ships, forty feet below the waves.<br /><br />President Roosevelt asks for a Declaration of War from Congress. [This speech is phony, FDR did not give details about the damage.] FDR asks for an attack on Japan. Impossible? Colonel Doolittle is in charge of a \\"Top Secret\\" operation using Army B-25 bombers. These bombers are lightened for maximum range after launching from a short runway. They will bomb Tokyo, they are not untouchable. \\"But that's just me.\\" \\"Man your planes.\\" They take off on April 19, 1942 and fly low. \\"Bombs away!\\" [Direct radio communication to Washington was impossible then.] One plane lands after running out of fuel. They are captured by enemy soldiers after resisting in an emotional scene. Back in the States a transport plane unloads a coffin. The Doolittle raid was followed by victories. We see who survived the war and married.<br /><br />This seems to be a big budget production with a low budget director and screenwriter. Is there some hidden message in this story? \\"From Here to Eternity\\" was a better movie about that era. \\"The Battle of Britain\\" was the best movie on its subject. Removing the side story about air combat over Britain would have shortened this movie, it covered too much ground. The credits roll for a very long time. A history book will have a better story about Pearl Harbor.

He mentions her A LOT, lol. The production is sound and he gives us a glimpse into what he experienced in his last arrests. Proud about my purchase. Just hoping this Troubled man stays free this time so he can keep making great music.

B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I've played this game several times on the computer and thus is exactly the same. The only problem is that it is very hard to do a hidden object game on a phone, tablet, or ereader.

B009ZE27US|1.0|Where to begin...  OK, it's a gag...  That would imply some type of vague humor...  This is NOT the least little bit humorous, rather it is embarrassingly and pathetically STUPID...  As for those of you who claim that this would be great fun to pull out at party's,  I don't know what kind of party's you go to, but I hope I am never invited...  this app won't help you with the ladies, but it sure will get your backside kicked...  And lastly, SHAME ON AMAZON for even offering moronic apps like this, including MOOD SCANNER as well...  if only there was a way to give less than ZERO STARS...

B008DKBQMK|5.0|This sleeve protect my kindle fire and this was the main reason for purchasing it.  I wish it was a little bigger as I also have the Marware Stylus...I squeeze the Stylus in there but it is tough.  I still like the sleeve and its style.

B005NFJAZS|5.0|I had recorded The Music Man on an old VHS tape and my copy was becoming worse and worse with each playing of this movie.  When I saw I could a DVD copy for a reasonable amount of money, I was thrilled and I used it as one of my husband's Christmas Presents.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|First off, for starters, the music is phenomenal. The editing is beautiful and the story is downright adorable. You'll find lots of love for this movie and the characters in it and soon cherish this film as it has become a timeless classic for Walt Disney films. Your children will simply adore Wall-E. He's the cutest! I highly recommend looking into this film if you have children (or even for yourself!). I purchased this set because I simply love this movie. It's one of my top tens.
B00821PGUS|2.0|the thing that bothered me about this show the most was the fact that the show would enplane something about the science of the aliens and then the next episode it would be meaningless. Like the black kid that gets his harness taken off by the doctor then the kid puts it back on then the kids dad rips it off and the kid lives.They said earlier in the show that the harness could not just be taken off or you would die.<br /> Then the doctor finds a way to take it off.  He is the only one who can remove these things safely in the whole resistance and they get this guy to come out to do this real important procedure and it works but the kid is still taking cues from the alien so that's bad I get that but then the kids dad rips it off of him and you assume that the kids dead.  Like an episode or two later you find out that the kid is still alive he's a dummy but he's still alive.  why? there is no reason.  No explanation he just lived through the exact situation that was explained in detail.  Once that happened i just couldn't do it any more.<br /><br />It's disappointing as well. I think if the DIRECTION of this show was better executed ... I would have loved this show.
B006TTC5QS|5.0|This movie is funny and appropriate for all ages. You are guaranteed to laugh. I absolutely love the minions. I would recommend watching the trailer if you don't know what this movie is about, you will get hooked immediately.
0060594896|5.0|I love this book. This book has everything you need to have a successful live. I had this book but it got left behind when I moved. Then I bought earlier but a friend so I gave it to her and bought me another copy. A must have for anyone who wants to succeed.
0736092269|5.0|Worthy for the workout enthusiast and the student of kinesiology. This book Will help with workouts, muscular recognition and education for a CSCS.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie.  It has a solid message and is not unbearable to watch a few times with my kids.  This is good solid family entertainment with a good message about the environment.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is such a great game. My boys even enjoy this maze like puzzle game and they are ages 8 to 17. Definitely fun to pass time or cure their &quot;boredom&quot;. I totally recommend it!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out.  Though I didn't see it until it had been out for quite a few years, it is truly a classic.
1451695195|5.0|this is a most thought provoking book and great that he wrote it everyone should read it, and read it a second time so it will sink in
B00008G7UF|5.0|Great movie.  Always liked it, but it just goes to show, (like in my life), when the jerk dumps you, a wonderful man pops up when you don't expect it, for ever after.
0062124293|5.0|Honestly, I had no idea how this book could be humorous. I was fully expecting some clever moments sprinkled between dry lamentations of our state as women in the modern world. This was far from the case!<br /><br />Laughing out loud while reading this book comes as often as the sense of revelation--Often! Moran tells the story of her life as an overweight lower-class teen in the UK, and somehow, in these anecdotes, she reveals universally applicable insights into the various absurdities and injustices in being a woman, and shockingly, none of it ever feels angry. Somehow, \\"How to be a Woman\\" breaks the stereotype of the humorless feminist un-self-consciously and effortlessly. This in spite of the topics ranging from periods and a deeply poignant chapter on abortion.<br /><br />Moran plays with taboos fearlessly and with a refreshingly light touch, covering much of the female experience in the \\"Western World\\": social issues and economics, maternity and reproduction, everyday items like what we wear, self-image, health...<br /><br />I'll end with an example of how to-the-point her writing style is with a fun little exercise from her book. In the context of the prevalence of plastic surgery for everyday women (not just celebrities), from the anxieties so many feel about aging and how the whole \\"issue\\" is framed, she has this to say:<br />\\"You can tell whether some misogynistic societal pressure is being exerted on women by calmly enquiring 'And are the men doing this as well?'\\"<br /><br />Buy this book! Buy it right now--it has been my favorite one in 2012. Funny, insightful, and it leaves you feeling pretty great, actually!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is what my nephew requested--and he liked it.  I have no other things to say about it.  Thank you.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This filmed musical based on a musical play about a boy and a girl came to Hollywood to fulfill their dreams has an age old and slight story but filled with energetic performers and pop music from the 80's.  Credits must be given to Hollywood veterans like Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, etc.  Without them, there is no movie.  Cruise in particular gave another his 100% and impresses us with his vocal ability.  If you like 80's music, you'll like this infectious musical.  Sit back and enjoy.
0374280967|4.0|This little book was fun to read, but the ending was an abrupt disappointment.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the ending.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I Love M83..another mind-blowing album. Some bands just know how to reach perfection. When I listen I find myself in another time and place, somewhere back in the mid 80's. You make me feel my soul. Dope:). To all the dreamers on the run. Jesus and M83 make life better..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book I couldn't put down once started. Would highly recommend this book to others. Can't wait to read next one.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A wonderful story about what all of us have and never use wisely or even think about until it's too late
B0086213XW|3.0|Despite some terrific acting performances (with Seth Rogen shining by dialing down his goofiness to a level that actually works) this whole thing is let down by a very weird script. At times the dialogue rings true and at other times it's just plain off kilter. The whole movie is off kilter. Trying to make Toronto seems sexy seems well so...pretentiously like the wannabe New Yorkers are that make up Toronto (sorry, director Sarah Polley, but you only reconfirmed what the rest of Canada thinks of people from Tarrana).<br /><br />I'll admit, as in the Making Of extra adds, that the lighting was very unique and a lot of what Polley does is good but I don't think she's yet capable of making a truly good movie until she gets a bit older and gains some life experience. The characters written seem stunted adults whose attempts at justifying their actions seem childish and childlike.<br /><br />Also, what was up with making the artist a rickshaw driver? Really, that's his part-time job? There're still rickshaw drivers in 2012 in the Centre of The Universe?<br /><br />Then explain to me what was up with the amount of showers Michelle Williams seemed to take. We even get a women's water aerobics class shower scene-a-go-go that runs like some Porky's meets health science scene.<br /><br />The biggest head scratcher is when (SPOILER ALERT) Williams leaves Rogen for the artist, we get a montage that features a FFM and a MMF threesome. So we're supposed to believe that throughout the lengthy chaste \\"courtship\\" that actually Williams was secretly a freaky sexplorer?<br /><br />The entire movie does not compute despite it trying to have a say on modern relationships.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I chose this rating due to the rapid service that I received and the price was wonderful!! I find the quality great as well!

B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is a great movie.  We all know it.  This edition comes with extras that are great.  Love this movie.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|The acting was really bad.  The guy who plays John Carter ruined the movie for me.  I would watch it again just to see the effects though.
1419705849|5.0|Fun and Funny! My grandson really loved this book and all the other \\"Wimpy\\" books! The movies are great too!
B004ULEEY8|3.0|This movie in blu ray looks very good. The story held  my interest. It never got to cornball at least for me. Alot of cool fireballs and crashes. Best part for me was the battle on the freeway with the bus. This is a rental! If you need a blu ray to show off blu ray then buy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved the book. Good read as always. Vince Flynn is my favorite author. I look forward to the next Rapp

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This is a great book that includes lots of historic information and is a good book for those with an open mind and vivid imagination.
B0029XFNA8|1.0|I have the colorized DVD and was thrilled when I saw the Blu-Ray version which I could watch on my new player.  My excitement turned to shocked disbelief when I popped it in and it was Black & White!!!  I thought there must be a mistake and looked for the colorized version, but it was not there.  The color picture on the product page fooled me and I didn't read the fine print so this purchase burned me.  I chose to watch the colorized DVD and am trying to sell the Blu-Ray.  Fool me once shame on you.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is the best value if you intend to read the entire series to date.  Once Book 5 is added, it will be an even better value to purchase a GOT bundle.  Love this series!!!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Book Five and Book Four were very disappointing.  Book Five sort of retraces stories told in Book Four from other perspectives (even though the outcomes are already known).  I hope Mr. Martin intends to correct the errors of prose in these two books when he pens the six.  Love the series, not a fan of the last 2 books.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I found this collection of thoughts and writings by Christopher Hitchens to be a thought provoking experience. Do yourself a favor and pick this up
B005IQ39AY|3.0|This is a fun game that I've even played on my Nexus 10 (although in Portrait mode only and not Landscape since that would not work as well with the game's design). The main goal appears to be that you are supposed to get bubbles to drop by matching same colored ones that will slice through the rest. I have only played the Classic mode with this version of the game, but it runs really smooth on both my Nexus 10 and Galaxy S3. I have no complaints with play-ability although a tutorial might be good to explain how to get a higher score etc. It seemed as though I would be doing well and getting several balls to drop and then the game would end anyways.<br /><br />I had enough fun to toss it three stars for now and if they make improvements I will go back and update my initial review.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Its and Excellent movie about moonshine and one family's dealing with the corrupt cops, politicians and the mob in the 1930's.

0802473156|5.0|I buy this by the dozen and give them as wedding gifts w/ a 20$ bill in them.  I use the love languages in every relationship I have!  I love to know what someone is and then I know how to best to communicate with them.  I think it's something everyone should know about and use!  I have actually been asked to hold mini-workshops on these in small church groups.  It's been really fun!<br />It took me a long time to realize my true language and now that I know, I don't get as offended when someone does something in their love language, and not mine.  I'm more aware of how the other person is sharing love.  It really helps to know when they are showing appreciation for you, even in small ways.<br /><br />Best book ever!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Kind of late to getting around to finally checking out this new VH album, and I was blown away. Eddie totally shreds every song with his guitar slinging attitude of the late 1970s early 1980s. Diamond Dave still has that great vocal growl and sense of humor. Alex tears it up on the drums and Wolfgang does a great job on bass. Every song on here rocks, no filler all killer VH. Really surprised and pleased at how this album gives me hope that rock is not dead.
B00753MBHA|5.0|This is a classic sounding Accept album but updated with great production and sound. Singer Mark Tornillo is such a great fit for this band. He does not replace Udo but this is like a hybrid of the mid-'80s Accept just another direction they could have taken. I love the old TT Quick Metal Of Honor album, Tornillo's vocal style is awesome. If you are like me and love the '80s Accept sound, do yourself a favor and check out this release. 5 out of 5 stars.
B0012GMYI2|5.0|I still remember when my roommate put this on the stereo back in 1986 and it just blew my mind. The beer polka scratchy record intro and then Udo screaming as Wolfgang's guitars and Stefan's double kick barrage starts Fast As A Shark. Awesome. Lots of great memories every time I play this one.
B0012GMXBK|5.0|My old cassette of this essential Accept record was sounding pretty sad so I really needed to get a better copy of this album. No disappointments here, every song on here is 4 or 5 stars.
B003SWNRU2|4.0|Those not familiar with Mark Tornillo need to find the rare copies of TT Quick. What a great band, and he is a good fit for Accept. This record has some very good songs on it, worth checking out. I haven't bought an Accept record in a long time, but this one piqued my curiosity.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Awesome, I seen it three times and still love it. I think the images are so clear and realistic, and the story is very nice in such time of pain and suffering.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not a big reader but omg this was awesome. I love the three books and can not wait to watch the movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is very poorly written and dialogs were as unbelieveable as the characters. I kept waiting for it to pick up and it never did by the middle of the book. After wasting  both the time and the money reading the first half, I deleted it from my Kindle. It is a piece of trash.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader. The last time I picked up a book, other  than school textbooks, has probably been about 4 years. I bought the kindle to try and get back into reading and this was my first book. To my surprise, I was captivated by the story and spent long hours following Katniss through her struggles. I'm glad I chose this as my first read and I will probably buy the second book after I'm done writing this review!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really surprised at quality and quantity of information in the free ap! Works flawlessly w/my Kindle Fire THX!  Love feature that gives specific time amounts for different activities AND you can personalize to cover the things you'd want to know about like listening to music while surfing the web or reading. This is helpful also to be reminded gently, verbally to unplug or when  my Kindle Fire is at custom settings of increasing/decreasing it's charge. I set mine to notify me@ 20%80%100% when powering up and 50%20% when powering down. This way, if I am leaving I have heads up to charge. Great product!

B009Z5BPZK|5.0|OMG I don't even know where to begin. Gossip Girl is the most amazing show I've watched in a long time. This 6 years have been like a rollercoaster. It's true, it has some let downs, but it also has many memorable moments and unforgettable scenes. LOVED the series finale, everything that I wanted to happen, happened. This is truly the best show ever and I expect a movie soon. The end of Gossip Girl is the end of an era. I hope this isn't the last that I see of Gossip Girl. Thanks Gossip Girl, you gave my life a whole other meaning. I'm grateful and I love you. You know you love me. XOXO Gossip Boy.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|I love the whole series of Fast and Furious movies--shortage of Vin in here but still good racing scenes and story line
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very well written with a twist ending.  I can't wait to see the movie, but I cannot imagine it will be as good as the book.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since Hunt for Red October.  His books are always spell binders.  Sometimes what he writes seems to be minutia, however, by the time you get to the end of the book you realize that the minutia was character development that is very germane to the story.  I look forward to reading more of the Rainbow series.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Elf was funny and kept up a good pace.  Children above 6 would enjoy this movie.  Light romance, no sex.
B009KNPPS0|2.0|My box literally fell apart when I was opening it!  I hope this isn't another debacle like the Layla 40th anniversary boxed set.  The contents slide out, but not completely.  There are three sleeves containing the book, programs and LP.  The other discs are securely in the side of the sleeves.  All were in the right place, no free floaters or glue residue, so that's been fixed at least!  HOWEVER, one of the sleeves FELL OUT!  Complete with a nasty glue edge waiting to muck up whatever it touched!  Unacceptable.  I hope I just got a defective one (contacting amazon for a replacent, and I'd it's the same story I'll just get a refund), and this isn't indicative of the manufacturing process.<br /><br />The good news is that the DVD-A sounds fantastic, nice imaging and detail.  Can't wait to compare the LP to the MFSL one:)<br /><br />If the next box is ok I'll go to 3.5 stars.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Let me just begin by saying that I have seen this movie more than 10 times and laugh at it every single time. Will Ferrell does an amazing job , and it always brings my spirits up. It is a great movie for any time of the year, not just Christmas. LOVE IT!

B008XNZMOU|1.0|Excerpt taken from \\"New Business Science Times\\":<br /><br />\\"It has been a long and hard journey for the fledgling sound systems corporation, Weyland Sonics.<br />Industry insiders were shocked by the fatalities and property damage created by their first offering \\"Taylor 1.2\\".<br />Most considered this line as a complete write-off.<br /><br />  The cost of repairing Houston's infrastructure alone was enough to make most corporations file for bankruptcy.<br />Undaunted, the new CEO of W.S., Charles Bleaufeldt, revamped their entire Research division. \\"Youth, Youth, Youth!\\" was the mantra for the<br />new CEO. \\"We need sounds younger than Juice Newton, more strident than Ga-Ga 2.0 and lets keep the bio-covering as flat as possible!\\"<br /><br />  His staff did complain and many resigned. One researcher, a Mr. Arno Stark, left to create his own tech company.<br />Mr Stark told me: \\"Horrible, just horrible! By the time I left, I was drinking every day. The sound that thing made!<br />There is no ear protection made that can save you. Three techs were made permanently deaf! There is no controlling this thing!\\"<br /><br />  Earlier this year, Mr. Bleaufeldt did unveil his new creation at the Branson Sound Technologies Expo.<br />He decided to change the name, from \\"Taylor 3.4.5.2\\" to the more appealing \\"Taylor RED\\".<br />Industry leaders were shocked by its ultra-thin bio-covering but were amazed by its speech emulation capacity. Here is a sample:<br />'Hi, I'm Taylor. I love the number 13. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*  I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago.<br />*whirrrrr-click-click-click* I have blurry eyesight. I'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*<br />I live in Nashville, *whirrrrr-click-click-click*'<br /><br />  Simply amazing! During Taylor-Red's debut it proved its effectiveness as a sonic weapon by disintegrating a 5 ton block of granite<br />from 20 feet away. Needless to say, the military was very impressed and rumors abound about the many orders they are placing.<br />Bleaufeldt is now considering building a miniature version of Taylor-Red for the European market.\\"

B002BWP49M|4.0|Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn pt. 2 is the final installment in the Twilight series, adapted from Stephenie Meyer's novels. This dramatic ending concludes the tale of Bella and Edward on their journey, defying the odds of love. I have never really been a fan of the Twilight series, never read any of the books or waited in line at the midnight premieres. I'm not a huge fan of dairy products, and this series contains an awful lot of cheese. But food jokes aside, I didn't completely dislike this film. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some parts that were way too dramatic, but overall I would say this is by far the best film in the Twilight Saga.<br /><br />The cinematography and special effects weren't anything different from the previous films, so I think they were pretty well done. However, I was very confused when I saw Renesmee. I couldn't tell if she was real or not because she looked so computer edited. I also have a problem with Bella's makeup in the opening scene. This movie picks up right where it left off and in the last film, the final scene is Bella lying on the table after she gives birth. When this movie starts, it is Bella waking up on the table two days after the birth of her daughter. But her makeup and hair are perfect. If she had been unconscious for two days how would she have on spotless makeup? Another detail that I noticed that didn't seem right was Edward and Bella's new home. Who made it? And who could design, build and furnish an entire home in only two days? I pretty sure vampires don't have super-human-carpenter powers. One last visual detail that was weird for me was Renesmee's room. When you first see it, it's a nursery, but then a day or two later it's completely different and completely refurbished. How on earth do the Collins afford to refurbish their homes every week?!<br /><br />I can't say I have a favorite character because the acting done by each character is a little far-fetched. I understand that the story line itself is far from realistic, but I feel like all of the actors over-played their roles. I do have a favorite scene though. The final battle scene completely shocked me, and made me actually enjoy the movie. I haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect, but I got completely sucked into it. I watched this film with my friend who isn't a Twilight fan either, but she and I were squealing in shock during the ending scene. After the movie I felt like such a nerd because I got so into the film, but in all honesty I actually enjoyed it. No, I will not become a Twi-hard fan now, but I do have a lot more respect for this series now. And I'm thinking about reading the books.<br /><br />This film is the most violent and sexual out of the whole series so I recommend it for ages 13 and up. Obviously if you're a huge Twilight fanatic, you're going to see this movie no matter what anybody else tells you. And if you completely despise the movies (which I'm sure some of you probably do) you're not going to see the film no matter what your told. But if you're in the neutral category of loving/hating Twilight like I am, give it a shot and you might actually be surprised. Overall I give Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn pt. 2 four out of five stars because it definitely surpassed my expectations. Raven D, KIDS FIRST!

B005WTR4ZI|2.0|Readers interested in the &#34;machines replacing men&#34; concept should probably read Jeremy Rifkin's &#34; The End of Work.&#34;  The only really new ground Race Against the Machine covers is that the digital / cybernetics revolution is only now kicking into high gear, and the magnitude of economic displacement will grow even faster.  Still, it's not enough to justify the purchase price.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The latest of the Bond movies delivers action and adventure just as we've been prepped to expect since the 1960s when Ian Flemings' books first hit the silver scene. The difference between the traditional Bond films and this one is that Bond is shown as a somewhat aging agent who many wish to retire, particularly after he is shot in the opening scene. M has another idea and approves his return to active duty. What I really enjoyed about this film is its introspective aspect. We see Bond returning to the home he grew up in and where his parents lost their lives. When the house blows up, his response is, \\"I never liked that house anyway.\\" But, we meet the house's caretaker who knew Bond as a youngster and hear him talk about worthy of her talents. Daniel Craig's performance is spell-binding. Javier Bardem plays an artful smart and cunning villain. And, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 makes a brief reappearance.  This film is filled with action starting with the opening scene and continuing throughout. It's thoroughly appealing for an adult audience and for teens as well.<br /><br />Here's what our kids have to say: I recently watch the new James Bond movie and it was amazing. I have seen every James Bond movie and this one is by far the best and everyone I have asked agrees. I love the antagonist in the movie and as weird as it sounds I thought that he was pretty crazy but in an acceptable way. The villain's name is Silva and Javier Bardem deserves an Oscar for the great job that he does portraying Silva. While I watched the movie, I was constantly wishing and imagining that I was a British secret agent. This movie follows James Bond (Daniel Craig) who is shot on a mission and ever since his wounding, people are saying the he is too old to still be doing dangerous field missions.  Bond refuses to hang his hat just yet and returns to MI6 when he finds out that M (Judi Dench) is being threatened.  An ex- agent of MI6 seeks revenge on M for reasons only known by them. His name is Silva and he is a psychopath. We find out that M has allowed something to turn him this way later in the movie.  Everything that Silva does or allows to happen is a part of a plan because he is just that much of a genius, but James Bond is determined to best him.  Bond has to go through everything to get to Silva and save M and, as usual, there is a new love interest named Eve (Naomie Harris) who helps him. In order to save M, Bond has to come to terms with his childhood because his parents were killed; and in the final face off Bond leads him to the one place that no one would think - Skyfall, his childhood home.<br /><br />This movie deserves all of the stars in the sky, but since the highest is five; then I give this movie five out of five stars.  I love how all of the James Bond movies have the same concept so that there are no shake ups, and the writers give just enough prediction, but not too much to make the movie predictable. Some of the scenes in this movie have sexual connotations and are violent, so this movie is not appropriate for small children. I recommend this movie for ages thirteen and up because of the mature content.  Victoria B, KIDS FIRST!

B003LFG33O|5.0|At first I didnt remember purchasing this video and I couldnt find the box in my collection but after some research I recalled buying this as a streaming download via Amazon.com and my bluRay player.  It was an entertaining story with good flow and the characters fit perfect.  I recommend this absolutely.
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|Fantasy films aren't really my thing, however, my mother who happens to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan loves this movie. I have to give the movie props for the cinematography. I mean, oh my goodness, the visuals are beautiful!! All of the images are so clear and crisp, I literally felt like I was right there with Bilbo. I especially love the Elf kingdom and the graphics for that are amazing. I can't even explain with words how beautiful the imagery and 3D are in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. There are a few things that bothered me about the visuals though. Some of it is almost too perfect and too clear. You can see every piece of grass in the field and every pore or drop of sweat on the dwarfs. It is a bit too much. The other thing that pulled me away from the movie is how the Orcs look. They look like video game characters and they don't have the same quality of the rest of the CGI in the film.<br /><br />My favorite character in The Hobbit is, by far, Gollum. Even though he is only in one scene of this movie, he is really funny in a creepy way. I really want to go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings just to see more of him! I also like Bilbo Baggins because everyone doubts him, but he never gives up or turns back. My favorite scene is a toss up between when Bilbo meets Gollum and when the dwarfs are in the underground world of the Goblins. I love when Bilbo meets Gollum because the two of them have a very funny interaction of riddling each other. I also like when the dwarfs are escaping the Goblins because their world is underground and very rickety.<br /><br />The biggest downside of this movie is the length. It is way too long in my opinion, but then again, all of the Lord of the Rings films have been very long. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings then you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but will I see it again? No. The cinematography deserves 5 out of 5 stars but, the overall film only gets 3.5 out of 5 from me. Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.IDS FIRST! Film Critic.

B00A2H9OG2|5.0|This movie is based on a true story that will inspire the audience. Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) is raised by a single mom (Elizabeth Shue) who is never around. He almost died of drowning when he was younger and Frosty Hesson (the local surfing legend) saved him. Since that day, Jay follows Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) and notices that Frosty often goes out very early in the morning. One day, Jay follow Frosty to see what he's doing out so early in the morning. On this trip Jay discovers the secret place where some of the local surfer legends surf. Frosty tells him that the biggest wave will come to this spot one day. He asks Frosty to help him train to ride the biggest waves. During the training process many life events happen and it turns out that Jay is helping Frosty as much as Frosty is helping him. They build a father and son bond.<br /><br />This movie has so many different emotions. There are the relationships between a Jay and his mom, Jay and his first crush, Jay and his best friend and Jay and his father-figure neighbor. There is so much awesome footage of the waves and the surfing culture that the audience can really enjoy watching while learning. The music is so perfect for all the scenes, especially with the skateboarders and surfers. The scenes of the 80s and the small town lifestyle is awesome to see. The special effects in this movie are above average. The big wipe out captured in this movie is like no other picture I've seen.  The message in this movie is never give up. Sometimes it is so much work to achieve your goals, but if you practice everyday, you will be better than yesterday. My favorite characters are Jay and Frosty. Jay is so friendly and never hold grudges; he always forgives. Frosty is a great surfer with a big heart. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this for ages 7 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />I recently watched Chasing Mavericks and really enjoyed it. I saw it with my mom and she even cried in some parts; everyone needs a good movie to cry in sometimes. Throughout this entire movie, I obsessed over the main character, Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston.) He is just so adorable in the whole movie. I did a little research on the story; and it is pretty accurate. I have never really watched movies primarily filmed in water, but I think it makes the acting and storyline more intense, which I like.<br /><br />This movie is about a fifteen-year-old boy name Jay Moriarity who, since he was eight, has been passionate about waves and surfing. It all starts when he was timing the swell of the waves to determine how large they were and fell in. His later mentor, Frosty (Gerard Butler) saved him and ever since he is always in the water. One day Jay hops onto Frosty's truck and follows him to a place where he sees the biggest waves existing - known to be a myth, the Mavericks. Jay begs Frosty to train him to surf the Mavericks. Frosty agrees and they spend everyday intensely training. Jay has had a hard life; his dad left him, and he acts as a mother to his struggling mother. But, he is very optimistic - which is inspiring. This movie portrays Jay as a good role model, showing how to find happiness in spite of everything.<br /><br />I have now seen this movie twice because it was so good! I probably will soon watch it again. All of the acting is great, and from researching the cast I found out that the main character Jonny Weston (Jay Moriarity) is a new actor. He was amazing in this movie. Even though this movie is based on a true story, it feels unreal because the life of Jay is inspiring, and hard to believe that someone could be that positive. Also there is a good soundtrack. It is the first movie where I actually noticed the sound track. Usually it does not jump out at me, but this time it does. I give this movie five out of five stars because it held my attention the entire time. I recommend it for ages six and up because smaller children might get bored by a long movie Victoria B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />The surf is up and we are heading to the ocean for this amazing movie. The movie, based on the real life experience of Jay Moriarty, played by new-comer Jonny Weston. Jay moves to Santa Cruz, California when he is 9 and learns to surf from a boy he befriends. He is drawn to the waves and the ocean. He counts the seconds between the breakers for fun. Once he learns to surf and has made a name for himself as a good local surfer he meets a legendary big wave surfer named Frosty Henderson, played by Gerrard Butler.<br /><br />The cinematography is hypnotizing. Some of the shots of the ocean and surfing are more then incredible. Your eyes are glued to the screen from the beginning to the end and you can make a really strong connection to surfers and surfing as a lifestyle. Some people call it sour surfing and Jay Moriarty was the youngest and the best. In the movie they show the relationship between Jay and Frosty as having only being a few weeks of training seasons but in real life Frosty trained Jay for years before his first attempt at riding a Maverick. These waves can be 50 feet high and are very dangerous. There are so many things that can go wrong. Having us believe that all the training happened in one small stretch of weeks would be impossible but that's just Hollywood telling the story.<br /><br />Go watch this touching story and bring a friend but leave the boards outside. You don't have to surf to enjoy the movie but it could open your eyes to a glimpse of what some of these amazing athletes will do for the sport. Once you see it, you will know why once you start, the ocean is always calling you to back to play again. I think I would love to learn to surf but I will stick with the small waves. The age range is 9 and up but really the photography in the movie will keep anybody entertained. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool....the title tells you nothing, but the author has much to tell. Howey creates a world that is both claustrophobic and yet vast. The possibilities for chaos abound in this new world. It was entertaining and scary at the same time. I loved it, but only 4 stars due to the ending....I wanted a bit more.
B00007J5VN|5.0|I replaced my VHS tape with a cd, so I can watch this when I want.  I love this movie - just so much fun!
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|recently became fan of the Coen brothers.  This one is great, very well done, already a favorite. I highly recommend it.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|KEPT THINKING &#34;WHO MADE THIS FILM?&#34; THEN I SAW IT WAS OLIVER STONE AND IT MADE SENSE. THE RIGHT MIX OF HARD AND SOFT, THINKING AND FEELING, SEX AND VIOLENCE. AND GREAT PLOT. TOLD THROUGH THE BLAKE LIVELY CHARACTER WHO IS SOMEWHAT MARGINALIZED BUT SHE'S SO GOOD ANYWAY ITS STILL KEEPS THE DYNAMIC MOVING.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I'm confused and saddened by the amount of five star ratings this book has received.<br /><br />My opinions as a fiction and sci-fi fan:<br />The text is full of meandering and worthless internal ruminations of flat, dull characters.  The villain is pure caricature, and not in an entertaining way. The dialog is simply awful, and entirely unbelievable.<br />The 'science' in this science fiction is poorly thought-out, but that doesn't bother me.  What bothers me is the amateurish writing, and forced plotting.  It seems blatantly evident that the author had a cool short story, and pushed it, pushed it, pushed it WAY past its expiration.<br /><br />Waste of time and money for me, and I hope to someday forget I ever read it.  It's left me bored, grumpy, and anxious weeks after finishing.  Perhaps with a good editor the story could have been saved, but as it is, this disjointed omnibus is a stolid monstrosity of typical fan-fiction-quality writing.
0762434279|5.0|This was a smaller version then the released version. This was also seen over the internet as a download but it's not as good. I would recommend this to everyone.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Read Ender's Game on a recommendation and purchased Speaker for the Dead before I was even finished with the first book. Orson Card does a great job of pivoting from one story to the next that I was unable to put down Speaker for the Dead.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This show is a small glimpse into the madness that is womankind. For all the stereotypes about women this show often shows, I know that this is merely a fraction of the makeup of a real woman. This show centers around the character Carrie Bradshaw and her three closests friends and their adventures throughout New York City. It mainly explores their relationships with men, their desires and actions to be fabulous women and the often hilarious failures at trying those things.<br /><br />About this particular box set all I can say is - it is beautiful. It comes in a book like format withthe DVD's in cardboars holders throughout the book with little notes and facts about the show. The covers are pink felt I think and it looks great on a shelf.

B000SGRONM|1.0|My friends all told me how hilarious this book was, so I bought it.  Maybe I'm not in the right mood for satire (it is Christmas, after all), but it just seemed like one big curmudgeony rant.  I was even bored with most of the rants, they were too long and stopped being even remotely funny after a page or two.

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has brought the reader of today face to face with our worst and yet finest moments as Americans. It's no wonder that we Americans believe there is &#34;nothing&#34; that we cannot change or endure after such a trying moment in history as the Emancipation Proclamation and banding of slavery in our Constitution. Thank you Ms. Goodwin!
B007D5DUBG|4.0|This EP has a few really good songs on it, the best of which is the title track Hit Me Like a Man. Unfortunately, for as good as Hit Me Like a Man is, Under the Water is equally as bad. It is like they stole a crappy ballad from an 80's hair metal band and resurrected it.<br /><br />But don't let that one bad song ruin an otherwise enjoyable EP. The singer is sexy and tough at the same time and has great pipes and inflection in her singing, and when the band is rocking the songs have the riffs and the hooks of a great Clutch song. This EP left a nice impression and I look forward to checking out the rest of their catalog.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Truly one of the best albums to be released in recent years.  I don't think I need to say anything more.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|If I was 15, I would find this movie &#34;wicked&#34; cool.  Particularly, since we're now basically a &#34;med&#34; addicted society.<br />But as a full-grown adult, I found the complete lack of a story line completely unentertaining. Its hard to care about characters that just appear for no reason, do whatever they do for no reason, and make a movie, apparently for no reason. In short, outside of the usual &#34;crash, boom, bam&#34;..there's no reason to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />-- the dime-a-dozen film critic

B007GCY8FS|3.0|This one is overly complex and unnecessarily so. Reacher comes off as a savant instead of his typical clever and logical. The plot takes several twists and turns that make sense in context but feel forced and clumsy in hindsight. The resolution of the story is the clumsiest part of it all. Overall I enjoyed the book but prefer other Lee Child's books over A Wanted Man.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|I purchased this book after seeing the movie and really enjoying it.  I'm not a big into history or reading about it but DKG is well respected and the subject matter clicked with me.  So at over 900 pages, this isn't for the faint of heart - reading it is a definite project, not summer book-candy.  DKG brings as much insight and style to the personalities as I've ever seen and the result is a very readable, engaging book that will educate you not only about Lincoln, but the characters around him.<br /><br />One by-product of the book IMO is the learning I'm getting about life in the mid-19th century.  people's perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and customs are eye opening and make me think that we've lost much in the rush to productivity and the electronic age.  These little glimpses into a lifestyle long past are perhaps my greatest pleasure in reading Team of Rivals.<br /><br />I encourage you to read it if you have an interest in the subject matter and want something a little more weighty to sink your teeth into.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I think they tried to produce an 'epic' finale with this film but lost focus on the story.  Half-way through the movie I turned to my wife and said &#34;you know, this just isn't a very good movie&#34; and she agreed.  By the end we were both just anxious for it to end and neither of us cared who lived or died.

B0036OS3F6|4.0|So I wanted a boot that fit well, was winter-proof, and was comfortable.<br /><br />I only got two out of three.<br /><br />When I put them on, I realized there's what seems to be a cardboard insert on top and around the heel that just doesn't give as you move.  It feels a bit like a box.  A box of Crocs.<br /><br />So, while I like them, I was hoping to get a boot that didn't need breaking in.  I'll give it four stars, but this boot was so close! But alas, no cigar.
B008602KQI|5.0|My 2 teenage daughters loved this movie but said the book was much better. When I rented the movie when it was a new release it didn't make a whole lot of sense.

If you haven't seen this<br />movie, now is a great time to purchase it at a great price.
0316069434|3.0|The Black Box is interesting in that it delves into events in the riots in Los Angeles and ties those events in with present day happenings.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|I have heard about this show for a long time but never saw it.  Once I saw that the entire 1st season was available - I downloaded all on my Tivo and watched every single episode in one night and very early morning!!  Great.  I can not wait until the put the 2nd Season on Amazon so I can download to Tivo and watch them all at once.  I love doing this but am always dead tired the next day!!
B000FO0AOC|5.0|one of otis's best , bought for my daughter should have bought one for myself  we enjoyed all those songs..
B003D81NVQ|5.0|One of the best shows ever made.  It is not for the faint - but if you like great acting and incredible story lines - this is the show for you.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun for time when waiting for appointments lol  thanks!<br />time goes by so much faster you don't realize you've been waiting!
B002M2T1UO|3.0|I LOVE THE SHIELD, BUT THE FIRST TWO DISC OF SEASON 1 WERE SCRATCHED. I ATTEMPTED TO WATCH EACH OF THEM IN DIFFERENT PLAYERS. I WOULD LIKE MY PRODUCT REISSUED WITH A DIFFERENT BOX SET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I EXPRESSED THAT TO THE SELLER.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I choosed this so I can see the weather forecast for my area it gives everything I need to know where I am living.  It has lots of information
B00917IQFY|5.0|Listen to this is like a trip 30years back in time,best album since The Up escalator! On the peak again!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very addictive game. I spent like 3 hours in one sitting.I would recommend to friends. overall great game
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Seth Mcfarlane definitely pulled this off extremely well!! I never once stopped laughing my butt off!! Mark Wahlberg was an awesome supporting actor as well!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Spartacus Vengeance has taken special effects to a new level. The battle scenes are fast paced and realistic. Every episode is exciting and filled with intrigue.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've always like to play solitaire, even when I was a child. Now that everything is available via download on your cell phone or your Kindle HD you can play the game no matter were you are.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|At what cost do you put yourself on the line to say, I can fit in,this is where I belong? All it takes is one pill, but then after the high wears off you search for that high again. At what cost, natural or induced?
B000YMM3CC|5.0|My favorite movie of all time! It's a must see!!  Such an amazing love story.  This is my second purchase of this movie, I have my last copy to a dear friend who had not seen it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Interesting, well-crafted mystery initially.  It begins to unravel about half way through, and ends in a very disturbing, unsatisfying way.
1449410243|5.0|This is so great if you have a cat ( or 17). It is adorable and hilarious. It puts you in a great mood:)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. Very user friendly and informative. I love that I can set it to notify me when my battery is low and when it's full. I also know how much time I have for reading or listening to music or searching the web. It's fantastic.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If your looking for a plot then you obviously don't know Seth McFarlane. The creator of &#34;Family Guy&#34; &#34;American Dad&#34; and &#34;The Cleveland Show&#34; has a since of humor that you'll either love or hate. Ted is the kind of movie you want to sit down with your kids and enjoy, assuming your kids are in the twenties and thirties like mine are.
B008M721MS|3.0|Great program, but one issue: according to those I Video Chat with, I appear as if I have no lights on, almost as if I am almost completely in the dark. Anyone else have this problem, or a fix for it?
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The TV show, Nashville, has won me over to country music. There have been serveral songs on there that I have liked immediately. I am very happy with the CD except it's missing my favorite song which is Back Home with Charles Esten. I am also now a big fan of his. He's why I keep tuning in....
B0013ND36G|3.0|The movie story is nice, overall is okay. But maybe James Cameron was too good, make me feel the movie a little bit disappointed.<br />now the blu ray comment, video I can accept but the audio only dolby digital 5.1 ：（
B009FZFONO|3.0|Addictive show that makes me want to continue watching, but character development and motivation seems painfully thin at times, and a lot of opportunities to make the show great (e.g., how to rebuild life and society after/during an apocalypse) are left on the table in favor of gore and cheap thrills.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I watch this movie from TV since my childhood. from Tape &#62; VCD &#62; DVD &#62; Bluray<br />I love it so much.
1400052181|5.0|If you have NOT read this book, I suggest you buy it NOW and read it.  Such an amazing book.  I work in pathology and know the followup of the things this poor woman paved the way for.  SUCH an amazing story.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|audio video both were high standard, who enjoy hifi system this is one of you taste.<br />Bass and surround + supperhero fight...wow...!!! perfect!!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This movie is advertised as a comedy, but it is a drama.You find yourself looking for the funny parts, but they just don't seam to come. It's about an emotionaly dysfunctional couple. Toward the end of the movie they are told you've made progress here  is a therapist to continue with at home. They now are intimate with each other. It's a warning against letting your relationship go uncared for and how distant two people can become. It offers hope for the relationship. The only funny parts are in the trailers when you don't sees the seens leading up to them. Light hearted and funny this is not.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I've been in the home recording business for years and this little gadget is able to satisfy an experienced ear. It's not too big, not too small. Just right!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a very entertaining and heart-warming movie. It's family-oriented and fun to watch. I expect that it will become a timeless classic.
B00062PN6I|1.0|These were $15 (I know, not a lot of money) The problem? They sound like a $5 pair! Seriously! I bought these to have my clients be able to listen to each other (some kids, some parents of kids) They obviously don't need to have anything too special if they are just for listening. The problem is, I expected a quality product from Behringer and was very disappointed. I could have gone down to the local Wal-mart and got a better pair. They feel cheap, sound cheap etc. Don't buy! Do NOT buy!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Creative structure and quality of writing in this book make it a worthwhile read. Traveling through time with the character leaves you with a hollow feeling in your gut. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the structure adds much to the actual story lines or plot which are nothing special. Maybe if I read it again...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app thnx amazon good game to keep your mind active. Fills in when you have time and nothing to occupy your hands
B00AHXDECG|5.0|As I expected, Bruno Mars didn't disappoint me.  He's got a fantastic voice.<br /><br />On another note, why are 7 more words required?
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly back at his best in telling of The Black Box. The problem with this and any other MC book is I can't put it down. Read myself to sleep last night. It is a very easy read. I love the way things go back in time 20 years and then bring everything together in the present.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm almost finished reading the first book. I can't wait to read the rest of them! So far I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Brilliant and much needed today. I am grateful how seamlessly all performers, including you ladies & good gentlemen delivered on Blu Ray Stream. Wow affordable & crystal clear:) Must own DVD Merry Holidays
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I love The Beatles, they are and always be the best... I loved it, I think it will last forever, the quality is just perfect... loved it
B009K0P10K|5.0|My wife and I thouroughly enjoyed the plots twists and turns.......cleverly written......the actors played their parts with passon and style
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I love The Beatles, it is the most important band that ever exist... I loved it, I think it will last forever, the quality is just perfect... loved it
B00A757EFW|1.0|i love pac man but i hate how they advertise this as 'lite' but it only lets you play one level. of course you need to pay for the full version. but it is completely pointless
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|Movie was good never had any problems with streaming, older movie it was a little difficult to follow if you were fully focused on the movie. Had moments of funny humor. Small quips that only adults would understand.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|We've all heard it but he has written a book about it.  He made me look forward to more challenges in life.  So many places in life where we know it's true but he is bringing them together for us all to see.  I don't know of another book like it or one recently written that stands to affect society so positively in the future.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|excellent plot twist had me saying wow i didn't see that coming left a good opening for sequel in the future
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I am enjoying Downton Abbey immensely.  I would have rated this a '5' except the quality of the show on my computer is not great...it jumps and sticks sometimes and that is annoying.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who likes historical fiction.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|About time it's been awhile since I've seen a movie with such life it's surreal it's violent it's disturbing its funny its just Bronson the life of England's most violent prisoner Tom Hardy (who plays Bane in the dark knight rises) was overlooked by the oscars for his unbelievable portrayal of the title character I recommend this to anyone looking for something different and an exsperience away from mainstream crap force fed to you I bought the blu ray with great picture and sound and some extra goodies this movie does not disappoint
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome. I like how you never know who will get killed off. The show is always action packed and exciting.<br />  The down side is each episode is too short. A good cast, works well together.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|It really does not do what I had hoped it would. I wanted to play some videos on my tablet. Apparently, it takes a lot of know how.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Addictive like other Angry Birds games but for us kids who grew up on Star Wars, it's extra-fun.  Favorite AB game so far.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is okay. Not the best graphics. It will do okay, but not a real WOW product. I wil probably delete it.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I really liked the book. Unfortunately or not, I saw the movie first. Now, I can't wait to see it again, now that I have a fuller understanding of the main characters. Of course, I loved the movie, but think I'd have liked it even better had I read Team of Rivals first. The book gave me a full understanding of Lincoln's character and made me wish he were still with us as we sure could use his leadership now! I read the book on my Kindle and at first thought it might take me months to read it, but it finished at about 55%! I knew it would have an extensive bibliography, but 45% of the book??! Now, there's not a day that goes by, when I read or hear the news, that I don't think &#34;wwLd&#34;, what would Lincoln do? What a great human being, self-taught intellectual, masterful leader, and comedic raconteur! Thank you for re-introducing me to Lincoln!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Some parts of the movie made me confused and sleepy, But the last 30 minutes of the movie got pretty good.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Another great soundtrack.  All the soundtracks for this saga have been amazing.  The first soundtracks I have ever purchased from a movie.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Spot on. I dentified with so much of what they said and have tried the Whole30. It works. I've never felt better. This is life changing!
B00520R146|5.0|Great gift and my son loves it! Keeps him happy and busy so make momma happy! thank you for the great sale
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books were very entertaining, passionate & sexy. I hear talk of a movie & I hope they do, it would be amazing!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|only bad thing i found in this product is the automated iso mode, it cranks up to Iso1600 works with the camera exposure so you bounce flash and it cranks ISO, should be always at iso 100 and when bounced it should flash a powerfull light not cranck the iso to reach for a good light condition
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|The people acted in such stupid ways it was unbelievable! When the story line is so stupid, it is hard to find a mystery other than why read this book!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Mars has a great command of many styles and an incredibly heartfelt delivery. The Gorilla song is kind of laughable in terms of content but an important part of the story the album ultimately tells. There is a journey here and a lot of honesty. Despite the ra-ra sexuality of Gorilla, the opening is haunting. Locked Out of Heaven is just brilliant. Can't wait to see what he does next.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time, but try not to use all of you diamonds right away unless you are willing to spend money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This  book I  even Bette  than the  first. Anna really come  into her  own and becomes quite glamorous! Her love  for fifty blooms ever fuller and the plot thickens...
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Must check out. Quick read, Excellent story...kept me going till the end. Will definitely be reading Flynn's other books soon!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it so much.  I can not stop playing it. I.play it almost all day and struggle to put it down. I just have to keep playing til I beat my old high score.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Very good and realistic movie, although several scenes were extremely brutal.  An accurate depiction of events during the prohibition era, as well as the people and how they lived in that area of the country.  This American history-based film is a definite \\"must see.\\"
B006MGDVFM|5.0|loved it. watched it three times and de cided to buy it. i recommend it a hundred percent even if you are not an f1 fan
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Always a great classic....nice read when I haven't read it for years.  Always exciting even when you remember suddenly what is going to happen!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very engaging story that holds your interest.  Only difficulty was the chronology out of sequence was occasionally confusing.  Not for children.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|For the first half or more I kept wondering what was going on!  It was a great read all the way through.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The fight for survival has never felt so well portrayed.  Men, women, children - no one is immune from the end of the world.<br /><br />Season 3 of The Walking Dead continues its heart-pounding march as Rick and the others in his group continue to fight for their lives and, perhaps more importantly, their humanity.<br /><br />This season will have you pressing the play button for another episode as soon as you finish the one you've been watching.  You'll constantly be on the edge of your seat and on the verge of tears.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|A very fun movie to enjoy.  Love the singing and dancing.  Love John and Olivia especially the last dance and song.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I felt this is one of the most valuable movies made in a long time.  It has to be watched several times.  It makes one think and analyze ones own exisistance.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Love the music and easy to download.  It goes great with my Lord of Rings Soundtracks.  The music matched the other movies perfectly without it feeling like a repeat!
B008MM9630|3.0|It's ok, not recommended for little ones.<br />The older kids find it challenging and adventures.  As an adult it is fun to play.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Love this addition to my Kindle Tablet!!!  I would recommend this to anyone using the Kindle Tablet!  Great addition and easy to use!!!
B004U52VPS|4.0|My son had been playing Angry Birds on my iPhone for a while when I discovered this game. He was so excited when he saw this real life version of the game. Fun to play and fun to see my sons excited reaction when he knocks the blocks down.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|this is not your reality TV or cop dramas.  this is a fun road trip of blood, grave desecration, and ghosts.  always a thrill.  fighting off bizarre creatures and saving people is as noble as anyone now a days can wish for.  but Sam and Dean are written to exploit the inner workings of a dysfunctional family to a T.  the car is amazing and beautifully well kept.  classic rock like AC/DC and Black Sabbath are the perfect mirror to the boys riding along in a gorgeous chunk of american steel.  love this series so much we have the whole set.  if you want something that isn't daytime TV tune in.
B007V508CC|5.0|Love his album. Love Maroon 5. I have their last 4 albums. Love them all. Fantastic musicians with unique style.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|making deals with demons is never wise, you'll see why in this season.  but along with it we get to knock off a few evil critters along the way.
B008J34466|5.0|Love this album. Love Pink. I have all her albums. She is an amazing vocalist and artist. As with all albums (all artists alike), some songs are better than others.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|if you have been with supernatural from the beginning then you know what you're in for.  season 7 is no different.  i will say i'm glad they stopped focusing ONLY on the angel/demon story lines.  nice to see some real critter hunting going on again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have really enjoyed the characters created by Mr. Follett and how they cross paths.  I also enjoy the historical value of the novel from personal views.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I entered the world of Muse through this album.  I really enjoy the sound and mix of style that this particular album provides.  It is more than your regular run of the mill lyrics and music.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Movie is set in India where you can see up close how old and decaying and over run with people things are  One country I have no desire to ever visit.
B002EBDP9G|5.0|There exists a danger in America of losing accurate recounting of American history. Read Paul Johnson's book and know what really happened.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Saw footage that we have never seen before.  It tells a marvelous story of George Harrison.  He he was, what he stood for and how he lived his life.  Awesome.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|As with all Jane Austen novels, Emma is a peek into another time. I enjoyed Emma's machinations, and loved the ending--but, as with all Jane Austen, the book takes a LONG time to get there and has many long discussions of manners, and this can get a bit tedious.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|A great story on its own and one of the best animated Batman movies in my opinion.  Mark Hammel is back doing the voice of the joker and the animation is great- definitely one to watch over and over.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|I thought this movie was very good. Intense at times. I admit I was a little sad at the the end. Lisbeth was a brilliant character, and she started to change as she fell in love with Danial Craigs character. But it was good, a little too much sex.
B003JJA59K|3.0|I generally enjoy post-apocalyptic films and naturally sought this one out as soon as I heard about it. What I found was not what I expected. The Road was rather bland and lacked purpose/direction. There was nothing to really interest the viewer in this slow story full of unanswered questions that mostly remain unanswered.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|If your a Led Zeppelin fan, I would suggest getting this. John Bonhams son Jason, is fantastic. If you didn't know it was him, you would think it was his dad playing. Kashmir is better than the studio version. Really caught my attention.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Great for kids.....silly and charming. funny for the holidays. Even my teenager had a good time laughing at the Elf antics...
B000YHG72E|4.0|One of our family's favorites at Christmas. The streaming never missed a beat and was very easy. Another nice job Amazon.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The movie started off slow, which I understand because they were developing the characters; however, as soon as the movie started to pick up pace and get interesting...it ends.  It's like watching a TV show and plot starts to unfold and then all of sudden it ends with saying &#34;tune in next week for the dramatic conclusion!&#34;  The movie felt unfinished and the movie as a whole was not strong to begin with to have an ending like this movie had.<br /><br />The &#34;Bourne Identity&#34; introduced and developed characters, but movie ended very well, you knew there was going to be sequel, but at the same time you felt good about the conclusion of the first movie.<br /><br />Overall this movie is 2 star and worth rental, but definitely not worth buying on DVD or Blu-ray.
B007HACDLK|2.0|loved most of his previous books.He seems to be getting tired and cutting corners that could have made his book Dynamic.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is freaking great. I got this three days later i had in my hand just in time for xmas. You cant beat 35.00 I got two one for me and one for my brothers girlfriend since we are suck nerds about harry potter.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Simply put, this book breaks down the ins and outs of online publishing and is focused to be supportive to anyone starting out. Highly recommended.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I do not even want to hear any comparisons to other super-hero movies. Those are just popcorn-flicks. This is a very good movie. Great acting (especially Catwoman and Alfred), no catch-phrase dialogs. Keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is why I love Nolan's movies.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Terrible. You only see a few posts. Very disappointing. My phone is more user-friendly. For the price, I don't believe it's worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I just started playing today.  It definitely has a learning curve.  I don't think it was made to play a lot at once.  The energy refills 1 every 3min., but almost nothing gives you &quot;energy&quot;.  I am not quite sure why you don't get egy. frm food.<br />It seems that the game wants you to be a workaholic, without rewarding you very often with the egy. to work.  I guess you play for 30min.-1hr., and then stop for half the day to &quot;rest&quot;.  Fun, variety
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!<br />Book I've ever read so good and captivating I didn't want to put it down with there was more
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I love this movie! It's different, fun and something I can watch over and over again without getting sick of it. Great price too!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would be better without the adds but it is fun and you can choose random or winning games which I like.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I love musicals and comedy's and I really loved this movie until the puke scene at the end. I was really disapointed as I feel that nasty scene did not belong with this particular movie. Which is why it got 4 stars!
B007V65R54|3.0|Good read, very informative, and backed by lots of hard data.  Author can be quite repetitive at times though, taking 20 pages to say something that could have been said in 5 pages.  Not as good as Freakonomics or Outliers.  Several spelling mistakes throughout the text, something that I find annoying.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I would have done without the Chinese woman and add more Jet Li. It is not an amazing movie but just for the pleasure of having all these mythical action actors together you have to watch it!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Only playing the 'real' Mahjong with real tiles on the board could be a 5 star game.  This game however is fun to play and has tiles that are very similar to a true Mahjong game.  The game helps me keep my sharp with which tile is a '4 crack' (it's the one pictured) as say a '4 bamboo'.  And if you don't know what I'm talking about, then you need to learn how to play Mahjong with friends and the real board game.  This is great for me, myself and I.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|It's a weak storyline but there is some decent acting, I was able to get through it. Guy and Shia make it worthwhile if you have nothing better to do.
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|I have only watched the first two discs so far and will probably only get back to watching the rest if I ever I run out of other things to watch. There were so many mistakes that could have been caught by interns with good information editing skills and a desire to fact check. There are misappropriations of titles, there are wrong dates given for films. There may even be willful omission of information, but I can't be sure. To make this short let me include just one example: The General was a silent film not a late 1930s film. In the section about the coming of sound, we hardly have any time to actually listen to any of the film clips of early sound films because Mark Cousins is always talking over them, and to many people, his voice is very grating. This is not a history of film as much as it is a personal free association: spoken poetry and musings set to film clips. It's Cousins' personal poem/opinion, to which he is entitled but it IS NOT an accurate or concise history regardless of the choices of inclusion or exclusion he has made, and particularly when he imagines influences of one director's work on others' without providing any proper links other than they look similar and therefore one must have influenced the others. I imagine that Cousins' knowledge ranges to the more contemporary and thus, the later discs about the global history of the last twenty years will probably be more thoughtful and better researched, one would think. However, his production staff's knowledge and absolute confidence in this limited knowledge of the first 50 years of film history can be disputed by going to more complete sources who rely on primary information. I would never recommend this to anyone who actually wanted to learn about the history of film. For those who want a personal long-winded \\"story\\", this is it.
B004JMY312|5.0|I've been watching this movie since I was a kid.  It's a Halloween tradition my home. Will rent again next year.
B000T0XED6|4.0|Pollini is Pollini here; great technique, clarity, and power.  More unique is the mediocre recording quality.  There is an almost (but not quite) Nimbus-like distance and reverb which loses some of the treble and some clarity in faster passages.  Yet you hear lots of breathing from Pollini AS IF the mics were close - maybe they were close and the room acoustic is to blame for the echo-chamber effect.  So the sound here has the disadvantages of both distant microphones and close mics.  Frustrating and unnecessary.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I haven't finished reading this yet, but it is definitely a very gripping story and well written. Keeps you coming back for more (and this hasn't been easy for me to find because I normally read a ton, but in the past year or two, I haven't had the time, so that says a lot!).
081299471X|5.0|Like the heading says, a beautiful edition.  Also, I had seen the movie and that made me want to read the book.  I am SO GLAD I READ THE BOOK.  The book is SO much better.  The movie was brilliant, don't get me wrong - but the book is breathtaking.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|its a good movie and all, but i hate the fact that it was sent via u.s.p.s it had a broken cover.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Perfect edition - I just wanted the dvd - for what else is there anyway?  I could say so much about the content of this film, so I won't say anything except you MUST buy it.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|It gives realistic ideas on developing and maintaining audience attention.  I have implemented many of the tips and believe they will bring my presentation to a different level.
B000VE439Y|5.0|I love Monty Python, I love irreverent humor and I am not a Christian.  But this movie does not spit on Christianity. Need I say more?
0525958002|5.0|A beautiful piece of history for anyone interested in the pre-80s and beyond British music scene.  Makes you wish to go back in time!
B000I0QL82|5.0|I just finished watching this wonderful DVD.  It's so clear and perfect now that watching is a pleasure.  This movie is an annual event, one that signals the beginnings of the holidays for me.  There's just such a great connection between all the actors with Bing and Fred leading the way. I love the music, I love the dancing, I love everything about Holiday Inn.  And I get to see the WHOLE movie - not some PC version of it that the movie channels think I should watch.  I don't like having the song Abraham censored, it's part of the movie and I want to see it.  Well, now I can since it is right where it belongs - between New Years Eve and Valentines Day.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell's silly humor keeps everyone laughing. My family watches this movie every Christmas, now. While Will Ferrell is usually known for his raunchy humor, the humor in Elf is innocent, silly, and good for everyone. I'd highly recommend.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a typical love story book, but kept my attention and was a fun story.  I liked it quite a bit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A unique and interesting story with great pacing. The world that Hugh Howey creates is detailed and fascinating, and the book has a great deal of intrigue throughout.
B005LAJ212|3.0|There was too much killing and it was corny, also.  I was disappointed in it.  I would not order Season 2.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The writer brings you right in and captures your interest throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|White Noise has a wonderful variety of sounds to choose from. My favorites are &#34;shower&#34;, &#34;brown noise&#34;, &#34;violet noise&#34;, and &#34;fire&#34;. The only way this app would be better is if it offered over-lapping (custom-made) sounds that could be saved under a favorite option. Occasionally, certain sounds start sounding repetitive and so it would be nice if the sound bits (loops) were longer, but overall this app is great.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Highly recomended from my view. My brother loved it alot. I didn't expect to find this sooo cheap. Nice job
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very challenging and fun. My kids love it, but I enjoy it almost as much. Great graphics and a fun holiday theme in place right now. Allows you to unlock other characters as you progress, as well as hover boards, etc. Very enjoyable
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Despite all of the smut that is in these books, they have an amazing story line! I could not put them down. It seriously only took me like three days to read all 3 books. I recommend them for anyone 18 and older.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Bought the blu Ray.  Movie is great but i've always been a big fan of marvel comics.  would not hesitate to buy it again.  looking forward to ironman 3
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a compelling and lovable film. Really enjoyed watching it. Highly recommend you see it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is much better than the factory supplied calculator that came with my Android. I did not use it much on my phone, but installed it on my tablet, which I use in meetings. This came in handy so many times that I recommended it to my entire staff!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good acting helped get through a somewhat confusing plot during first 20% of the film. Lots of shooting, which didn't sit well after the Connecticut massacre, but that's what this genre offers. Plus a good chase scene on motorcycles. In the end, we found the story and characters enjoyable.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I Love Lady Gaga's New CD I would recommend it to anyone looking to find them selves in music. Its amazing buy it!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The film comes across in commercials as a comedy, but it is actually a frank treatment of the all-to-common loss of joy in a long marriage. Couples remain close and devoted, but lapse into dull routine and lack of passion. Old married couples--beware before going to this together! It's done well-enough, but the dialogue is obvious and I wish there was some real humor interjected.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|it started a little slow but picked up in true Bourne fashion....liked the way they left it open for another and maybe a way to work Jason Bourne back into the fold.....
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I knew I'd by this album just because I loved Locked out of Heaven so much.  And it did not disapoint.  LOVE YOU BRUNO!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie certainly has a place in the Alien story, although there are a few things I though could have been done better. Being a big fan of Alien and Aliens, I would recommend seeing it. Maybe not owning it but worth renting for Alien fans. I'm on the fence about the rating because the next morning I woke up running through the story over and over again in my head. At first I thought it was a 3-star, but the next day was thinking more of a 4. So... 3 1/2.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great suspense that keeps you guessing until the last page. Quite modern in style, lively and quick. I will recommend it to my friends.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The move starts well, gets you wondering what is going on. Maybe a 1/3 of the movie leaves you wanting more action, however it delivers towards the end. Opens up a whole new chapter to these stories.
B005LAII3A|4.0|Totally better than the original!  This is a very, very good movie.  This is a case of the remake being pretty much better than the original in just about every way.  I was surprised.  That was unexpected.  There have been remakes that are no better than the original, or not even as good.  Case in point is \\"Clash of the Titans\\".  The remake of that film is very good, but could not quite match Ray Harryhausen's original.  Sure, the special effects were better, but it's hard to match the original casts of Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Harry Hamlin, and Burgess Meredith.  To me, the writing and the acting are mostly what makes a good movie.  The other stuff, the special effects, are just icing on the cake.  So, what makes this remake of \\"Total Recall\\" better than the original?  As I have stated above, the writing and the acting.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenneger has a more imposing physical presence than Colin Farell, but there is no doubt who the better actor is.  Colin's performance is a bit understated compared to Arnold's, but in my mind, that's for the better.  And you do not have to make excuses for Colin's acting abilities.  The standout performance here comes from Kate Beckinsale.  As I have said of her before in my previous movie reviews, she has established herself as one of the top female action stars in the business.  Not only that, she actually has the acting chops to pull off just about any role she's been in.  I actually cannot recall a movie in which she performed badly.  The Lori character has been expanded from the original role played by Sharon Stone.  And maybe that has to do with director Len Wiseman being Kate's real-life spouse, but it was a very good call on his part.  Or rather the writer's part.  I admit to being a fan of Beckinsale's, but she honestly is very good at her craft.  At this point in her career, she is one of the best all-around actresses in Hollywood.  Ofcourse, Jessica Biel is also one very good performer.  Jessica gets better and better every year.  And as she gets older, her sensuality and her sexiness also mature.  This Jessica Biel has a different screen presence than the one that played Abigail in \\"Blade\\".  Her acting has been solid ever since \\"Easy Virtue\\".  There is very good chemistry between the three leads in this film.  And credit goes to the leads' having lots of acting experience under each of their belts.  This movie has an all-star cast.<br /><br />Doug Quaid is an underpaid assembly line worker in a robot factory.  He lives in a dumpy apartment, and yet, has a very beautiful and quite obviously sophisticated wife.  He has been having strange dreams lately.  Bothered by those dreams, he decides to visit Rekall.  Rekall is a provider of recreational fantasy, delivered in the form of memory injections.  Basically, you can experience your chosen fantasy using memory implants to trick your brain.  Basically, Rekall takes you on a brain trip, and your brain cannot differentiate between those memories and reality while it's \\"tripping\\".  While at the Rekall recreation clinic, Doug experiences a complication.  The proprietor then tells us this is due to a conflict between the memory that Doug already has in his head and those they are trying to put in.  So, yeah, obviously Doug is more than just a production technician who assembles robots in a factory line.  The police SWAT team barges in and storms the clinic.<br /><br />It is hard to write a review without spoiling the plot.  In this case, I believe most of you will already have a good idea of the central plot.  Doug manages to elude the SWAT team and makes it back to his house.  As he tells Lori what happened at the clinic, he is further surprised when she tries to kill him.  A very entertaining fight breaks out.  Great choreography and stunt work, by the way.  Doug manages to escape and meets up with Melina.  She knows who he is, but it takes him quite some time to accept that his real name is Carl.  The story then diverges from that of the original, but I do not believe that is necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />In any case, this is a very good movie.  Len Wiseman shows once again just how capable of a director he is.  I think this is his genre.  He is good with these action films.  Bokeem Woodbine, Bill Nighy, Bryan Cranston, and John Cho play very capable supporting roles.  All in all, a solid action movie.om that of the original, but I do not believe that is necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />In any case, this is a very good movie.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is just a simple review.  The game was fun to play &amp; figure out.  It's very pretty.  Navigation was a tiny bit tricky - but nothing to really complain about.  Run on a Galaxy Nexus, CM10.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Don't expect the cool sultry Krall on this trainwreck. I don't know what she was thinking with the material and arrangements. Bad all around.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book. Made me think.... and you gotta love when time travel and JFK come together a book I won't soon forget
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I lve this series.  It's erotic but with a great story line.  I would recommend this to anyone to read
B009VSW15Y|3.0|It really needs a flash option, but other than that, it gets the job done for the most part, wish they'd make a better upgrade
B005LAII3U|3.0|[MINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW, though I reveal nothing that wasn't in the trailers; fans of the original already know what they're getting, for the most part, and I won't ruin the minor changes.]<br /><br />TOTAL RECALL is a loose adaptation of the 1990 film, which was itself an even looser adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.\\"  (Most Dick-to-film adaptations are incredibly loose...but I digress.)  The story is fairly simple, except that it isn't: Douglas Quaid is an everyman in the future, who has dreams of being a hero, fighting alongside a beautiful woman.  These dreams lead him to Rekall, where he's promised the adventure of a lifetime--totally simulated, of course.  Except things go wrong, and Quaid finds himself in a real-life espionage case...except, of course, it may all be the fictional programming.<br /><br />Okay.  Snicker all you want, those of you who've watched the film.  Paul Verhoeven's original actually left viewers a sense of doubt; while not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time, it was a great action vehicle that presented some surprisingly deep characterization, and prompted quite a bit of thought on the part of the viewer (it was and remains a very political film).  Len Wiseman's remake never leaves much to the imagination.  We know who to root for because he's good looking and charismatic and, well, his wife's just not a nice lady.  Wiseman gave us UNDERWORLD and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, so we shouldn't bee expecting much depth in the first place.  (And the script is by-the-numbers; great actors like Bryan Cranston and Colin Farrell chew their way through dialogue that is far beneath them; Cranston's entire purpose is to reiterate the plot, for those in the audience who weren't following along.)  Wiseman is keen on visuals, not characterization; and yes, this is a very visual movie, though not as awe-inspiring as the original still remains.  It's got a grittiness that one can't help but like, however, and the action sequences are well-choreographed (perhaps too well).<br /><br />The acting isn't that great; don't be surprised.  Farrell has proven he's got the charisma to be a lead actor in more independent films (IN BRUGES is a modern classic), and on TV's BREAKING BAD, Cranston has become the epitome of the villain everyone loves to hate.  But here, they've got two-dimensional parts.  It's nice to see Farrell getting a paycheck, but that's basically all this is.  As our femme fatales, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel have big shoes to fill; Beckinsale proves she's up to the challenge (she's done this before), Biel not so much.  Billy Nighy drops by for a bit and does his brooding thing, and Bokeem Woodbine just oozes charm as Quaid's friend.  There's a nice (yet confusing) cameo in the unrated version; I won't spoil it.  And that's about all we get on the acting front.  It's all we can expect.  TOTAL RECALL is a film to be enjoyed with your friends, tossing popcorn into your mouth and laughing at all of the absurdities, while simultaneously being impressed that we have the technology to make films like this.  Is it in any way comparable to the original?  Of course not.  But if you're looking for a night's entertainment, and don't want to think too much, then give it a shot.e action sequences are well-choreographed (perhaps too well).<br /><br />The acting isn't that great; don't be surprised.

B0018OIK0E|4.0|This was a crazy, funny movie. I loved the subtle humor and the gory zombie scenes made for an edge-of-my-seat experience. The movie was cleverly written and enjoyable.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This is a really good movie. If you like movies in the vampire genre I highly recommend that you see this one.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Like all the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, this was pretty good for an action movie. Well acted, well directed, etc. I just didn't think the story was terribly compelling -- without giving anything away (although I'm probably the last person to have seen this thing), it just seems like the incidents were rather arbitrary and didn't really build upon each other the way a movie this well received should.
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie is also, limited character development and even Channing couldn't help and they wasted Matthew Bomer's many talents, it is a shame!
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE HD AND THAT I AM A PRIME MEMBER. THAT I CAN RENT THE MOVIE AND IT STAYS IN MY KINDLE UNTIL I WATCH IT IS THE BEST, AMAZING THING FOR ME.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Love the soundtrack, though it is not my favorite of all of the ones released. I love the variety that it offers. And Green Day makes everything a little better.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I had to restart this movie several times and still had trouble being interested in it all the way through.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I am so in love with this movie! I have probably watched it a hundred times, and I may watch it a hundred more before I get tired of it. If I ever do get tired of it!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|If you like superheros, you will LOVE this movie! This movie is action packed and the story line is easy to follow.
030758836X|4.0|I was expecting a lot out of this book. Between the reviews on Amazon and from my friends, I thought I was going to be reading something so amazing I would want to re-read it immediately. It was good, but it was not that good. I think maybe my expectations were just too high to give it a fair read.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|My kindle fit perfectly, and it was very easy to get it in correctly. This case works just as described, all the buttons are easily accessible, and my kindle goes into sleep mode when the case is closed. similar cases I viewed online we're at twice the price. I got the purple case, it's more of a dull purple than it appeared to be,  even so it's attractive enough. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a case.
B00136S0NE|5.0|My wife and I both loved this movie, and we recently watched it again on DVD. She asked me, &#34;Why do I not have this in my car?&#34; Naturally, I immediately bought it for her. Happy wife = happy life!
B008Y7IFSA|5.0|It's not by Jim Henson, but by his son. It's funny and moving at the same time in old style muppet form.  A classic, definitely fit for a family Christmas.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has a great story plot. It's a good book to curl up by the fire and read. I highly reccommend this book for a enjoyable read. I did give it a 5 star rating for the reason at the end it made be feel good.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|a good read... nicely woven story. twists and turns. believable, likable characters. vivid imagery. away from the grime and hustle of the city... what else can you ask for!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is a fun game.I love how you have a jetpack in the game.Why do some people give this app bad reviews?
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to come out! Probably going to watch the season again before next season comes out.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. You need to use quick reflexes and I t is Challenging. I love how the farther you progress the harder it is and the coins start gaining more value. The only thing is the characters prices are ridiculous.
B005NNURES|5.0|I was really not sure what to expect, I love Pink Floyd, This is really a great remaster of the final cut
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|This is a very good movie. Just dont let the kids watch it. It is a must see for the Family Guy followers.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|The cover came in good condition and on time.  It is perfect to protect the kindle and it is nice to be able to stand the kindle up.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not the best Harry Bosch novel.  Usually Connelly's books are a fast read.  This one dragged a lot. I was disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You will have to keep reading and it is an easy read.  A good ending to the trilogy, I think 2 was the best though.
B00AAQ7JNA|1.0|I bought this for my wife as she is a huge Rihanna fan. Well, she is disappointed to say the least. She loves to blast her Blu-Ray concerts on our surround sound and the audio from this Blu-Ray falls way below expectations. Like another has mentioned, there is NO HD AUDIO. Just Dolby Digital 5.1, which is abysmal and Dolby Digital Stereo which makes it sound like Im listening to it through the TV speakers.<br />To compare, I bought my wife, one of the other Rihanna concerts, on DVD(Good Girl Gone Bad) and the audio on the DVD is MUCH better compared to this one. The songs that have bass do not have any bass and when it does hit, if any, it sounds off.<br />Video quality is just average, slightly better than DVD.<br />Also, there is no pop-up menu!<br />Very disappointed in this, not Amazon, but the audio producers of this Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Heres a hint for the audio producers: If you're going to offer a concert on Blu-Ray, make sure it has HD Audio!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first book, you will not be able to put down the second.  It only took a couple days to read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|From page 1, I was hooked.  Great book.  I have recommended it to everybody I know.  Based on this book, I ordered another Garth Stein book.  Hope it's half as good as Art of Racing in the Rain
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I heard all the hype about this movie when it came out. And then the awful tragedy in the theater. I expected it to be more than it was. It was unrealistic at times, and it was too BIG at times. A lot continuity questions for me also (how did a broke Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham so quickly?). It had the potential to be a good story at the start, but later on the film, it just got unrealistic.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Its book that makes you think about how well you know your children. I haven't finished it yet, but love reading it.
B000SVZIGC|1.0|We had just moved our daughters room, and I had not hooked up all of her DVD/BluRay/TV stuff yet.  My wife bought this movie for our daughter.  When it came in, she was all excited so unfortunately that meant we HAD to watch it on the big tv in the living room.  SO.....The movie is some cartoon about a girl in Russia who is at a dance and some guy gives her a necklace.  Some magician shows up and puts a curse on the girls family which of course causes communism in Russia.  Some guy offers a big reward if someone can find the little girl, but she was at an orphanage and had lost her memory or something like that.  There was something about a job at a factory that processes fish, and a stray dog was in there somewhere as well.  It was about this point that I got off the couch, went upstairs, and installed all of the AV gear in my 12 year old daughters room so she can watch this kind of mess in HER room, and I won't ever have to sit thru something like this again.  That's about all I can tell you about this movie.
B005MJ883K|5.0|I purchased this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas last year and he absolutely loved it!! It is challenging for sure, but every member of the family (9 and 11 year old boys) loved it as well. Definitely a good purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! It is perfect for any age and is great for keeping your mind sharp! Super fun! I highly recommend :)
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|My favorite will always be the original Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. I would have to say I preferred The Dark Knight to The Dark Knight Rises, mostly due to Heath's joker. This one seemed to drag a bit, too slow in parts. I did enjoy Tom Hardy's Bane though. He was one creepy dude.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I can only give it 1 Star because I could not finish watching it.  I heard better reviews and just didn't fall for it.  I was hoping to Love it.  Not so.  There are some funny seconds and Mark Wahlberg knows how to deliver a joke.  The story is shallow and you just sit or (stand) and hope for a funny joke
B008XKT9FG|5.0|A wonderful romance movie. Keeps viewers on their toes about whats about to come next. Is he cheating? Is he faithful? Very good acting and wonderful storyline.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I was a little skeptical about a Bourne movie without Matt Damon, but I thought I would try it and I loved it!  Kept me in suspense the whole time!  Jeremy Renner was awesome!
B0053TMP24|5.0|They are probably meant for a younger crowed but i just love how easy to read an entertain they  are
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Steve Carrel shows he can act like a normal person; Meryl Streep looked a little like Maggie Thatcher at times; and man! is Tommy Lee Jones OLD! but this is a good story and worth the watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is by far one of the best series on TV this year.  If you have not been following this series you are missing out.  Little warning show is gory, however that made it a little more interesting to me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter downloaded this for me and I am having so much fun with it.  I like that it is challenging and I do have to retry sometimes.
1451695195|1.0|This book is not scientifically accurate, not medically accurate, makes wild unsupported claims, cobbles together a bunch of stories from other NDE books, presents nothing new or fresh, and is written by a man much too certain of his own importance. Trash. Actual score? Negative five stars.
0740748475|4.0|The box set is exactly what I've been looking for as a gift to my grandfather who's been a fan of Watterson's work since I was a child, if not longer.<br /><br />Was intended as a gift, so slightly disappointed when I noticed I had to remove the shrink-wrap protecting it to remove a sticker with the price placed on the box set it self, makes it feel a little bit like a second hand gift, but other than that I was very happy with the purchase.
B001676320|5.0|After listening to these great bands and artists, I feel like I left the earth and went on mystical ride with a one-way-ticket.  Who needs alcohol or mary jane or any narcotics, not me, this music makes me &#34;high as kite.&#34;  I LOVE IT!
B0098VYKSA|1.0|Ugh, what a piece of crap. From the visuals shown in the trailer, I thought this movie would at least be tolerable but it really wasn't. I don't know how they got Charlize Theron or Chris Hemsworth to sign on for this, but they both seemed to have been taking acting lessons from Kristen Stewart (read as &#34;a very BAD thing&#34;). No redeeming qualities whatsoever for me.
B002RB7VMA|4.0|This is a pleasant to listen to Michael Buble album at a good price.  If you like his style music go for it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game has a very simple premise, and fairly decent graphics to support it. Essentially...you run. That's about it. Run, occasionally turn and jump. And collect coins. And die. You'll do that a lot. There's quite a lot of fun to be had doing it though.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Very entertaining great show cant wait for the new season. Love amazon instant video best ever ! fast and easy !
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. I love 'Family Guy' and Seth Macfarlane cracks me up, but I didn't know if he could pull off a live action (mostly) comedy. It was hilarious, if a bit contrived and familiar in plot. It also has some of the best one-liners of the decade so far.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. I liked how the story moved along quickly. It wasn't drug out like so many other books are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great site for people who like sharing photos, recipes, craft ideas, etc...and this app allows for decent browsing on a tablet. It is a little too easy to burn hours pinning stuff to it, though.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|My wife and I are both fans of Family Guy so we thought we would give Ted a try.  Big mistake.  We were barely able to get through it (I actually fell asleep in the middle).  Not recommended.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I've never seen the original 'Dark Shadows' soap opera, so I can't speak to just how faithful this Tim Burton film is. That said, I did really enjoy this gothic and creepy, sometimes funny vampire romp.
B007YJS7G4|5.0|I like the story, I like that it is based on a true story, I like the quality of the film, I like the choice of actors in the film; and, most of all, I like that the story is being told, and retold, to show a &#34;positive African-American impact&#34; on American history.  I like that the movie shows the &#34;struggles&#34; Black people had to endure to service their country in a time of global war when Jim Crow ruled America.  A great story that I hope will be told over and over again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This seems like a pretty good game...for someone. I just didn't completely understand what was going on, even with the tutorial info available. It's fun to build, but the game doesn't seem to go anywhere.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This concert was filmed after the death of original & founding member, drummer John Panozzo. The line up in this concert DVD includes: Dennis DeYoung on lead vocals & keyboards, Tommy Shaw on guitar & mandolin & lead vocals, JY Young on guitar & lead vocals, Chuck Panozzo on bass guitar, & Todd Sucherman on drums. The theme of this concert is \\"The Grand Re-Opening of the Paradise Theatre\\". It was filmed on the Autumnal Equinoz, 1996 in Chicago.<br /><br />This is a fantastic hard rocking concert, however they take time out to remember the late John Panozzo, and dedicate the song \\"Show Me the Way\\" to him.<br /><br />You get a bonus backstage interview with Tommy Shaw. Although the band Styx formed in Chicago, Tommy Shaw is originally from Montgomery, Alabama. There is even a Styx River in South Alabama.<br /><br />I recently saw Styx live in concert and they put on one heck of a show. Overall, if you like Styx, you'll love this concert.
B0016CVN02|5.0|I never knew just how many Stones songs I've come to love over the years until I got this set. Now I can listen to everything from 'Paint it Black' to '19th Nervous Breakdown' without switching discs or folders.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I absolutely love my lifeproof case! I owned an otterbox prior to purchasing this case and it basically fell apart on me. The lifeproof case is less bulky and way more attractive!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When I first received my Kindle I had a quick overview for it and one of the apps that was used was this one.  it really is easy to use.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift for a member of my family.  As a big fan, she should really enjoy it.
B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed the saga I  recommend  this to all.  I gave it only 4stars as it been a little slower reading,in fact as of now I haven' finshed One thing  would like if there was a list of characters  to keep track of them.  If there is a list would someone tell me how to get them.  I  most likely get the next novel of this series.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Great dialogue and suspense.  Mitch Rapp and CIA Director Kennedy have all the right moves.  Flynn gets the culture of our clandestine services and is able to share it with the reader in a very readable and fast-moving way!
B00846REIS|5.0|O i just love this series...I had recently read the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; series and a friend told me about these.  though the books are similar they are also very different... I love these and i am patiently awaiting the next
B000NY12LO|4.0|I've read a lot of her books, but this is one of my favorites. It's meaningful and interesting. I'd read it again.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I didn't like the way the author cut books four and five apart and even though I liked both books, I'd have preferred one long book instead. I thought it kind of broke up the continuity for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead Rocks<br /><br />  The Story line yeah I know zombies, this show rocks. very easy to start taking sides. I enjoy it even if I think the writer have not soul at times. great show.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My entire family loves this movie.  I am a huge superhero fan.  So you could imagine my excitement when the Avengers came out.  I couldn't buy this movie fast enough.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I am overwhelmed with emotion as I sit here contemplating what to write about Ponyo. That might sound silly, but it's true. Here is an animated film which focuses on two children who are about 5-years-old, but the story works for any adult who is open to being moved by its charming characters. To be precise, one of the children begins life as a fish, before undergoing a transformation.<br /><br />Director Hayao Miyazaki is some kind of magician. If you have ever seen My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Princess Mononoke, you'll know what to expect from Ponyo. It's closest in feel to Totoro because of the ages of the main characters. Miyazaki's animations look like watercolor paintings rather than the 3D worlds found in Pixar's releases, but although they are less real, they have more warmth and heart than the world's second-best animation studio. I don't say that lightly.<br /><br />If you're put off by the title, or the fact that the film was made in Japan, set aside those fears immediately. The Blu-ray comes with the original Japanese dub (although only in 5.1 Dolby Digital), and an HD dub from Disney for the US market featuring actors you mostly already know.<br /><br />Ponyo has a special place in my heart because it is the first Studio Ghibli title that I ever bought. I had borrowed one or two before from my local library, but this first glimpse of Miyazaki's work in HD is something I will never forget. The experience begins with five minutes of action without any dialog, and the colors, imagination, movement, and sheer beauty of the animation will take your breath away. If Kubrick had made an animated film, the first five minutes might look similar.<br /><br />After the initial sequence, we meet Sosuke (Frankie Jonas). He's a small boy who discovers something while he's playing by the beach; it turns out to be Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), who he mistakes for a goldfish. She's trapped in a discarded bottle, so he helps her break free. When he cuts his finger in the process, she licks the wound and heals him. Yes, Ponyo is a magical creature. The taste of human blood changes her nature. Sosuke takes care of her and keeps her in a bucket, but she is later returned to the ocean.<br /><br />Ponyo's undersea world is just as fascinating as the one above. Her father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), is some kind of wizard who makes elixirs and helps keep nature in balance. He doesn't trust humans and fears for Ponyo's safety, so he's reluctant to allow her to leave her home. What he doesn't know is that Ponyo has come to love Sosuke, and wants to transform herself into a human girl so that she can be with him.<br /><br />The two most common complaints I have heard about the film are that it is intended for small children and the story is hard to follow. I have never had trouble following the plot, and I think it will work for anyone who doesn't dismiss it as being too childish without even seeing it. This is a film for parents as well as children.<br /><br />Miyazaki is an incredible study of human nature and knows exactly how to depict emotion in his drawings. I would say that it's almost impossible to watch without being moved in a positive way. Like Totoro, the story takes place in a world in which people care about each other. There are no villains of any kind. The story relies on events to drive it, and it's never boring. Notice how supportive Sosuke's mother (Tina Fey) is when he tells her that he's rescued a fish and that she has turned into a girl, or the respect that Sosuke has for his elders. There are a lot of good messages here for children (and adults).<br /><br />I want to mention two more scenes before I stop talking about the plot. The first is one of the purest expressions of joy I have ever witnessed in a film, and shows Ponyo running along on top of the waves as she tries to reach Sosuke. Look at the expression on her face. She only has one thought, and it's driven by love. The other scene shows Ponyo and Sosuke recovering indoors after being soaked in a storm. It's meaning might not be immediately apparent, but if you have ever been cold or wet, remember how good it felt to be warmed by a meal and a hot drink. Miyazaki includes these scenes because every human being can identify with such feelings. Instead of being bombarded by action and conflict, we are shown a world in which real things happen, and the scenes are stronger because of it.<br /><br />Ponyo is a magical story. It's hard to watch without breaking into a grin, and that feeling lasts for the duration of the film. If you decide to watch it and find that it touches you in the same way, I urge you to check out Miyazaki's entire catalog if you haven't already done so.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is excellent. The image can't be faulted and the US dub sounds great. The only tiny criticism is that the Japanese dub is not lossless, but at least it is present for those who insist on seeing films in their original language.ndoors after being soaked in a storm.

B004NEY9EW|4.0|This one didn't feel like the normal Bond movie. It was really good though. Direct sequal to Casino Royale.<br />Make sure you watch it before Skyfall!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Can all the flows be solved?  It seems like some of them are not possible.  Maybe add a hint to assist.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has resurrected the Classic Spaghetti Western of the 1960's era with a story of a facet of slavery with class, dignity, and accuracy in his film \\"Django Unchained\\".  His portrayal of love is so aptly expressed in the Original Score \\"Ancora Qui\\" sung by Italian singer/songwriter Elisa.  And, one that is worthy of an Oscar nomination.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Make it more of a challenge by making it harder to solve. I like puzzles that make me think more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game.  I just don't like how slow it is after you reach a certain level. If you want to spend the money I'm sure you can level faster.  I agree with another reviewer. I would rather pay a small monthly fee and level based on my game play and not my pocketbook.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Book 5 (sort of like Book 4) was good but felt neither here nor there... it raised more questions than it answered (though, to be fair, it answered very few) and there was a bit too much going on. If Book 6 sees the resolution (i.e., end) of some of the plots, it would be more manageable. Considering the sheer number of characters, I'm starting to worry that the ending(s) can't possibly be completely satisfying.<br /><br />Also, the quality of the writing seems to have gone down. I assume there's pressure from the publisher, etc., but it's not an excuse for some of the laziness that has crept in. First, there are far more cliched phrases (and more repetition of the ones that are used). Second, the idioms used are clear (sometimes direct) copies of modern-day ones. This is a fantasy series, so although I'm happy to suspend my disbelief vis-a-vis certain things, it somehow breaks the fourth wall when the dialogue reads like it could take place today in the &#34;real&#34; world. Finally, it feels like the detailed descriptions of auxiliary characters are being used to fill space. And, whereas earlier in the series, seemingly minor characters would later become important, this doesn't seem to be happening with anywhere near the same frequency.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're this far in the series, you're going to read the book no matter what. But if the writing were of this quality in the first book (or two, maybe even three), you wouldn't have made it this far.
B001KSJ08Y|5.0|I love every song on this record, every must have for  any twihard!  The price was great and the company sent it in a timely fashion, I will do business with them again.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The series is still solid -- writing is believable, characters are good, and enough suspense is resolved for the read to be satisfying.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is way to much fun Iam allready hooked .It keeps chalenging you to do better and get a higher score
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is great. The writing is tight, characters are believable, and the drama -- although omnipresent -- is gripping.<br /><br />Having read all five books, the only caution I have is that the series drops in quality. It may get better in later books (i.e., after Book Five), but right now, the decline has been steady though not uniform: the first three books are all pretty great, while the fourth is confused/confusing, while the fifth is almost hard to read.
B000002LR6|5.0|This album holds a certain nostalgic spot in my heart, because it was released in the first few years of the 90's. I  was in high school, and the industrial music boom was sweeping the world. Nine inch nails had become a household name, even though this was the era of grunge. It seemed as though every band tried their hand at industrial/electronic. But noone did it quite as well as ministry, and this album is a masterpeice of it's time. Ministry creates hard driving songs that are clearly metal, yet rythmic and catchy. \\"Scarecrows\\" has a haunted feel that will stay with you long after the song is over. \\"Tv 2\\" is a frantic guitarwork and rolls at a n insane pace. \\"Psalm 69\\" is clearly the gem on this album, although not one song is filler material. There has not been a darker, more potent, or more technically precise album from ministry than this one. If you haven't heard this one, you are missing out.

0307450570|5.0|Love the crafts, love the instructions, and she has unusual projects that you'd WANT to make.<br /><br />The book brings out the ADD in me.  I can't decide which project to do first.<br /><br />But I've tried several and was very pleased with the result.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The first three books were pretty solid and this one is still pretty good... but the number of characters/plot lines is starting to feel overwhelming.<br /><br />My concern is that there will be too much for any satisfactory resolution.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|For the life of me I cannot understand what the hype is all about, possibly some good marketing.<br />If erotica is your deal this is probably the worst story line I have ever read.<br />Very badly written and not even a good story. It's like weak bad tea!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I expected a little more for paying for the game. The free version is better. Especially when I get to the part which says it's still under construction. Heck why did I pay $2.99 just to tell me I still have to wait to play portions of the game. You did not wait for you money!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My daughter misplaced the original charger for the Kindle Fire. After purchasing other \\"so-called\\" chargers locally, they never worked and were a waste of money especially when the stores wouldn't accept the return of the open package.<br /><br />Upon receipt of the charger, I plugged it in and it immediately started charging. My daughter was ecstatic as it was weeks she couldn't use her Kindle. Now I can't get her off it LOL<br /><br />Thank you so much and I would definitely recommend this charger to fellow Kindle users!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I have tried on numerous occassions to make the program work. There are no instructions to tell you how to play the game. I downloaded the program for the one year old. I thought she would like the pretty colors. You can barely make out the one little pony. Really, if you give somethin g away for free, can it be something I can use for more than just to look at and wonder what it does. Don't waste your time with this one.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I really loved this book!  Maybe because I loved Delirium so much as well.  I had just finished reading that and discovered the sequel of Pandemonium, which I loved as well as Delirium.  I would recommend it for anybody that enjoys a good story.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy playing the game at night right before bedtime. It is a great way to wind down. It's also a way to think outside of the box!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Good to catch up with my old friends in the book. Always a good mystery. Hard to put down until the end.
1576875776|5.0|This book is a wonderful collection of the photographs of a very talented, unsung artist. The quality is fantastic. It is really a great deal and I highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of my new favorite books of all time!!! Colleen Hoover just writes perfection. My words cannot accurately describe how I feel about this book. It's brilliant. I loved it, everything about it. Holder is freaking amazing. Sky is the perfect book heroine. The story is fresh. I would recommend to anyone and everyone. So butterflying fantastic!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|fantastic. It lives up to the promise of the first volume and I am eagerly awaiting the third one!! Having been  a history major in college it is a joy to read and educational too!
B007HACDLK|5.0|this is the latest in the wonderful series of books. Mitch is back and bad as ever. got to hope America has some real life Rapps out there.
0817439390|5.0|I am still reading through the book and as a hobbyist photographer I already have a better understanding of exposure. The book for me is easy to understand with the online video aid and in book exercises it gave me a conceptual grasp on how all the elements that make a creative shot better. Yes, I would recommend this to a beginner or someone who it tired of pointing a shooting and not understanding all the elements of ISO,F-stop etc. that come into play.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I had a hard time believing the intricate plot and all the deal-making with Federal prosecutors, but it's supposed to be fiction, so who cares? This was more fun than many of his books, such as The Chamber and An Innocent Man - both are in the 5-star social commentary arena, along with King's The Green Mile.<br /><br />Many of Grisham's books point out injustices in some part of the legal system. This one left me wondering if Federal prosecutors are really as vicious as he has depicted them. Entertaining and a little scary.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I would recommend to any penguin lover or any litle kid, my wife loves penguins and also loved this movie and happy feet.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My favorite game. Everyone made  fun of me....until they played  and got<br />hooked. Hope they continue  to update and add new missions.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|My wife loves penguins she absolutly loved this movie. She also bought happy feet 2 and loved that movie. Both the two movies were really good. I recommend any penguin lover or little kid.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I would have given it more stars, but after playing 3 time times for free I was prompted to buy it to go on playing.  This is not my idea of FREE!!!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Best to date look forward to more. Believer or nonbeliever the music works the messages of the creator. Keep it coming
B0000E1WKE|5.0|You must have this one in your Christmas Holiday song collection.  This one is a keeper by this great recording artist.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Enjoyed this one very much, but as other reviewers have said it's probably not the right Culture novel for an introduction to Banks' universe(s). Much like Matter, Hydrogen features a female protagonist swept up by the manipulations of a collection of Culture Minds, in this case as her entire race is about to &#34;sublime&#34; off to a higher dimension. Scavenger races impinge and the conflict begins. Recommended Banks-ian reading.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Put the kids to bed before watching the unrated version.  I put this one up there with &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34;, &#34;Team America&#34; and &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34;.  Mark my my words, it will be a comedy cult classic. I didn't realize Mark Wahlberg was so versatile. All I knew about him was he had a troubled youth, he was now a devout Catholic and family man that made movies about athletes making the long shot.  He really came out of his mold for this one.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good Harry Bosch novel. Harry is Harry, and this is the best Bosch novel in awhile. Hope Connelly continues the series, the character seems like he wants to retire.
B000WLTKXK|5.0|I read a review about this album that said it was probably the best live blues recording of all time.  After buying and listening I would have to agree that it is right on up there at the top.  Give it a listen if you haven't yet.
B009B2U73I|3.0|I'm used to full on, high quality music from Ms. Krall.  At first since this wasn't the usual recording of new standards I was hoping for another effort equal to &#34;The Girl in the Other Room&#34;.  It's not even close.  As they say I could listen to Diana sing the phone book so I haven't dismissed this recording completely.  But at least a third to a half of these tunes must have snuck their way onto this recording.  And Elvis Costello as a carnival barker (I assume) is really nerve wracking.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. This is a great game for all kids.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|So, what do you say about a dictionary?  It's handy to have on my phone and Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; when I need to cheat at Wordfeud.  :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter and are absolutely loves it. This is a great game for any kid.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|This looks and feels like Windows Explorer in that you have to navigate to the file/doc you want to print.  I have to admit that I'm lazy and don't want to work that hard to print from my tablet.  If it acted like an addin for email for example it would be much better.  I haven't seen too many alternatives though so until something more user friendly comes along it will have to do.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Humor mixed with action and a few surprises. Enjoyable family-friendly movie, with no nudity, profanity or overt sexual over tones.
B0059XTU1S|3.0|I know I am in the minority in my opinion of Peter Jackson's new Hobbit movie, but that's okay.  I found The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey to be way overdone visually.  It was not the scenes that I felt were overdone, but the action.  Several parts of the action involved such fantastic escapes from death that they eventually got tiresome to me, because of the lack of any realism to them.  Examples include collapsing scaffolding, immediately followed by a huge goblin falling on the entire company; mountains fighting each other (\\"stone giants\\") and every single member of the company being constantly on the edge of death but never quite falling; and a huge fight with orcs at the end which detracts from the story--the story is captivating in that there was no way for them to fight the orcs; they were completely helpless until the eagles arrived.  This movie, I felt like, tried to jam too much into an adventure, so that it didn't have the \\"incidental\\" enjoyment of the original story.  Instead of a set of interesting incidents like the book is, this seemed like one battle after another and like it was trying to fit in all the marginal events that go on in Middle Earth at the same time.  It wasn't nearly as enjoyable as I hoped it would be, for that reason.  I might even have lost my taste for the fantasy genre entirely if this movie were my only exposure to it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The movie is an action-packed adventure. It is very funny and the action sequences are almost seamless and it is very enjoyable.
B005PK553C|5.0|We purchased this season through our TV, and was able to watch it with no issues whatsoever completely through the TV. No problems.
B007X3DQGM|5.0|Well written, lots of hints  and many beautiful patterns.  The suggestions on<br />how to assemble  the motifs are an added plus.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so amazing I love it it was a great idea to make this app and I hope they make another app like this one
B0082RHRHC|4.0|This classic was as usual very enjoyable to read.  It is the type of book you can read and re-read and still be entertained by it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|How Great was that!! So many fun things to do and little Miles was a refreshing touch. Looked and played beautifully on KF. Cant wait to play it again in the next mode. fantastic job G5!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I don't think the story line is as good as season 1, but its still a great show. It's really interesting to see my favorite actors from last season come back in new roles.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I wish it was longer, I could have sat and watched an 8 hour version of this movie. I think Michael Keaton needs a cameo.......
B0070Y46UY|5.0|you will enjoy this tale of survival against quite a few unbelievable odds.  But isn't that just what miracles are?  This tale draws you into a world of fantasy and, if you believe, the power of faith.  Makes you think about a human beings capability to survive and the will to live.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love the 3D start off slow to be expected but was a big improve meant since the first one I read review on. If you read any horrible review under this movie keep in mind a lot of the bad ones post were intended for the old 3D version. You won't regret it :).
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Movie came when promised and as promised, always love disney movies, happy I could get this quickly and at a price equal to the stores

B004QX07G4|4.0|throughout. Every page made me laugh. I love the way Ellen's mind works. She can find humor in the smallest things.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|This is such a great album. I can't say that every song on here does it for me, but those that do REALLY do. There are so many different influences in his music that I think it appeals to a lot of different interests. Personally, I hear a little Van Morrison, Ben Harper, and maaaaybe a little Bob Marley. But it's all done in a very subtle and gentle way. It really is a beautiful album.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I already owned the first two movies on DVD, but purchased this trilogy set anyway because it barely costs more than the third movie by itself.<br /><br />Considering this trilogy doesn't even cost $20, the value here is pretty insane. You get the three best Batman movies to date in a nice folding style case and a \\"making of\\" booklet, all contained within a very sturdy and cool looking box.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the art booklet has to be in the box along with the DVD set in order to make everything fit snug. I wish the box width was designed for just the DVDs and the art booklet was separate. Hardly worth knocking a star off for, though.<br /><br />You also get an Ultra-Violet copy with this, but I've heard some pretty bad things about UV. Personally, I don't use digital copies of movies, so I couldn't care less.<br /><br />If you purchased this, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved everything about this book. Couldnt put it down and now im hooked on this author. I just wish there were more books on the main character in this story. This book continues to surprise until the very end. Loved it.

B004X4QW42|5.0|This has been the best martial arts movie ever that I've seeing in a few years.  Donnie Yen is one of the best martial art actors out there and he knows how to bring to life his character.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read several books by John Grisham, but was a bit disappointed by this one. It seemed as if he rushed the ending.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I found the book well written, well documented and covered all the bases I was wondering about.  Although I have not given it a full try yet, I did try a week without wheat and slept better along with losing 2 lbs.  I did nothing else different.<br />The holidays would be a really tough time for me to give the theory my full attention, so I will give it a go after the first of the year.  I see nothing to lose by giving it a try.<br />I am glad I purchase the book.  I would recommend it if you have any interest in this subject.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|I love playing Angry Birds, but not so much this one.  I have a slight vision problem, and the contrast between the birds and the background is not as sharp as other versions.  The biggest problem I have with this is that even though I bought the premium version..which I thought said advertisement free, there are advertisements on it.  Not a problem for me, but when my toddler plays it, I'm afraid she will click on it and buy something!
B003CSV7TK|4.0|I think the remake is better but this will always be the classic.  Still love it though and the colorization adds a lot to it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|MIB: 3 is well worth watching.  Will smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are all super in this movie. I'll probably buy it and watch it again soon.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Wonderful;  I've  watched it about 20 times since its first release.  I still love it; it's even better than the original.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a great read and so much fun and definitely an author i can recommend to all my friends
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. Easy to read and easy to use. It was handy to have on a recent vacation. I highly recommend it.
1401201911|4.0|The fact that Batman wears an Ushanka and reminds me of a crazed terrorist was all I needed to see to make me want to buy this comic.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  We all need to be aware/reminded of what is true and this book does that in spades.<br />If you had any doubts about God, immortality etc. this will answer them. I&#34;m so glad this came from the medical community and that the evidence is scientifically backed.  I found it fastinating and hopeful and relieving!
0670020478|5.0|The only thing I can really say about this book is that it opened my eyes. It did not make me find a passion but it made me realize that my passion is creating. I love to start with some very basic things and make something extravagant, this is why I loved art, carpentry, and cooking. If you are buying this book hoping that it tells you what you are good at STOP because it will not do that.<br /><br />Part of the point of this book is take make you undertake a spiritual adventure to discover your passion and if you can find that you can be happy in life.

B00117W1HQ|5.0|I like this type of program.  And it keeps interested though the whole show.  I can't wait to watch the next episode.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A little light in the details. I read it in less than three hours. Lone Survivor was much better than this book.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a gift. These shows are so funny, even enjoy watching the repeats. Plan on buying all the seasons.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I am not always an action movie person caught it on Showtime while I was sick could not get enough!

B0063IH60K|1.0|It's all advertising.  i removed it.  Words as advertised. Words required to fill in requirement to rate this product although it certainly isn't necessary.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Most of the cuts are very good, however a few of the guest singers don't sound as good singing along with the mellow voice of Tony Bennett. But, would purchase it again, many more good cuts than poor ones.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|'NUFF SAID.  WorKs as advertised. Words required to fill in requirement to rate this product although it certainly isn't necessary to rate product.
B007SGM084|4.0|It's a good read. The take off the twilight saga can get worrisome but the read turned out to be good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Simple, informative and responsive.  Allows for tracking during purchasing and selling.  It has most the basic functions to buy and sell on the site.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|has many of the channels that are in france-great for keeping up your french and for french living abroad and for francophiles
B0091REZMW|5.0|I loved this game on the computer and now its available for the kindle fire.  I'm so glad they came up with this
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Enjoyed reading, interesting story, it is a good change for a lot of the involved books I usually read. Good summer romance read. Liked the fact that it wasn't a lot of sexually explicit details, was enough to remember how sweet that first bloom of romance can be.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I find many USB cables tend to break/fray/otherwise fail at the point where the blocky end of the charger meets the wire cable.  This has a nice support piece in that location, plus the cable covering seems a bit thicker.  I hope this means extra longevity.  Otherwise, it has a nice tight connection to the Kindle Fire and doubles as a charger for my Samsung cell.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The price alone doesn't justify the amount of content in the game! Live concert footage of the songs...etc. Very addictive. It's slow to start at the beginning - the game will hold your hand during the first two hours but after that...you can easily sink hours and hours into the game. So much to do! The music and voice acting makes it very immersive.  Even if you have never played an rpg before or never tried a JRPG...play this! The gameplay mechanics and plot is like Scooby Doo + Yu-Gi-Oh all rolled into one. Get this game if you have the PS Vita.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Half way thru the second book, and I love this series. Historically based, covers lots of events not often covered in other historical fiction, really enjoying the characters and story.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I love this series.  Season 7 takes u to another season of bursts of laughters and nail biting suspenses.  I love and hate this serial at same time.. season F****g 7 and we still have not seen mother for God's sake!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Whether you want a simple calculator or a scientific one, this free app is just what you need for your Kindle Fire. The interface is excellent and the buttons are big enough for your fingers. I wholeheartedly recommend this app.
B002NJWHHA|3.0|I loved reading these books so I thought I will give it a chance based on my experience with Twilight and Harry Potter movies, but this one does not cut it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|not a very good movie -- interesting concept but thats about it.  Left a lot to be desired.  Would not watch again.
