B005721Y7Y|4.0|This was not a move I would have chosen to watch on my own.  I watched it with the purpose of completing a psychology assignment.  In the end, I thought the movie was pretty good.  The characters were great and the acting was great.  The end left something to be desired.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killer is one of those novels that you start reading with average expectations, and are quickly surprised by the fact that you cannot put it down because it's just too good!  The story has enough detail to excite, fascinate and yes...even scare you, without going overboard with the gore.<br /><br />The author knows how to write an intriguing mystery with plenty of twists and turns to keep you constantly guessing.  The dialogue between Max and Jesse is equally as strong.  This is the kind of book you can get lost in, and although you will finish the book feeling satisfied, you will be eagerly awaiting the next installment, as I am!<br /><br />This book as made a lasting impression on me, and I will certainly think twice before I \\"waste someone's time\\" in the future - you never know who could be a serial killer searching for his next innocent victim!<br /><br />~ Jenna V.

0451209338|4.0|I had not read any of Daniel Silva's books, so I decided to start with his first story of Gabriel Allon, Israeli Mosad agent.  Good story and very well written.  I didn't care for the ending, but just ordered the next book in the series anyway.  I don't think you absolutely need to read the stories in order, since each mission is different, but I understand that Gabriel's character development progresses with each book.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|My fiance bought this for me, as I recently ran through the entirety of \\"new Who\\" in about a month.  We were looking at both screwdrivers, 10 and 11's, and decided on this one as it's a classic and the craftsmanship of 11's seems a bit lacking (also, that size!).<br /><br />Anyway, fast forward to today. After about an hour and a half with the product, I have come up with as follows:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-It feels really great in the hand<br />-The light is bright and the sounds are accurate<br />-The pen part is pretty neat<br />-Sliding it open and shut oooh<br /><br />Cons<br />-At times can feel like a toy<br />-The pen is kinda tacky<br /><br />Overall, it's really great for any Who fan.  I'll probably cave and get 11's at some point, but for now this will suffice.  Now, excuse me while I sonic virtually everything in my house.

B001MWBK4U|4.0|It is extremely rare that I ever buy any movie without seeing it first elsewhere but I bought Cold Mountain on Blu Ray on a lark as I enjoy anything having to do with history.  I'm glad I did but since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO....The transfer to Blu Ray is quite excellent and deserves 5 stars.  The colors are very natural and skin tones as they should be.  There was no color popping as you often see in some Science Fiction films like the Transformers.  Contrast throughout the film was also excellent and details, even the smallest of them, are easily discernible.  Strands of hair do not mush into each other creating a blurred focus and even in darker/shadowy areas all details are spot on.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the high 20's.  The soft focus used during most of the film only adds to the feel of the movie but does not take away from it.  Cinematography was outstanding.<br /><br />AUDIO.. The film defaults to DTS MA HD 5.1, however you are forewarned that in the Audio section not only do you select the DTS lossless audio but there is also an 'AUDIO OPTIONS' with a small speaker icon.  I have seen this rarely before and if you do not know what it is, it is a 'surround fx on' or lowered option.  Choose the one with the sound waves coming out of it or you will not get your surround foleys.  The audio dialogue is beautifully balanced with the soundtrack behind it though in some of the battle scenes the dialogue can get lost in the sound fx. This only occurred a couple of times for me.  It is only during the battle scenes where your surround comes into play with panning across the front stage and even some dialogue coming from the right rears.  For the most part the rear channels are used for ambient sound rather than discreet directionality of audio effects.  Most of the film, especially after the early battle scenes where your LFE channel will have a major explosion to deal with, remains dialogue driven by its excellent cast.<br /><br />EXTRAS...There is good and bad in everything I guess.  When you first put your disc in you are treated to 5 previews of other movies and an advertisement for the EPIX channel.  I hate these things as a blu ray disc is limited in space and they just take up more room on the disc making it necessary to compress the film even more to fit the feature film and worthy extras on the remaining room.  These previews are the only reason why I gave this 5 star movie and Blu Ray disc a 4 star rating.  I do not like to pay for advertising and would rather get an even better film transfer.<br />  Other extras are several good but time coded deleted scenes that all would have been quite fitting in an extended version of Cold Mountain.  These scenes all have DD 2.0 audio and are not completely finished from post production but I enjoyed watching them all.  There is also an hour and a half feature on the musical score which includes cold readings of the script by the cast as well as musical performances of the various tunes used throughout.  It's rare that you get this type of extras and it was very enjoyable to watch.  Additionally, there are a few film commentaries, storyboards and a \\"Making of' documentary.<br />  Completely glad that I bought this film that should appeal greatly to both men and women.<br />  All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.st of the film, especially after the early battle scenes where your LFE channel will have a major explosion to deal with, remains dialogue driven by its excellent cast.<br /><br />EXTRAS...There is good and bad in everything I guess.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|At first I don't think I was that into this record, but the more I listened as intended, to the songs in the order on the album, complete from start to finish, I understand that this record is a throwback to the concept albums of the 1970's, and I appreciate that.
B00BUI6D2A|4.0|Sure Lil Wayne goes overboard about with his sexual preferences but that aside this is, in my opinion, way better than quite a few of his more popular albums. I'm always reluctant to write reviews but with all the anti-Lil Wayne rhetoric I felt it necessary to add some positivity.<br /><br />You don't have to like him, and honestly, it's not a deep and thoughful album but for simple, fun, catchy hooks and beats I would definitely recommend this album.<br /><br />I won't list personal favs since I think that's highly subjective but unless you're looking for deep, meaningful rap I'm sure you'll find music you'll enjoy.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is heartbreaking yet captivating in so many ways. My heart was so heavy for each of the characters, yet there is a thread of hope and an abundance of love that runs through each element of this family saga.<br /><br />Mr. Hosseini's Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns make my short list of favorite books every time.  I just love the detailed way he writes...the way the backdrop of the story comes to life in my mind's eye.  It is almost as if you can hear the sounds and smell the smells as he so eloquently illustrates them through his storytelling.

B0071XO8RA|2.0|This book starts out strong. I genuinely enjoyed getting to know this dystopian world and building up to the Main Event.<br /><br />However... The character development is hugely lacking. The characters are very one-dementional. Our heroine is a strong feminist-type who needs the help of no man. Our villian is evil and will stop at nothing to rule the silo. Blah blah blah. I stopped caring what happened to the individuals in this book, but continued to read to find out what had happened to get them in the silos to begin with.<br /><br />Also, what's with the gross amounts of detail? I fully appreciate an authors way to paint us a picture with words, but seriously... I've seen a person jump into water before. So, I know what it looks like. Ripples, bubbles, splashes, the whole thing. A simple, \\"She jumped in the water and started swimming\\" would've been great. The entire paragraph describing the way the bubbles float to the top? A bit much. A lot much, actually. I skipped an entire chapter and picked right back up where I was before without missing a thing.<br /><br />Except maybe some more jewel-y bubbles floatin' in the water. Or a character that fits a stereotype.<br /><br />I'll give him this, there was not one sassy black lady from the south that says \\"Mmmmm honey, I don' think so!\\"  So.. that's one stereotype unchecked.

B005LAIIMG|3.0|Without reading the Max Brooks authored book that the film is based on, \\"World War Z\\" is just a $200 million zombie movie that had a ton of issues during its filming process. It's already developed a reputation for agitating longtime fans of the book since the trailers have already revealed that the film is nothing like its source material. It was expected to be as disastrous as the apocalypse the film predicted, but early reviews were surprisingly positive and offered a little beacon of hope in an otherwise dark tunnel.<br /><br />As a Muse fan, it was a welcome surprise to find out that lead singer Matthew Bellamy contributed to the film's soundtrack. What's disappointing about it is that it only seems like Bellamy contributed music to the opening and end credits while everything else in the middle mostly revolves around really moody piano arrangements.<br /><br />It takes little time for the world to be turned upside down, which is probably for the best. Hearing about how Gerry quit his job at the UN to make pancakes for his family or Gerry complaining about his family not knowing how to put dirty dishes in the sink isn't exactly a riveting experience. What's most impressive about \\"World War Z\\" is its size. You can literally see this virus destroy huge cities with vast populations. The creatures they become move in numbers like ants, sprint at full speed, and will often lunge off buildings or walls built to protect cities without hesitation. While the events are intense, the zombies are awkward. They throw their heads against car windows to try and get the warm, pulsating, fleshy center still found inside trying to survive. The raptor-like squawking is complete overkill. Their constant chattering and ant-like movement can be chalked up for trying something different, but the squawking seems pointless unless they were using it to communicate which they don't.<br /><br />Coming back around to the size aspect, the atmosphere of the film is really strong at times particularly in the apartment complex when Gerry and his family are trying to reach the roof; those claustrophobic hallways with the flickering fluorescent lights and flares being their only hope is unforgettable. There are moments of intelligence, as well. Their solution to the outbreak is fairly clever. The dialogue shines at times. Andrew Fassbach's (Elyes Gabel) speech about Mother Nature being a serial killer is fantastic.<br /><br />The film can't decide if it wants the viewer to sympathize with humanity or get lost in the swarm of zombies as Brad Pitt searches for a cure. The first 30 minutes or so are gripping and contain hints of intimate human relationships, but once Gerry embarks for South Korea it's just this wild goose chase while everyone who isn't Gerry just sits around and rots. Some scenes from then on have memorable moments, but feel like filler overall. It's also extremely disheartening to be watching a zombie film when there are no headshots shown in the film. If \\"Warm Bodies\\" from earlier this year wasn't proof already, \\"World War Z\\" throws the rules that zombies once had out the window. Humanity should falter in the face of oblivion during the apocalypse in zombie films. That's kind of the point. Without that sense of hopelessness, it just winds up feeling like another walk in the park.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" doesn't end. It's the end of the world and the film stops in the middle of the story. At just under two hours, the zombie fan in you will wish for an extra 30 minutes just to witness some sort of closure. The blockbuster film isn't awful, but it doesn't have the balls to be a real zombie film. It deserves credit for always having a strong female character in every setting Gerry found himself in while a few of the ideas and some of the writing is commendable, but the film has too many noticeable issues; too many cooks in the kitchen without a satisfying recipe for disaster. Semi-entertaining for what it is, \\"World War Z\\" doesn't accomplish anything \\"28 Days Later\\" didn't 11 years ago for 1/25 of the budget.nything \\"28 Days Later\\" didn't 11 years ago for 1/25 of the budget.

B00005ATZT|5.0|his has always been one of my favorite movies.  I gues one of the reasons is because I have been accused of doing things I didn't do all my life.  My first wife accused me of cheating, which I didn't do and several other occasions I have been accused of doing things I didn't do.  I guess that has caused me to be on the side off the underdog.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|as Kite Runner or his other book.  The first part is wonderful, heart breakingly so.  And the individual stories of many of the connected characters are good too.  Alas, for me, their stories just didn't fit together seamlessly.  Still, given what poor quality we've been given in fiction lately, one could do much worse.
1250007208|5.0|First of all, I need to state clearly for the record that this was a totally stellar read. It reminded me quite a bit of A Long, Long Sleep by Anna Sheehan, which I read and adored a couple months ago. The stories are not the same at all, but the general idea is. Both take a well-known fairy tale, put it into a futuristic setting, and make something completely new and original with it. Cinder is, in case you couldn't guess, a revisionist version of Cinderella.<br /><br />I loved how Meyer weaved in the core elements of the fairy tale, but felt free to make some changes too. For example, Cinder was adopted into a family by Linh Garan, who promptly died, leaving her in the care of her stepmother, rather than him being her father as in the original story. One of her stepsisters is evil, but the other one is actually her best friend. She attends the ball where Kai is to choose his bride, despite having been ordered not to go. All of that clearly draws the correlation to the fairy tale.<br /><br />Cinder is all about dramatic irony, or at least it was for me. The book ends with a big reveal. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be a twist, or if the audience was supposed to be sitting there shaking the book all the way through because they knew what was going on and no one else did. I suspect it may be the latter, because what happened was so obvious. Really though, I don't think the knowledge of where the overall story was heading detracted from the book at all.<br /><br />The setting here is completely amazing. Earth has apparently been through some serious turmoil. It now contains only six countries. The formation of these large powers occurred during the peace conference following World War IV. Ouch. Not to mention the fact that there are now folks living on the moon. What I am not sure of is whether the Lunars were initially human, although I suspect so.<br /><br />Cinder is a powerful heroine. I love how much she is not run of the mill. She has expert skills as a mechanic, is over a quarter machine, and hardly cares about her appearance. She cares deeply about the few people (or androids) she's close to and will risk herself to protect them. Plus, having a crush on the prince does not turn her into a brainless puddle of goo, something that I see a lot when the heroine hangs out with the hero of her book.<br /><br />Book two promises to be even better. I have no idea where the story will go from here and cannot wait to find out! Recommended to all fans of science fiction and fairy tales.a mechanic, is over a quarter machine, and hardly cares about her appearance.

B004L9MFM2|5.0|Book two follows on with the story from Game Of Thrones and wends and weaves its way through the lives of Catelyn Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Arya Stark,  Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Danaerys Targaryon - amongst others but these are our main protagonists. R.R. Martin's books represent a journey into another world and the detail with which he draws it is awe-inspiring at times.  Go ahead and escape.

B0093Q8W0C|3.0|I didn't think this movie had the suspense of other Hitchcock movies so was a bit disappointed.  It kept my attention enough though that I finished watching it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game is ok  but you should be given  a lot more time to play it! It gives you like ten minutes to play It then it says that you have used all your time and that you have to BUY the full version to play!!!! Down lilac if you wish but don't expect to be impressed!!! -.-

1451696191|5.0|I loved this book with all my heart. It just kinda spoke to me about being the odd one out and finnaly finding a group of friend that you belong in. It just really inspiring to go out and meet somebody and have a family and get a good college education and then get your own Sam. <333 LOVED IT! Wouldn't recomend for people under 13 tho..
B004IPPINW|3.0|With the title of Fundamentalist.. even reluctant had expected to find a bigger turn about of the protagonist.<br />Apart from that, was a good read and good representation of the bubble that America lives in, far removed from the rest of &#34;globalised&#34; world and how immigrants slowly find the vacuum or worse, the paranoid bias of the locals. Would recommend as a reading.

B00280LYIM|5.0|Wow just wow. This book is awesome. Lots of detail and action. Fun to read. I loved it so much.
B007THA4FI|4.0|As usual her descriptions and characters are deep and interesting, but there are so many characters to learn for this one story that it is not a quick and easy read.  It takes about 1/4 of the book to introduce all the players and their motivations, so you have to be ready to concentrate and remember each one and how they are connected.  Definitely not a beach book.<br /><br />Even so it was worth the effort in the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a decent game. The horse is adorable and fun to interact with. My four year old son loves this.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Most people only know Sherlock Holmes from TV and the movies. The CBS series, Elementary, which brings Sherlock Holmes into modern day New York is excellent. But nothing beats the original stories. It's been over 100 years since Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle wrote A Study in Scarlet. It became internationally popular. Conan-Doyle grew tired of Holmes, but the audience wanted more.`The author tried to kill the character, but the audience wouldn't hear of it. He brought Holmes back in unforgettable fashion. But you have to read it for yourself. Don't go looking for Professor Moriarty, he only appears in The Final Problem. He is only mentioned in a couple other stories. Holmes's puzzle solving is what the stories are all about. The best of the four novels is The Hound of the Baskervilles. Two of the best short stories are The Red Headed League and The Naval Treaty. Holmes is at his best in both in solving the mysterious puzzles presented to him. The stories give a great glimpse into what Victorian England was like from the perspective  of someone who lived in it. Reading Holmes is a journey that every mystery fan should take.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie is just flat out genius. It shows how people from different walks of life come to find that they have more in common than they thought. All delivered absolutely brilliant performances. One I would watch over and over again and not grow tired of it. They certainly don't make them like this anymore.
B005VU9LVI|4.0|\\"Traffic\\" by Steve Soderbergh is a well-done film with its handheld work and bold color grading.  The most intriguing element of the film to me was Bencio Del Toro.  He had an understated quality of a man who is navigating incredibly dangerous worlds.  Even more so in 2013 than when the film was made.  In Soderbergh's film, nobody gets really angry.  There is an even tone throughout.<br /><br />On another note,  watch the original \\"Traffik\\" which was a German TV mini-series.  It is superb and more gritty.  I thought it was terrific.  Many scenes from \\"Traffik\\" were lifted into the Soderbergh film.<br /><br />I was the producer of a documentary called \\"American Federale\\" which deals with an American Citizen who became a Mexican Federale policeman - and had to juggle the cartels, his everyday life and legitimate police work in the process.  It's up on Amazon now and is an insightful gaze into this world.  \\"Lobo\\" is the cop (we don't use his real name) and has stories that he can tell.  And ones that he can't tell on video or over the phone.  If you watch traffic, then you'll like the grounded documentary.
630463949X|4.0|It is dated. I sawthem at MGM last month and 3 years ago and they blow away the dvd from around 1998. They neved to make a new current dvd. What is wcith 2 sides to the dvd? One side has little color and the audio is flat such as it was not recorded correctly..non electrified. The other side is fine. Same concert on both sides. I guess it is the best that they have available but they need a new dvd of current concerts. Their current concert is spectacular. I see hundrds of vegas concerts and I rate their current show in my top 5.

1451695195|5.0|The guy doesn't believe because he's arrogant and puffy then has an experience and realizes that there's more to life than what he thought. It's more of the same as far as NDE's go but he attempts to throw in a bunch of facts like it makes it more legit. Facts (and name dropping) are all fine and good if you need that sort of thing to comprehend/understand basic functions of life. It's like the golden rule being backed up by a bunch of scientific data about human interactions and effects on the psychological make-up of the brain. The bottom line still remains, treat others as you would desire to be treated (period) end of story. He sounds like a smart guy but as for writing style and effectiveness of story telling I prefer Howard Storms book better; it just seemed to flow better and less focus on his credentials. After all, we're here to find out what's in the beyond, not what's hanging on the wall in your office.

0544139453|5.0|This book was part of my book group discussion.  Since we had just finished reading Karen Armstrong's &#34;Twelve Steps to A Compassionate Life,&#34; thinking about Hamid's book through that context opened other avenues of thought. I especially liked the book because it pushed me into re-examining my personal belief systems. I disagreed with what I felt was his symbolism of Erica as the American woman.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|i love to write and am committed to this craft.  Stephen King repeatedly demonstrates in this book that writing becomes a complete paradigm.  He looks at the smallest details of day to day existence and you can see the wheels of creative invention spinning - even from the time he was a small boy.  Fascinating.  Surprisingly normal. love the book. Love him.

HOWEVER, I THOUGHT THERE WERE CONDRADICTIONS IN THE BOOK - NOT ALWAYS HOWEVER IT APPEARED TO AS SUCH,  ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE PARTS THAT WERE DRUGOUT - (MCcELLAN DISMISSAL).THE BOOK DOES EXPRESS THE TIME A. LINCOLN WAS PRESIDENT AND THE PROBLEMS HE HAD WITH CONGRESS AND HIS CABINET.  I FEEL HONORED THAT I WAS ABLE TO READ THIS BOOK AND GET THE ENTIRE FEEL OF THE GREATEST EVERY - ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|it is totally awesome and fun! and for the concerned adults, there IS a Gore off and on option!! must buy!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game but dont want to have to keep leaving the game to like and review also you have to pay for to much
B00CFSWMYM|2.0|After hearing the first single, 'Home', I was concerned, to say the least. Gone were the wonderful early 80's sounds in favor of a more digital 90's feel. The song is saved only when the real drums kick in. But since I was such a fan of Feel It Break, I was optimistic. Now that I have had Olympia for several days, and have played it numerous times, I can say my concern was warranted.<br /><br />The sounds throughout Olympia have in fact become more modern, which is a BAD thing. The charm of analogue synths are far more appealing than the crystalline digital blandness here.  One song that could have been good, 'Annie', is made unlistenable with the more modern sound. There are a few 80's sounds scattered on Olympia, but in very short supply. The only thing that truly saves portions of the album is Maya's live drumming. Many of the songs are a slower tempo, which means less excitement. It seems to be little more that Katie crying song after song about a failed relationship. What happened to the awesome songs about witchcraft, etc? While some of the songs are nice, none are truly stunning. There is nothing near the creativity of 'Spellwork' (with its quivery keyboards, Katie's stunning vocals, and the way the drumbeats sound like little explosions), or 'The Villian' (with its throbbing beat and amazing chorus).<br /><br />The album opens with the adequate 'What We Done?', which is little more than background music until it kicks in. Then it really comes to life. Then we go into the so-so adult contemporary sound of 'Forgive Me', before we get to the album's best track, 'Painful Like'. This is the closest thing to the excitement of their debut. This better be a single/video at some point. 'Sleep' is an appropriate title for the next track, because that's what it induces. Other so-so material follows in 'Fire', 'Reconcile', and 'You Changed My Life'. By the last track, 'Hurt Me Now', you realize that Katie has been listening to too much later day Kate Bush, which is nota good thing at all.<br /><br />In recent interviews, Katie has stated her approach to this album was very different, in that she left the songs fairly bare and let the band fill them in, as opposed to doing most of it herself. Perhaps that was a really bad idea because this is not going to be a memorable classic, but hopefully just a live-and-learn stumbling block. And I really think it needs to be said that those two worthless backing singers have GOT TO GO! They detract from the music more than anything, with their bland to mediocre (and I'm being generous here) voices, and their laughable stage presence. They just sway and wave their arms like some sort of wannabe witches. I think the rest of Austra are extremely valuable, though maybe not in helping to construct the songs if this is the result.<br /><br />Olympia makes me fearful that Maya's second band, Trust, may ditch the wonderful analogue synths in favor of a more polished sound as well, which will no doubt illicit a similar reaction. People always try to \\"grow\\" and \\"change\\", but more often than not, it backfires. Olympia is little more than passable background music, especially when you follow it up with a listen of Feel It Break. There is no comparison. Katie's voice is amazing, but it's not enough if the backdrop is bland. Let's see if the 3rd time is a charm.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just love this game,  it really makes you think and certainly helps your memory stimulation.  I am new to computer games  but this appeals to me.  The challenge to get to the next level is something I have not experienced before.
0765325950|5.0|A fitting conclusion to the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.  Sanderson does an excellent job continuing the tradition and wrapping up the storyline and characters.  The final ending feels a little odd, but I think it may be a disjunct between Jordan's and Sanderson's styles (Jordan always knew the ending, and Sanderson had to achieve it). Still a great book that gives me confidence to recommend the series to friends once more!
B0086700CM|1.0|All the rushing about and jumping under and over is not my scene,  perhaps this game is not for the elderly pensions  who are new to kindle.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> I'm happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superior to the ho-hum 2009 initial Reboot. Here you get two villains for the price of one; they manage to be much more fleshed out than the bald Romulan, Nero, in the 2009 film, an unlikeable sadist of a character, who viewers could never warm up to.<br /><br />At least the two villains in 'Into Darkness', Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, and the genetically engineered superhuman, rogue Starfleet agent, John Harrison (aka 'Khan'), operate on the surface, with some sort of (albeit twisted), moral imperative. Marcus is sort of a futuristic Dick Cheney run amok, determined to provoke a war with the Klingons, who he fears will soon destroy the Federation. And Khan, who resorts to terrorism when he blows up a secret Starfleet installation in London, is actually trying to get back at Marcus, who has stashed 72 of his superhuman comrades inside photon torpedoes, which end up on the Enterprise.<br /><br />After Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike, is killed by Khan, in a direct attack on Starfleet headquarters in San Francisco, Marcus correctly calculates that the impulsive Kirk, will gladly follow his 'shoot to kill' orders, and take out Khan, who has fled to Chronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk's impulsivity is what makes him interesting. Don't ask me why it's necessary for Marcus to place the 72 'pod people' in the photon torpedoes, because after all, Kirk could eventually disobey his orders and they could be discovered, which could mean bad news for Marcus, back at Starfleet. But that's exactly what happens. So why didn't Marcus dispose of Khan's 72 buddies before he orders Kirk to go after Khan? Some internet posters have suggested that Marcus wants to 'stick it to' Khan after he becomes a turncoat. Khan will die with the knowledge that all members of his race will die with him, at the same moment.<br /><br />If Kirk happens to have a little of 'Marcus' in him in his thirst for revenge, it's up to his 'United Nations' crew members, to become more 'balanced' and bring Kirk back into the fold, so he conforms to acceptable behavior, within the context of international (or shall we say, 'universal') law. 'Scotty' is first to sound the trumpet of 'lawful behavior', when he resigns his commission after he's banned from inspecting the torpedoes. And then Spock, Bones and Uhura, who today would make a great team on a Commission of Human Rights, convince Kirk to take Khan alive.<br /><br />'Into Darkness' really picks up in terms of plot, when a series of reversals keep us guessing as what's going to happen next. Marcus attacks the Enterprise and disables it; Kirk offers to give up Khan and the 72 cryogenically frozen ones but before Marcus can kill everyone, Scotty infiltrates Marcus' unmarked Federation starship, the USS Vengeance, and causes a power outage; after Kirk and Khan do a 'space jump' to the Vengeance, Khan manages to kill Marcus and take over the ship. But Spock manages to beam the torpedoes onto the USS Vengeance, explode them, causing the ship to become incapacitated, just like the Enterprise.<br /><br />There's a spectacular scene as Khan crashes the USS Vengeance into Starfleet Academy in San Francisco as well as his apprehension by Spock and Uhura (please rest assured that in the future, there are still cable cars operating in San Francisco!).<br /><br />'Into Darkness' could have been a masterpiece except for the unfortunate fact that it is wholly derivative. Kids who are not familiar with earlier Trek movies, might not realize that when Kirk saves the ship by going into the radiation chamber and has an emotional farewell with Spock, that's almost a direct rip-off from Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Except in the earlier film, the roles are reversed: it's Spock who gets radiated, dies and saves the ship! I know this is supposed to be a tribute to Wrath of Khan, but tributes should not be direct copies. It's an example of LAZY Screen writing.<br /><br />Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2. Consider how easy it is that Kirk is revived when they discover Khan's blood has restorative properties. One unexplored implication is that many people on earth will now be resurrected from death, by simply tapping into the blood supply of the 72 pod people, once they are brought out of suspended animation.<br /><br />There are plenty of more scenes that are copies from earlier Trek incarnations. Take for example, the opening scene, where the Prime Directive is violated. How many times did we see that before? Another group of indigenous peoples, being saved by the noble crew of the Enterprise. Or how about the 'machine gun' attack on Starfleet Headquarters or when Kirk and Khan, do the 'space jump'? You'll just have to ignore In Darkness' lack of originality, if you want to enjoy this film.<br /><br />The story is also enhanced by how the screenwriters give the supporting players, their moment in the sun. I happen to favor Simon Pegg as the best actor in the film and enjoyed how he disabled the ship, in the proud tradition of the original Scotty, James Doohan. Bones is nicely utilized when he helps out arming the torpedoes and saves Kirk; Uhura helps Spock subdue Khan and Chekov has some nifty moments, below deck. Sulu also manages to get in the act by some death-defying piloting.<br /><br />Spare me all the little petty arguments between Kirk and Spock as well as the aforementioned copycat radiation chamber scene. Nonetheless, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, are becoming much more comfortable as worthy precursors of Shatner and Nimoy.<br /><br />Now that J.J. Abrams has improved his reboot, it's high time that he steps up his game and comes up with a truly original screenplay for the third installment. Keep the copycat stuff to a minimum. 'In Darkness' passes the test...barely.creen writing.<br /><br />Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2.

0307476073|3.0|It was a good read.  The author gets a little self-indulgent with her thoughts and feelings.  Good exposure for the trail - I've been on stretches of it in NoCal without knowing it's full extent.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Completed in one evening with my 8 year old son, makes both of us work together to solve the riddles.  Looking forward to more.

B000Z9PYJS|5.0|It's not often that I cannot stop reading when morning breaks and it's time for the day to begin.  Of course, it's not often there is a book like THE LIFE OF PI. I say a reluctant goodbye to Pi and Richard Parker as I listen to the end of this Audible book, following on in my Kindle. What a sail!  Highly recommended.
B001KWZ796|4.0|My girlfriend asked me if I had ever watched her favorite movie &#34;Ever After&#34; before?  I said no...she responded I've watched it like 40 times.  She went on to say that she lost her DVD of the movie a couple of years back and hasn't been able to find another copy.  I guess there is someone in the world who isn't aware of Amazon's awesomeness!  :)<br /><br />Getting back to the movie...I decided to purchase the Video on Demand version from Amazon for $9.99.  The quality of the streamng and the movie itself is second to none.  If you like &#34;good eventually triumphs evil&#34; type movies...this one doesn't get much better.
B00BUL0IHI|2.0|Not his best.  This is just another notch on his slow decline from greatness.  The best verse on this album was from Trina and that's saying a whole lot.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|While I have only had this set for about a month, I was able to see episodes I missed since the show launched. Plus, other I know (from teens to adults) have had the same reaction. They love the show, but several missed earlier shows...so everyone is using this set to catch up. And Michael Patrick King still has that creative spin to give everyday life true humor in laughing at ourselves.<br /><br />Get this!
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|This album is so trippy and gorgeous. It's a great way to escape.<br />I love the sounds of the English country side and the small furry<br />animals grooving.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|having visited England several times, I was enamored by all the descriptions of different locations.  It was a interesting read, and I hated for the book to end.  You laughed one minute and then laughter turned to  sadness and tears.  Most enjoyable book.
1400069289|5.0|One of the best books I ever readed. It is not only interesting but practical. You can use it's knowledge in every single thing.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I didn't want to watch this movie at all, based on the title and the worry that it was yet another chick flick. But, my wife convinced me, and it turned out to be pretty good. My wife insisted we give it five stars. It's always uplifting to see a movie where a bum makes good.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am an avid devotee of Les Mis on the stage and on film, and don't usually like reading the book after seeing stage of film presentations.  However, I was continually amazed on reading the book how faithful the presentations are to the original text, and the extraordinary depth of understanding the book brings.  It is also a very easy read in terms of the grammar and vocabulary.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The battles drag on and on. There's not a whole lot of plot either, and the end leaves you hanging... although that's where the next LOTR comes in. Good photography is the saving grace.
B000HKYN74|4.0|The Star Trek Enterprise series of four seasons shows the making of the Federation. That makes it a great prequel to the Star Trek Movies. There are 24 times 4 separate videos. And they are free with Amazon prime. I enjoyed the good acting. Most of the plots are good, too.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I hear the book and the story are pretty good. But, this movie is far too disjointed to follow. My wife thought it was horrible, and I'd tend to agree with that evaluation.
B008602KQI|5.0|Thats a good movie my boys like this one too much and they can see the movie all the day
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack. It has deep jazzy songs with a fresh twist. I like that it features popular artists as well as some that might not be known very well. I think it embodies the spirit of Gatsby very well. The only think I was disappointed about is that the song \\"Happy Together\\" by Filter was not on here. I thought that was an important song that they should have added, because they play it on almost all of the movie trailers.
B004TI1WME|5.0|But when I need it I like the additional applications that go beyond the very basic calculator I first downloaded.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|If you are a fan of comics and super heroes in general you will not be disappointed with this program!  I am a huge super hero movie fan and this is a great show to fill the gaps in between big screen releases!
B003D81NVQ|5.0|This is the best series I've ever watched on cable. And I remember when AMC was just a small little station showing old movies!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, not too difficult. Would be easy for children to learn problem solving skills. I recommend this game for ten years or older.
B000FA675C|5.0|I had seen the movie a while ago but reading the book placed a lot of the puzzle pieces from the movie. This is also a great history lesson. Easier to absorb from a book than a movie.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Lost blokus to Hurricane Sandy, the kids were soooo happy to get it again.  We couldn't find it in any toy store.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game is challenging and you must use your hand and eye coordination. You have the remember number sequence and operations. As we get older I think it is good to always use thing that will enhance your brain power.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a great game and I love this game and I hope that others love this app too
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I haven't finished the audio book yet but you can read about one transition of presidents and then put the book down to read something else. Some things are fascinating like Hoover's help to Truman after WWII to feed and handle refugees, etc. Even Ike who needed nobody, found that help from past presidents was good at times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting I got it and I thought it looked stupid. but I gave it a try and it was a good game. I could not stop playing it I hope this helped you and if you like mazes kinda .this game is made for you hope you enjoy it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|On our trip to Florida, my kids couldn't stop playing this! Great game with great graphics!!! Very addicting, that I even took some turns to the achievement of  the next evolution  :P
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|It's easy to follow - don't eat for 2 days per week, and eat normally for the other 5 days.  I've done 2 weeks so far and am 1.5kg down.  The first week was hard but next week was easier.  Its actually amazing what you can eat within 500 calories on your fasting days.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|From the first episode two years ago, I have been hooked.  These characters are so bad, yet the viewer comes to love them.  I can't wait for each week to come so I can see what they are up to now!<br /><br />The writing is fabulous.  Keep up the good work.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Got this for the grandkids and watched it with them- brought us all back to their age- something that makes us young again
B009LDCXNY|2.0|If you've already seen Season 8 and enjoyed it, I'm sincerely happy for you.  You probably don't need to read this review (go ahead if you want).<br /><br />I love Supernatural.  Seasons 1-5 were incredible, and 6-7 were great.  Most people seem to have basically the same opinion, which is why the response to Season 8 surprised me so much.<br /><br />For me, the most important part of a show is the characters, followed closely by consistent and natural development of their arcs and the plot arc.  I thought Season 8 was at best unsatisfactory, and at worst practically insulting to the fans, in these areas.  These are my biggest issues with the season.<br /><br />1) Ignoring Amy in \\"Citizen Fang\\"<br />Previously, Dean had killed one of Sam's childhood friends in front of her son because she had killed a few humans to give the blood to him when he was sick.  It was justified in a way because Dean really believed that things that kill humans do not deserve to live.  However, in Purgatory, Dean became friends with Benny (whose character was one of the highlights of the season).  Dean took the friendship seriously enough that he wanted to hear Benny out even when it seemed like he was killing again.  Sam didn't agree and wanted to kill Benny.  Even though this situation represents a reversal of what happened with Amy, Dean makes practically no attempt to explain or apologize.  Sam seems to suddenly care more about hunting than the friend he lost (what?).  Amy is barely mentioned.<br />This made me sick.  Amy is the most sympathetic character Dean has killed - a good-intentioned mother trying to take care of her son - and Dean ignored it because she wasn't human.  His actions were understandable in that context, but Dean clearly has changed his mind here and believes that some supernatural creatures should be treated like people.  I'm sure he still thinks that her killings justified what he did, but Sam never thought that.  For the writers to make Dean so apathetic towardAmy, as well as toward Sam, and to decide Sam's forgotten his old friend, was disgusting.  The writers' carelessness and laziness here went way too far.<br /><br />2) The Trials, Benny, Amelia, and other unexplained, ridiculous, or half-finished plot lines<br />The three trials were very confusing to me.  Why did Sam have to kill a hellhound?  Why did Sam have to die? Is this just a really hard test or are these things necessary to close the gates of Hell?  In the past, there have been understandable ways to resolve season arcs (shooting Azazel or 'cutting of the head' of the Leviathan beast).  This seemed like the writers just wanted some interesting things to make a few episodes out of.<br />Benny was amazing, but his storyline went nowhere.  You'd think they would have made him part of the team, given him a role to play in closing the Gates of Hell, or...*something*.  Anything.  Bringing in an amazing character, giving him a small initial role, and then instead of expanding it, writing him out?  Are you kidding?<br />Amelia's story also went nowhere, but the real problem was that the 'resolution' came when she found out her dead husband had been alive the whole time.  That was pathetically lazy writing.<br /><br />3)Absence of compelling supporting characters / Sam and Dean still acting like they hate each other<br />Ackles and Padalecki are amazing, but it was hard to watch Sam and Dean yelling at each other, and then not, and then yelling again, for most of the season.  Do I want them to be happy best friends?  Well, yes, but that wouldn't be as interesting.  Still, the tension in their relationship is like Season 1 all over again, and a show this old needs to have some gradual maturing, not just short-lived reconciliations.  However, *if* the finale brought change that lasts into Season 9, I'll be fine with the lack of growth here.  The (hopefully) bigger problem was the lack of supporting characters.  Benny had a small role, Castiel was mostly absent and mostly indecipherable until the end of the season, and Kevin and Garth do NOT add up to Bobby.  Bobby used to be there to yell some sense into Sam and Dean when they were being 'idjits'.  His unfilled shoes probably explain why all the fighting was just tiring.<br /><br />4)\\"Sacrifice\\" - The scene right before the awesome one<br />Another writing debacle that ruins this season for me.  The writers didn't want the gates of Hell to close because that would make Seasons 9 and 10 like a slightly grittier reboot of Everybody Loves Raymond.  Well, you know what I mean.  There are some *really* obvious ways they could have done this (e.g., a demon rescues Crowley).  There are some clever ways they could have done this.  They didn't. They decided to inform the brothers that Sam would die when he completes the trial, have Dean run to him to prevent his death, and have Sam decide to stop curing Crowley.<br />This is admittedly a powerful moment, but it's insane.  Not because anyone wants Sam to die, but because it's a slap in the face to the entire show.  In every episode the brothers risk their lives fighting demons.  Dean has demanded multiple times that Sam has a duty to join him instead of choosing a safer life.  Sam hasn't always loved hunting, but he's put his heart into it.  To suddenly introduce the idea that NOW (now that it's convenient for the writers) Sam and Dean won't give their lives to stop evil...I don't know how to describe how stupid this was.  The best way to handle it would have been for Sam to complete the trial and not die, for some reason beyond 'whoops, wrong trial'.  One of many good ways would have been to not introduce the dying part at all.  I understand Dean's trying to save Sam, but for Sam to leave the gates of Hell open is something that I can only explain by 'we just found out we have a Season 9, how do we derail this train?'<br /><br />Those are the biggest problems I have with Season 8.  Compared to \\"Bitten\\", the rest of the season is a masterpiece.  But that's an isolated episode.  These things actually ruined it for me.  I wrote this review partly because I honestly felt like the show imploded this season, and I was shocked to see most people liked it better than 6 and 7.  There must be something I care about more than most fans that they didn't mind missing this year but I did.  If you loved this season ... well, I'm glad for you and we're both looking forward to Season 9.
B000JPRPAO|3.0|I really enjoy this film, though the whole Napster thing really dates this movie and completely unnecessary to the overall story which is why I knocked a star off. My other gripe with this movie is that Ed Norton really phoned in his performance her and was very obvious that he didn't want to be part of this movie save for contractual obligations.
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I definitely recommend buying Horrible Bosses. This all-star cast will have you laughing non-stop throughout the movie.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This adventure is a fantastic read. The storyline is complex, yet plausible (from a fantasy world perspective). The style is VERY readable. Completely worth the read.<br /><br />Maybe not comparable to Tolkein... but very fun to lose yourself in.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love that there is loads of information from humidity percentage to Sunrise and set times. The radar maps are great and very accurate.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Edited...<br /><br />I SO much enjoyed the Game of Thrones.... up until the author (I am theorizing) lost interest in the story, and decided it wasn't worth the effort to tie up all the various plots, sub-plots, and myriad storylines.<br /><br />In my initial review, I panned this book. I somehow was under the impression that this was to be the last book. In that light, I thought it was horrible.<br /><br />As several people have commented, I was mistaken. There are two more on their way. (whew)<br /><br />While I still do not PERSONALLY like how this book went, and found it inferior to the first four... I will hope that the remaining two books do a better job, and conclude with the excellent writing of the first four.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|I love reading/hearing it read! I read it and listen to Audible both. When I am driving, it is an awesome way to get there without any boredom. I love this author's writing.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Wow! With al the glowing reviews and blah blah blah, I was completely let down by this flick. It was amazingly underwhelming. Yes, there are a few positive attributes, and I suppose it's worth a watch (if you can rent it cheap), but I would NEVER pay movie theater rates for this. It was barely worth the $3.99 rental fee.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because I didn't HATE it, it just thought it was kinda sucky (is that a real word???).
B00881PTRC|5.0|I spent hours playing, when I first got it. It is great for long time periods of boredom. Some of the words keep repeating though. Nice.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|item is great at great price, enjoying every laugh.  Usually the individual seasons together would have cost a great deal more, very satisfied
B000KZFMZI|5.0|The video is fast, clear and I have it forever, won't scratch like a dvd! Not back for 20 bucks!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is Fantastic nicely animated and stuff but there are many pop up adds. and f.y.I. you do bees Internet!! Anyone may play. It so fun.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game so much. everyone should lov this game cause if u don't have a pet now u have a vultiril pet
B008JFUMDS|5.0|What an amazing movie!<br /><br />The first time I tried to watch it I ended up getting sick from bad Mexican food so we went and tried it again.<br />Boy am I glad we did!<br /><br />The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo<br /><br />The greatest thing about this movie is that it keeps throwing things at you that you don't see coming. For those of who you don't know, the movie is about four magicians who are brought together by these special cards. They become worldly famous and are under the management of one man. The movie focuses on their last three shows and how they tie in together with each other.<br /><br />They did an awesome job at keeping the audience surprised. Even my boyfriend was surprised and that's saying something! The movie makes you think and wonder and it keeps your attention the entire time! The ending is completely unknown throughout the movie, unlike all those other movies where you know the ending right from the start. This one will have you saying \\"WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!\\"<br /><br />Alesha's Rating:<br />10 out of 10 for sure!
B0074B10ES|5.0|Here's little Richard's first five consecutive albums. Starting with his 1957 debut to 1960.<br />Richard only had one more album prior 1962 (public domain) so it's interesting that<br />\\"The King Of Gospel Singers\\" which includes 12 more gospel songs, wasn't included here.<br /><br />Richard's first charted R&B single was in 1955 and he continued with a total of 18 R&B & 16 pop through 1958.<br />All are here plus 3 of the only 4 B-sides of R&B during that time.<br />He had a 6 year hiatus from the chart and returned in 1964, to have 5 more songs chart through 1973,<br />with modest chart success, but nothing to compare with his mid to late 1950's hey-day.<br /><br />This set captures the essence of Little Richard.<br />Track Listing ~ and identifying the charted songs numbers 1 to 18 (R&B) and the B-sides.<br />And R&B/pop only.<br /><br />1.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I cannot stop playing this game you should get it. if you do good luck!!!!! love it
B009MYARIK|5.0|Funny, light read made me laugh out loud at times. Two character story telling was artfully done. I enjoy this author.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It's a great game. Puzzles are very interesting. The game keeps on your toes not only do you have to find but also you need to learn where and when to use them. Would recommend.Looking forward to some more play.
1439152802|3.0|Once I read The Forgotten Garden I was really looking forward to The Secret Keeper. I usually enjoy voluminous books involving generations and/or centuries but this one I found to be difficult reading. There was nothing that really drew me into the story and I didn't care for the characters too much. I found myself skimming parts and skipping others. I did finish however but would not recommend this book like I did The Forgotten Garden.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I really like this workout app, I really like the moves many of them I forgot about since I was a kid
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of these books and love Sookie and Sam. Happy she keeps her humanity and feel this is perfect final chapter. SWEETASAPETUNIA
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I gave it 5stars. I play it on my grandma's kindle fire. It's so addictive.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent it was sometimes difficult to read on as the question occurred to me of how it would feel to be in this situation. It was a page-turner for sure!  I'm going to read his other books as well. Really enjoyed it!
B005HSL626|3.0|I hate to wait, whether it is pumping gas, in line at the DMV etc.  This gives me something to do in those instances.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|For those fans who've been waiting since 1978 for a fully new Black Sabbath album that didn't suck, this is your wish come true. For those of you expecting something other than a Black Sabbath album, like an in-your-face, high energy Ozzy Osbourne album, this ain't it.<br /><br />13 is the good and bad of a complete Black Sabbath album with Ozzy. There are some amazing tracks (albeit most of the best tracks are on the bonus disc for the deluxe edition) and some really heavy plodding songs that don't really deliver on the full potential of the talent in the band. If I were to compare it to another album from the band I would likely compare it to Master of Reality or Vol. 4. It has some awesome songs like \\"God Is Dead?\\" and \\"Pariah\\" and a couple duds like \\"Zeitgeist\\" and \\"Damaged Soul\\".<br /><br />All in all it's worth the cost of admission but if you're expecting a life altering experience of the best of Black Sabbath all rolled into one disc you'll be disappointed. For true Black Sabbath fans, this is a must have album. It's all new original Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne for goodness sake!! If you don't have it, you're not really a Black Sabbath fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|like so love it I truly have no life. because all I do is work and u know all play and no work is the devils playground
1400095204|4.0|The plot takes a little while to get going but well worth it. A great educational experience about a recent time in African history
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|It was so well done this movie. I really enjoyed it. I have been to two Cirque Du Soteil and watching this movie was like being right there. They are amazing and talented people who are ever so fortunate to be able to do acrobats as well as they did.  It made a beautiful love story that I really enjoyed.
B0049VVE7Y|4.0|I decided to start watching this show to see what all the fuss was about. I was not prepared for how bloody and gruesome it was going to be. However, you do get a bit desensitized after watching the 50th zombie get its head blown off. The story here is what makes this good. There is great character development and you really care what happens to them. Every show ends with you wanting to watch the next one. We've watched 3 shows in a row because of the cliffhanger endings. Overall, if you can get past the gore it's a great show.
B000MG1ZG0|4.0|\\"Morrison Hotel\\" is basically a blues rock album, without the inventive quirks which in varying degrees characterized the previous albums. Among the tracks that have the most obvious starting point in this genre \\"Peace Frog\\" (great intro) and \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" come out strongest , while tracks like \\"You Make me Real\\" and especially \\"Maggie M'Gill\\" are quite ordinary and unattractive.<br /><br />My favorites are mainly to be found among the ballads. The fine appendix to \\"Peace Frog\\" \\"Blue Sunday\\" is a for the group a remarkably simple love song. Very evocative is \\"Indian Summer\\", which has some of the same magical atmosphere as \\"Riders in the Storm\\". A great song. \\"The Spy\\" is actually a simple blues, but the fine original guitar theme, helps making the song more than just this.<br /><br /> I believe that \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" is an outtake from the album of the same title. Somehow, it was decided to save the song two years before it was released. Maybe it was felt that it had too much in common with songs like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" - in any case, the song is another highlights of \\"Morrison Hotel\\"<br /><br />The bonus tracks must have been included for the benefit of hard-core Doors fans as they do not really add anything musically exciting to the album. Best and most interesting are the early versions of \\"The Spy\\" and \\"Queen of the Highway\\".
B0079J28NC|5.0|This is one of the coolest films ever made, in my opinion, big time...<br />It really has it all, a fine psychedelic/weird story & nice humor & good music & the graphics beautiful...<br />I saw this one the first time on Swedish TV back in the 70s, and I would have given it 5 stars even without this remaster thingy :)
B00821OX98|5.0|Along the same lines as Walking Dead,  post-alien invasion instead of zombies.  Really great special effects and lots of fun twists!
B0076NAVNA|2.0|I'm really sorry to say that this is one of the worst produced albums I've ever heard, every high pitched note (the cymbals & the sung Ts & Ss, for example) is hurting ones ears, and WHY dose the singer always bland his singing with that horrible falsetto, all this is a pity cause I really wanted to dig this, but the music is OK though but it's not an album you can enjoy listen to via headphones which is a almost a &#34;must&#34; with every proggy music!?!<br /><br />I give the album 2 stars (just for the music's sake)...
B009AMANBA|5.0|You will either love it or hate it. You just need to to buy it and watch it for yourself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|When you start playing you can't stop. Once you are stuck on a level you just CAN'T give up! Great for all ages.
B0015DROBO|4.0|While some of the minutiae made the story bog down at times, reading through to the end brings the scope of the story full circle and leaves you pleased that you stuck with it. Well worth the effort.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this gadget, love the large numbers and ease of use, yes I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple calculator.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I love it and I can't wait for my son to get old enough, so that I can force him to love it too.
B008HK3S9K|4.0|This sleeve seems to offer good protection of my kindle.  The price was reasonable.  It is also pretty to look at
B003ZSH606|5.0|This band is one of the most underrated bands in the world.  They use real instruments and Jay Kay has an amazing voice.  These are talents lacking with &#34;musicians&#34; today.  This album is amazing, especially when driving with my premium sound system blaring the clear crisp treble and bass.  If you respect music as an art, than you will respect Jamiroquai as artists.
B005LAII12|5.0|it's very amazing and funniest in that moive. it makes my fiance and me laugh so hard and we can't wait to see part 2 is coming... wonder what is Ted 2 is all about?
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My son loves this app! It keeps him entertained during family dinners at restaruants. I must admit that I enjoy playing the game as well.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Things went quickly for a while and then I was stumped for a bit, which makes this game fun and interesting. This continued several times, I had to really stop and think to get to the end. A great brain exercise.  You won't be sorry if you play this one.....Enjoy!
B004S5FW1U|4.0|Although it was hard not to picture Jennifer Lawrence  and bradley cooper as the main actors ( thanks to movie coming out) I found tits book really hard to put down!
B00005JKCH|5.0|great job I love it  may buy another one very soon for my brother he love mine he's into movies also
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a fantastic game!  The graphics are good, and clean.  The colours are bright bright and I like the various pieces to each puzzle! I spend a lot of time playing & enjoying this!
B00361CAEE|5.0|Fabulous documentary! An up close and personal glimpse of one aspect of the creative process as it relates to fashion. For more, please purchase Grace's autobiography from Amazon. I think I'll watch it again right NOW!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I switched to Feedly when I learned that Google Reader was going away. This is an excellent replacement. I really liked the Google app and Freely took a bit of getting used to but for a free app I am impressed.
B000UD08HW|5.0|The main disc was utterly fantastic.  However, the second disc contained a lot of information (and alternate tracks) that was worth the price by itself.  To sum, this is a great bargain and a must have for Gilmore / Pink Floyd lovers.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini won me over with the Kite Runner. I was smitten by his newest novel..And the Mountains Echoed.<br />What a beautiful story. The love of siblings, the love of parents, the history of the area, the colorful characters that you dream about while reading this book, the drama, the comedy, and the suspense and twists and turns...and tragedy. I recommend this novel to everyone! and Thank you Khaled for another wonderful novel that I will re read one day...I did not want it to end.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|'This game is really trickey to curve it through space and gravity of the planets. A miss goes off to space.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I'm a major fan of anything star wars but this show was ahead of its time. Little cheesy at times but hey it was made back in the 60's.<br />Overall great story lines and really fun to watch plus Capt Kirk is simply one of the all time great characters. Overall awesome series.
0765325950|2.0|i don't read much fantasy anymore but I used to read this series in high school/college and had good memories of the first few books. I remember reading that Brandon Sanderson was going to finish these books when Robert Jordan passed away but didn't think more of it till I read about the final book being released. I had skimmed books 9 - 11 when they first came out and I didn't go back to re-read those, just read the wiki synopses. I bought all three Sanderson-written volumes and thought the first two volumes were a decent approximation of the earlier original books in the series that had so fascinated me, although something seemed a bit off with a few of the characters' \\"voices\\".  I found the last book just terrible and tedious. Overly long, not cohesive, full of inconsistencies, character deaths without any real emotional resonance (with one exception), new characters popping up out of nowhere and as for the rumored ending Jordan had written years ago? Ugh. SPOILERS TO FOLLOW: Really so Rand just took over Moridin's body, left his three lady loves and babies, and walked off into the sunset? Unless his entire somewhat numerous inner coterie was privy to the trick he had planned, wouldn't someone be very alarmed that the Dark One's right hand was at large again? And no closure or epilogues for any of the other surviving characters? Nothing more about what becomes of Mat/Tuon, Perrin/Faile etc.? And Padan Fain getting a paragraph of plot after all the buildup over the series. Very disappointing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded and started to play it. Has incredible resolution, great graphics and animation! Love it! Highly recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game<br />Will continue to play.  Waiting for more levels.  Its a good distraction from all my stress.  Happy playing everyone.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I like Spirits so much I bought it in CD and Mp3. I have all of Justin's solo albums, and this one is magical. His voice is amazing and the lyrics are beautiful.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not too easy and some new weapons to fight with. The latest level has a moving target, not easy at all. This one will keep you busy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun Fun fun fun fun really fun<br />Very strategically planning on how to set up<br />Awesome greater than that of an excellent way to have fun<br />Wow holly Molly
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|What a labor of love it must have been to make this. The writers and artists packed it so full of jokes, details, and shout-outs to video games that my teenager and I watched it twice in 24 hours. It's probably funniest if you've played a lot of games, but the characters and plot can stand on their own for those family members who are too young, too old, or not nerdy enough to catch the many cameos and in-jokes. The voice actors are terrific, particularly Sarah Silverman, even if some are type-cast (Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer). Best surprise: Alan Tudyk (Wash on &#34;Firefly&#34;) channelling Ed Wynn as the Candy King.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Love Match 3 games and this one is a typical Match 3 game. It is too easy for my liking but it is fun. If you like Match 3 games, this one is ok.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. fun, and free.  The level of difficulty is just right with it being not too easy or too hard. More games are promised by this developer.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Have watched this three times now and still could watch it and laugh yet again.  Brilliantly written and acted with an underlying message worth pondering.  I love this movie!
B000FA5STS|4.0|Very gripping book. A bit confusing at the end with too many characters, but enough suspense to make,the reader want to not put the book down. Main characters were well depicted and made real
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|great movies, kids love it, cuz is fun and have a lot of action on it, totally recomend this movie
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This provides exactly what I was looking for: multiple alarms with different sounds (including ones you import). I use it with different nature sounds to signal when class begins, when I've got 10 minutes to go, when class ends, and when office hours are over (a fake telephone ring). The intuitive interface lets you repeat alarms in many different configurations such as weekly on MWF or daily except weekends. Many updates, no problems.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|When I was a child, I loved this film--I'm 53!  I tried to find this original at several local stores (used would have even been okay), but couldn't locate it.  Finally, I decided we just had to share this experience and ordered it on-line.  It came in only a few days and we have watched it several times as a family.  We just love it.
B000I186FW|2.0|If you like a tale were a man rises to lead his fellow citizens in rebellion against their oppressive society, then you will like this film.<br />If you like watching large explosions, fight scenes, and physical violence, then you will like this film.<br />If you like George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" then you will like this film.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />A well-made film will pull its audience in for its entire length. However, unrealities in this flim's plot jolt the viewer back to reality twice.<br /><br />A young woman is captured, her head is shaved, and is held captive while being repeatedly tortured. All of these acts are accomplished by the same man yet film goers are expected to believe that this woman never once realizes that it is the same man.<br /><br />And the filmmaker's abrupt intrusion with a sexual political agenda where people living the gay lifestyle are portrayed always as hapless victims is jarring. The flimmaker's unethical sexual views should have been left on the cutting room floor.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|KUDOS! a labor of love.  creative, entertaining, complex, challenging, and just plain fun!  the only game i highly recommend.  i would have paid more.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|A superb, emotive and varied soundtrack presented in a great case. However like many one of my reasons for picking up the deluxe edition was to gain access to the DTS Headphone:X version. The Amazon description doesn't mention it is iOS/Android only...because your phone is obviously the best audio device on which to listen to high end tracks...erm...okay. But hold on I mentioned Android didn't I? And it is touted on the voucher included with the Disks. Well as of the date of this review it doesn't actually exist, a wonderful piece of false advertising there by Watertower Music.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I Really enjoy playing it and it doesn't bother me having to wait for energy to charge. Now if I could just get some friends!!  Haha
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just found this series and having a hard time watching anything else.  Michael Chiklis is amazing - good cop/bad cop = great cop show.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I searched the thesaurus to find a euphemism  for \\"criticize,\\" and decided on \\"comment.\\" Thus, although I found Ocean, by the nature of its narrative,an \\"I'll-finish- the-book-today\\"  meal, I felt just a bit more than half-fed after ingesting it in one sitting, and dessert wasn't anything I didn't expect.<br /><br />  Of course, I liked it. How could I not? It had an imaginative, book-bound,scared, semi-sanctuary displaced, lonely, and friendless kid;  two unusual houses in a remote part of a forest, replete with various stages of mooned/moonless nights,and sleep inducing rain;  a disengaged(for somewhat different reasons) mother, and father; a four-years (?) older girl who would protect him, if only he held her hand;  part-time, surrogate mother and grandmother conjurors; dead people resurrected; floating witches......and yet.<br /><br /> And yet, I wanted more. What \\"more,\\" I'm not certain . To be perfectly ,(I usually function that way)  honest, the tale was \\"parsimonious\\" ( Like me?!?!) for the price.<br /><br />  In any case, I enjoyed the snack.<br /><br />mario
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable works wonderful ... Thank you  It gives my Kindle a full charge every time and it last at least 14 hours .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|wish it was longer! otherwise very neat game - looking forward to more rooms. now to look at their other games.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great content, easy read.  Wonderful insight into the tough training and sacrifices of our heroes.  Their dedication and self-sacrifice is incredible.  Kudos to the author for avoiding politics to the extent possible!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|A lot of detail went into this book and it is a continuing story about a family life style who the parents are both attorneys, an uncle who was disbarred and Theo who has a goal of becoming a practicing atty.
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is a classic Star Trek movie. My sons enjoyed watching it with me. Shatner's hair piece is awesome--it looks so real.
B005UG542S|5.0|We love this movie and all the others Harry Potter movies and books. We watch them all at least once a year.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked the game but it could have let you get all of the rooms for free but other than that it was a good game. I love these type of games
B001BANK32|5.0|I have seen the movie, &#34;The Shining&#34; many times and I have also watched the television mini-series.  I enjoyed them both.  However, nothing compares to the book.  The charm of Shining isn't in the scares, it is the relationships.  King really understands the strains and pressures of family dynamics.  There is a pain to &#34;getting along&#34; that you rarely see depicted in other media the way King can create in a story.  It is beautifully insightful, plus there are monsters...  both living and dead.  This story can't be beat.
0812992784|4.0|Is this Rushdie's best creative work?  No, it would be hard to beat Midnight's Children or TSV.  But, it isn't meant to be, and it is instead an incredibly important historical document.<br /><br />It's strange to read the number of negative reviews that mention \\"name dropping\\" in the book.  I found his personal lists of those who stood by him, or against him, with him or without him, as very skillful and even necessary.  It's easy today to think that the Rushdie story is one of the triumph of Free Speech where everybody agreed and fought alongside him for the right to publish and think freely, but in 1989 it was hardly that.  Those who now talk about how much they supported him were hesitant to stand with him openly, quiet and speaking from the sidelines, from fear of retribution.  It was a dangerous, violent time, and the sense of disorder, fear, and the unknown permeates the book.<br /><br />The style mimics this... it isn't a linear narrative, it isn't summed up in each chapter, it doesn't appear \\"plotted.\\"  It runs like someone running in the unknown, unsure what is to come. This \\"criticism\\" from negative reviews is also strange... the book would have suffered from a traditional, summed-up, crafted narrative that knew from point to point where it was going.<br /><br />It's not, I will admit, a particularly enjoyable read, and even though I understand the rhetorical function, the use of third-person is both a little hokey and distracting.  Even still, the work is definitely something essential for Rushdie to have gotten into the public record. It's something I'd definitely expect to read, or would assign, in a college course.  I'm glad it exists, and am glad to have purchased it, even though it isn't something I'd recommend to friends, or something I'll revisit again.<br /><br />Read it and put yourself in his position: imagine yourself having spent years pouring your heart and soul into a creative project. Then watch it nearly cost you your life. That is perhaps more terrifying than the actual threats of violence... how do you get over the psychological trauma of that?
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys were first known to me through Pandora and then I saw the PBS special featuring them and had to own some of their music. Beautiful!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This new masterpiece has the same power, intricacy, angst and, monstrous haunting feel and impact as anything they, or Ozzy, have ever done. It is simply a crushing return to form (with some drama and difficulties along the way). But what's important is the sheer quality of this release, which every bit justifies and explains the fact that it's the #1 album in the U.S. (their first ever), and either #1 or in the top 5, all over the world. These gods of heavy metal, the last group where all founding members are still alive, deserve all the accolades. Ozzy, Geezer and Tony are just spectacular on this release. Brad Wilk does a great job in Bill Ward's absence.<br /><br />[Black Sabbath's debut album came out when I was 13 years old...I'm heading (fast) to age 57. I've purchased every album they, in whatever incarnation Iommi has taken them, or Ozzy on his own, have ever released in various formats over the years: this includes albums, eight tracks, cd's, reissues, box sets, imports, etc, etc. Suffice to say; I'm a longtime fan. I've seen Black Sabbath perform live with Ozzy, Dio and Tony Martin on vocals. I saw Heaven & Hell this last time around, and Ozzy on his own. I will see them this time. Enough about me...this is just to give perspective.]<br /><br />Listen on a good stereo, crank it up loud, and be taken on a real musical ride. I still remember my disappointment when, on Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die, not every song was a masterpiece. That was not so on their first six albums, and it is not so on \\"13\\". All songs, and bonus tracks, are just great. What Black Sabbath, and Rick Rubin, wanted to accomplish on \\"13\\", has succeeded in every possible way these musical geniuses in their mid 60's could ever have hoped to accomplish. This is an essential album for any Black Sabbath fan, and a real important album for any fan of hard rock, or heavy metal. Just to hear where it all came from, again, in such a fresh, vibrant release , is a little surreal and a real trip down memory lane. Just buy it!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|It was great book. I would prefer that the author did not talk as much and would get straight to the point.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|Fun sequel to the John Barry story of my childhood.  It was fun to see popular actors and actresses playing the parts of this fantasy tale.  I enjoyed the story and was glad there was a moral to the story at the end.  Life is short so enjoy every day with your family.  In this story, Peter Pan has grown up and forgotten his past.  He was focused on his present career and not so much on his wife and children.  When the family goes to England to visit his grandmother, all the wonders of the past come to light and the adventure begins.  I would recommend this movie for children and adults 'cuz its fun!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|While I read nearly 100 books a year, I don't often write book reviews, but A Discovery of Witches (and the All Souls Trilogy generally) is certainly worthy of written praise. A Discovery of Witches builds slowly, but by Chapter 16, I was hooked! Deborah Harkness does a commendable job of combining a captivating plot that slips quietly into fantasy, while retaining enough realism to appeal to any logical reader. Over the course of both Part 1 (A Discovery of Witches) and Part 2 (Shadow of Night), Harkness develops characters, Diana and Matthew, that I have grown to love. I have recommended this book and its sequel to several friends and family members, and all have loved them just as much as I have. Harkness is a skilled storyteller with a deft touch--nothing about the magic in the story is heavy handed, and yet having read both books twice, I appreciate her careful attention to detail in the stories; details that become important when moving from the first to the second book. The only issue I have with the stories is that waiting for the third book is really hard--I just can't wait to see it come out! If you are a thinker who likes fantasy but  also likes substance in a story, you will not be disappointed in these books.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Loved the way this book switched between past and present.  The mother's dementia helps to weave the tale in a backwards and forwards motion.  The credible description of characters creates a realistic read. In regard to the 'secret keeper' as a character, I so admire her strength in guarding the riddle that was her life.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|These guys are amazing. Cello, just as much if not more than piano, but my goodness can they play music!
1476734941|5.0|I think the health implications of this book are more important than the diet aspect, but I must say that the diet part works.  I've lost 12 lbs since March 1 using a modified fasting approach.  I bought three extra copies and sent them to relatives.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book is wonderful and brings tears to my eyes as an adult. Very light for children and deep for adults. Very moving<3
B000FC130E|5.0|I liked this one better than American Gods. It was easier to follow and entertaining the whole way through. Anansi Boys is the best so far.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A great buy for any GOT fan.  The movies and books together make for a much more enjoy expeirence for this saga.  The books actually provide more detail that are often missed on the shows.
B003TNW044|5.0|You can never go wrong with Friends.  My favorite series of all time and this is a great season of this series.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|Redford at his very best, many of his iconic films such as Butch Cassidy & Sundance, The Sting, Jerimiah Johnson (and the list goes on).. only show what a great talent he is.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome<br /> This game is really cool and I recommend that you should get it! I love it and I can't stop playing it! It is so adicting!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Loved this game. I have only played the 5x5 grid because of my phone size so I'd love to try it on my tablet next! :)
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had never heard of this man but after reading this book I started to notice small things around me that fall back to Mr. Release. The author did a great job of putting bringing this mans life to light. I recommend that everyone. Deaf it Eddie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Sad it's over....  Was so caught up in the story I didn't even feel like I was reading it on a Kindle.  Stories that are not afraid to kill off the people they get you attached to (and main characters) are the best stories because then when the hero is in danger you actually don't know whether they will die, or if they will all pull through. Some authors save their heroes at the last second every time and then I get bored of reading the story because I know what's going to happen. This one was not like that.
1452110581|4.0|Just plain old fun!  Any cat lover can relate and enjoy!  Not great literature by two-legged standards, but, oh, the furry four-legged readers will be thrilled!
B00AEFXZEO|4.0|They all follow in the footsteps of this one... Mr. Bacon does it all, cannot remember seeing him in anything we did not like.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was introduced to the Jack Reacher Character in the movie with Tom Cruise.  I really liked the character and his uniqueness,  his values and his deductive reasoning.  On my kindle, an advertisement came out for the next Jack Reacher novel.  I then learned that there were over 10 novels of Jack Reacher.  I first read the comments by Lee Child on how he started his writing career and how he selected the Character and how he decided to structure his novels.  That gave me a unique insight on the character as I read the &#34;Killing Floor&#34;.  I am from the South, so the location was great to read about.  There were surprising turns in the plot.  I was eager to open my kindle each evening to continue the adventure.<br /><br />As a Ludlum fan, I am excited to have a new (for me)series of novels to enjoy.  I am downloading the next Jack Reacher right now!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Brings a wonderful addition to the music heard in the first movie but keeps the darker tone for this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is good fun and challenging. Pretty good for a free app. I like it and I highly recommend it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Overclocked to 4.4Ghz on 1.26V. Using Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus, maximum of about 70 Celsius on Prime95. Excellent performer, get it if you have a Z77 motherboard.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Really like this game. Would like a hint option, though... and maybe a bonus for completing in record time. Fun!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Got this as a gift for my nephew- he loves it. Duplo's are especially great for kids who are maybe 2-5 years old and have younger siblings, as they are big enough to pretty much eliminate the choking hazard!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|If you are a person who read the book first, good luck liking the movie. I absolutely LOVED the book but the movie got it all wrong, but I'm not saying don't watch it, I'm saying it isn't the best.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought the game would be stupid but then I started playing it I found out it was a number1 game and its free who couldn't want that
B000002H48|5.0|Buy it!!<br />a great documentary and wonderful songs....just waiting for the dvd to come out!!!  JT. CSN, Tom Petty, Carly Simon.....great
B008XG1X18|5.0|It doesn't matter if I am looking for a new recipe, a project for my kids or some inspirational quotes-- I just pin it!!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Love Bruce and have always been a fan, but how many times can a human being fall into girders, concrete walls and floors and not get seriously injured???? Movie was ok from an action standpoint, but I think Willis would be better suited I'd a different type roll. Just my opinion. We're all getting older.
B009R659L8|5.0|it was excellent! It kept me reading,it was very well written,almost could not put it down. I,ve read every book Mary has written.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love the game I like going on adventures and being fearless and I hardly know any other girls rather than me who play this game but it needs updates like more mobs or villagers
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I still read this book despite the reviews because I wanted to continue the story of Eva and Gideon. It wasn't as bad as some said but still not great like the first two. Despite that I will read the next book.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game is ok but I do not like the quests that you have to do. It would be better to just build it the way you want not the way the programers want it built. The quests are kinda long, not very relaxing at all. The music is good and it is relaxing. I would rate a higher star if they would get rid of the quests.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Looks like a kiddies game but is quite challenging. You have to try the upper levels. Love it! Download now!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|One of the best games I have found and it is very addictive<br />Play as often as I can and still want to play more
B00884GR0W|5.0|like minecraft but better because it's way cheaper &amp; u have like 100 more characters to help &amp;/ or hurt u
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Love this album. I hadn't heard some of the older stuff and I love hearing it!!! Maroon 5 has such an eclectic sound.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I dream of hopefully being able to sample his Sushi!!!  I think it is great that someone can be so talented and committed to a single focus and creating &#34;the Best&#34;!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Typical solitaire game. Only downside is ads. But, free games = ads. I play a lot on my kindle fire. Helps fill in wait times.
B00CKKDZ2S|3.0|just something for fun. but more times than not it hits the nail on the head. I enjoy having it on my kfire.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|wonderful,engaging...great dialogue and sustended tension between the characters. would recommend to everyone who missed it in the series.Look and enjoy!
0399162097|5.0|For me, We are all Completely Beside Ourselves is one of those novels where the premise put me off, but the strength of the author's earlier works (Jane Austen Book Club is a favorite) piqued my curiosity enough that I figured I would try the book.  That was a good thing.  This  novel is extremely well-done, fun to read, great characters, engaging and entertaining.  The premise--a family raises a chimpanzee as a child sounds like something you might hear about on This American Life and not fodder for a literary novel.  Fowler pulls it off and pulls it off well.  This is a story of family, not a story of the chimp alone.  The novel starts off a bit slowly, but once the narrative gets going, you won't be able to put this book down.  Rosemary, the non-chimpanzee daughter of the family at issue is the narrator--she is humorous, charming and an excellent storyteller.  Highly recommended.  Enjoy!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging to play and it is like temple run but a whole lot better!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have enjoyed the floors so far, I can't wait to see the next ones. I love puzzle games and problem solving.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I liked the whole series and this was the only season I was missing for my collection. Now I can watch the whole series, from beginning to end, at my leisure.
B0040I09RM|4.0|This 1st season was really great but IMHO there was too much graphic language. I certainly understand the reasoning behind some of the language since it fleshes out the characters but also think too much is just..<br />too much!!  I will continue to watch but it's because of the storyline which I don't think is enhanced by the verbal assault on my ears!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I enjoyed playing this game until the recent upgrade. Now all it does is rip you off. Each time you open a treasure chest you lose more pearls or sand dollars. Then when you need pearls or sand dollars to buy game elements you have to spend real dollars to get back what you lost to the treasure chests. In the previous version the treasure chests more often than not were beneficial.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|It simplifies the whole process of reading my feeds. I can scan thru to see which I \\"need\\" to read, what can wait and what I can pass up. So many of mine are graphical that it's easy to scroll thru.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Finally, something well written, well acted for someone smarter than a fifth grader. Can't praise it enough. Plotting, characters, acting, story development are consistently on a level that makes the show addictive. Haven't seen such quality in years. Thank you, CBS!
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Sure, it's arguably their weakest album, but the songs are still really enjoyable and fun to sing with. Very proud.
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this series after reading a review that compared it to Twilght.  What that reviewer failed to mention is that \\"50\\" copies the storyline & then turns it into x-rated crap. There are too many similarities throughout all 3 books--nothing original to this soryline. Very lame & disappointing.
B000006TRV|5.0|Sitting in a somewhat dark room playing the first track and then just letting the songs play in order is a great experience for me.  If you haven't done that and are a huge Floyd fan you really should.
B005GIS23I|4.0|My wife and I are comedy nerds so we hold a high bar for intelligent and thoughtful comedy. This hits things on the head and doesn't ask you to &#34;wait for the jokes&#34;
B000WTNCQI|5.0|The only issue with it is that, when buying different formats of an album on Amazon, it's hard to tell which songs exactly you're getting. I bought the double-vinyl edition, which includes 11 tracks. I was just slightly disappointed when I saw a couple of large blank spaces on the records where another song or two could have been included. The songs that are included, though are all very good (as one can expect from U2 and The Joshua Tree specifically), and they are as follows:<br /><br />Side One:<br />-Where The Streets Have No Name*<br />-I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For<br />-With Or Without You*<br />Side Two:<br />-Bullet The Blue Sky*<br />-Running To Stand Still<br />Side Three:<br />-Red Hill Mining Town*<br />-In God's Country<br />-Trip Through Your Wires<br />Side Four:<br />-One Tree Hill<br />-Exit<br />-Mothers Of The Disappeared
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I love the total salon make over and getting to dress the dolls.  I wish all the dolls were unlocked on this free game.<br /><br />Age 9
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|An amazing video follow up to the album that just about wore out back in the 70s and 80s. I was hoping that it would be straight covert video and not interviews and documentary stuff. It's a 2-hour concert video!
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|I had watched the movie and was expecting a different ending.  I thought the book would give me more insight into the thoughts of the main character.  The book's ending was disappointing.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|We love this app. Easy to navigate and it puts hours of amazing talks right on my Kindle. We use the app daily.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you have only heard The Piano Guys you miss half the fun.  Their music videos are as breathtaking as their music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these type of games! I really hope they keep adding more levels! This game is just challenging enough to be interesting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - was a great accurate description of the mission that killed Bin Laden and the events leading up to it. Would recommend!
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|A simple twist on an old story that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good action moves the story along at a nice pace.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Nice to be able to pick episode and watch whenever I want to. Great deal on price too. Thank you so much!!!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I guess it was just too &#34;out there&#34; for me. Might have been a cool idea but I didn't think it was very well executed. I think you would need to be smoking a lot of pot to be entertained & not annoyed by the movie & needless to say, I wasn't.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good writing, interesting history and good portrait of characters.  I did get a bit confused in the middle of the book as to who the characters were, where they were, and the years jumping back and forth which led to mandatory re-reads. Thank heavens it came together at the end of the book.  Those people who liked his first two books would also enjoy this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!Everyone should get it and rate it 5 stars!!!!! Its great and awesome put all together!!!! get it now and love it like me
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Having fun mixing my own music. Good times wasting time at home and learning mixing in my own home.  Awesome app
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This cd was better than expected, songs were great, choice excellent, a life gone way too soon.  Would  recommend to all Amy's fans.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Love the video and the era it represents.  I love Audrey Hepburn and her metamorphic role in this all-time classic.  Its a great movie to share with your family- especially if your children have a love for the Arts.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Incredible writing! Cheryl Strayed knocked it out of the park with an engaging memoir about hiking the PCT. I laughed. I cried. I was amazed. I really felt like I was on the journey with her. Can't say enough good things about this book - you will not want to put it down & you won't want it to end...BUT the ending is SO PERFECT! A+++
B007W4OZ76|5.0|Terrific app takes the frustration out of file management on your Android. Works great as promised. The themes work very well with it. Highly relommended.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I LOVED this app &amp; now it just wont work. wont even open at all. I thought I would re-download it &amp; it still wont work. unhappy customer.
0385472951|4.0|This is one of his best books, keeps interest and is a fast read.  Definitely recommend! Would purchase more of his books.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This  game is cute &amp; fun but Rairity is 35 gems and then her sister 30 gems and then rainbow dash is 90 gems!!!
B0081336FO|5.0|It's an amazing rendition of the classic tales ... seamlessly woven into modern background ... superb acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman ... it's a treat even for an old-fashioned (books and Jeremy Brett) Sherlock Holmes fan.
B00B04NJLW|4.0|Most of these shorts are mildly entertaining, only few are great, unfortunately none are scary and one is  extremely offensive. If you don't ilke what you see just wait and you will see something you do like. All of the shorts are creative and original. It appears many of the directors filmed what they wanted then tried to think of a word that began with that letter, instead of using a more logical word choice to fit their story because they were not assigned that letter. The strength to that is you see the director passion for their story. The weakness is some of the letters do not seem to fit. The menu selection is great so after a first viewing you can easily only watch the few shorts you love.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I had 4 of the individual workout apps from the same company (abs, legs, arms, cardio) from previous FAOTDs about a year ago. I enjoyed the apps although I admit even with the app I wasn't motivated to use them regularly though that's no fault of the app developer.<br /><br />This combined app replaces all the previous individual apps and adds a butt workout. Now there is an option for a full workout as previous reviewers said which combines areas of the body. The combined workout is very good if you are new to the app and can't sustain a workout routine of even a few minutes focusing on just one body area. Of course you are flipping your body around like crazy in about 4 seconds between routines but that is part of the fun.<br /><br />With this new app, I got my significant other involved a few days ago so we both have motivation. The videos are easy to follow and give clear instructions. I use plastic jugs or bottles filled with water for the weights.<br /><br />I got this app as the FAOTD but it would be well worth the money to buy it if you compare with a gym membership.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|It is fun and very acturet. The only thing i did not like is it takes so many questions<br />to just get one person.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This is more of a documentary than a movie, but it is very interesting.<br />Perhaps the best parts are the special features where loads of information<br />is given about rice, fish, etc.  For example, I didn't know that the best type of rice<br />for sushi is a transparent type.  I never even knew such a thing existed (we don't<br />have that kind of rice in our grocery stores!)
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is intriguing and weaves a dark tale about relationships and their nuances and how things that happened in the past affect our futures.  However, I didn't like one character in the book.  They were all damaged - some more than others - but mostly they weren't people I would spend a minute with.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|good quick read. steady build up and  didn't see the ending coming. would recommend this one especially if from boston area.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|First, let me set context here.  I'm rather new to Bruce Springsteen.  I'm 58 but treated him with indifference though I knew his music and story.  How could anyone in the USA miss that story back in the 70's when it was plastered all over Newsweek and Time?  Later on in the 80's someone loaned me Born to Run but I just did not see what the fuss was about.  I was too stuck into my Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charlie Parker records.  I wanted to hear virtuosity... there are many types of virtuosity and certainly that exists with Bruce and The E Street Band but it wasn't the sort of virtuosity I was looking for.  Anyway... Tastes and motivations change as we get older, don't they?  I saw Bruce's performance in the Superbowl a few years back and was impressed but our family went through some big changes and moved cross-country and I forgot about that.  Long story short, I got here via The Clash and London Calling after finally getting curious to see what THAT was all about.  I decided to buy the Live in NY City collection as was just blown away by the power of the sound, the incredible showmanship and of course the songs.  Land of Hope and Dreams is what sealed the deal for me.  So I decided I needed to add to my very large music collection by purchasing something new (the studio version of Land of Hope and Dreams helped me decide on Wrecking Ball) and Born in the USA.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying the songs on Wrecking Ball; these seem to be a cross between the stuff he's done with The E Street Band and Irish folk music (which I've heard he was doing a few years back so I'll investigate that too).  The music has a lot of power, a larger-than-life foundation underneath (I'm a musician by the way).<br /><br />My only complaint with this special edition is the larger packaging.  The booklet and photos are great; it's a handsome package but it doesn't fit into the shelves I have for my collection (too tall).  That's a pretty small complaint though.  Great stuff, I look forward to expanding my collection and getting a little more context.k forward to expanding my collection and getting a little more context.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|They are very helpful if you have issues and I love playing it! I'm a daily player and I don't t get tired of it. There are so many different rooms to play it keeps it fun.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I didn't expect such a great series from the History channel. Couldn't stop watching so I had a Vikings marathon. Can't wait for Season 2.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Gave this 5 stars back in June when I first got it. Everything worked fine. Now I get the old can not connect message every time I try logging on. Not sure what they changed, but app is worthless to me now.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three is just as good as the last two - can't wait for Season 4! Even my husband loves it! Great characters, great dialogue (love Maggie Smith). Good guys, bad guys, love, hate...it's all here!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have only tried all of them on easy, but really enjoyed it! Can't wait to try a harder level.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Challenging yet completely do-able. would recommend to anyone! it combines puzzles, games, and mind teasing perfectly. I cannot wait for more levels.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|Love the bluesy style of most of the songs.  A departure from routine Doors-style rock.  The Doors' version of Exile on Main Street.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm already loving this game.  Love brain teasers and the graphics are cool. Anyone who likes puzzles and hide/seek games would love this.
B005LJJESY|4.0|All of my friends said don't waste your time watching this movie, but I grew up loving the Green Lantern so i had to watch it. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it's because my expectations were so low to beging with, but either way I liked it enough to buy it in HD. It's not in the top 5 movies of all time, but certainly worth watching.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love the Bones TV show and thought the story would be similar. The story was very different, but the TV show could never make a show out of this book. There are 3 locations and many places in each location. Once I got it out of my head that it is not like the TV show, I looked at the story different. Temperance is like the Temperance on the TV show ready to investigate and get in trouble doing things she shouldn't have.  It was a fast read because I couldn't put it down. I will be looking for more books by Kathy Reichs reagarding bones.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Crashes a LOT (cant really get in often), but when I can play it the game is really fun! Something else I noticed is that it turns up my volume (max!) and brings me to the tuturial sometimes. It gets tedious and I hope these bugs can be fixed in the next update.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I truly enjoyed this story; it was thought provoking and engrossing.  The movie was wonderful, but the book was better.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|It's obvious the big movie studio is going to try and take advantage of the most loyal fan base by putting out the \\"Rated\\" version, then a few months later they will put out the version we all want, the \\"UNRATED\\" version. Don't let them double dip into your wallet!!!!!!!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Pompeii grasps the reader from the start of the book and embarks on a fascinating and illuminating journey through Italy on the eve of Mt Vesuvius's eruption.  This historical novel captures the essence of life in ancient Italy, set in the context of ancient aqueducts and the life of the protagonist, a Roman aqueduct engineer.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Word lover's ..... this app will make u happy! I LOVE IT! It inspires me to believe that I will never be too old to learn :))  What r u waiting for... just spend the 4 bucks and u will get smarter too!!!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Not a hard game to play.<br />I like the graphics.<br />Anybody who has extra free time can enjoy this.<br />It developes speed.
B005UG542S|5.0|Great movie and a terrific ending!!!!!  I am sad that Harry Potter's story is over, I would love to know what happened between killing Voldemort and Sending Harry and Ginny's two sons to Hogwarts!!  I have watched the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2 several times. already.  I always seem to find something  I  don't remember seeing before.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|Such great character development and well developed story telling. The dialogue was and still is memorable. What the movie lacks in modern day special effects and big budget, it makes up for in heart and charm. The latest rendition of Superman from 2013 is non stop choppy action and disjointed storytelling.
1451627297|3.0|Obviously, Mr. king is a master story teller, so I hold him to a higher standard.  My main disappointment was a rather over-the-top interpretation of the butterfly effect.  I won't go into so much detail as to spoil the book, but a few pages providing a more credible alternate future/present  would not have been too much to ask.<br /><br />As always, the story's development of interesting characters is impressive, even transient figures who appear for just a few pages.  This is what makes the book most rewarding...
B00940XIGU|5.0|this is one of those albums that's so packed with hits that there really isn't anything to scrutinize. I mean, there are so many collaborators on this album that everyone will find one or two artists if not more that they enjoy. if you want to know what party music sounds like for the first half of this decade, david guetta would be it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game and its sooooo good. both challenging and fun I think everyone should try it at least!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|Movie was amazing, all I can say, I dont get what people are talking abt. I enjoyed every second of it.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Watched it on father's day.. very enjoyable and in-line with the classic Die Hard movies. Much better than the last one
B003TOH8AE|5.0|This movie deserves a 5-star rating because that's the movie that my daughter loves. I do recommend this movie because it is extremely funny. It makes my daughter happy. She is constantly amused while watching it on her Kindle. I myself have seen this movie and it is hilarious. Oh yeah and my daughter is 14 years old. Obviously appropriation should be the number one factor in choosing anything for your child/children. Age appropriate for my child.
0143122916|5.0|very eye opening book.  i have read a handful of holocaust books and just talking with people and the general feeling is &#34;its amazing they did this without anyone at the time knowing.&#34;  and then talking about what we &#34;could&#34; have done if we knew.  This book describes the horrors of life for these imprisioned people and it is happening right now.  yet, nothing yet has been done to stop or even try to stop it.  Very detailed glimpse of life and how physcially, mentally and emotionally horrific humans can be to one another.
B0011Z76RS|4.0|CLASSIC linkin park. if you didn't know why this band was so great, then you probably never owned this album.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I don't believe I waded through all that gore & guts to be left with no resolution. I 'm not sure I'll bother with next one, there aren't that many characters left that I care about!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|This book opened my eyes!  Great inforation, lots of facts, I lost 25 lbs after reading!  Highly recomended for Diabetics
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Probably the best Le Carre I have read. Clearer and lighter than his older, archetypal Cold War iron curtain books.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|This was a Great Movie!!!!! Denzel's the man!!!! Don't see why the critics hated this movie. OH, because he's black and bad!
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band's Ultimate Hits contains some of the best Rock and Roll songs ever written and performed.  I can listen to this album over and over again.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|only really picked this album up because of hearing the Alesso Remix of If I Lose Myself, but thoroughly enjoyed this album. at times kind of sad and other times very uplifting. i really liked \\"Au Revoir\\" and \\"I lived\\"
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I am a die hard Streisand Fan.  She delivers comedy like no other actress I know. I loved this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is exciting and moving.  I couldn't put it down.  This futuristic world is too close for comfort.  I was also disgusted with the way death was so casual to many.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Being a SciFi fan and just having finished reading this book, I'm a bit chagrined that I didn't pick this up when it was first published. An excellent story and well told. If you enjoy a good scifi tale, you'll enjoy Ender's Game.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|This production demonstrates strength under the pressures of extreme persecution and man's inhumanity to man. The humor is wonderful, but, sadly, belies the tragedy of conditions of the time. I have never seen more moving performances than those of the three lead characters. The movie is a reminder of how any nation that does not continuously challenge its leaders can fall prey to a tyrannical government.
B002SKDGRE|5.0|Simply an excellent book about an extraordinary Man very well written. Unlike other authors who tried to make a criticism about this guy, the author of &#34;The King of Oil&#34; based this books on personal interviews he made during many years with many people concerned so the book is based on facts and not on personal emotions and frustrations like many others.
B00BX8653O|3.0|I find the music on here to be very enjoyable. at times haunting, but always appealing. if you like coldplay, this takes that falsetto to another level. great material, though would have appreciated more vocals on the tracks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a person that reads a lot, however, this book is a page turner.  I recommend this book to those in and out of relationships.  There is something to be learned by all.  I look forward to reading the last two because this book leaves you wondering what happened next.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Incredible bang for the buck and great for a gaming build. Solid choice for anyone building a non CPU heavy PC.
0307474275|1.0|My main problem with this book is that when I read it the main character in my brain when I imagined it looked like Tom Hanks. I wanted the character to look like my neighbor, Harly, because Harly is a professional symbologist (which is really a real job, so don't listen to the haters, Tom!). Also, I found the book to be unrealistic because Tom Hanks was menaced by Opus Dei Catholics, who caused him a lot of trouble. In real life, this would never have happened. I know this because Harly HATES Catholics. In fact, I'm pretty sure he's the one who set that fire, but I think the statute of limitations is two years, so who cares.<br /><br />I guess my point is, zero stars. Thank you for your time, Mr. Hanks.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I love this cd.  Every song puts me in a mellow mood.  Hands down my favorite Radio Head album.  Definitely a great purchase.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is ready to use. The search field is conveniently located at the top of the screen. It also has an auto suggest function that saves you time from in putting the entire word.
B00122DF16|5.0|I don't think I've ever run across a person that didn't get something from this album. sure it's a rehash of all their previous songs but the delivery and rework of those songs are done so well. I'm not the only one that shares the opinion that some of the reworks in this album are better than the originals, and that is hard to do considering how some of those songs are already so great.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The ergonomics of the PS3 controller is great but wish they were more robust and lasted longer.  I play FIFA and I probably push harder on the directional controls than most people or than most games require, so I understand the reduced lifecycle...
B00C061I3K|5.0|It's not like their normal stuff but it is a beautiful ode to the beginnings of dance music and it is absolutely stunning.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was fun and I 'm pleased I read it. I was a bit surprised by how well Don coped with some situations but let that slide.
193700788X|5.0|I really reading this book.  I'm sad to see the end of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Some series endings leave you questioning what happened to the characters but this book wraps everything up nicely.  I enjoyed reading about the path some of the charaters took in this book and I was very pleased with the ending.  I would definitely recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series to anyone who enjoys the supernatural in all aspects.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Very challenging and the story was interesting.  I will be looking forward to part two.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I love this series and other then the 'In Death' series by J. D Robb would say it's my favorite, but this book was too drawn out for my taste. I normally like lots of details but I felt she started describing things as a way to fill more space. I know many are upset with the man who wins Sookie's favor in the end, but that truly doesn't bother me (although my favorite pick was not the one). I only finished the book because I'm that dedicated to the story and because I feel it a personal failure to give up on a book. I normally read through these books in days, a week tops, but it's taken me a month and eight days to finish this one. I've never said this about a Sookie Stackhouse novel, but I won't be reading this one again any time soon.... or maybe ever again.<br /><br />I do however fully recommend the others!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|sat and watched it with the fam. every one enjoyed it, can't wait for the other two movies to come out
1401322425|5.0|Good home cooking with some great tips on how to make them extra special and tasty. Lots of handy tips and good information and photos are superb. Just what I expected from Jamie Oliver.
B001NVIZ9I|5.0|I purchased this movie to show to some of my sixth grade students as a reward (and compare/contrast activity with real medieval life).  It took a little bit of work to convince them that it was going to be a fun movie, but by the end their eyes were glued to the screen.  The clever, sometimes campy, dialogue and good action scenes kept us all entertained (and my academic exercise worked as well).
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show!  The story line and characters are great!  I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys SciFi!!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|this is such a great mix of artists and the movie was phenomenal im so excited! i love all the songs
B00005JKDR|5.0|This was a big hit with my grand kids who are 4 to 11 years old.  They laughed and laughed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addicting and exciting.  The puzzles keep getting harder and more exciting.<br />This is a great app.  Lots of fun.  Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzles.
1401324649|2.0|The author has a great writing style - otherwise this would have been a 1 star for me. It's reviewed on the cover as being a silly novel - and the character as being like Forest Gump. It IS a silly novel, and not one that I'd recommend for it's silliness. Likening the character to Forest Gump is an insult - where Forest was a naïve kind natured person, this main character is a con man and a murderer. I read it to the end and wondered why did I bother? It was because I enjoyed the way the author structured the story and his writing style is superb. Please, Jonas Jonasson, write a less silly book next!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really great.  I get different things everyday. My friend have challenges and they cant resist getting beat.  I love this game yo.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I have several utilities for this function I don't like it as much simply because of the limited information you get from it but otherwise ok.
B00821OX98|5.0|A wonderful show! I can't wait to see what happens. It keeps getting more and more interesting. So many surprises.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Riveting Exciting and action packed.  Read the trilogy back to back.  Could not put this one down.  A must read.  This not just a young adults reader.  This series reminds me Harry Potter in its wide appeal to all ages.
061891868X|5.0|I'm not a scientist, just someone who is curious about the world. I'm especially curious about the second law of thermodynamics - the so-called &#34;arrow of time&#34;, and the low entropy state of the known universe before the &#34;big bang&#34;.  Theories abound, take your pick, plenty of big brains are invested in particle physics, string theory, branes, etc., etc.<br /><br />Lee Smolin digs into all this in this very readable book.  Look, I'm just a curious layman and The Trouble With Physics helps me slog through my journey into the unknown.
B00632HWOG|5.0|An excellent, easy to understand and easy to use mail system that encompasses everything an email system should have, with high file storage limits and ample limits for attachments. Yahoo has a great automatic SPAM filtering system, yet gives you the chance of reviewing any SPAM messages until the user deletes them. Dumping of SPAM and DELETE files is quick and easy. I have used Yahoo for over 15 years and find it the best and easiest to access while traveling, both domestically and overseas. It compares favorably with the best of the email systems of Microsoft, Google and others, and excels over many ISP mail systems like Comcast or Roadrunner. Yahoo easily links to photo site Flickr and other sites such as Facebook.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I wanted more hip hop, instead I got the antithesis of 808 and Heartbreak. Songs 2-8 were pretty good though, but overall this is my least favorite Kanye album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! This book had much more romance and hearts and flowers! Plus the action and fighting kept me on my toes!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love ))&, and this was a really great movie. I saw it at the theater and liked it so well, I wan't it in my collectionl
1451629192|4.0|Difficult to read considering what this girl/woman went through but also very encouraging in that she survived and didn't succumb to what many others do; which is self-pity or the blame game.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|I have a soft spot for clear monster high parts. The 'wig' feels really funny, like... a toy more for adults. If you know what I mean. Can't say I'm fond of it. The rest of the parts are gorgeous though. One of the better CAM kits, in my humble opinion.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Biggest innovator in hip-hop in my opinion. Extremely raw and well-conceived music. What you might expected from a disgruntled genius.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Story really pulls you in!  Great acting!  Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver are outstanding!  This movie really earns all the buzz about it!
B0086700CM|1.0|This game will not let me turn right. Then it won't let me turn left. I wasted an hour trying to make it work but it just flings me into trees or off the path.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing.  They blend classical with modern.  Who else can combine Vivaldi and the theme from Bourne and pull it off.  and they didn't just pull it off, the song is, well, amazing.
B009PAETCG|1.0|So, I downloaded the &#34;FREE&#34; app which I found in the &#34;KIDS&#34; game section. When we opened the app it stated that if we want to play the game in kid mode we had to pay....false advertising anyone?
0345803485|1.0|I'm generally able to find a few good things about a book. This one succeeded in having all of its page numbers in the correct order.<br />Unless your reading interests mainly involve gasps, oh mys, down theres (because they make up about a third of all the words used in the book) and overused italics, you may want to find yourself something a little better written to pass your time with. I recommend something in the Dick and Jane collection. If you want something a little more kinky, get one with Spot in it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of reading fiction... Reading in general... But this book blew me away. It captured and held my interest from the first page. I don't recall ever reading a book from start to finish so quickly. I simply could not put it down. I am a byproduct of the 80's and every reference and quote from the book had me grinning ear to ear. This book is for everyone who appreciates a great underdog story. Tho, I think those who experienced the 80's era first hand might enjoy the books nuances...
B004U8VQOW|4.0|This is a very enjoyable tour, with the added value of an account of maintenance added.  Beautiful photos from space!  Great for parents of elementary or middle-grade children.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|So happy the EP decided to extend it another season. I enjoyed season 7 and look forward to season 8.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Great movie even if not blue ray quality is awesome since we have a high def TV's.  My 2 year old loves the OG movie and this one.  I enjoy seeing it over an over too..
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was a latecomer to the Whoniverse but I'm definitely here for the long haul. Be careful...it is completely addicting
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I have had this for about a month and its still working great. For the price paid it cant be beat.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This Grisham novel was perfect reading for the rainy days in the south during our spring break in Gulf Shores, AL.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|But considering that the Hero 3 now comes with the dive housing included they should throw in the red lens as well.  Over priced given the minimal materials, but absolutely necessary if your diving below 15 feet.  Air bubbles have a tendency to get between it and the housing so make sure you give it a few good shakes to clear before recording starts.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Love this book!!!! I love Jack Reachers character. Childs descriptive ability makes you feel as if your right there with the characters. Great book!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Good overall album in a time where music lacks substance and originality. He stays honest to him lifestyle.  No fall off from first album.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie - everything about it.  It's funny, poignant, inspiring, illuminating (when was the last time you heard a fascinating comparison between rap and opera - in rap?!) and unbelievably entertaining.  \\"Yes, guys - I AM having fun...!!\\"
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this on both my smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD. I use for my :Honey do!&#34; lists, grocery lists, taking meeting notes, jotting down an address and/or phone #. You name it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Finally--a show worth watching. I really was getting discouraged with the choices on TV and was delighted to come across this. Better yet, it is available on Amazon Prime, so I was able to get caught up on the first 3 seasons before season 4 is released. Definitely worth watching!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|You cannot complain much about the movie if you have read the book.  It is an excellent retelling of the story, but as with all movies much has to be left out in the short time frame allowed to tell a story.  The only thing I felt that was not portrayed well was the extravagance of the people of the Capitol City.  Someone not having read the book, would not have gotten the flavor of the outlandish and selfish doings of the people of the Capitol City to entertain themselves and their total naivete of the other district's plights.  Great movie for one who is a fan of the books and understands all of the political undercurrents that could not be conveyed in the movie itself.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I'm not a consistent fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. Some I find good, others leave me flat.<br /><br />This movie I thoroughly enjoyed. Well thought out script, and superb acting by Christoph Waltz. It is the story of a German Dr. turned bounty hunter (Dr. King Schultz), and a uneducated but savvy slave (Django) who becomes his partner. Waltz's character is both compassionate and heartlessly ruthless, yet he pulls it off masterfully.<br /><br />Set in about 1859, 2 years before the American Civil War, these two wage a bloody war on wanted criminals. They also have a secondary mission which I will leave you to see.<br /><br />Great movie. Django... the \\"D\\" is silent. ;-)
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|The only problem I have with this movie is he keeps watching the movies, I would have tossed them after the first time.  The ending is crazy, I never expected that, but I think it was not that scary.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|One of the very few television series I would ever rate as top notch entertainment. I love it more now than ever.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Gotta love it. Works well as a companion to so many other things. Like, where do I go when my Scrabble (Kindle Tablet Edition) &#34;Teacher&#34; shows me words I don't recognize? Or, when I want to impress by using a 'big' word in an email to a colleague, or one of my (grown) kids?
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|This is a newer version of &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;--but it was still a decent movie and worth watching at least once.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Read if: You like characters who hate themselves. You like mysteries that are about characters instead of events. You like simple, poetic language that sometimes jolts right through you with the clarity and poignance. You like your books like you like your coffee: dark, bitter, and bottomless.
0307341550|5.0|Great book. Absolutely loved it. Lent it to a friend who also loved it. Now reading another novel by the same author. Paints a picture with words.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It is ok. Not a must see but worth a couple bucks to watch. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre.
B009R659L8|4.0|This was true Mary Higgins Clark style.<br />Could not put the book down!<br />I am always looking forward to a new book from her.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Amazon delivers again! DVD came in perfect NEW condition and arrived early. One of the best good feeling movies of all time. Sandra Bullock nails her performance. A must see for any age. Ten stars!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super!!!!!! Definitely keeps me busy when I'm bored. Like that it's a hands on sort of game. Wish I could get more money to buy things faster.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|works fine-what else can I say?  the price was good too.  I am not going to rate things any more if I have to do 25 words!
B00C061HZY|5.0|The soundtrack to this summer and many more to come for sure.  There's so many layers and new favorites to come back to.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very much like 50 shades, but more mature. Over easy read & can't wait to read the rest! Definitely would read this again.
0679805273|5.0|The book was exactly what I wanted at a great price - even including shipping it was cheaper than at the bookstore. The first book came with a tear on one of the pages. There was absolutely no hassle with returning it. Amazon printed a postpaid shipping label and I just sent it back in the original package. The replacement came in perfect condition in just a few days. It will be a high school graduation gift for a special young lady.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|At first I didn't think I would like it but I do. I started to finally get use to the game with its falling rocks and trees. I thought I would never get over the thin path you had to run on but I got the hang of it. I finally got up to level 10. At first I didn't get the hang of some of the items you can use and some I still don't because I haven't seen much of a help screen but I think I will continue playing and see how far I get. It does get fast at some parts of the game but it is fun anyways.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I dislike this book because I was looking for a simple word description of pronunciation to show my class mates.
0062267787|4.0|If you love Delirium , you'll love these! They're nice and give some background about the live of the world in Delirium! Annabel was my favorite!
B000002JSP|5.0|I was in high school when this came out, in the throes of a first love. I played this endlessly on 8-track, feeling like a fool in the rain, in the evening, giving all of my love. The relationship didnt last, but my memories of it and this album go on.<br /><br />Still holds up as well as any other Zep album.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Beth Hart is by far the most incredible and powerful performers I've ever seen! She delivers on every song on this cd... absolutely amazing!!! This is the second cd her and Joe have done together and its pure magic!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect since I've watched every Trek movie out there and this one was supposed to be &#34;modern&#34; with different actors.  It was a pleasant surprise because it was humorous, and the actors all did a wonderful job in portraying the well-known characters.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I have been playing for a little while on this atlantis. The stories are interesting they tell you about and it is not a fast game, sometimes you just want to unwind and do the match up type games. Although the screens after you find all the items and you have to match them to the objects I thought was a little lame, not much to do there very easy. Not a real exciting game but okay to play for a slow match items because that is all you do on every level.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The movie came within a few days of ordering. The person I purchased from had computer problems and thought the movie was not shipped. After a couple of emails I stated that I had indeed received the movie and thank the person for being so caring. I will definitely recommend this person to buy from. The customer service was excellent.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It's very good in explaining and the words are pronounce so that very good in a way for some reason I  hope everyone feels the same way as I do
B007HC3LHS|3.0|While this book was okay, I never felt she truly made her disorder believeable to me, and when she went for help there was very little about what made her better.  She came out of it far too quick.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|No chance that you'll not hear this baby! By the time I access the program I'm wide awake. And price is right.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It took me a pit to get started but after I figured out how to play it became a lot of fun. The start was slow and I thought it is not working,which was wrong. Need some more instructions.
B003A2JBUK|2.0|I was just surprised that something with less than a dozen pieces cost cost nearly $50.00.  Feel like it was overpriced.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|The writers did a great job in picking up the story line from the original movie and tying it in with this story line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very relaxing. I recomend this game to anyone that likes animals! It's so realistic. You can get lost in the game for hours!
B006OGMEUI|5.0|if you like rock, if you like guitar, if you like music that clearly took painstaking hours upon hours of thought, talent, and devotion to produce, then buy this.  yes, it is very VERY different than what most people here in the US are used to hearing. but it's just amazingly well done.  it's a recounting of the gallic wars taken from the commentarii de bello gallico, which is Caesar's own account of the wars.  but it's told from the perspective of one of the more prominent tribes he opposed. so that's the story the lyrics are telling you, now throw in amazingly heavy death metal, and somehow add in flutes, whistles, bagpipes, hurdy gurdy, etc., and BOOM.  I promise you, you'll catch yourself headbanging to flutes.  This was my introduction to Eluveitie, and now I have all their albums and have been exposed to sooo many other bands I'd never heard of before.  But still, this is their best work. Buy It.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who loves metal of any kind, give this album a chance. you will not be disappointed. It will open new doors to many different genres of metal for you.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|This CD kicks ass it reminds me of the good old days with a 2013 twist..Yes one member is missing But Tony.Terry and Ozzy are great. Granted this isn't the late 60's or 70's they were alot younger then but it has a more progressive and mature sound but still relates to their rootsAll the guitar work and the singing just come together Ozzy's voice sounds captured me and I enjoyed listening to the words and the music..In all this is a great CD and I can't wait for them to go on tour..
B00979CS50|5.0|Suffice to say I have everything he has released.Even his first of the ANTHOLOGY.I did not expect anything but perfection,so thats what I got.<br />He is starting to say more these days then perhaps he did 30 -odd years ago.Not that it should all be taken at face value.Neil has a crazy way of starting to write about something and then veer off to far left so that if anyone WAS perhaps relating a bit too much,it all changed.He's brilliant at it! Well,he is just simply brilliant.<br />Love the jamming with the Horse.He always,I think has the most fun when he can let himself go,into Neiland...drifting back or just singing about that cowgirl in the Sandiego.........Heh,heh,heh.
034580404X|5.0|I't was REALLY good!  Wish there was other books I could read.  E L James is a great author hope she writes more:-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome but if they could add new stuff like more upgrades and obstacles that would be cool to but I think that would be awesome:-)!!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like the game but I don't like how you let ppl play the game then out of nowhere u want us pay for the rest of the game if the game says it's free then it should be if not it should say free trial.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|i'm still amazed at how great this album is. it is flawless in every sense of the word. absolutely one of the best records of all time.  buy it, now.  you'll thank me later.<br /><br />btw. if you've never listened to it before, before you do, put yourself into the following state of mind. *you're a huge fan of Sabbath, and you know they have a new singer now who you've vaguely heard of before, and you're angry anyone had the gall to try and fill ozzy's place.  you expect this album to suck. you want this album to suck. you turn it on. and you hear neon knights start up...*.  still gives me goosebumps.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is definitely a sexual book but at the same time its appropriate and keeps you reading more and more! Definitely a woman's book
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game so far!! definitely recommend it to my friends! I am having so much fun. I rate this app four out of five stars
B009GFEOY8|5.0|The fact that i no longer have to shield the film from sunlight makes using my old Polaroids much more pleasant and easy. However i'm wondering why there are only eight exposures in the PX70 cassette and not 10 like it used to be in the past.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Even though it was the last book and I wanted Eric and Sookie to stay together I wasn't really surprised by the ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game made me stop and think on a few levels, wish there were more levels though. it stops at only 10 levels.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|outstanding album. I personally love it.  however it should only appeal either to established fans of Sabbath or metal history buffs. if you're not already a dedicated Sabbath-head, it's not worth your money. go back and buy all the old classic albums for much cheaper.  this album won't be appreciated unless you have a knowledge of where it all started.
B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men has always been one of my favorites. I used to steal my brother's comic books and action figures as a kid. Honestly, I loved this movie. It was well done and had a great cast. I know that there are discrepancies between the movies and the comic books, but it is that way for any book-turned-movie. The discrepancies were easy enough for me to overlook in order to see one of my favorite things come to life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I usually get frustrated with games like these, but this was different. I got off to a good start and am looking forward to more levels as updates come out.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I'm on max lv 25 and there is nothing to do it is boring u can't get a lot of money to get things soo please get a UPDATE I NEED ONE BAD'LL WWW
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's good but you pay a dollar then they only give you 3 avatars and 5 world's to buy the other stuff all together it would  cost at least thinking off the top of my head 5.00
0307476073|5.0|Well written; passionate and realistic journey toward self discovery. The author earns one's respect by telling her story without subterfuges. Great read.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I grew up watching the various renditions of this for TV and movies, and was very pleasantly surprised about the differences between those and the book. Not to say that I will stop watching those, but this will be a great Christmas tradition for me to read.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Having seen the film nearly a week ago, I wanted to take a few days to let it all soak in. I wanted to be able to highlight what was done right and what was done wrong as objectively as possible. Despite the fact that I know many of the folks here gave it a stellar five-star review, I simply couldn't. I wanted to love this film so much and, while I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but feel something was missing. Upon much deliberation and thought on the matter, the most nagging question that came to mind was...\\"Where is the JOY??\\".<br /><br />I was nine years old when my father took my brothers and I to see Richard Donner's Superman film the day after Christmas in 78. As a kid, it was a mind-blowing experience. From the opening credits to the iconic shot of Chris Reeve as he smiles passing over Earth, it was enchanting and beyond what I thought Superman could be. Granted, I was NINE at the time. However, to this day, it still holds up as a fun and visually breathtaking film. For my money, I still maintain it's the best \\"superhero movie\\" ever made. Now...I know what many of you are going to say. The typical argument against those critics who took issue with Man Of Steel is that they are too set in their ways and vision, as if living in the past and kneeling at the altar of Donner's classic interpretation. I would certainly concede that is valid to a degree. However, I went into it expecting something different and more \\"today\\". I'll admit that, while I love the Donner film, it is certainly dated in terms of special effects and had a rather silly plot at times. That said, despite what would now be seen as shortcomings to the film, it had something that Man Of Steel was lacking in spades. It's an element that should be at the very center of a character that has remained a symbol of hope and goodness for seventy-five years. Quite simply, it lacked \\"heart\\".<br /><br />Having been absolutely \\"gutted\\" when I saw Superman Returns seven years ago, I was absolutely thrilled when it was announced that Christopher Nolan and David Goyer (the team that brought Batman back from the cinematic dead after Joel Schumacher's horrid take on the character in the mid-to-late nineties) would be taking on Superman for a new generation. Moreso, I was positively stoked that Zack Snyder, the man that brought \\"Watchmen\\" to the screen, would be at the helm as director. I knew Snyder had a penchant for visually stunning action sequences and very comic-styled scenery. I figured if anyone could bring Supes back from Bryan Singer's abysmal \\"Returns\\", it would be them. Of course, after some thought on the matter, it occured to me that maybe Nolan and Goyer, who grounded Batman in a quasi realistic world, might not be the right people to handle Superman. Let's be honest. Superman and Batman are polar opposites. Batman is, by his very nature, a troubled and dark vigilante. \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" were befitting for that character (although Nolan \\"nuked the fridge\\" with \\"Dark Knight Rises\\"). Superman, on the other hand, is Earth's favorite adopted son. The character is grounded in religious iconography (more Moses than Jesus in my opinion), classic mythological archetypes (think Hercules), and raised by \\"salt of the earth\\" midwestern farmers to give him an absolute moral center. Batman is \\"grey\\" and Superman is \\"black and white\\" or \\"right and wrong\\". This is why their shared stories have a great dichotomy. As a team, they're great foils for each other...but separately, their stories should be as different as \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\".<br /><br />Now, with all that in mind, let me give my opinion on what they got RIGHT.<br /><br />Krypton was fantastic!! This was the only area where I thought this film surpassed Donner's crystaline world. There was a hierarchy involved. You had the counsel, the scientists, and the military. I thought the notion of a world with genetically engineered offspring was fascinating and the notion of Kal-El being the first \\"natural\\" birth in centuries was intriguing. Russell Crowe, as Jor-El, hit it out of the park. Crowe brought a bit of Gladiator's Maximus to the table. He carried himself with nobility and fearlessness as the father of Earth's mightiest hero and prophet of Krypton's doom. Michael Shannon's Zod was stoic and convincing as Krypton's military leader who sought to preserve their culture and heritage. This is another plot point I thought was well done. Zod was not a clear-cut villain who only sought revenge. Like most military leaders throughout history, he carried out his machinations with the best of intentions for his people. Those are usually the best kind of antagonists, the ones that truly feel they are on the side of right. If there's a true villain (in the \\"love to hate\\" sense) in this movie, it's Zod's right-hand Faora. Played with delicious coldness by Antje Traue, Faora is really fun to watch. Her motives aren't as noble as Zod's in that she seems to relish the violence she inflicts.<br /><br />When the film moves to Earth, it immediately cuts to an adult Clark Kent. Unlike the traditional origin story, the film tells Clark's story through multiple flashbacks. It's an interesting device that works in the sense that we don't have to wait a full hour to see Superman come into the picture. It's not unlike Mark Waid's brilliant \\"Superman: Birthright\\" mini series, where Clark, before taking on the mantle of Superman, goes on a soul-searching trek to find his place in the world.<br /><br />Kevin Costner takes on the role of Jonathan Kent with his usual earnestness and Diane Lane was an inspired choice to play Martha. They convincingly play their roles as Clark's earthbound parental role models.<br /><br />Henry Cavill was a great casting choice. He certainly looks the part and, let's face it, he did as well as he could with what he had to work with. He's certainly a fine actor (The Tudors) and didn't try to be a Reeve clone (like Routh in \\"Returns\\"). However, by saying \\"what he had to work with\\", it allows me to segue into what I believe the film got wrong. Before I do, I please ask that, should your opinion differ from mine, please maintain some civility in your comments. We all have opinions and these are merely my own.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan and David Goyer were clearly the wrong people to tell Superman's story. As I mentioned earlier in this already lengthy review, Superman and Batman are polar opposites. It would seem that they really wanted to give this film a \\"realistic\\" take on how the world and humanity would react to an alien presense with god-like powers. Naturally, he would be met with cynicism, fear, and distrust. While this is an intriguing premise, by doing so they have erased Superman's sense of wonder, hope, and goodwill. While we all know Superman/Kal-El is an alien, Superman is also Clark Kent. As a matter of fact, and please go back and look through the history of the character over seventy-five years, Superman is more Clark Kent than he is Kal-El. Despite his alien birth and phenomenal powers, Clark Kent is one of us. His humanity and midwestern upbringing gives him the moral fiber to use his powers responsibly. In other words, he knows when and where to pull his punches. It's not only about saving the people of Earth, it's about protecting them and striving to keep them from harms way. So...where was THIS Superman in the latter half of the film???<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints most had with \\"Superman Returns\\" was the lack of action. We all wanted to see Supes throw a punch and kick a little butt. I was certainly one of those who longed for a real global threat as opposed to yet another Lex Luthor feeble real estate scam. However, while this film certainly delivers the action many of us wanted to see, they took it to levels of mayhem and destruction that was (for lack of a better term) in poor taste. Poor taste for Superman, anyhow. As a sci-fi epic, it works. As a Superman movie, itfails on many levels. It's as if they were trying to make up for \\"Returns\\" lack of action by over compensating and saying \\"this is not your father's Superman\\". The collateral damage in this film is nearly unforgivable. There comes a point where I, as a movie buff, stop suspending disbelief and start paying attention to the staggering loss of life that has to be occurring in the midst of all the \\"action\\". When action gives way to absolute mayhem and wanton destruction, I find myself detached and disillusioned. I wanted to root for Superman. I wanted to root for Smallville's favorite son. I wanted to root for Clark. However, the last third of the film had me asking myself \\" Why isn't he taking this fight AWAY from the already decimated Metropolis???\\". My son and I often joke, being comic book fans, about how much insurance premiums must cost for the average citizen of Metropolis. As I was watching the climactic final battle, I found myself thinking of the escalating body count with each punch landed by either Superman or Zod. \\"Ooops...there goes Zod through another building...that's probably two or three hundred people dead right there\\", and et cetera. Have film makers become so jaded that they don't think people will notice or care? What does that say about us as a movie going public??<br /><br />Now, I'm taking into consideration the Kryptonian threat. Naturally, there are high stakes in this story (maybe too high because I'm not sure how they will up the ante for a sequel or subsequent films), but the failure here is that the crash-bang-wallop happens before you're genuinely in a position to care about any of these people. Superman, in this story, is more Kal-El than Clark. He's somewhat detached and unsympatheic most of the time. He's grown up in Kansas, yet seems all too eager to be more Kryptonian than Earthling. Instead of being uplifted and optimistic, as should have been my sense when watching Superman, I was unsettled and cynical after a while. All the greatspecial effects and CGI in the world mean absolutely nothing without a solid and engaging story to tell. However, I think the greatest sin inherent in Man Of Steel is that it takes itself WAY too seriously. I can't recall a single point in the film where I laughed (save for the moment outside the bar where Clark was bullied by a drunken patron). As a matter of fact, I don't think I even smiled a whole lot either. My point is this...shouldn't we be smiling when watching Superman? Shouldn't we come out of a Superman movie longing to take to the skies and fight the good fight? That sensation was lost on me here. Granted, I wasn't as livid and angry as I was coming out of \\"Superman Returns\\", I simply was left feeling uninspired. A great movie has me coming out talking about it for days on end. Man Of Steel simply left me stupified. It's like watching a big fireworks display on the Fourth Of July that goes on much longer than it should. After about fifteen minutes of big bangs and spectacle, at some point you just want to go home as if to say \\"enough already\\"... Too much of anything is not a good thing, and Man Of Steel gets to be too much after a while.<br /><br />Great Scott!! Superman shouldn't be THIS difficult to get right! We live in a cynical age. We don't trust our government. We don't trust our media. Sensationalism and exploitation mire the airwaves, films, books, and music. Shouldn't a Superman movie be a welcome distraction from all of this cynicsm? Again, this is my humble opinion, but shouldn't Superman be inspiring? To me, Superman should be the best of ALL of us. No matter what race, creed, or philosophical background you have, Superman should encapsulate all that strive for and not just some comic book with unrealistic powers and oversimplified morality. Is being the \\"big blue boy scout\\" such a bad thing???<br /><br />I didn't hate the movie. It was enjoyable at times and provided some \\"geek out\\" moments for me as a comic book fan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good Superman movie. Yes...there is a difference between a good eye candy flick and a Superman movie. Namely....having respect and reverence for a character that has been a global beacon of good for seventy-five years.<br /><br />Sorry to all you Nolan, Goyer, and Snyder fans out there..but Superman deserved better than this.

Also commentary of the Air Force rocket propelled aircraft program (X1, X15, X20) which was being developed in parallel with the NASA space program, but scrapped before it realized its full potential.  A pity because it was the precursor to the modern concept of aircraft launched recoverable space vehicles.

0743579631|4.0|Ok, that was one loonngg book to listen to. I swear I spent a couple weeks on it. Maybe I just wasn't driving enough (I only listen in the car). Anyway, to the review- this audio book seemed like a perfect end to a trilogy but there's more books, what?? Everything happens with this book on a monumental scale. Clary travels to the City of Glass to save her moms life (but when her mom does awake, Clary spends all of five minutes with her before taking off, that was weird for me). Sebastian, what to say about a naughty boy- I don't think we've seen the last of him. Jace and Clary FINALLY getting things right, it's about darn time! In the end, Clary ticks off a queen fairy so I can see where the problems may come from in the next book. I'm no a Shadowhunter and I know not to refuse a favor exchange with a fairy queen. Good luck with that Clary! Hopefully Jace knows what he's getting into.

Also, being an avid equestrian, the horse's gait doesn't look as realistic as it could in the trot. I have to say, other than that, great graphics.

B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I had such high expectations for this film, as I am a HUGE Wizard of Oz fan, but this movie failed me =( The visuals ARE stunning, but the acting is lackluster, to say the least. The characters felt very hollow, one-dimensional, shallow. It felt, as I watched, that the actors expected their pay simply for SHOWING UP, not caring about their performance. In fact, the most entertaining personality in this movie would have to be the bellhop monkey. If you don't expect much out of this, give it a shot. I regret having spent $10 at the theater to see it.

1439148953|5.0|[In this review, I am trying to isolate a characteristic of the book that makes it unusually interesting.  I have to mention some plot elements, but I think I avoid real \\"spoilers.\\"]<br /><br /> So \\"quietly subversive\\" . . . not primarily subversive of \\"traditional morality\\" or \\"Catholic values\\" but subversive in the way that Alice Munro is subversive -- of the way \\"character\\" and agency are represented in most fiction.  Readers of Toibin's very accomplished first novel, \\"The South,\\" will recognize that what in that book might seem to have been represented, through its heroine, as \\"the creative impulse\\" is here broadened by being deployed through a protagonist, also a woman, who isn't extraordinary in the way that creative artists are said to be extraordinary.  You'll remember that in \\"The South\\" the novel opens with the protagonist just up and leaving her husband and child.  Although we have access to her consciousness, she doesn't explain or rationalize her decision, and she doesn't see herself as a \\"rebel.\\"  She doesn't say what she positively WANTS from life, but what she DOES is create art.  The sense that her motive for leaving was not fully articulated even to herself is very strong.  In \\"Brooklyn,\\" to the extent that the protagonist, Eilis Lacey, examines her inner life, her language tends to be fairly conventionally Catholic lower-middle class; but what Eilis DOES is not in line with that, and while it doesn't seem that her big decisions are premeditated and rationalized before the fact, there is no doubt in her mind that these are HER decisions, and she doesn't shrink from (indeed she embraces) their consequences even when she herself would say that she has done \\"wrong\\" or \\"sinned.\\"<br /><br />In the final section of the book, in which Eilis returns to Ireland to visit her family following the sudden and unexpected death of a relative, we see the world in which notions of \\"sin\\" and \\"wrong\\" seem determinative of the way in which a culture will seem to \\"script\\" a life -- and we see Eilis, for a while and for the sake of her bereft family, playing by that script to an extent that we feel some concern for her: after all, she knows that script, and there's something comfortable about its very familiarity.  In Brooklyn, where she had lived for over a year before her visit home and where she had been sent -- unlike the protagonist of \\"The South\\" she didn't choose to go but was persuaded to for lack of economic opportunity in post-WW2 Ireland -- ideas like \\"sin\\" and \\"wrong\\" aren't exactly meaningless (she goes to confession) but they don't WORK in that culture as they did at home.  The characters in the novel who would seem to most clearly embody the values of home -- Eilis's Irish landlady, Mrs Kehoe, and the priest, Father Flood, who has enabled her coming to Brooklyn -- seem to let her make her life.  It's not that they \\"approve\\" (and here Toibin's sense of the subtlety of a kind of tolerance that isn't trivial is very acute) but they don't exclude her from their circle or stop trying to be positively helpful to her.<br /><br />The crucial scene that illuminates all this is the scene of Eilis's first sexual experience and the consequences, which ripple out right up to the end of the novel.  Eilis is not seduced: in fact, she takes the action that makes the sexual encounter all but inevitable, and she registers her physical discomfort but not really any other discomfort.  And the next day, she feels she requires confession, but doesn't seem to feel profound guilt or regret.  Then when we see how her landlady and Father Flood subsequently behave towards her (and I'm not explaining here all that they KNOW about Eilis and her lover), we realize that judgments have been made and that the basis of these judgments lies in Brooklyn and not in Ireland (to put the matter rather cryptically, for the reader of this review who might not yet have read the book).  It's tempting to see \\"Brooklyn\\" (the place) as the space of a freedom that Eilis seeks (just as \\"the south\\" was in the earlier novel), but that freedom isn't sought consciously and is certainly not a product of ideology, either political or feminist.  And if one wants to call Eilis a \\"pragmatist,\\" she's an oddly unconscious one (or a merely instinctive one).  Her decisions are made in response to a series of specific situations and not to the promptings of some moral \\"center.\\"<br /><br />By the end of the novel, we realize that people are what they DO, and what they do is decided upon by them but not necessarily rationalized.  That is, they decide what they will do, but on the most crucial matters, they will not necessarily give themselves reasons before the fact, and usually not after the fact either.  When characters are presented in this way, we realize that the traditional notion of character has been undermined.  Usually, a character \\"stands for\\" certain values that she can articulate, and that character is judged and understood by herself or others on the basis of how consistently she applies these to her own conduct.  A much more fluid notion of agency has replaced that traditional notion of character.  It's not exactly a case of \\"minute by minute they live\\" (in Yeats's phrase), but they live from decision to decision, and what the sum of these decisions is tending towards isn't always clear to them or to us.  This, I think, constitutes Toibin's \\"realism.\\"  Provokingly, \\"Brooklyn\\" has the narrative shape of a sentimental novel in which the idea of home has to be if not rejected at least gone beyond.  But in its presentation of character and agency it is much more radical than that, and it's well worth your attention.<br /><br />NOTE:  This review has focused on elements of Toibin's novel that seem \\"Munrovian\\" to me.  But there's other interesting stuff.  His treatment of Eilis's work, her homesickness, and her feelings on returning to Ireland are handled with a touch that recalls that other great master of short fiction, William Trevor.t Eilis seeks (just as \\"the south\\" was in the earlier novel), but that freedom isn't sought consciously and is certainly not a product of ideology, either political or feminist.

It's a sweet unlikely romance that is well-written. A perfect sexy romantic escape. I enjoy the author's writing style. I purchased and read all of the other ebooks available from her and enjoyed them all. I can't wait for her next book!!!
1483934772|5.0|What a beautiful, well written and inspiring story this was. I was captivated from the start as I followed Oria in her adventure. It made me feel like I was sixteen again and no other book could ever do that. I was back to being a hormonal, excited teenager and relived all those emotions.<br />Oria's character is so authentic and this typical 18 year old girl becomes part of a world unknown to normal people. She takes on a daunting tasks of learning about her heritage, herself and her people as a great evil threatens their very existence. Through out the story the reader is not only learning the ways of the Ahwahneechee along with Oria but living the fantasy with her. Experience the wonderful spirit world with shape shifters, fairies and magic as Oria's abilities transform her into the true Golden Queen.<br />I tip my proverbial hat to the author and look forward to the next book.

B00C7JFIRC|3.0|To say the least, director Sam Raimi had a difficult challenge trying to provide an update of sort with this prequel to the beloved \\"Wizard of Oz\\" (1939).  In some ways he succeeds.  In some, he doesn't.  Certainly the nice transition from a squarish, black and white opening sequence to the CGI-laden color and wide-screen spectacular gets the audience enthused for more.<br /><br />James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs, known as Oz, a magician and con man aligned with a travelling circus.  During an escape from the husband/strongman of a girl Oz was attempting to romance, he jumps into a hot air balloon.  A violent tornado - the first of many connections to the original film - dumps Oz in to the fantasy Land of...you guessed it...Oz.  Oz is greeted by Theodora the witch (Mila Kunis) who believes him to be the expected great Wizard/King of Oz.  Using a few tricks from his bag, he goes along with the hoax when he finds out that the job comes with a warehouse full of gold.<br /><br />Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is secretly hoping to take over the royal role by default.  Along the way, Oz saves a ceramic doll (Joey King) and Finley the monkey (Zach Braff) and falls in love with Glinda the witch (Michelle Williams).  All three characters appear in the opening sequence under different guises, so pay attention.  While all the razzle-dazzle of the visual effects are indeed eye popping, the story falters at times and slows down too often.<br /><br />I had a hard time really caring much about any of the characters.  As Oz begins to be less selfish in his actions, Franco doesn't really pull it off with his words.  I suspect much of the problem is with a less than great script.  The best thing about the film are the witches, especially Weisz and Kunis's pairing.  In any case, the movie certainly has an audience, even with its 130 minute length.  It is colorful eye candy, but it lacks the music and the emotion of the 1939 classic.<br /><br />I watched this film on a Blu ray 2-D version.  It has of course, 1080p video resolution and 2.40:1 aspect ratio once the film makes the jump from the opening 1.33:1 window-boxed black and white opening sequence.  As noted earlier, the film color really pops and the filmmakers use every color in and over the rainbow (sorry).  In some of the darker scenes, the blacks are appropriately black.  The audio is top notch as well.  It even has a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 option.  The film is full of audio effects and the engineering is excellent in the home theater.

B008JFUMDS|4.0|I strongly agree with previous reviews and just wanted to add my rating of this movie. I do not usually go out to movies preferring to wait for DVD's from Amazon and watch in my home theater. This movie however with its illusions effects is worth seeing on the truly big screen. As has been said by others, this movie is intelligent, very well written, and will hold your attention throughout.

B004X1D3TC|5.0|Clear, if wordy study on estimating, planning, handling various risk factors (schedule, feature), across time horizons (release-sprint-daily).  Read it cover to cover then keep near your desk as a handy reference. Good foundation or starting point but of course you'll have to glean from it and then adapt for your needs and environment
B008JFUNYG|4.0|okay, we have seen the original 1981 movie with bruce campbell directed by sam raimi. that was more than 30 years ago.  with the new \\"evil dead\\" by fede alvarez, i also had reservations on how it would turn out, but at the same time thee was also anticipation and excitement - after all this is evil dead, and bruce campbell and sam raimi produced it.<br /><br />the premise is the same (since it's a remake). i agree that the acting was better but there were also loopholes in the presentation of the new characters.  as a gorehound, i was expecting it would be as evil as the original. in 1981, sam raimi et al  impaled a head, gorged eyes, raped with trees, splattered brains, chewed on a hand, and most of all, chopped a woman with an ax in loving details... now to expect that in the new evil dead would make me ... lucky! especially with today's rating.<br /><br />the new evil dead still made me cringe, but i thought maybe i expected too much. i have all the original trilogy, but i would sure add the new evil dead in my collection.  despite being a remake, it has its own merits. it is also a good movie that could stand on its own!

B000JMKQX0|2.0|man, what a boring, go nowhere book. no character development, just nobody i cared about in the book.  the &#34;reporting&#34; of events is interesting for a while but then it's just all the same. hope the movie is better
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Its so good! Always makes me cry and i have seen it about 100 times. If you have not seen the movies already then get out of the rock you are under and watch them!! In order of course.

B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The first third of the this film promises more than it ultimately delivers, but it is definitely more than three stars.  Amazon really needs to give us the half star category.  This had the potential to be a wonderful film and is worth seeing for some of the performances.  Perhaps the timing is off given that Twilight has just finished its installments.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|the game was easy but there weren't enough levels.  there should be lots more for the #1 game. I did enjoy it, just wished there were more levels to start with.
B008YAPRPG|5.0|Anybody who bought the first blu-ray release will know what a ghastly travesty it was, a strong contender for the worst remaster of any great film. The grotesque, washed out pastel transfer was dreadful, made all the more painful by director William Friedkin's intro about it being the best the film's ever looked! Plus the disc is full of fascinating extras and commentaries, giving the lowdown on how this classic was made and the typical Hollywood trials and tribulations during the making of.<br /><br />This what the blu-ray of 'The French Connection' should have looked like all along. Thank God they got DOP Owen Roizman to supervise this new update, which captures the gritty, documentary style and colors of the original release.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I didn't regret the time spent watching it, but it was not something that I would watch again, or recommend to a friend.

B00DF0POXA|5.0|Listen to this songs and then try to think who is the best raper in the world. (Let me help you : its Kanye West)
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A very humorous and insightful book that deals with the challenges,fears and doubts of the male species when searching for a life partner and in the process also explains Asperger Syndrome, sometimes defined as the extreme of the male brain, by describing clearly the thoughts of the person with Asperger Syndrome which underpin the extreme and sometimes frustrating behaviours he presents.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Yes I've read this book looking for something to believe about life after death. It was very interesting having Dr. Eben talking about his experience. I don't think he would be the kind of person that would lie just to sell books - and being a neurosurgeon, explaining about how his brain wouldn't be capable of &#34;dreaming&#34; or creating those experiences, makes me believe he actually went on a trip to Heaven. Well at least I hope its true! :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|It was cool but I wish managing added more stuff from minecraft today. There is so little stuff from computer minecraft that it is not as fun. But still a good start.
B00BEJ5O6Q|2.0|It says a lot about this cd that when asked to review &#34;Based on a True Story&#34; I had to wonder what is that?  A book I'd bought?  No, it's this crappy cd!  The only catchy songs are the ones played on the radio.  The rest of the cd is really not good.  I'm sick of hearing this fool sing about drinking and getting high.  What a  waste of talent.  Can't believe this is the same guy who sang &#34;The Baby&#34; and &#34;Old Red.&#34;  Wish he'd go back to singing good story songs instead of just trendy crap.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|[[ASIN:B00BRBIA6C Agnetha Fältskog - A]]<br /><br />Having Agnetha record a new album has been Heaven, with a voice as beautiful as ever, and a unique, mesmerizing interpretation that takes one's breath away.<br /><br />Rarely do I find an album worth listening to for more than a few times. Not so with Agnetha's 'A' - the more I listen to it, the more I love it!<br /><br />There are no fillers here, and Agnetha's expressive voice makes each song stand on its own. Favorites, Agnetha's own composition, \\"I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed\\", followed by \\"Bubble\\", \\"Perfume In The Breeze\\", \\"When You Really Loved Someone\\", \\"Past Forever\\", \\"I Was A Flower\\", \\"Back On The Radio\\", \\"The One Who Loves You Now\\", and \\"I Should've Followed You Home\\". In other words, 9 out of 10.<br /><br />I highly recommend this superb album at a time when exquisite vocals and true pop music are almost impossible to find.<br /><br />Now that Agnetha has returned, I hope, she will record again and again...<br /><br />American radio stations - listen to the album and give this music legend the airtime and recognition she deserves. It's about time!
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I love biographies, and Schwarzenegger's life was really amazing. He has some great insights of how to succeed in life.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|It is very well done and I am a Dr. Seuss fan so it wasn't hard for me to enjoy this movie.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I loved the song \\"Downtown\\" so decided to purchase my first Lady A cd.  I wasn't sure if I'd really enjoy it since I'm not usually a big fan of the new pop/country sound.  But I was very pleasantly surprised by this cd.  I like the lyrics of songs as much as the sound (if that makes sense :)  Every song, but one, on this cd is so nice to listen to.  Sounds great and tells a good story.  Love driving around listening to this cd.  Golden is probably my favorite.  Such a pretty song.
B0042JSSVI|5.0|Having been to Pompeii the hole experience became more real when I read this book.I thought the working of the political system of the time along with an explanation of how the eruption played out was very well done.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The kind of book that makes people around you think you are crazy, so much you are laughing. Can't wait for a second one.
0446547646|5.0|Love the Arthur and this Book is just another great story of his. Was tied to the book til the last sentence!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|First time I ever bought the instant videos and I was a little worried but it was awesome! No waiting, just buy and play! For those who have never seen walking dead it is a great show... Good enough that I bought the full season, not just an episode.
0307949486|5.0|Very interesting book to me.<br />At first, I thought it was kinda slow starting but as I got into it I can't put the book down.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Even though it lacks a main title theme akin to the classic Main Title March by John Williams in 1978... the overall impact of this film's score by Hans Zimmer is not to be underestimated. When trailer 3 premiered on TV, the buzz for this soundtrack escalated. The entire score does not disappoint, the second disk does not either.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer captured the spirit of the film, but he also captured something different than John Williams did... Hans Zimmer captured the wonder, and the awe of a superhero just beginning. Williams' theme was a majestic affirmation of what we already knew about the character from his storied comic/TV history.<br /><br />If you are looking for a theme, you'll note that the tracks Flight and What Are You Going to do When You Are Not Saving the World, feature the heavily drummed, heavy brass that we were first exposed to on the main movie trailer.<br /><br />Overall, the score is token Zimmer, but then some. He continues to show his fearless approach to melding orchestras with electric sounds. In this particular outing, he utilized several fully equipped drum sets with several drummers rather than using a drum corps, or standard orchestra percussion. Will this go down as one of the greatest movie scores of all time, probably not due to its lack of overall theme and focus that would be contained in a title theme, but this collection does not disappoint.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Why nice app because you can do plenty of editing but crap because you can't save or do anything with edited photo so what is the point of using this? Worst error ever for this company.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book is not very exiting at all. Unlike the other two books, this one doesn't have much drama or action; and what happened to the  hunger games? Do not read this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just downloaded the app after having a kindle 2 for many years. I still prefer my kindle, but this will do when my kindle is not with me.
B00821OX98|4.0|Characters are believable, easy to immerse yourself into their lives during a constant struggle to survive while facing the eternal question of who am I as a Warrior or Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Husband, Wife. Will I make the correct decisions to<br />save those who I love, or am I a coward and have ulterior motives to save my own skin.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I'm so happy to have picked up this book in my twenties and not ten years from now. Sheryl is a true inspiration and full of valuable insight. I'll be sure to consider her advice often as I continue to advance my career. Every young man and woman should read this book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Okay. Truth be told, it's a fancy soap opera. But leave it to the British to invest, not in sets or stunt casting (although this season has both) but in character development, a compelling plot, and historical accuracy. Enjoyable doesn't begin to cover it. Try addictive. Be warned: you'll be invested in these three-dimensional characters to the point of crying when they die-and nobody is safe! Just like real life. And don't be quick to make up your mind as to who is a villain and who is a hero. These characters are far too nuanced for that. Just drink the Downton Kool-Aid and wait patiently for the next season after you power-disc the first three.
B00A32H1B6|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCTION  THAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR. I HAVE WATCHED IT MANY TIMES. I EVEN HAVE THE CD VERSION.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not a game player but as someone who loves challenges....the Room is<br />FANTASTIC!<br />The graphics are superior and the best I've ever seen. I would like to see more like this.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|This cd rocks!! Every song has something unique about it, but the common-denominator is classic rock & roll in a 2013 presentation. I guess we shouldn't be surprised considering the talented and seasoned, veteran musicians, and the treatment from producer Kevin Shirley make this a winning disc anyway you slice it. Even though there are songs that sound exactly like Thin Lizzy (\\"Bound for Glory\\", \\"Someday Salvation\\") there are plenty of songs that harken signature Damon Johnson riffs and grooves, evident on the opening snake-like riff of \\"All Hell breaks Loose\\". The guitar solos are incredible between Johnson and Gorham, and the cd lyrics spells out who plays which solo, where. Another treat is the twin-guitar harmonic melodies for most songs,very Thin Lizzy-esque. On \\"Bloodshot\\", \\"Kissin' the Ground\\", and \\"Blues ain't so bad\\", had Damon Johnson sung them, they could fit right on any Brother Cane disc. So all in all, if you like Thin Lizzy, or like the genius of Damon Jonson / Brother Cane, click the \\"Add to Cart\\" button without hesitation, now! (In my opinion, these guys are the best band to arrive since Black Country Communion, another Kevin Shirley brainchild). This is an awesome cd to crank while driving- but be careful not to floor the accellerator...Black Star Riders already did that on the recording!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting read-different from other near death experience books I have read in the past. Is it more believable? Or less?
B004QO9WVO|5.0|Yes, I loved these stories.  However the enjoyment was over all too soon.  I could have gone on and on.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie grips you from the beginning and holds you tight until the very end. The suspense is terribly awesome, and you can't help but feel like your right there next to Catnis. A completely immersive experience. Buy it now.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Even if you've never heard of Sigur Ros, this album positively rocks!<br /><br />Give it a listen. I'm sure you'll enjoy. It's even better if your speak Icelandic. ;)
B00571F26Y|2.0|Pretty much the same as the Atkins diet, only maybe stricter.  Doesn't let you know that until your 2/3 of the way through the book
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my wife. She loves this show. They talk really fancy so I kind of feel smart watching it.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I was so disappointed in the final book. Charline Harris changed story lines around anc she did the ultimate no no by making Eric come across as a push over!! It seemed that charline Harris just couldn't be bothered, slapped something together and thought yep that will do now I'm out of here. Some reviews have also suggested that it seems that charline Harris didn't even write it and she got someone else to do the job for her. Well it saddens me to admit it but that's exactly what it looks like to me as well.<br />Of course dedicated fans of the series have to but the book and read it because you can't start the journey without finishing it, but I for one won't be reading it again. I wouldn't go as far as to say the final book ruined the series for me... But it came very very close to doing so. Shame on you charline!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|As expected and not disappointed the writing is smooth, emotionally detailed and woven beautifully between stories. I will read this book again because it has a lot of characters to remember and I think I'll appreciate the story being woven more clearly second time around. It was worth the wait for such a wonderfully portrayed lifetime in Afghanistan. I weeped near the end for Pari, and Abdullah's lifetime of hoping and loving.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|....which is ironic since I have yet to read the book.  I know I'm going to like it since I'm in love with Gideon, but Eva not so much.  I read Fifty Shades and was left disappointed with the unrealistic ending.  I said to myself that series could have been so much more and should have been rewritten.  Low and behold I came across Bared to You and thought my prayers had been answered.  A better Fifty Shades!  After reading Bared and preordered Reflected in You I began to read Sylvia Day's other works.  I wasn't disappointed.  I was overjoyed when Reflected was delivered to my Kindle 3 days early.  I read it in one day and was very pleased.  I didn't think the series could get any better.  I immediately preordered Entwined with you and waited and waited and waited.  I finished reading Day's other works and two series by other authors:  Tiffany Reisz (The original Sinners...buckle up and hold on to the ride if you read this one!) and Kristan Higgins (Each book will make you mad, laugh, and cry!).  When Entwined's publication date was further pushed back I cancelled my preorder.  I'm glad I did!<br /><br />As for the Crossfire serious...I purchase Kindle books 1 & 2 because it WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TRILOGY that I was going to read over and over.  I brought the paperbacks of Fifty and quickly sold them.  It wasn't worth re-reading.  Like others I'm not going to continue to pay $10 for each of these books.  The before mentioned authors have series and are priced accordingly so.<br /><br />Some reviewers are on the defense they say the author revealed Entwined wouldn't be the final installment.  Yes, but only after books 1 and 2 were published.  If I knew this were a series and not a trilogy I would have purchased the paperbacks and resold them to recoup some cost.  I will not purchase the Kindle edition of these anymore.  Instead I will borrow from the library or buy paperback and then resale.<br /><br />I'm not, however, disappointed that Gideon's story doesn't end.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is great it's safe,fun and you get to see all the things they have for you and for family and.friends
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It is a very stimulating game to get into.Sometimes you look for something and it is in front of your nose.It can be challenging.but I like the game.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Man I love this movie. I have seen it at least three times on cable. I should just go ahead and buy the darned thing! Love everything about it except that it can be hard for me to understand what everybody is saying. I can't put subtitles on my TV because it is HDTV and Comcast doesn't allow that option. Buying the DVD would solve that problem. The main character (Shartlo) is excellent. From what I have read on IMDB he wasn't even an actor and even adlibs things when he is doing his newscast. The scenery is really dramatic and depressing at times. The language of the \\"prawns\\" is really cool especially since one person does all the voices. I really don't want to comment too much on the plot because I don't want to spoil any surprises. I hope they make a sequel. I think it is an underrated movie. Very complex cultural clash. I also like the undertones of socially injustice with the aliens. Government cover-up is also rampant. This movie is more than just an alien scare. The CGI is great and works well with the characters. It isn't your typical jump out and scare you type of aliens but there are a few scenes that will make you flinch. There is some bad language (but it fits with the situation). I would recommend turning on subtitles if you have the DVD. The aliens speech comes across as subtitles but the British accents can cause a problem when spoken with lots of noise around the characters. Starts out a little slow but just be patient....
B001NHNG64|4.0|I continue on my quest to read all the Reacher novels in publication order.  Just finished this one, obviously have quite a few left to go.<br /><br />I liked this one, just not as much as I liked #1.  Plot was solid and I am comfortable with Child's writing style.  IMO, this one dragged on a bit in the beginning.<br /><br />It's a solid 4 star book and I do recommend it.<br /><br />On to Reacher #3.....
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Some of the ideas are rather difficult until you get some coins. The extra tools you get with the coins help to make the drawings easier, but it is still a fun game. It will test your imagination and ability to convey an idea with out words, alway great for a smile.

B003G4W49C|4.0|For some reason the cover of the book made me want o read it, then I found out it was going to be made a movie, so I was sold. I enjoyed reading this story and the concepts presented for Ender's training and seeing that what was written back in the seventies is being used for actual training purposes today. It is amazing how a simple idea's of one persons imagination can be picked up and drive another person or group to make it real. It only helps to make some parts of the story seam like a real possibility. It also makes you wonder what the human race is truly capable of, good and evil, and to what extent they are willing to go to reach their desired results.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great series.  My daughter and I have been watching together & we love it.  Better than watching on TV because there are no breaks.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun but did not stretch the imagination too much so perfect for an evening game.  Hope more rooms follow soon.
B008Y79HE6|1.0|Talk about a decent story gone wrong.  Matthew Broderick was great in Ferris Beuler's Day Off...  that was not the performance I saw in this film.  I mean...  I saw Ferris, but there was no reason for that personae to make it into this film.  A couple hours of my life I will probably never get back.  The special effects were awful (even taking into account the technology of the time) and the acting was &#34;off&#34;.  The plot line had potential, but the undercurrent love story?  Atrocious.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Eerie occult star music which can be turned off. Satellites, Southern Sky constellations, & planet locations. Takes some practice to get the hang of moving through the stars, but fun nevertheless.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it I want to do it again because I loved it!  I played it with my grandma and we had fun looking for the clues. I just want to do it again!
B005HSL626|4.0|I was happy to get fruit ninja. It's about the only game I play besides minecraft. It started out entertaining, and I enjoyed it. Last night, I was playing fruit ninja, and it wouldn't open. I was very disappointed that my fruit ninja wouldn't open, so I went to the app store to see if opening it from there would solve the problem. At the app store, there was an update, and it helped me open the game. I've had the update for only a day, and I can open fruit ninja, but as soon as I select a mode, the game will freeze up, and I can't slice any fruit. Overall, this is a great game, but this problem needs to be fixed. In the meantime, I will see what I can do to fix it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Enjoyable for adults and kids alike.  NO BLOOD  'N'  GUTS.  Creativity comes alive.<br />No need to worry that your kids are getting into things that are harmful to their minds and spirits.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|A boy scout, an old man, and a flying house. Pixar used these, and several other subtle ingredients, to craft another masterful film. It was an emotional roller coaster in the movie theater, and the Blu-ray faithfully recreates that. More than that, the movie stays with you as a grand adventure! It's a bit scary at times, and the opening sequence is definitely heady material for younger children, but even then it's still a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I have all the books in this series and I couldn't put them down once I picked them up I wish there could have been more
B00CATSONE|3.0|Sort of a rehash of Gladwell and then a meandering Tesla biography.  Easy enough to read and the inspirational message was not lost.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie shows you that we are all the same!! We have the same needs! We want to love someone and be loved by someone. We have sexual needs the same the people society calls disabled. They are not disabled at all to me but beautiful. My grandma had a board and care home when I was little and I used to play and talk with all people that lived there no matter what they looked like. Great movie!!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Universal gave this Blu-ray release the gold-standard treatment. The video presentation is stunning, with an orchestral score to match. The supplements are so bountiful it will take either a long afternoon or multiple days to go through them! For a company whose track record is shaky at best on their catalog titles, the final result of JAWS is one seen to be believed.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|In these days & times in our society, it is a real joy to watch this series set in this time period...
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|Nice game. Still working on how to fight. Game is smooth, easy to follow.  Need Internet connection in order to play. Good graphics.<br /><br />Update: I have been having difficulties to just loading the game....It would not open therefore I have uninstalled it. Good concepts, it was nice to play in the beginning, but had too many problems just to load the game. I reduced the rating to 2 stars. Feel like I wasted my time to play this game.
1476734941|5.0|the FastDiet by Dr. Michael Mosley, format works for me in my best life, and I've just begun but so far... GREAT.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|AMERICAN HORROR STORY is one of those series that is best enjoyed by getting the box set and viewing multiple episodes at once.  It's the perfect way to keep track of the series's many, many, twists and turns, along with some jaw dripping revelations over the course of the first season.  And let the viewer be warned yet again: there is graphic sexual content and violence, the kind that pushes the limit about as far as it can go for cable television.<br /><br />But for those who like this kind of stuff, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is must see TV.  The basic premise is one of those horror story tropes: family goes through emotional trauma (psychology professor husband is caught cheating with a student)and moves across the country to LA and a fresh start, which includes buying an old house with a past in a quiet neighborhood. This Murder House, as it is called, has more than a few things in common with the Overlook Hotel from THE SHINNING, in that it is a place where a lot of bad things have happened to a lot of people, mostly former owners and some unlucky visitors.  Basically, what dies in the Murder House, stays in the Murder House and within these walls, the ghosts are all too real. These ghosts want things of those who are still alive and will do whatever it takes to get them. Not all of this is explained up front in the first episodes and part of the fun is figuring out who is dead and who is still among the living (at least for the moment).<br /><br />One of the many things viewers might find off putting initially is that the story's principle characters, played by Dylan McDermott, Connie Britton, and Tessa Farmiga, are so down right unlikable and unsympathetic right from the get go.  McDermott's psychiatrist is an adulterer who is remorseful only because he got caught red handed, while Britton's wife is cold, bitter, and unforgiving-the complete opposite of the wife and mother she played on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  Teenage daughter Farmiga is sullen, full of resentmentand hopelessly self absorbed.  Not the kind of people with whom you'd want to spend time, but without giving away any spoilers, it is safe to say that where these characters start out is not where they end up.  In the end, everyone is where they need to be, for good or bad.<br /><br />Over the course of the season one, the plot comes to include such elements as the birth of the Anti-Christ, a Columbine like massacre, miss treatment of the mentally challenged, illegal abortions, kinky sex, rape, multiple murders, and a character in a Gimp suite. All that and the enduring legacy of family dysfunction, seeping into the woodwork generation after generation like so much toxic waste. A lot of viewers will be turned off or rubbed the wrong way, and not with out good reason.  But for those who are game, it'll be well worth the watch.<br /><br />Maybe AMERICAN HORROR STORY's chief virtue is the excellent cast and superior acting which goes a long way toward helping sell the often outrageous actions of the characters.  And the most outrageous of them all is Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance Langdon, a faded southern belle who once lived in the Murder House herself and has left more than memories behind her there. Constance is the kind of part Bette Davis would have played back in her Baby Jane days, a human monster who makes even the dead cringe.  Lange is given great support by Frances Conroy as Moira, the maid who has been on the job a very long time; Evan Peters as a most troubled teen, a patient of McDermott's and secret boyfriend to Farmiga; and Denis O'Hare, as Constance's horribly disfigured ex lover who keeps hanging around for a reason.<br /><br />There are also appearances by such familiar faces as Charles S. Dutton, Zachary Quinto, Lilly Rabe, Matt Ross, Kate Mara, Mena Suvari, Eric Stonestreet, Morris Chestnut, Christine Estabrook, David Anthony Higgins, and Brando Eaton.<br /><br />Give credit to writers and creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, in AMERICAN HORROR STORY they have come up with something about as far from the saccharine sweetness of GLEE as it was possible to get. God help them if these two worlds would ever collide.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I spent hours and money playing this beautiful app. I saw on a few other reviews how it starts to crash and refuses to load when you advance to higher levels on the Kindlefire. It's true as it just started happening to me after I received a brief &quot;adding more content&quot; message. It is with great regret that I must say farewell to my reef and uninstall this app. I will not be purchasing another Disney app.

It is a cute movie and live and relationships and what's really important.  The birds of course, not really.  My whole family enjoyed this, including the non-birders

B0066W1AZK|2.0|I like a lot about the game.  It has a nice interface, and serves as a good test bed for trying out some outlandish moves.  However, it will frequently freeze, sometimes for many minutes, and during that time there is no way to recover.  I am going to have to remove it.

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|The plot description of a young man's accounting of his life as the son of bank robbers is a simplification of a narrative of 15 year old Dell Parson, whose life is upended when his parents are put in prision for robbing a bank. The book is a compelling revelation of how much a child's life is at the mercy of their family and their survival instincts in the face of events which are beyond one's control.

0553584537|4.0|ALONE by Lisa Gardner is the first book in the D.D. Warren series.  Warren is a detective in the Boston PD.  Gardner does a great job with this book.  It keeps you guessing till the end and it's a great intro to Detective Warren. Warren investigates a shooting by State Trooper Bobby Dodge and all that is or is not wrong with this shooting.  Interesting and fast moving.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I gave up, figuring I'd try again later, but couldn't get pass the &quot;Update available&quot; message.  Had to uninstall.  Given where I was at and how aggravating the &quot;update&quot; experience was--I don't see me reinstalling.

1451638450|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold is the 2d most honored Sci-Fi/Fantasy author after the late Robert Heinlein and she is a better writer than him.  And she is my favorite living writer.  This book is a supplement to her Vorkosigan Saga series starring one of the most popular characters in Sci-Fi, Miles Vorkosigan (introduced in Warrior's Apprentice [[ASIN:B005DNGSUU The Warrior's Apprentice (Vorkosigan Saga)]]).<br /><br />Ivan Xav Vorpatril is a cousin of Miles who has appeared in several earlier stories.  In this book, he is an admiral's aide on Komarr, one of the few planets in the Barrayarian Empire.  An undercover agent asks Ivan, a famous womanizer, to pick up Tej, a refugee in order to protect her from an eminent assassination or kidnapping.  Tej is a daughter in a powerful House that was recently decimated and scattered in a violent takeover and the new rulers want to kill or capture any surviving family members.<br /><br />Ivan manages to help the refugee and her friend survive the anticipated attack.  But as a result, he and she soon get in trouble with the police, immigration, and Imperial Security.  Uncharacteristically, Ivan quickly thinks of an ingenious plan to postpone their trouble with the authorities.  And that leads him and her back to the home world of Barrayar and trouble with his family and Imperial Security.<br /><br />A totally unexpected development leads to divided loyalties, galactic politics, smuggling, and catastrophic danger.<br /><br />The writing, as always, has humor, sadness, tension, and gladness.  The conclusion has a satisfying resolution of a very complicated situation, in spite of a few latent plausibility flaws.  A new reader should be warned that anyone reading this book risks an addiction to the Vorkosigan Saga.  Readers familiar with the series will enjoy the book, but may pick up hints that this might be one of the final books of the series.

B00AFEXRME|1.0|This movie SUCKED.  The trailer did not indicate AT ALL that it would be so inappropriate!  The opening scene has full frontal nudity and they hold the frame for a long time... then keep going back to the woman.... Washington is on the phone which is \\"supposed\\" to be what you're focused on but all he's saying is \\"no... no...\\" etc.  The rest of the movie is all about drugs and alcohol... yes they show it ruins your life but they go into such great detail which is unnecessary, offensive, and inappropriate... The movie actually has very little to do with the story line as seen in the trailer.  In the last 5 minutes the main character finally admits he is an alcoholic but the first 2 hours are all about using drugs and alcohol... in great detail.  And oh yeah, there's a trial going on in the background.  Scenes with the news reporters last a total of about 5 minutes... Scenes with the trial are limited to the ending of the movie... A waste of time and money.  Don't see it, don't let your family see it... Unless you want ideas for how to cure a hangover with cocaine.  Should have gone to kids-in-mind dot com to get an actual review of the movie before seeing it.  The trailer was so misleading I never thought to do this.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It was overall a good movie. The witchs' makeup was very halloween haunted house and the gore was a bit over the top with the intention of disgusting the viewer. It had some funny moments and the storyline was decent. I'd rather give it 3 1/2 stars.

B004ZGI2KK|4.0|It's good. Kind of cheesy sometimes and the acting is sometimes fail but overall it was good. I'd recommend it.
0062255657|1.0|I wanted to love this book sight unseen because I love \\"The Graveyard Book\\" and the complete \\"Sandman\\" series.  But I found this book to be bizarre & lackluster because he begins the story with a true event that happened in his Scientology childhood.  At the age of seven, Gaiman was speaking of Scientology on BBC radio.  A \\"boarder\\" steals his fathers car and commits suicide.  This isn't fiction, it's a memory from his past.<br /><br />I found it hard to extricate the true events from my brain while reading this 'fictionalized' event... Still, I trudged onward, wanting the story to transmogrify into one of Gaiman's great tales.  But sadly, for me, it did not.  Many sections reminded me of passages I'd read in books by the great and unequaled writer, Graham Joyce. I thought of [[ASIN:0671039407 Smoking Poppy : A Novel]], [[ASIN:0312872542 Dark Sister]], [[ASIN:0743463455 The Limits of Enchantment: A Novel]], and even [[ASIN:0671039385 Indigo]].  If you're disappointed with Gaiman, then definitely check out Graham Joyce.  He's a unique writer who defies genre and never disappoints.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Wonderful movie that I would watch again and that doesn't happen very often.  Superb acting and storyline.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Te novel is short but it is sweet and pulls you through the narrative in the shortest period of time.<br /><br />You never learn the name of the narrator nor whose funeral it is that he was attending that he needed to take a break from but that is hardly what matters.  The Ocean and the Hempstocks and what happened to him when he was a 7 year old are what matters.<br /><br />Gaiman is brilliantly able to separate what a 7 year old and an adult would consider important and will the 7year old is in control he is able to tell it from the child's POV without letting adult morals or what we would consider to be important interfere with the 7 year old's perceptions of events.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I love these movies. They are so well done and just wonderful. If you like the other movies then you'll like this. Also, you should go see the sixth one. It's great! :)
B001ECQ4HG|2.0|You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction rollercoaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems.<br /><br />Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good.<br /><br />The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness.<br /><br />The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this to any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks pretty bad in 2.40:1 1080p that is not much better than the old 2002 DVD with a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack that sounds very old and poorly mixed. At first glance the list of extras looks extensive, but it's not. Quite a lot like the movie itself - pure junk food.ut pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer).

1400097029|5.0|The Sea was the first novel of John Banville's that I read. ( I had already read the Benjamim Black mysteries which were excellent.) His way with words is magnificent and got me hooked. I am now eagerly reading a number of his other novels. Would recommend his books to anyone who loves the written word.
B000002C25|4.0|A big heavy powerful destructive force that crushes everything in its path. Built to be the biggest and the loudest and to take no prisoners. That's \\"Be Here Now\\".<br /><br />The release date was even placed on the cover to further emphasize NOW. It was the fastest selling album in British history and reached number 1 in 13 countries, and number 2 in another 5. It would produce their second biggest selling single; `You Know' and the album would go on to sell over 8 million.<br /><br />This is a big bloated monster of an album, 71 minutes of hard punches thrown at your head. Oasis had conquered Britain, now they wanted to beat it into submission. According to the producer, Noel wanted the album as \\"dense and colossal\\" as possible. He layered multiple guitar tracks on several of the songs, sometimes dubbing ten channels with identical guitar parts to create a \\"sonic volume\\". The songs are like long walls of sound that enclose you. No space. No light. No silence. Better grab hold of your senses because you are in for it big time.<br /><br />If you don't like long songs you should stick to top 40 radio. Typical classic rock albums are around 40 minutes in length. If you can handle long songs but can't take over an hour of flat out hard driving music, my advice would be to eliminate `My Big Mouth', `I Hope, I Think, I Know', `The Girl In The Dirty Shirt' and `Getting Better Man'. These songs are decent but I think they should have left them off and replaced them with `My Sisters Lover' and `Stay Young'. `Stay', the `Know' B side is almost giddy it is so happy. It is 5 minutes of head bopping teenage joy. `Sister', the 6 minute B side of `Stand', is the solid sound of drums, acoustic guitar and snarling electrics fronted by a good set of vocals. Just good old rambunctious Oasis rock in roll, and as overdone and bombastic as all the other tracks here. If you go for this shorter version of the album you will still get your monies worth.<br /><br />The album starts with a plane taking off. Then we get Morse code and guitar scratches and who knows what else. Some parts are even being played backwards. It takes about 2 minutes for the drums to show up. `D'You know What I Mean' is one hell of a song. Loud is the word that comes to mind, as Oasis seems to be speaking to their fans in mass. Like the rest of the album there is a lot going down here. There are guitar solos galore on this record, as well as support vocals showing up out of nowhere. It is amazing that a song like this could be put out as a single in the UK. In the US it would have soccer moms running for their babysitters. This is a sonic attack on your speakers right from the get go. After 7 minutes you get the feeling you might be in for something big.  It ends with a spinning sound that may be a guitar, or it may be our mind. Take your pick.<br /><br />The 7 minute `Magic Pie' also starts with Morse code, and rain, and lightly strummed guitar with a soft hollow lead behind it. Noel sings a sweet song; his simple unassuming vocals might be about his girls honey pie, assuming she does not shave. But suddenly an electric guitar is dragged groaning into the picture, giving it an avalanche of sound. This is a heavy song, but its breaking guitar runs give it a breezy feel. A whizzing sound gives way to the actual lead solo, which is orchestrated with a full on \\"Ahhh\\" backing chorus. It ends in a flurry of guitar noise, someone yelling \\"Shut up!\\"  and a short tune comprised of guitars and piano. At the very end a voice can be heard saying something akin to, \\"Oh dear\\", probably what your mum would be saying by that point.<br /><br />`Stand By Me' is not a copy, at nearly 6 minutes it is another Oasis extravaganza, full of more orchestration, drums and guitar solos. The engineers did a good job getting Liam's voice to stand out against this flood of sound that continually washes over us.<br /><br />`Fade In-Out' is nearly 7 minutes long too, but the slow lead in is the first time youhave to take a breath. It has percussion, tambourine, coughing, and a count in before the acoustic guitars began their strumming. Liam sings \\"You've got to be bad enough to beat the brave\\", and I think that sums up the way they looked at the making of this album. Your \\"Gunna be blinded by the light that fall off me\\". In the middle someone screams and we are off again, with a snaky guitar solo leading the way. The fairs in town today and we are on the rollercoaster ride. Fading out is one thing these guys were never going to do.<br /><br />`Don't Go Away' is the only commercial song here. And it is a dear one at that, supposedly about both Noel and Bonehead's mothers, it is sung by Liam with real feeling. Your mum would like this one. Noel wrote the middle part on the day of the recording, after a heated argument with Liam. \\"Me and you, what's going on? All we seem to know is how to show, the feelings that are wrong.\\" The cracks in the band were already big by that point, but the brothers hung it out and it would be the two Paul's who would not survive the coming break.<br /><br />The 5 minute title song starts off like a circus organ in another dimension. This one sounds like a pub song, one in which everyone sings along with the chorus. It is bouncy loud and has shout out points like \\"Get a grip\\", \\"Come on, come on\\" and \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah\\", all good for a rousing time. It is an easy song to party too, and it ends well, with a massive guitar effect sliding right into `All Around The World'. This is the epic sing along song. Mid tempo at first, then 3 minutes into it they begin to rip into a break. When they come out of this and return to the verse the lead guitar sticks with it. So we now have drums banging, full orchestration and a guitar wailing behind the singing. At 5 minutes this breaks into a round of \\"La las\\". Then we get irregular vocals and the whole thing pounds along until the horns come in at the 7 minute mark, and my God if all of England isn't singing along with it! This is the type of fanfare only the Beatles could pull off. This is Oasis' satellite program to the world.  At nine minutes it begins to fade away, but then a guitar flips out and strings are getting louder. A trumpet blast and then its drums and the whole thing is back, sans vocals. Turn this `Reprise' up loud and just listen to Alan White pound the drums! He finishes it off with a roll, then there's piano notes and guitar feedback and like it or not, you have to admit you have just been thru one hell of a musical experience!<br /><br />\\"Coming out of nowhere, singing rhapsody, you've got to be bad enough to want to be\\".<br /><br />Talk about the meaning of \\"Be Here Now\\", Noel wrote most of the lyrics in 2 weeks, while at Mick Jagger's villa in Mustique, on holiday with Johnny Depp. A far cry from his mom's house where he wrote most of the music 4 years before.<br /><br />And just like that, \\"Be Here Now\\" is \\"Bad enough to beat the brave\\".have to take a breath.

Not because of any musical similarities, but because they both pushed the edge of the public listening comfort zone at the time. Tip of the hat to Rick Rubin as well... his production finds that difficult balance between the familiar and the challenging.

All he does it put out good to great CD's, this time hard to say this is either for the first time in his career.<br /><br />I've listened to it over and over the last two days and have determined there is one 10/10 song on the album, \\"Blood on the leaves.\\" Billie Holiday originally sang the song about lynching in 1939 yikes !  I gotta admit I just like the song, not really following what it's message is or the song is about until I looked it up.  Nina Simone is the voice on the track.<br /><br />The rest is like what many have said, loud industrial elctro-techno beats.  The CD is obnoxiously pornographic at times, it really turns me off, because it just wasn't necessary.  I'm not one that usually cares, but it's obnoxious on at least three tracks.  He is always pushing the envelope.  He is definitely an artist, regardless of what you think of him.  I'd put this as his worst CD.  Dark Twisted Fantasy & Watch the Throne I just loved.<br /><br />I think he's a short guy (diminutive complex), and not the best looking guy, and his mother passed, he's just angry, and everyone passed on him in the beginning, he's in the limelight cuz of Kim K and because of his punk act so he feeds the act, and it sells clearly so he continues to feed it.  I'm guilty of feeding it this time and I knew better cuz I read he had to hire Rick Rubin at the last minute to put it all together.  He didn't lay down the vocals until that point.  I think that all kind of fed to the CD no being as good as it could be.<br /><br />2/5
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved learning about Tesla, wish I had learned about him earlier in life!.. his focus, selflessness, struggles, strength! Very inspiring and motivating! Have sent recommendations for my coworkers and friends. Thank You
B00BHMF578|5.0|Really good movie.  You're captivated from beginning to end.  This happened when I was a kid and I can remember the yellow ribbons were everywhere.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|What did I like about this book?  Everything.  It is very funny, a bit of a gallop, heaps of history, fantasy, unexpected surprises, it doesn't plod at all, and I loved every word.  I just can't wait to reach 100 years old, but I fear my past is not as exciting as this old codger's was.  Telling the history and the present is in the right balance, and I think it's a masterpiece.  A must read folks.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Kept my interest all the way thru.  Well written.  Better than the Kite Runner.  So sorry when it ended.  I wanted more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked the game, but I was expecting it to take longer. Some of the levels were just extremely easy.
0545586178|5.0|Most of the people I've talked with say this is the one of the trilogy they like least; it's my favorite. Here's why. The first part is all about consequences - the consequences of winning the Games, but also the consequences of defiance, and I can see why this book is not always popular with readers, because the things that happen are hard to read about. But it's still good storytelling, with Katniss and Peeta inadvertently triggering District uprisings when they are trying their hardest to play nice. Collins had me at the description of President Snow smelling like blood and roses, and Katniss's not-so-farfetched speculation as to why.<br />Once the rules for the Quarter Games are announced the book shifts gear, taking on intensity, because this time the other players won't be newbies and kids, they will all be seasoned veterans, and some of them are wonderful, or heroic,  or interestingly dangerous people. So instead of there being only two or three people Katniss really doesn't want to have to kill or see die, now there are about a dozen. Furthermore, Katniss has to deal with her support team's reactions, which range from disappointment and shock to tears, to determination. Cinna, again, is wonderful, and so are Peeta and Haymitch, and it is riveting to find out his backstory. And it is here, in the second part of the story, that I began laughing, because there is a dark humor that only arises when lives and loves and integrity and death are all on the line. From the moment Katniss tries out Haymitch's coping mechanism all the way through the training at the Capital, I was enjoying the book mightily. And then the Games themselves began.<br />Of course, the Capital is trying to punish Katniss and to quell uprisings, but these contestants are long-standing favorites in the Capital as well as in Districts, so the most dangerous Game is the one being played by the President. Some of the contestants realize that he, and the rigged political game he upholds, is the real, the only enemy.al, the only enemy.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Kanye decided not release any singles as a part of this album; quite an unorthodox approach considering the way the music industry operates today. Whether you end up loving or hating this album, you cannot deny that this album was a risk. He makes it very clear on this record and in his NYT interview that he's done doing what people expect him to do. If you like the crap that is being played on the radio, you're probably not going to like this. The album is full of electronic and industrial sounds. It also changes quite a bit, which I think the average listener will have a hard time with. For example, the beginning part of \\"I'm in it\\", doesn't sound at all like the rest of the track.<br /><br />I found the album enjoyable to listen to from start to finish. It was only on my 2nd and 3rd times around that I started developing my favorite/least favorite tracks. No, there's not any \\"standout\\" tracks in my opinion, but that doesn't mean that they're all bad or even mediocre.<br /><br />Top Tracks:<br />Black Skinhead (if Marilyn Manson doesn't get some production credits on this song he's being robbed, because it sounds just like 'the beautiful people')<br />New Slaves<br />I'm in it<br />Send it Up<br /><br />Bound 2 and Blood on the Leaves are pretty decent tracks as well IMO, I just don't always have the patience for them. If you're yearning for the days of College Drop Out, I would say Bound 2 is the closest thing to that.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the best books I've read in  long time. Had me on the verge of tears at multiple points.
B005UG542S|5.0|I have seen all of the Potter movies and I have loved them all.The movies followed the books very well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking jay is a bittersweet book. I cant imagine what it would be like living in such awful times. It brings me relief to no that none of it is real.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are wonderful, the story line keeps you guessing and wit is enjoyable.  I will whole all the seasons when they are available as one could watch this show over and over.  The detail that is included in the history puts you back in the early 1900, however, if you listen carefully it is not much different than today.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Game is fast action and allows you to retry the level if your time runs out.  Has more levels than other arcade games that are free.  You won't regret getting it.
B002JIEYLM|5.0|I really like this album. Black Sabbath fan since high school (the original group), this album and &#34;Never Say Die&#34; are the last two of the original group that I did not own and they contain all the other songs I remember hearing but did not realize they were Sabbath tunes. Once Ozzie split I sorta lost interest I guess.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was really fun loved all the puzzles and levels. takes some thinking but its pretty cool and entertaining
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Omg I absolutely love Gideon and Eva!!!!!! They are so in love and I love it!!!!!!!! I so can't wait for the next book I hope it's just as good as this one and the other 2 books!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This app ia a nice time-killer. Its a good way for you to just keep tor mind occupied. :) I suggest it for people of all ages, I mean, I'm 13. &infin;
B002JIEYKS|5.0|I really like this album. Black Sabbath fan since high school (the original group), this album and &#34;Technical Ecstacy&#34; are the last two of the original group that I did not own and they contain all the other songs I remember hearing but did not realize they were Sabbath tunes. Once Ozzie split I sorta lost interest I guess.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|Fine album and plenty of solid songs through out. This is the album that got me into Bowie so it's always gonna be a fond memory listening to it. Fans aren't gonna be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well i played on my friend  tablet and i got an addiction i won so many times and and it was very cool to have a game like this \\"the new temple run\\" but BETTER yousould go get it today
B0084IG8TM|5.0|After reading the book I went to see the movie. I'm glad that I read the book first since many things had to be omitted or movie would have been 8 hours long. If you haven't seen the movie yet, buy it. Although the books were written for a teenage audience, all age groups. will thoroughly enjoy.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I can only give him 5 stars because of his characters. He is one of my favorites. I would recommend all his Will Robie novels.
B0027Z5DM6|1.0|Made this purchase but the download did not work correctly and I was charged for it anyway. Don't know what the movie is like, but the follow-up was not adequate.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The beginning was really slow. I fell asleep 3 times before I finished the movie. Just didn't keep my attention
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book. Even though it was written for teens it has a universal theme that applies to all age groups. The movie &#34;Hunger Games&#34; was true to the book in every aspect. To get the full impact, it's essential to read the book either before or after viewing the film. Best book I've read in awhile.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Very enjoyable read, wish I had read this before &#34;The Hit&#34; but couldn't put it down.  Will definately be reading more of his books.
B001GMQALY|4.0|This one is definitely for adults only! The steamy scenes override any story line or the, at times, acting challenged performers. I think the director was going for lots of sex (it sells) and not much emphasis on the plot or direction for that matter . 4 stars for the sexy Kim Basinger !!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun and could not put down. Very challenging and the puzzles mind blowing .hidden pictures was also fun.kept me on my toes.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|This is easily the best Maysa album to date!  14 original tunes and 1 luscious cover version (Nancy Wilson's \\"Quiet Fire\\").  Along with the \\"Get Lucky\\" Daft Punk song her \\"Put It On Me\\" is sure to be pumping on every disco dance floor.  Who would have imagined the two best disco records of all time would be released in 2013???  Several tracks on Blue Velvet Soul are thumping party music and the rest of it is the sublime soul, neo-soul, jazz, blues, pop confection that NO ONE ELSE does quite like Maysa.  It's a generous album about an hour long, but what is rare for a long album, this one doesn't out stay its welcome.  The last five tracks are the albums finest moments IMO...she saves the best for last as the saying goes.  this is a SOUL ESSENTIAL recording!
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Great product, great quality, totally great transaction. My grandson loves these! I told him I'd get him more spiderman movies, so he's thrilled with these.
B00005JKDR|4.0|A very funny take on closet monsters.  Big name stars voice these monsters.  This is a great family movie.  It does not get old.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I watch this show all the time and it can make me laugh no matter what kinda mood I'm in!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it is so hard to find a chess app that you can change the difficulty.  it's always set to hard. like it's meant for pros. not beginners. I highly recommend this app.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Easily addictive and very fun mystery manor is a collectors dream and an item hunters fantasy come true. all the items to collect make it addictive and the npcs are all funny characters you like getting to know
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I recommend this CD for anyone who LOVES real HIP-HOP! J. Cole is the TRUTH. I haven't picked up a great product through and through since K. Lamar. I want to thank J. Cole for resurrecting the game because it has been drowning with auto-tuned songs about &#34;molly's, lean, and prostitutes&#34; for far too long. J. Cole is a lyrical Beast and the production is super hot. If I saw him today, I would hug him and THANK HIM for True Honest Hip-Hop from his heart. He didn't have to try hard and it shows. He has found a fan in me! LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|When I start to watch this, I can't seem to shut it off!  It is so hilarious that it is addictive!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game but some levels were extremely easy and others hard. it'll be interesting to see how more levels will compare.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Worth every penny. this memorabilia collection has everything a person could want to experience this great concert tour in 1976.
141659521X|5.0|Flynn is super as usual.  The plot an action are non stop.  A great read if you like this genre.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you liked &#34;Friends&#34; then you will like &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; too.  Its just a group of people hanging out dealing with life!  Most of them are just extremely smart!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Difficult following individual characters.  One has to guess which character is speaking in each chapter...whose point of view etc.  What happened to the doc and other characters'?
B0067EKY9K|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, but wished they had shown more fishing.  Easy plot, romance nice, humor and some basic drama.  Acting was good.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|Action, excitement and some pretty good acting. The Gangster Noir, You have the girl, the gangsters, coppers, chases, fights and a fair plot. Enough to invest your time , and a bag of popcorn.
0321811984|5.0|There are many guidelines, templates and standard for doing presentations, and, sadly, few will help you do good ones that engage your audience.<br />Presentation Zen is an easy to read book that can show you how to do effective presentations and inspire you to get started on a presentation.<br />It combines guidelines, examples, and pointers to resources that can help you both organize your ideas (even if you don't plan  to present) and do better presentations in person, or on line.<br /><br />The book will be one that you will want to refer back to from time to time, and my one complaint is that the index could have been better.<br />But in spite of that minor flaw, presentation Zen is worth reading if you ever have to do a presentation to a group of any size.
B009R659L8|5.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark style.<br />She grabs you so you can't put her book down. If you like surprises, you'll love this mystery.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|I loved this project.  You never cover all of Nat's songs.  But I wish he would have added &#34;The Christmas Song&#34;, I remember You&#34; and &#34;That sunday, That Summer&#34;.  I guess I'm just greedy, great job George.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|Daft Punk can make you shake your groove thing. Pharell on the track makes it a must have for groove fanatics. Just put this one on and get the party started.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If I was a teacher I would use books such as this to teach my classes. The historical facts stick in my mind so much better when they are interwoven within a story!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I haven't had time for social networks until I recently retired. Facebook has me connected to family and friends that I haven't heard from in years! I enjoy Facebook very much!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game. Can't wait for more levels. Spent the afternoon playing the game with my daughter. Hurry up with more levels...
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I didn't want the upgrade but apparently if I want to keep using this app there isn't an option other than to uninstall the thing. It was fun while it lasted
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As always, I am left with so many thoughts and feelings after finishing my latest Gaiman read, the most powerful of which is once again sheer awe.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|product is Good! I really enjoyed it and will contunue to watch it more times again and a again Thanks!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|2nd best game every. Just love it.@ more<br /><br /> A game I have the double  headed Sun dragon and have the best
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love the characters and all the story lines that are part of the big picture. Can't wait for the next one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun puzzle.  Perfect for when you have just enough time to escape a single room before your break is over.  It would be nice to be able to save your progress within the rooms.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm surprised this book has such poor reviews, I really loved it. The last book wasn't great but this one was my favorite of the 3!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book is a great read, it introduces Jack Reacher to his audience.  He is a no nonsense guy with no qualms about killing someone but only for a good reason.  Great entertainment
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I am not a movie reviewer so this will be short.  This was a great movie and well worth the watch.  I loved it and I am glad I bought it!
B000FC146C|5.0|I love epic novels that span decades and tells a story for the ages. This is one of my very favorites.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|On the Kindle it is hard to use the control buttons. My little girl was bored in 10 minutes. oh well
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed the character development and flow of the story. Looking forward to reading many more of the Jack Reacher books in the future.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|My wife loves Rod Stewart so I got this album for her. She has just about every album Rod has made and this is one of his best.<br />Amazon prime is great. Love the free two day shipping.
B00BJS7104|4.0|i have not yet watched it yet on my but I hope to watch it and be able to give a review on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The buy got bin dear ghost love go to the store story title girl shady very for get be you<br />5stars
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Very good! The actors chosen perfectly for this film. The setting amazing. The fire scene mind blowing!  Ready for the next one!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My children and I enjoyed this game together. We found it fun and addicting. It was also a decent learning expierence.  However when the app had its first update you are forced to update to play. Only there is a parsing problem fory device. Thus the $20 we bought in app credits are now wasted as we cant even use them. Very frustrating.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Lots of fun, and I have to get three gears on each level...<br /><br />And the second level looks fun with the two goals.  Quite interesting, and challenging to get all of the gears. . My kids will love it too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|amazingggg app it is so fun. I get to use my brain while uncovering mysteries. I reccomend this app to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great novel it kept you on the edge of your seat.it was exciting and emotional at the same time.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|Too much happening with no real conclusion... Kept me occupied on the plane but really can't say it was an enjoyable read.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game provides a certain amount of fun flying along as Ironman, but is fairly limited and one-dimensional...something to briefly pass the time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game but makes you review to continue game.  Fun and just challenging enough.  Similar to 100 floors.  So far it is not too hard but we'll see once we can continue after review.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|challenging enough and fun to play alone - once you have concurred the levels, may lose it's appeal - for now it is still entertaining me - actually too much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow! This home is like totally THE BEST GAME EVER!! Every girl should TOTALLY HAVE THIS GAME!!! The horses in this game look ABSOLUTELY REAL!!!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Just a great feel good movie,  great talent that should be enjoyed for generations to come, these old musicals are amazing.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This is the greatest show in television history. Once I started watching I couldn't stop. Ned stark is a beast and Joffrey stinks
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and not too difficult.  nice twist with the added rooms on several levels. my son and I had a blast
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was an okay book. But it was not nearly as good as people made it out to be. It pulls the reader in quickly but there was some depth lacking.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This has been in my mind to read for a while, and finally decided to dive in. It was a good read for sure. I think there were a few plot holes, maybe just by omission of details which I hope the rest of the series will address, but overall a great story. I don't want to give any spoilers, but was surprised by the speed of the book. I didn't think it end like it did, but I like to be surprised. Just purchased Speaker for the Dead and will start right away. Enjoy!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My brother in law was crazy about this show, and since we live in Boston, he said we MUST watch it... He was totally right! This show is great, reality mixed with fiction, and the best of all... The suspense... So, so far, so good, 5 stars for the first season!
B00AIBZM40|2.0|Ok so my girlfriend rented this and I wasn't excited about it at all. The opening in my opinion the first 7 mins are entertaining then it's snoozesville. The only thing that is remotely good about the film is the Talent but even that doesnt make it a good film.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|So thrilled to have Rebus back, keep them coming. Liked your new series but LOVE Rebus and cocannot wait for the next one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! As soon as I finished one book I couldn't wait to start the next one!!!!!
B0060CV31C|5.0|I had it on VHS and got ride of it when we switched over to DVD's and blu ray.  I saw it on Amazon and had to buy it.  My daughter and I enjoyed watching it again  just as much as we did years ago. It's cute and funny with a good message.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I turned this album off about 6 songs in. The level of arrogance and just plain twisted lyrics, plus annoying beats was too much for me.<br /><br />I guess I've grown tired of glorifying people who intentionally destroy their lives so they can sell their stories to others.
B00BPJ5Z96|4.0|I've watched Enter the Dragon and other Bruce Lee films so many times, but this one never gets old. With all the extras included, this is a great deal. Got it pre-ordered on the day of the release as promised. The bonus features on the DVD are good, but I suppose I was expecting more. I am not let down, but wanted more action with commentary like the documentary &#34;I am Bruce Lee.&#34; Still, this will always be in my collection and a go to movie for inspiration.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game. Started playing it on facebook and am so happy I can play on my kindle fire too!  It's so addicting.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it..but I couldn't put it down. It's charming, funny and heartbreaking. If you can give yourself one pure gift of joy - make it this book.
0374275637|5.0|Great book that makes you revise your way of thinking.<br />This book engulfs a lifetime of studies and research of the noble prize laureate Prof. Kahneman yet succeeding to be accessible for people that have no academic background in that field through a lot of examples, remarks and obviously the not pretentious writing style of Mr. Kahneman.<br />This book is long and demanding (after all its not a prose book)  but it is worth a while, so take your time :-)
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Seems to work as advertised.  I have not tested all functions yet, but it should work for what I want it to do
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I paid for it and when it began to install it said error wouldn't let me download at all. And I paid seven dollars!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy this game very much .  Playing the Casual mode is relaxing and if you want a little more challenge or mind stimulation, you can play the Timed mode. I would recommend this to anyone that just wants to have some fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cleaner app. I love it!! Good test of the mind. Requires different thinking process for each level. Actually have to use your brain.
B009EBNSD2|5.0|Great series. Really stuck with the book. I loved seeing the characters come to life.  You understood why Tess made the decisions she made
B003E88TKS|5.0|Was amazing to be able to relate so well to a character. Would recommend to anyone with a face paced and stressful job who is overly ambitious and driven to be the best. Success is won by paying the price of sacrifice, which this illustrates well.<br /><br />I don't buy movies often, but had to pick up this gem.
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|This movie is enteraining and I recommend it to any of you folks that enjoy make believe!  Rent it or buy it today!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I saw the movie and thought I would like the books. I was wrong. Some parts were disgusting and unnecessary. Others were boring and simple. I'll stick with John Sandford and Michael Connelly.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|You run out of things to do quickly.  More quests would  be nice . It gets a little boring after awhile.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is simple and entertaining.  Very addictive.  The levels don't take long, but it's fun hunting for the pieces.
B007TBCTRK|4.0|Bought the album for background music for work atmosphere and it is wonderful. There are a couple tracks that my toddler likes falling asleep to at night.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Too many open issues left unanswered.......but still a great read!  I hope there will be one more to clear up loose ends.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This was one of my favorite games,but since I can no longer open Cloud City I am really disappointed with this app. Please fix this problem .Before this problem I would have rated this a five!  (Update was told by Rovio that the problem was fixed,but I still cannot open Cloud City,keeping my fingers crossed,hoping I will be able to finish playing this game.)Update August I had to uninstall and reinstall it fixed the problem but I lost my progress.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Evernote is a nice notebook app that has decent functionality. For Apple iPhone and MacBook Pro, it's your best choice.  One comment though, it pales in comparison to MS OneNote, whose functionality makes Evernote look like a 'lite' version or OneNote's little brother.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was free and the best classic book i ever read!!!!!  Anyone should read this book.! WIZARD OF OZ FOREVER
B0026P3G12|5.0|Coming from a small church choir, Susan Boyle has emerged to share her beautiful voice with us all.  Her beautiful voice needs to be shared will all those who enjoy her extraordinary talent.
0307279189|4.0|Not a runner, but loved this book! It's amazing to think that this is a true story of a man who only recently died. So often in conversation I have found myself referring to the book and the person with whom I'm speaking has also read it! This was a required reading at App State not long ago, and I'm glad that one of the students recommended it to me. Amazing story of stamina and mental fortitude!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Hello All!<br /><br />Like everyone else I was excited to hear their would be a new OZ movie! No surprise it is a prequel as these type of stories have become very popular. However I couldn't wait to get back to the land of OZ. I grew up watching \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"The Return to OZ\\". The fantasy genre has stuck with me into adulthood thanks to movies like these! I'm a Disney child at heart.<br /><br />With that being said, I gave this movie a real shot! I have to say, just like after watching Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton, I am very disappointed in Disney! What happened to putting good story telling first! First and foremost a movie is just another medium to tell a story and nothing more. As technology as grown and come alive over the decades, film studios have come to think only about the visuals rather than letting the writers do their job!<br /><br />The visuals in this movie are wonderful and really bring OZ to life. However, the elements I have to say I enjoyed most where the scenes without any CGI at all! This movie felt to much like a video game.<br /><br />On that note, I have to agree with another reviewer, the acting was severely lacking. I have been a big fan of James Franco's for a long time. I have really enjoyed most of the movies I have seen him in, but this was just not the movie to get him nominated for an Oscar. I will say this may not be entirely his fault as the Character of OZ is written as a \\"Playboy\\" who turns his life around. This is seen coming from the very first time you meet his character. Zach Braff, I love that he was in this movie because of all the references on \\"Scrubs\\", but in the beginning scenes, I could not help but to see JD. I think he was kinda type cast. Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams, and especially Rachel Weiss I think were the real people who held this whole thing together! The story was really about the witches.<br /><br />I would really like to thank Disney for making this film as the story really did answer a few questions as a preguel should. The next question to Disney is \\"will their be a second prequel to answer the last question of 'how the wicked witch of the east got the Silver Shoes\\" If no one got the whole Silver Shoes reference at the end, then I think you need to go and read the books as MGM only made the Ruby Slippers red because it was the first film to be seen in color and red is far more eye catching than silver.<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie 2 stars. This was definitely not what I was expecting, but at the same time, I was hoping for something a little more original in character development and plot. We are not all Sheep you know!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this every day! Wish i won more but who doesn't!  But it passes the time while the kids are napping!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This book. This series. It leaves me speechless every time. I'm more addicted than ever. Seriously, Stephanie Plum needs a new job, but where would that leave me??
1594203334|4.0|I love this book. I read it while expecting my first child and it REALLY helped me learn to pace my reaction as a parent. Bringing up Bebe focuses on 'the pause' -- when your child starts crying, you need to pause. Pause and think about why they're crying. Picking up the child or handing the child a toy isn't always the necessary response! I really loved this book and will re-read it before having another child.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout writes in a refreshingly humorous style and she is obviously well entrenched in the understanding of the relationship between the power that creates universes and us.  She is a master in communicating with clarity of thought that makes one comprehend exactly what she's talking about.  Her nine do-it-yourself experiments do prove that your thoughts and intentions create your reality.  It doesn't get better than that.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading E-Squared and highly recommend it to others.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Perfect, no more and no less than that. Just the way i always wanted a headset to be and i just found it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good read. Glad to know people like him were on our side. It is weird to hear how much he didn't mind killing the enemy but I was not in his position so I can't really criticize but maybe it was for the book. Sorry he passed away in such a violent manner. He did deserve more than that!!!

0785163182|4.0|Team-ups are a time-honored comics tradition. Get the superheroes together, have them slug it out, and then have them unite against a common enemy. It's simple enough, and it's been fueling comics \\"events\\" for decades. Avengers vs. X-Men (AvX if you're hip) is one of the latest of those events.<br /><br />The story unfolded in miniseries form throughout 2012 and has been collected in a gigantic trade edition. It begins with the news that the Phoenix force --- a cosmic entity of almost unlimited power that one fed on a star, killing several billion residents of a nearby planet --- is returning to Earth. This is disturbing news for the Avengers, who want to make sure it doesn't happen. That seems sensible enough, but mutant superheroes the X-Men have a different take. The Phoenix force has long had a special tie with the women of the Grey family --- beginning with Jean Grey/Marvel Girl/Phoenix and continuing with Jean's daughter Rachel --- but this time, it's aiming for Hope Summers. Hope's all right with that; she's pretty sure she can handle all that power. The X-Men are fine with it as well.<br /><br />And thus begins the setup for perhaps the greatest war in Marvel history. Superhero fights superhero to bloody and violent effect. If you're a fan of epic comic battles, this is a series to love (and so are its plethora of tie-ins, where the major battles really take place). Also, smartphone-enabled readers will get a big kick out of the interactive tags throughout the book, which provide tons of fun extras.<br /><br />While this series seems like an excuse to have major heroes fight each other (and act somewhat erratically), it has a larger storytelling purpose: It redefined the teams of both the Avengers and the X-Men and changed events permanently in the Marvel universe. This series sets up the future of Marvel for 2013 and beyond.<br /><br />-- John Hogan
0062235893|2.0|I thought it would be the complete story but it was not. I bought the cloth book because my grandchildren ripped the pages of the paper book.
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling was always a great storyteller, but with this novel she proves herself to be a writer of rare insight and talent. Managing to avoid what in other hands could have been reduced to a soap opera, the best-selling author in the world delivers up a genuinely interesting and at times quite powerful take on a socio-political war that flares up within a West Country village where the abrupt death of a loved/needed/resented leftist council member suddenly throws a once delicately prevailing balance into the heart of a whirlwind. Exploring as she does every facet of middle and lower class society, Rowling somehow pays homage to the grand Victorian epics, but does so without losing touch with exactly what motivates various groups of people in a particular era: in this case post-New Labor Britain. Filled with memorable characters, some of whom are downright nasty and others incredibly tragic, The Casual Vacancy is as intelligently composed as it is addictively readable, and deserves the five stars I am giving it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. All of the HP movies in blue-ray at a really decent price. I read some reviews about bad quality and missing cover art, but nothing like that happened with me. Mine is fantastic! I would highly suggest this.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|very dramatic & strong. Superman is my favorite superhero. The music makes me feel good. i look forward to the sequel.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was the third book in the Crossfire Series.  It was delayed in coming out but definitely worth the wait. Sylvia Day knows how to write these characters so that we become so involved with them.  It picks up where the second one ended and the fact that Eva now knows exactly want Gideon did for her.<br /><br />Since the police are still investigating the murder, Gideon and Eva have to keep their relationship a secret for awhile.<br /><br />This book was really about becoming a couple and the trust they are learning to have for each other.  Gideon was always putting Eva first and she was learning to believe that she deserves Gideon. The sex was HOT and they pushed things a little further in the bedroom in this book.  However, their relationship was not based on sex, they have a deep love for each other and it showed in and out of the bedroom. I loved it when they just hung out at the apartment and watched movies.  This story resolved some cliff hangers from the previous story but did not leave us hanging this time.  Eva and Gideon are happy and know there are still things to work on and problems that still need to be resolved. Personally, I am thrilled that there will be a book 4 and 5 as I was not ready to let go of Gideon and Eva as I love them as a couple.  I am definitely looking forward to the next book!<br /><br />Rating:4.5<br /><br />Heat Rating: HOT<br /><br />Reviewed by: Donna McClaugherty
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very GOOD!! Couldn't put it down. First book that I have read by William Landay, will read more of his books.

B001NLL93W|4.0|This is an excellent summer read. You will love the entire mortal instruments series.  The characters draw you into the story and you want to find out what happens next.
B008D1RCI6|5.0|Never heard this album  and stumbled upon it by chance and I love it. Kind of reminds me of Bob Dillon. Love \\"There is a Valley\\", but the whole album is great!
B00797MB0O|4.0|I really liked this movie though it probably isn't for everyone.  However, it is dark and depressing - not a comedy!  There is ironic humor in parts BUT DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED!!!  Especially if you are a depressed single woman who doesn't want to be single.  I wanted to rescue her dog from her because Charlize Theron's character was so depressing.  Anyway, the acting is great, its a story that you don't often see because no one wants to admit how hard life and delusion can be, but only watch it if you are in a decent frame of mind because it will depress you even if you were feeling good before you saw the movie.
0345803493|1.0|I did not like this book because it was a children's book with an adult theme.  It is not realistic in the BDSM world.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|I like the game and everything but sometimes it goes too fast and I can not keep up the game is fun and all but the people get made a little too fast
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging at the same time. Some clues are obvious and others a little more thinking. If you liked 100 Doors you will like this one too.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I was honestly expecting more out of this movie, but it didn't fail to impress. There were some really good parts to the movie and slightly humorous parts. The music in the movie was fantastic and chosen well. I just regret that some of it was a bit too predictable.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|and moving into the first decade of the twenty first century in Afghanistan.<br /><br />I am thoroughly enjoying this book. It is written as well as &#34;The Kite Runner.&#34;<br />Like any good writer Khalid Hossein brings in many characters that seen<br />upon introduction to me separate stories, However, throughout the story<br />he relates them in small ways so that you know that they are connected.<br />I have not finished reading the book but I am on the final third. There is a<br />wonderful push to reach a resolution to the story in the part that I am currently<br />reading. Great book!
0762445262|3.0|The book makes nice kindling, I wouldn't recommend reading it really. The light itself is nice and rather neat looking. Comes with batteries already in so you won't need to find the right size first thing upon getting it. It is a cheap little plastic toy, but the detail work on it isn't sloppy like you see for some other products. The signal itself needs a dark room to show up right, and gets extremely blurry when the light is moved beyond about twelve inches from the surface it's projecting on. I think I'll be using it as a topper for my cupcake stand, and just put the whole thing close to the wall.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I haven't even finished watching it. My wife has fallen asleep. The acting is severely overdone. I feel like I am watching a high school musical and the popular kids are trying to see how much they can stress the words in the play and overplay their own importance. Delete the part about the musical, though. Thankfully I haven't heard any singing yet.<br /><br />The effects in the movie look like a 3-year old with neon crayons going crazy on a green screen. Even the depth doesn't feel all that real.<br /><br />This is easily one of James Franco's worst performances and, to be completely honest, he has had many.<br /><br />Mila Kunis has yet do anything to impress me as well and I generally like her.<br /><br />Actually, I am so bored with this movie (as if you couldn't tell from my writing a review of it while I watch it) that I am going to just stop it now. I've had enough.
B0000549B2|5.0|THIS IS A ALL TIME GREAT MOVIE! DENZEL IS A VERY GREAT ACTOR. A GOOD SPIKE LEE JOINT! VERY GOOD MOVIE MO' BETTER
B005JZBP8W|5.0|its one of the old great classics. Rex Harrison was so perfectly cast and Audrey Hepburn was so well chosen as Eliza.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My daughter really enjoys this game, and I enjoy playing it with her.  We saw another little kid playing it at the dentists office and I decided we needed it too!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I've never read a book so interesting in parts yet so uninteresting in other parts. This book could have been edited down by about 200 pages. There are sections that could be eliminated entirely, and the story would still thrive. Not a book I would re-read.
B005LAII12|2.0|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT ALL THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE KIDS AND THE SEX WITH A TOY BEAR WAS VERY NASTY!
B004SUDPWI|5.0|excellent movie. though its an old production the main actors were superb. very well converted into blu ray. thank you
B00B5FBQTS|4.0|I like the look and feel of this game but it lost its luster a little too quickly.  overall though it is a fun game 4 stars.
B005PK553C|5.0|A fresh take on horror! I never envisioned that it would be so racy and intense.  The actors are wonderful.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I love this movie; it's on my list of 5-star flix. I love the `40s film noir atmosphere combined with the futuristic man-has-despoiled-the-planet setting; the way the story proceeds from clue to clue; the way the replicants' actions mirror the humans' actions; and the theme, that the humanoids are \\"more human than human.\\" I prefer the theatrical version, with the voice-over and the flight scenes at the end. The longer version feels more complete and more rounded somehow. The so-called director's cut seems thin after seeing the other. This is always a great movie, in any version. This seems like a good collection, but I have not gotten around to watching all the versions.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love using this keyboard, it's smooth and fluid and remembers exactly how I type and can correctly guess what I'm trying to type. Big thumbs up.

0375423877|5.0|love this whole series of books, main character is wise, kind and very loving, what a great world it would be if more of us would live the &#34;Botswana&#34; way.
B00A8OWOSO|3.0|then you'll like Miller's Landing. I'm not a fan of that genre, so found it diverting but missable.  It's purely cartoonish drama, lots of violence, and dialogue that's hardly soaring. The cast is great, though, especially Albert Finney, and it's fascinating to watch a young Marcia Gay Harden before she became an accomplished actress.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was the first book I read about Jack Reacher.  Reminds me of the TV show &#34;Person of Interrest&#34;.  Loved the book.
030746363X|4.0|I bought and read this book in December of 2011.  Eighteen months later and I'm twenty pounds lighter.  Not that amazing, right?  Well, I decided years ago that I would never \\"diet\\" again.  I've tried most of the fad and no-so-fad diets over the years: Atkins, South Beach, Weight Watchers, good old calorie counting, etc.  At some point I decided that I would only make deliberate, PERMANENT changes to my diet  one at a time and only if I felt I could live with the changes for the rest of my life.  The Slow Carb \\"Diet\\" (SCD) found in the early sections of the Four-Hour Body was the perfect companion to my decision.<br /><br />The SCD is not so much a diet as a set of guidelines for steady, gradual fat-loss.  It comes with recommendations for supplements as well as some unusual modifications to your lifestyle, such as brief exercises before and after eating to stimulate fat loss, and an interesting section about ice therapy; but the eating plan itself is what I have stuck to for the last eighteen months with amazing success.  I've gone from 205 pounds in December 2011 to 185 today.  I don't feel deprived or like I'm eating unhealthy.  I could continue losing a pound a month the rest of my life, well at least until I'm at my target weight of 178.<br /><br />Here's the core of the SCD: five simple rules (I changed them a little to suit my own needs and lifestyle).  1.  Don't eat white carbs - meaning flour, sugar, potatoes.  (Read \\"Salt Sugar Fat - How the Food Giants Hooked Us\\" and you won't want to eat them anyway!)  2. Don't drink calories. 3. Don't eat fruit (I replaced fruit with copious amounts of leafy green and other vegetables) 4. Eat the same foods over and over for breakfast and lunch, with variety for dinners, and few or no snacks.  5. My favorite rule - pick one day a week and eat whatever the hell you want all day long. Stuff yourself with anything!<br /><br />So in a typical week I lose 3 to 4 pounds and gain back 2 or 3 of them on Saturdays.  You may think this is counter productive, but the Binge Day is the key to my long-range success.  If I crave pizza or Cinnabons on, say, Tuesday, I make a mental note to indulge in them on Saturday, and therefore can wait until Saturday and stick to my eating plan until then.  Over time I'm losing weight, feel GREAT and will never have to \\"break my diet\\" as long as I live.<br /><br />There's more to the SCD (example: add cinnamon and lemon juice to your foods to inhibit insuling release)but the five rules mke up the basic plan.  Get the book, read the first half (it's really more of a reference book not meant to be read through all the way) and free yourself from the vicious cycle of dieting and cheating and dieting and cheating and...
1451695195|5.0|This was a great book. I think the author was very sincere in describing his near-death experience, and his report is very interesting and inspiring. In many ways, his experience is an affirmation of lessons taught in many religions: we are spiritual beings; our existence persists beyond this material, earthly realm; love is the essence of our bond to the divine Creator and to each other. I walked away from reading this book feeling renewed spiritually. I think the author's own background in science and medicine affords a perspective that speaks to our Western, science-trained minds.<br />  I read the book a few times, because it is easy to read and  there is much joy in its message. I found it helpful to make a list of the various family members and friends mentioned in the book, because without a list, I found it hard to keep track of who he was talking about.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|kept you guessing, a page turner. In terms of narrative a  good example of the unreliable narrator.  Would recommend to legal mystery fans.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Loved the book, it was interesting and thrilling. All of Lee Child's books are good, they keep you interested. That's it.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|Ever since Tom Robbins quit writing while at the top of his craft, I keep searching for the go-to author. Someone you can count on to be entertaining and thought provoking. Someone who stimulates conversations. David Sedaris had reviews that led me to believe he could be the one. Not even close. Sedaris' life is just not that interesting. Sure he's gay, was a druggie and a heavy smoker who agonizingly quit. That puts him in an elite group of a couple million people. Come back Tom, we need you now more than ever.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I like to read before bed, and this was not the book for that. I ended up laughing so much at the start of the book, that I woke up my SO and kept myself awake--anecdotal stories about being a young woman that any woman can relate to. This book is more or less an autobiography, but towards the back third of the book it was more serious--it was less like a comical autobiography and more like a stranger on the bus telling you the details of their life for the last few years. I'd still give it 4:5 stars, because it is a good book, and to be fair it was still the course of her life, but if anyone else is like me, a warning about the last parts of the book being more serious would be good. To be fair, the topics in the last part of the book are serious, and I think the tone was intentional and reasonable.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Now, in the second decade of the 21st century, we have seen the enemy and he is us.  We have become the beast.  The scariest of all le Carre's books.  We so wanted to think we were better and different.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|app works well om my kindle fire. challenging. fun game. not very long. but very enjoyable. my son loves this game. he is 6. so its fun for all ages
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I really really enjoyed this movie. I have not read the book, so I cannot compare. I am always disappointed if I watch a movie after reading the book, so I'll leave it at that! The acting was fantastic and the characters were really well built up. The cinematography was fantastic and I also enjoyed teh soundtrack and the artwork during the credits. Overall, very creative and enjoyable film...assuming you like watching movies involving the \\"supernatural\\". One must likely have somewhat of an open mind and creative personality to truly appreciate this film. I highly recommend this film.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|While I wouldn't recommend this movie to young children it was still good. Its not that the movie is horrible for young kids, it just tend to be a little gory, and that scares most kids. This movie was romantic and funny. Very light hearted. I really enjoyed this movie :-)
B0013TTLDE|3.0|story, and a good beach book or if in bed with a cold but not Downton Abbey for sure.  Lots of plot twists that are hinted at so it's fun to figure out the ending.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Just dragged on into stupidity and over acting. J Lo is so annoying. like always. the rest are good, but unrealistic and overdone. Diaz is hard to look at with 10lbs of facial makeup. They are really trying to let these over the hills in their 40's hang onto a younger girls parts..unfair I tried to watch this many times..then canned it
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|well done, tight script, very masculine storytelling. I have enjoyed Sellick as the exact opposite of Magnum from many years past.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|On time, and it works. I don't know why I had to buy this separately (maybe I lost the original).
B004LROUW2|2.0|My niece who is younger and smarter highly recommended this book but I hated it.  I didn't finish it.  Hated the premise for starters.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I was using Flipboard on my Kindle Fire for the past few months and loved it. Worked like a charm. Then on 6/19/13 it wasn't working. It hadn't been updated with new content. The following day it would not open. I rebooted the Kindle. Same behavior. So I deleted it and reinstalled it. The reinstalled version won't let me sign in; it tries to process my sign in and just stays in that neverland, trying to process the request. The Clipboard app on my phone still works. It's disappointing, because using it on the Kindle was a delight - until it stopped working altogether.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|For anyone who loves traveling through the Highlands of Scotland to the American Colonies, this is a wonderful book.  I would recommend starting with the first book called the &#34;Outlander&#34; by Diana Gabaldon to truly appreciate James and Claire's lives, but you become immersed in the &#34;Drums of Autumn&#34; even without the earlier books.  Diana Gabaldon knows how to keep the reader captured. Highly recommend!

B004A8ZX28|5.0|Exciting suspenseful movie that gave me clues but I did not predict the outcome.  This is better than recent James Bond movies.<br /><br />That's what a great movie is all about.<br /><br />This movie is based on the French novel Unknown: A Novel by Didier van Cauwelaert. Foreign movies focus on great stories whereas Amercian films usually have boring stories and focus on special effects or sex.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Another great Liam Neeson movie is \\"Taken\\".

B00BWJARHO|5.0|I was concerned, having heard about some of the extra's that had been added (a lot of backstory, the Pale Orc, the outright animosity of the Dwarves to all things Elven).  In all I think the film retelling of this classic tale only adds more depth to the story.  I know Mr. Jackson could have gone the safe route and made the movie line for line from the book.  I know that some purists may wish that he had.  But I sat enthralled for the duration with no complaints at the end.  Looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|But its good.AWSOME I love it spool good at it too I think its more geared for people 10 and up
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The scenery of the setting.  The wonderful engaging story line. The suspense of what's going to happen next.  The changing world as it always has been and always will.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Graphics are colorful and entertaining.  Action keeps it exciting and I like that you have to work to level up. The ads are no more than I would expect from a free game but harassing me to share on FB every couple of games is super irritating.  I do not generally feel the need to let everyone on FB what game I am playing Nd what my score is.

B000FC1MCS|4.0|I suspect that there are two ways to review this book. The first is to launch into a detailed description of the authenticity of the portrayal of a fifteen year old boy with Asperger Syndrome. Is it realistic? Does it accurately describe the symptoms? Is it a fair representation of what it's like to live with someone with Asperger's? Personally, I have no idea. The reviews seem to be divided. Some rave, some dismiss. I will leave it to those who have experience, to have an opinion.<br /><br />I'm left then with my experience of reading a novel about something which I know nothing about. In that context I can say I really enjoyed the novel. It's incredibly readable and well structured. I like the way it jumps between a straight narrative and commentary on random facts. I found the narrator an engaging and really likeable character. His unswerving honesty makes for a really interesting assessment of his family and those around him. Even if his point of view is not a perfect rendering of an autistic experience, it is a unique and refreshing take on the world.<br /><br />I enjoyed too the way in which the narrator, Christopher, describes and illuminates the people in his life. His teacher Siobhan, whom we never meet, but know a lot about, is a lovely character - oh that all students had a Siobhan in their lives.<br /><br />The novel is written for a YA crowd but it's a worthwhile read for all ages.<br /><br />My only other comment is that there's a part of me that almost hopes this book isn't seized upon as a great coming-of-age-english-text-that-all-students-read-so-they-can-be-more-empathetic-about-kids-with-autism. I would love to see this book read widely not so we can understand an 'other', but rather from the standpoint that literature should give voice to all members of society. Students should read books told from multi-racial standpoints, about all religions, abilities and experiences. This book should be read to remind that people with autism are the same not different.different.

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I love this album.  This is my first time buying any of his music and I am now a huge fan. I love his honesty and how he's just raw and uncut. He speaks the truth and I love it. I can listen to this album from beginning to end (no tracks skipped) multiple times a day. Definitely worth the money.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I can't believe how many disc will not play or stop at some point.  What happened to pride in your work?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|fun free roaming game if you did not like the first one or another version try this one it is jam packed with extras
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard not too easy lots of fun and interesting.  challenging enough for you to enjoy playing this interesting game
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old but I play it all the time! Teaches you names of marine fish and invertebrates as well as producers!  Educational! He loves the bright Colorado and peaceful music
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is rather hard to find the objects in the room that you need. Not hard to figure out what to do with them once found tho. It is kind of fun.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|This is the final volume of the wheel of time series,  and while it is a good read, you get the feeling that Sanderson was forced to finish the series as quickly as possible. There is a lot of jumping between characters, and it is sometimes hard to follow the individual storyline,  as this is the authors last chance to show the POV of any character. Much of the detail from the previous books is missing,  such that even though the story is well written, you get the feeling that the book could have been more.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an excellent book written by one of our nation's true modern day heroes.<br /><br />It starts off by setting the stage by Mr. Luttrell describing the experience of Navy Seal training (BUD/S) to help the reader understand the amount of physical and perhaps more importantly mental toughness.<br /><br />He goes into detail to describe his account of Operation Redwing and the heroic efforts these men had to undertake in order for them to do what was morally right in their opinions.  His description of the experiences during the Battle of Murphy's ridge read better and more intense than a Tom Clancy novel.  He is a great American hero in my mind and it makes me proud to know that there are men like Marcus Luttrell and his comrades in arms on the SEAL teams who genuinely love the U.S.A.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This story is inspirational. It shows the courage, stamina, strength, and fortitude of an American solider, especially Adam Brown. Everyone should strive to embody characteristics of Adam. Eric Boehm does a great job of retelling his story and it is apparent in his heartfelt words. I believe every American should read this book. God Bless.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|I learned a lot about myself. I would recommend the test to anyone who needs to know how the work.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter loves this game. She loves the color options and getting to take a picture at the end. Its great.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder has been an intriguing adventure into the literature for young adolescents.  R. J. Palacio has woven together the intricacies of several themes far beyond just calling subtle attention to the issue of bullying. It brings to mind Maya Angelou's admonition to parents and guardians, that every child should be able to feel the love, care and protective spirit of their family deep within their soul.
B0000259FK|5.0|I love this cd.  I have been to the Acripolis so I can imagine being there for his live performance.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I played this on my friends phone briefly over Christmas break and found it to be a fun game, but until I had it on my own kindle I didn't realize just how fun it actually is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Saw Season 1 and got hooked on the series.  I loved Season 2 and looking forward to seeing season 3.
B008RKKUZ0|4.0|I was a fan of the TV version and seldom missed an episode. The movie version captures the morbid humor of the TV show perfectly. The actors are outstanding in their roles, especially the kid actors. Wednesday almost steals the show with her goth style and masked dark humor. My kids have never seen the original series so this was new to them. Much of the double entendre humor was over them but they were still amused by the characters and the visual humor. Another good comedy choice for families who aren't squeamish with the macabre.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was fun without being too hard.  makes you think without frustrating the snotty out of you.<br /><br />a great one to pass a little time.  cant wait for more!
B0012DP8A6|5.0|This is a fun classic movie. Steve martin's part is something to remember and laugh at over and over. Enjoy!!
B00942G4UA|5.0|As a restaurateur, I am familiar with many of the horror in the food industry. The average person must see this to learn what goes on in the food chain before meals hit their table. Everything they see here will surely affect how they buy and consume food from that moment on. This was produced in 2008 before Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) gained momentum in the industry. I hope they bring out another look at the food industry with GMO's now threatening our health. The other thing I hope the producers take on is how American food, once the worlds standard for nutrition, is now banned in many countries because of unhealthy additives, preservatives and chemicals the rest of the developed world banned from their food. Even our prepared foods must be produced differently for overseas markets. It's saddening to know America allows things into the diet of our population that most all developed countries ban.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It is a work of prose. Strayed's descriptions of the trail, the wildflowers, the trees, the national parks are so vivid I almost feel I have hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. Her account of how she deals with the rattlesnakes, bears, deer, and fox who try to stand in her way gives the reader a look at her strong, fearless character, which she is only just discovering. She makes this a spiritual and emotional journey through the icy mountains of the Sierra Nevada as she mourns her mother's death. It is the story of how a young woman learns to redirect her life with a humorous look at her own mistakes. I was hooked from the very first paragraph, and could not put this book down.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|They are a great band!  We have heard them at the Minnesota zoo concert series and can't wait to see them again!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really loved the game wish it was a little longer but over all the story line was very intriguing and the puzzles and mini games  were really fun.
B003EVWDR0|2.0|I am hard of hearing and there was no option for close captioning. Why aren't your movies adapted for those of us with hearing disabilities?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play bingo blitz every night,i love the game and the challenges . I wish there were more ways  to earn earn coins though.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Got the Battery HD app a few weeks ago.  It shows how much battery is left; how long it will take to charge; how long the battery will last using different functions and gives a chart so you can see where you're &#34;spending&#34; your battery power.  Unlike some reviews here I do not find the app is draining my battery - however if you have a kindle fire you will find the Battery only lasts a day or two anyway.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|A complicated love story in which race plays a primary role, with truth but not bitterness.  The characters became real people for me, and I loved them.  I went to a doctor's appointment with my Kindle, and he (a Nigerian) asked what I was reading.  Before the first two syllables of the author's name had left my mouth, he said, &#34;She is my friend.  An amazing woman.&#34;  The most wonderful thing he could do to me would be to introduce me to her.  I grew to love anyone who could write with such astonishing clarity and skill.  Read it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really like this game. Just difficult enough for this novice to keep me interested. Look forward to getting better at it, and finding the solution.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra bullock does it again another comedy that will have you rolling laughing! Sold at a great price too. Watch it time and time again.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|She rushed this book, Sylvia Day didn't know how to end it and probably didn't have the time. This book gave me nothing. There is no closure, no finality, no warm and fuzzy feeling. After waiting for it to come out 6 additional months you would think you would at least get a decent ending. No, this gave you none of that and now she is definitely dragging out the story for money. I'm disappointed as a reader and honestly have lost all interest in Gideon and Ava.. sorry but you will not be getting any more of my money. Sylvia: try listening to your readers and keeping them happy. This was a horrible novel and maybe if she didn't write 10 books at a time she could write one good one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The reason why i really love this game is because it keeps entertained when you don't have anything to do and it's addictive
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found that some of the experiences discussed in the book were very similar in ways I had to a communication I felt I had just a few days after my daughter died.  I felt I had a vision and she was telling me \\"It's okay, Mommy.  I love you, Mommy.\\"  And she was standing with a robed figure.  I felt like I was choking to death on sadness and this vision was instant relief.  As Dr. Alexander states, it is just very hard to describe something like this.  I had woken and was in bed crying and begging God to help me and my faith in God was very shaky at this point, and that is when the vision appeared and it was a split second but very clear and it is to this day. I can still hear it and see it in my mind as clear as if it happened just a moment ago.  And as distraught as I was, the relief it provided to me at that moment seems miraculous to me.<br /><br />My faith in God and Love wavers as I have a very, very difficult time reconciling the concept of evil and what purpose the horrors of mankind provide to the universe and why a loving God would allow people to torture, and children to suffer and starve.  I guess if there is a God then maybe it is just too big to understand, or maybe someday when I die I will enter that world of Love that Dr. Alexander describes and understand, maybe the pain will go away.<br /><br />I do like that he saw dogs in heaven.  I hope it is true and I am not so narrow minded to discount anything.  If this was his experience, this was his experience.  The \\"proof\\" is non-existent, but I would still recommend reading if you are interested, as it is trying to provide proof of a world outside of ours, outside of what we can possibly really know.  It is a mind expanding book and I think it did make me a little more receptive, at least for the time being, to a concept of a loving God.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I was not sure about this series until my husband recommended it.  I watched the first show and was hooked.  Great story line and awesome actors.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|Anthem is the best Hanson album yet! I recommend it to everyone! Anyone who decides to pass this album up will truly miss out on great music. This album has the same great style that Hanson always delivers with an added edge!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's fun and colorful while still being a challenge. I really like the mini game each on has where you have to find a particular fruit and then be able to hit it. There are even new birds to use with different advantages.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|Actions films aren't really serious cinema, any more than westerns and romances are serious literature. I'm not knocking any of them, just saying that the genres in general demand such titillation that they crowd out that other stuff like drawing the audience's empathy through setting a believable stage for the tale. Some action films, like the first Die Hard, are well-written enough to rise about their genre. Point Break doesn't. That said, it's still a lot more fun than a generic action flick, since there's so much love in it. It's one of the best of the 80s and 90s action movies, full of the kind of creativity and fun that distinguish it from the far more soulless action movies we get nowadays.<br /><br />The film continues the proud tradition of cheap 80s action movies -- the so-broad-it's-vague title, the poorly paired law officers who learn to appreciate each other, the surly boss, the charmingly fake blood -- and mixes in one vital element that keeps the whole thing fresh: an obsession with surfing. It's not just about surfers, it's about Keanu Reeves' special agent Johnny Utah unexpectedly gaining a love of surfing while tracking down bank-robbing surfers just as obsessed with it, ending as he quits the force. Scenic shots of the surf start the film, end the film, and show up a ton in between: we're meant to love surfing just as much as our heroes. Since the film gives itself over so much to Patrick Swayze's character's notions of surfing as a way of life, it's possible for a viewer to get just as swept up.<br /><br />The supporting actors give the movie a lot, too: Gary Busey is cranky and unhealthy as Utah's partner, and John C. McGinley makes a particularly sarcastic surly boss. Lori Petty has an entertaining voice. The sense of fun about the film is inherent in the script, with a scene where Keanu gets a sandwich while on a stakeout and manages to miss a bank robbery looking like something out of a straight comedy. I was further amused that the fact thatone of the bank robbers enjoys mooning people turned out to be a major plot point, played for drama. Add the sky diving and the fact that the robbers use rubbery caricatured masks of formers presidents and call themselves \\"the Ex-Presidents,\\" and you have a quirky, genre-bending action-thriller-extreme sports film. It might not be timeless, but if you enjoy action films, it's up there.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Loved this book , Good Summer beach read just the right amount  of fantasy and reality .  A spin we all would like to put on our past
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Man of Steel, like all films from Zack Snyder, is far above average in some aspects, and far below average in others. In fact, it's about typical of his work. It's flashy and punchy and zingy, but it glosses over character and plot developments. Unlike 300, though, this film does manage to get characters into the final product, even if they aren't fully fleshed out. It's an okay film, and definitely a visual triumph, but if you're looking for a gripping time, you might want to look elsewhere. It's the perfect popcorn blockbuster.<br /><br />Snyder, who cut his teeth on television commercials for automobile companies and Reebok, has always been fantastic at visuals. The opening credits for Watchmen, a series of alternate universe vignettes that play out over Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-changing,\\" and most of the fights in 300, despite the overuse of slo-mo, are great examples. As a result, Man of Steel looks great. The fight scenes are action-packed, even for moviegoers already overdosed on packs of action, and certain visual spectacles, like a huge building collapsing as our heroes run for cover, and, notably, the 70s-sci-fi-influenced planet of Krypton, with its dragons, underwater nurseries, and scarlet-skinned suns in the backdrop. No one can make a film look as good as Snyder, James Cameron exempted.<br /><br />But the characters are given no time to develop: the most we get is Clark's parents telling him what a good person he is, and Clark in turn telling everyone how good America and Earth are. It's all telling, no showing, because the `showing' is too busy wowing us with how epic everything is.<br /><br />One character does get developed, and is easily the best part of the film: General Zod. The guy is the only one with a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish, he's the only one who gets screen time from the first ten minutes to the final ten minutes, and he's even the only person who really makes a worth-while effort to save Krypton in the prologue.He's a powerhouse. He essentially saves the movie by serving as its spine. With a sequel and the Justice League movie in the works, we'll see a lot more of Superman, but without Zod, we won't really know any of the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played in my life you have to try it. play it like right now
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show, love the chemistry between Alicia and Will.  Great acting and the episodes always keep you glued and interested, it is just fantastic haven't see an episode that I did not like.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I'm late to jump on the Bruno Mars band wagon, but I'm am thoroughly enjoying this album.  Every song either has me dancing, singing along or bopping my head.  I love his smooth voice over varied musical styles.  I'm only sad that I waited so long to enjoy it all!
0345529057|5.0|An unbelievable collection.  I had  never read fantasy before, but was completely captivated by this series. Martin's writing is creative and keeps you on your toes--you never know what's going to happen next. I'm watching the movies and trying to stay ahead in the books. Beware, they are a bit different!
0375869026|5.0|This book so impacted both me and my 12 year old son we spent days whining to each other, &#34;I don't want this story to be over!&#34; I've passed it on to other parent/son pairs and they are experiencing the same.  Fabulous first release for this author.  Love the variety in points of view.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I enjoy Michael Pollan's writing about food, because he makes his points about the health issues surrounding our current food processing and eating methods without being preachy or overbearing.  I've learned quite a bit about the nature and the importance of food to humans as a cultural referent and driver from Cooked.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed book, but the story doesn't compare to Khaled Hosseini's other books.  I wasn't ever engorssed or captivated.  He did a great job weaving in characters and linking their stories, but I definitely could put it down and pick it up a couple days later.  He is an exceptional storyteller and I recommend it if you identify with his writing and the trouble Afgan country
B0016OMFNY|5.0|How did I miss these guys.  Tom Petty, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, and Roy Orbison.  Good tunes by great musicians.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining and challenging. Keeps you on your toes and has some aspects of memory games...remembering sets of codes or numbers or both. Add in the puzzles and lots of fun. Definitely recommend.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|We'll just got back from the premier of WWZ and thought it was a great movie.  I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars but Amazon does not give this option.<br /><br />Descent plot, great action throughout and a good ending to save the World.  I think I would have preferred to have a different opening to it before Pitt and family got hit in Philadelphia.  They said the white house got taken down, Washington DC whipped out and the president killed so that probably would've made a better opening scene even though it would not show show Pitt in the opening scene.<br /><br />I thought the director did a descent job as well.  I had read several times the ending was entirely reshot as the original was too complicated.<br /><br />Their was a scene taken off our very own Walking Dead that will not be a surprise to many when you see it.<br /><br />If you could label the movie something it would be like \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" zombies on speed though.  Swarming Hordes were very impressive on the big screen, but the majority of these scenes were displayed at least in segments on several of the trailors.<br /><br />We'll I hope for a good unrated DVD  to follow, director cut etc....<br /><br />I think most will come away saying it was a good movie but just didn't blow them away.  I think some of walking dead episodes could be labeled as blowing you away however.  So for the amount of money spent I think the crew got an extended vacation in several countries in the process and maybe bigger pay checks then they should have?<br /><br />I do have to commend them on doing such a movie showing the lack of gore and blood.  This was a big plus and should show others it's not really needed as most movies portray it these days.<br /><br />Go check it out!!

1623360277|5.0|Dr. McDougall's approach to whole food, plant based eating is the best.  Science backs up that not only should you eat only plant based items, but you need to get the majority of your calories from starches so that your body has the energy it needs to be healthy and heal.  Read this, follow it and enjoy truly good health without starving yourself!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This is a perfect time-consuming game for waiting for a meal,waiting for a doctor, etc. I love it and would recommend it.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This game blew me away. There are only two bugs to complain about. Unfortunately these are major bugs. 1)There is no &quot;fire weapons&quot; button on the Batpod and 2) there is no &quot;eject&quot; button on the Bat! Update, maybe? The combat, however, is simply stunning. I especially enjoy the slo-mo hits and silent takedowns. All in all, a great game, but two big things need to be fixed.

B000007ODX|3.0|There is nothing wrong with these nocturnes, but they sound as if Barenboim had not slept for days before recording them. I like Barenboim's playing most of the time. The Songs Without Words is fantastic, but this disc is just too slow. No energy or change of mood. I also bought the Ashkenazy Chopin Nocturnes and they are better.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|but ya can't visit enough friends and it costs too much to get the animals needed for the challenges .. that is What I really don't like cause I don't spend NO Money on games
B009LMTDL0|4.0|It is nice to read a book that affirms the gender imbalances in leadership roles around the globe.  There is a need for input and contribution from women in higher level positions in all organizations.
B00CE6E6B2|3.0|it is okay but gets boring after awhile waiting on things to do in the game.. I didn't enjoy enough to keep it on the kindle
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I really like this game except for one thing. I played it for a few days and then it stopped working. It wouldn't let me play it. I had to delete it and then reinstall it. But the game itself is great.
1401322425|4.0|The book was a gift for my wife who really enjoys the television show, and now has a book with more details.  The book is well written in the style of the author and has several of his recipes in the book.  However, in the show there is a lot of scrap art work made like a collage of images and writings.  I was a little disappointed that this book had none of that artwork.  I think it would have really added a special dimension to this book.  Maybe the author will consider adding snippets of this artwork in an updated version.  Overall, anyone who enjoys the Jamie's show will enjoy this book too!

B00004X10B|5.0|Very roomy, has compartment for all photography needs. Just the right amount of cushioning. Great bag. One of the best selling points for my husband is that is can be used as your second carry-on on an airline. It is designed to fit under the seat. We planning a trip that's a photographers dream. This way he can keep all his important equipment with him.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Waiting for more games, it takes some thinking and a lot of logic that makes it a delight to play Fun to play
B00BTYP6QE|2.0|So I bought this game thinking it would be fun, but when I opened it, it crashed!! Honestly I really was looking forward to the game but now I can't do it at all!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun, but you do only have some games unlocked, until you buy them with the points you get from the other games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun for the levels it offers for free till i had to rate it. There should be many morelevels

B006BGZJJ4|3.0|The Kindle USB cord has caused me no end of grief. I have gone through two of them in a year, and neither worked properly. At first I thought there was a problem with my computer's USB port, since the first one was returned for inadequate connection issues. The replacement cord disillusioned me of this idea. The plug had to be inserted into the Kindle outlet just so, and I could spend upwards of ten minutes jiggling the wires until it maintained a connection. The second cord has been deteriorating steadily until it gave out entirely this afternoon.<br /><br />This is not only the lousiest product, but Amazon has backed us poor Kindle owners into the proverbial wall with having no viable generic options to fall back on. This will be the third time I have shelled out $10 to replace the forsaken things only to find that the performance of the new one was even more pitiful than the last.<br /><br />ETA: The third replacement cord seems to be functioning better than the others, yet there are still some connectivity issues.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|A must see series if you want something off the beaten track...almost as good as Breaking Bad.  Great guest stars!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is an app that is fun for anyone of any age!  It's also incredibly educational!  In fact, I'd say it is an educational app but because it's so fun you don't even realize you're learning!  It also gives the user a sense of responsibility for taking care of our real oceans just because you fall in love with this game's characters, coral and under water fauna.  While, playing this app I find my thoughts drifting to our own oceans and wondering where these creatures live and how they're thriving.  THIS APP IS A MUST not only for the fun but also the education and of course the green feel of it all!!!
B005HSL626|4.0|The game is great and fun but the pictures on the description page are misleading but it may be an update that has not been released on Kindle Fire HD

B00BESNKB8|1.0|Please just don't do it.  I know, you see it is Lucy and you just imagine Kill Bill.  But, it isn't Kill Bill and shame on Tarantino for &#34;Presenting&#34; this crap.  It is a trap!  Ignore his name!!!  He has nothing to do with the making of the film!  There is no character development and what little of a plot there is, goes all over the place.  RZA just wanted to be the star, director, writer blah, blah, blah.  He bit off more than he could chew and then choked on it.  Plus, the man can NOT act.  Or write, or direct.  Even if this is free to watch it will cost you two hours of your life you can't get back.  This just shows how egotistical RZA must be.  First film, he tried to do it ALL himself.  You know, because no one can see his vision the way he does.  Good call.  NOT!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Natalie Portman has always been magnificent and this role just justified everything about her and her work. The story was incredible and showed me a little about myself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent continuing video of a classic show. Easy to accces, convenient watching on mobile devices. Glad it was released on the date as advertised.
B003HARV98|5.0|I can relate too so many of the songs especially &#34;Are You Satisfied&#34; great lyrics. An incredible album from start to finish.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I liked the movie so much that I actually watched it 3 times and would like to see more movies based on halo.
B004EPZ03Y|4.0|My 4 and 2.5 love this movie.  They listen to the soundtrack every day and sing it constant. Such a cute movie, family friendly.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I liked this movie better than the first movie Judge Dredd played by Sylvester Stallone but then I like Karl Urban.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am so hooked on this game and I never thought I could be.  I actually watch tv and play at the same time.  It's a blast
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I really did enjoy watching this movie and now I am considering buying it because I want to watch it again.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Hip-Hop is always growing and evolving fusing with different genres at times, this is one of those examples. First I'd like to say please ignore the people who gave this album 1 star they don't know a masterpiece when they here one. This right here is a masterpiece!! Yeezus has mixed other genres in the music to make not the average rap beat that would usually be heard nowadays. The beats are booming with a strong electronic feel to them and the lyrics cover conscious issues (New Slaves), his Kanye sized ego (I Am A God), among other topics. My favorite song on here i would have to say is Black Skinhead because of the build up it makes on the chorus (\\"four in the morning, and I'm zoning\\") then the drop comes in and it's like a roller coaster going down (\\"I've been a menace for the longest, but I ain't finished, I'm devoted, And you know it, and you know it\\"). The whole song seems as if Kanye is going so fast with his tempo and makes the song feel suspenseful. This definitely worth the buy if you want to be part of the next step that hip hop is probably going. Soon producers will probably be copying Kanye's formula here on their next album
B0098VXMNE|5.0|The second season was even better than the first season and cannot wait until I can watch the 3rd season.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Its very addicting. I recommend this game to anyone who likes fps games.<br />Enjoy!!!!!!!! Also, dont die like a skunk getting ran over....win like a mustang riding thru a trail.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Great series! It is extremely difficult to watch just one episode at a time. I found myself watching the season far into the night.
006123141X|5.0|This is where it all began As I`ve mentioned in my previous reviews I've been reading James Rollins since I picked up The Doomsday Key at Target. I have been looking forward to reading each of his Sigma novels with anticipation before buying it. I have been reading each in the order they were written after reading The doomsday Key, The Devil Colony and Bloodline last summer while waiting for the release of The Eye of God later this month. I know its a year late but here is my review.<br /><br /> This time around, Sigma is back to work with a shadowy double agent operative named Seichan who also works with the Guild (see: bad guys). We still don't know if Seichan is true to us (and by us I mean Sigma, of course) or if she's just out for her own benefit. Either way, if Commander Gray Pierce doesn't work with her, the whole world could be taken over by a nasty spore; a fungus that grows mushrooms inside of you.<br /><br />I will be very vague about the plot. It would be a shame to give too much away. The central plot revolves around a plague from the past and a plague of the future: hunger. As characters in the novel expound, there will soon be a tipping point where there are far too many people on this planet to feed. Who gets to choose who lives or who dies? If you had the power and resources to make the hard choices, what would you do \\"to save the world?\\" And would you be a hero or a villain?<br /><br />Once Rollins set the main plot in motion, things really kicked into high gear with the introduction of a new character, Professor Wallace Boyle, whose lecture on peat bogs thrilled me to my soul. I know, peat bogs, who'd a thunk it? But again, that's Rollins' gift. He must look at the world through curiosity-colored glasses; he can find the wonder in the most unlikely of places and subjects. And even more brilliantly, he manages to string together a laundry list of disparate fascinating topics into the plot of a tight, tense thriller. And he does it again and again.<br /><br />It is the exploring of the above questions that entails ancient artifacts, hidden rooms, booby traps, prophecies come true, missing bumble bees, miracle-performing saints, love triangles, the final resting place of Merlin the wizard, polar bears, teddy bears, and the world's healthiest apple. And I didn't even give you a hint of the real shocker!<br /><br />A lot of thrillers make the goal, save the world, whatever, and end abruptly. Not so here. There is a nice... cooling down period after the action ends. It's a chance to check in with all the major characters, and a chance for Rollins to leave us with another of his signature cliff-hangers. This one isn't as brutal as some he's written, but those invested in the series will be left with a question that of course leads to his next book The Devil Colony.<br /><br />As of now I only have to wait to next Tuesday for the Eye of God to come out which I cant wait to read other than that I will be posting a review for the Devil colony in the near future but till then I am waiting for the eye of god to come out. But for everyone do yourselfs a favor and read the The Doomsday Key along with all the other Sigma novels in order you will not be dissapointed.br /><br />It is the exploring of the above questions that entails ancient artifacts, hidden rooms, booby traps, prophecies come true, missing bumble bees, miracle-performing saints, love triangles, the final resting place of Merlin the wizard, polar bears, teddy bears, and the world's healthiest apple.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you are a parent with a teenager, you will have a lot to think about.  I read a lot of mysteries and am not always suprised at the ending, this was definitely a suprise.  I would highly recommend this book.
B005544V6A|4.0|I was skeptical at the beginning but just watching a few shows I got hooked - somehow it's a nice mix of the two main characters and I love the show so far. Just wish I had more time to get up to date...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Sleek, intuitive, and well made. Simple controls and a layout that's easy for my sleep addled brain to use. It's my new nightstand clock.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy the game. It makes you think and pay close attention, and just when you think you've got it you are missing something small that you need. It does get harder as you play.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this app makes it very easy to see how much life is left in my Kindle Fire. Since the Kindle Fire goes through a charge within eight hours it is great to see how soon I will need to find a charger when I am travelling.
B007Y36K46|4.0|This film is a very entertaining action film.  The story line is very good and has a few interesting twists.  Even though  they use blue blood for the sword fight injuries the good guys inflict on the bad guys, it maybe too gory for little ones at times.  Overall a thumbs up.
B004USRLRS|5.0|I loved it when it came out on vinyl in high school and it still stands up in its timelessness.  Great melodies, great lyrics, great performances and relevant (even today) subject.  Great love songs -- poetry set to music.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I really love Slender and ive always loved all the Slender games, but can somebody please tell me how to pick up signs or &quot;get&quot; them?
B001NIA27E|5.0|It is a thrill ride a minute. The transformation of a warm and inviting small town feeling, into a hellish nightmare is striking. Watching the tenderness of Pierce Brosnan towards Linda Hamilton and her children, as it grows and becomes real is very moving to me.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Mark Wahlberg is convincing in this role as bob lee swagger. After watching this movie muy girlfriends son said I gotta change my name. swagger is cool.... ok maybe that was just the name but he is great in this movie
B006FE83UE|5.0|Again, one of my favorite movies of all time, which I decided I had to add to my collection. The love portrayed between the father and his children, and the contrast of the racial bigotry and hatred exhibited by the town is stunning. This is a movie that moves me to tears at the end every time I see it.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|This is a great album. You can tell that each song was carefully thought and not just random babbling about nothing like Yeezus
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is one of the most dynamic performers in rock and roll today. I love him, and everything he produces.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was different from all the other hidden object games. Can be challenging at times but it is worth playing.
