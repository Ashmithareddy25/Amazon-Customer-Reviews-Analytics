B00A14SQBU|5.0|Really obsessed with this CD.<br />Stand out tracks:<br />Just A Fool.<br />Let there be love.<br />Blank Page.<br />Your Body.<br />The rest is great. Only one that comes out a a bit short for me is Make The World Move.<br />Happy with my purchase
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Many interesting things are happening in the mind of writers that, who know? they might become true in the near future...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. I ordered it for my niece and began to help her. Then I got so into it I couldn't stop playing.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I read this book in just a couple of days!  Very interesting concept but an easy read and extremely engaging.
B0086700CM|4.0|My niece loves it when I got it for her. My kids loved it more and made me get them Temple run 2.
B008J05EL8|5.0|Update helps application to 1) install and 2) work. It completes the program The update is recent. So  ignore the man behind the screen (Wizard of Oz) and<br />try it. You CAN get refund if it fails.
B005TBWN0K|2.0|I searched &quot;screenshot&quot; in the Amazon store and this was the first of the few things that came up. Why it came up with that, I don't know, because I can't figure out how to take a screenshot of my tablet screen, even after I installed Evernote. If these were easier to use, I might have liked them better, but I can't figure them out. I'm uninstalling and giving up on finding a screenshot app for a Kindle Fire HD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game that tests your brain and makes you think. It has  problems and is very fun. It is highly recomended for all ages. You will garunteed have tond of fun playing this game.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I searched &quot;screenshot&quot; in the Amazon store and Skitch was the first of the few things that came up. It led me here, and I've installed both Evernote and Skitch. Why Skitch came up with &quot;screenshot&quot;, I don't know, because I can't figure out how to take a screenshot of my tablet screen, even after I installed Evernote and tried to find the option with no luck on either app. Whenever I hit the screenshot option, it went to my camera with no option to switch to the screen. If these were easier to use, I might have liked them better, but I can't figure them out. I'm uninstalling and giving up on finding a screenshot app for a Kindle Fire HD.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like this book because it shows you the dark side of war and its not about trying to be a fairytale trying to convince you that war is glorious and fun but that war is real and the media has no clue what actually happens.I would encourage anyone that is looking to join the military to read this book first just to be more informed of the decisions you make before you make them
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|A timeless classic for readers of all ages. If only we could all live in a simpler time as in this book the world would be a much better place.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good app. Good loading, accurate. Helps me with future day planning. Would recommend for others to get and its FREE.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|It gives me great pleasure to give Ms. Lisitsa countless stars for this splendid recording of Rachmanioff's piano concertos.  Her strong courage, fortitude, and long practice hours on the piano has paid off to produce this beautiful stellar CD.  She brings out the real essence of Rachmaninoff's concertos in a whole new light with such clarity, exuberance, and grace.
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|Luke has made a habit like Kenny Chesney of making a good summertime cruiser album. This effort doesn't disappoint for the most part, my only complaint is the rehashing of previous efforts again. I would love to see more artist put out beach front, bonfire, at the lake summertime country kickin' it themed albums just like we do every Christmas, BUT with new material each time. Overall though it is Luke Bryan and as a fan you won't be disappointed.
B008I3RARW|1.0|This game is very hard to understand how to maneuver, so I deleted this game from my kindle not long after purchasing it and receiving it.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|My grand-daughter loved it and I would have given it a 5 star rating except that I fell asleep about half way through.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book of the trilogy, I just simply loved it. Remember to read the epilogue once you finish the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series...started watching and cannot stop. I am captivated...well written, well acted and educational....who could ask for more? I love the characters in the story...it is well worth watching...
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The 3D and technical achievement in this movie is fantastic. There is a twist in the movie in last 15 minutes, which makes you rethink all the events in the movie. People who think the final allegory is boring or overstated have not understood the movie.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Sounds easy, but it is not, as former and present smokers know all too well. I found it interesting reading about the ways marketing gurus exploit the power of habit to change our purchase patterns and consumer customs. But this book will not change your life, so do not expect too much of it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but the down. side is that you can't. Make redstone into anything. please make it so we can craft redstone
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|First, I've been a big fan since the early Roxy Music days back in 1970's, own every one of his albums, and have attended six or seven Roxy/Ferry concerts over the years.  I eagerly anticipated this one knowing it was a special pet project.<br /><br />The music is actually pretty cool and is very interesting.<br /><br />The &#34;distracting&#34; part is the recording- they attempted to make it sound like you're listening on an old 78 phonograph.<br /><br />Frankly, I wish they hadn't.
B00BMVTTJ4|2.0|I was disappointed about this movie. Managed to watch only half and stopped. Unable to see  HD on PC, special effects were better in new COD unfortunately.<br />The first 15min were also quite boring, but this is a matter of taste.<br />I saw all the three parts of lord of the ring with passion, but not this one.
B003QSLW0K|1.0|First, please know I am a HUGE Disney fan. Huge. As in obsessed.  So when I took my kids on their inaugural trip to Disney World (my 30th trip), I thought it was funny that my 3 year old daughter really liked the character of Stitch after he stole my water bottle from me in Tomorrowland.<br /><br />So we get home, I rent Lilo and Stitch, and we turned it off after the first 20 minutes. Why? 1) Turns out my daughter didn't care for the movie, which is saying something since she's memorized practically every other animated feature. 2) I was horrified by what it was teaching kids. Examples from the first 20 minutes:<br /><br />1) Stitch spitting in people's faces;<br />2) Stitch bites a guy;<br />3) Lilo jumps a girl who says \\"that's crazy\\" to something she's said, starts punching her in the face, and bites her;<br />4) Lilo disobeys her guardian-sister and doesn't meet her where she's supposed to in order to have an important meeting with a social worker;<br />5) In running home to meet Lilo, her sister darts across a street without looking, then calls the driver who almost hits her a \\"stupid-head\\";<br />6) Lilo nails shut the front door to keep her sister out, then uses the stove (allowing pots to boil over since she's only around 7);<br />7) Her sister threatens extreme bodily harm when she won't open the door;<br />8) Lilo hides from her sister in the dryer.<br /><br />With that, we turned it off. That was just the highlights from the first 20 minutes. Certainly not what I want to teach my daughter, even if she was 10.<br /><br />Good thing the movie didn't rise to prominence in the Disney library!!
B005LN5UOC|5.0|There is one word to describe this item AWESOME!!!!!!!! Great connectivity, great volume, and an awesome fit. I got it for m PS3 and its a great price.
B007HACDLK|5.0|another excellent Mitch Rapp thriller from Flynn. I just wish someone would make a movie already.  If only the modern CIA is this bold.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|See title, just download it so I have yet to actually use the alarm, but the interface is very user friendly.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|It was extremly disjointed with way to many &#34;bits&#34; of scenes and no real insight into the character of Anna
142312166X|5.0|a surprise for my son who loves to read bc he is doing so much better in school and he LOVED it.
B00A32CKKI|4.0|I have used this film for years in my American Literature class as we study John Steinbeck. I love that I can now get in online instead of using a DVD.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|Rarely works.  I find the lack of favorites troubling.  I also can seem to only get the videos to play 1/10 times.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The actual story and mystery were not as entertaining or suspenseful as it could have been compared to other games that I have been exposed to. However, I did find that the object searches were much more challenging than the other games that I have played.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Fairly mindless vacation reading.  Not as good as Lincoln lawyer but entertaining.  Would recommend this book if you expect to be frequently interrupted and don't want to worry about losing your place.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Definitely impressive since my wife doesn't even like video games and she loved the movie.  It was a classic combination of clean comedy and a little bit of love.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Or Jason Bourne will hunt you down.  This is the three part trilogy and one of the best movie series I have ever seen.  Well worth watching and having on hand for family get togethers or holidays.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Life of Pi held up as the visually stunning movie the earned its director the Oscar. It's content however was not as strong as the book it was based off of.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I had no idea how funny this movie was going to be, and I loved the music.  Fat Amy made this!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was one of those items that Amazon suggested for me based on their analysis of big data, but I happy to say that it was a great surprise.  I was a little dubious at the end of the first section, however, it quickly turned into a book I didn't want to put down.  The timing and direction of the plot twists and surprised was superb and easily kept from being predictable as this genre can sometimes be. When I reached the end I was pleased with the adventure I had been on, satisfied with how things had ended, and eager to read more. I have already recommended this to a number of close friends.
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|As you should expect if you are looking into getting a controller for your phone, tablet or even computer, there are a limited number of games this actually works with.  Basically any game that lets you map out your keypad will work.  I mostly use mine for roms becuase i love old nintendo and sega games.  Awesome for that!  Yeah thats right, i get my mario kart on like its 1990!<br /><br />Works as expected....  very well with games that let you map the controller!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am completely in love with the series. I think it was very well put together. Only thing I wish was a little different was the ending, I wish they talked more about some the other characters. But all and all I would recommend to all of my friends.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I liked the twists and turns of this plot.  As usual, the bad guys got what they deserved in the end'
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like the first book, I really enjoyed it. I think this author is amazing and I plan on trying to get my friends to read the series.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was surprising for me, as I have not read nor heard anything about the book. I thought it would be more lighthearted but was not disappointed by my decision to rent.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all his books and this one is one of the best! I thought it was a great book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|awesome seeing the characters from the old video games. My kids love it. They wanted to watch it again, lol.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Compared to other Disney/Pixar offerings, this movie was dull.  We fast forwarded through most of it, hoping that it would improve.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is so intertaning and fun to play wen you ar siting in a car for a long time with a anoint brother or sister I garinty it will help you zone them out so give it a try.
B004T6OEHG|5.0|this was a gift,pretty cool c.d.,has some great extras.my husband was at the show featured on the live c.d.and he really loves it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed this very much. Beautiful setting. Terrific acting. Several story lines occurring  simultaneously keep it moving along nicely, without compromising character development. In season 2, the Great War drags on just a bit, but one gets through it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are good and the game does not lag. I approve. This game something  my daughter  loves to play. Love it!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Best movie we've seen in years!  The plot is so smart and the cinematography is mind blowing!  A must see!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game .Leps world is my favorite game to play.  This is the only game I love it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Powerful story and fantastic acting from a church that put itself on the map with these awesome movies!  Already watched it 6 times and about to go for number seven!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I find Suits a welcome combination of inoffensive yet not dull wit and light human drama, a bit of legal talk not so heavy as to matter whether it's really correct, 2.5-dimensional characters (so to speak), by which I am trying to say that the whole series is a light view that doesn't become shallow or boring and moves briskly enough with involving enough plot that I don't forget what happened in the previous episodes. It's a welcome diversion for me, and the protagonists are sympathetic without being sappy and have very good chemistry on the screen. A simple pleasure.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Great action packed movie about a wimpy kid and all his trials and tribulations. All that he endures due to problems with other classmates, the girl of his dreams, and especially all the torment from his older brother. And I mean Torment with a capital T. A must see for the entire family.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Around the World in 80 days is based on Jules Verne's classic story and is one of the best and most beautiful match 3 games. Backgrounds are gorgeous. The cut scenes have been greatly simplified from the PC version, no doubt to save space. Parts of items that need to be collected are found in the match 3 grids. The challenge to secure these parts increases as the game progresses. It is a good idea to build the power-ups as fast as possible by matching 4 or 5, especially in those grids where only power-ups can free the item parts. There are levels where it takes both strategy and luck to free the item parts. This is a really fun match 3 where even an average player like myself can finish the game, though it may take a few tries of some of the later levels.<br /><br />Because of one review, I want to mention that the game automatically saves, of course not in the middle of a play - I don't think any match 3 game does that.<br /><br />Around the World in 80 Days is a must have for any match 3 fans.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|well 1 i would recomend it to any one that likes adventures,2 the acting is good,3but leaves a hole in some areas,but otherwise it is good
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Ben Afflack should have received an Oscar for best director.  A best picture is that because of a good director. You  can't have one without the other.  Don't understand the judges for the Oscar.  Must be a money thing.  Anyway, congrats to Ben Afflack
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Innovative & creative movie making...good characters wonderful special effects & the kids liked it (alot)! Hugh jackman as the Easter bunny was their favorite and chris pine as jack frost was very close
B001G9F9IW|4.0|Not like I remember.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  If you're a fan of Scarlett, you'll love this flick.<br />People poo poo it for some of the dialogue and perhaps delivery thereof, but then they'll say that the<br />scenery and shooting is what one would expect.  That type of positive comment balances out the stuff<br />that they have to make up that's \\"bad\\" about the movie.  I don't quite get her affinity towards Woody Allen,<br />but that's just fine.  In this movie, she's the character that I think we all love her as.  The supporting cast<br />is extremely able and Penelope's character is scary and intense.  As the story really sets, the relationship<br />between these 4 is really unusual, but extremely Barcelona-esque?  It's a love story, and kind of a chick flick<br />but there's no sense in missing out on the scenery, either of surrounding landscape or the women themselves.<br />I don't know what keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but for the fact that it would become a Top 10 quality of movie<br />for me, and certainly there are very few that can do that.  I'll go with 4.85/5.  If for nothing else than<br />Scarlett's presence in the movie.  :  )
B009JBZH54|5.0|This pkg here was such a steal that I had to get it. I was already looking to get Batman Begins & The Dark Knight in blu-ray so this was a no brainer. Sound and picture quality are fantastic.
B0071FBARY|4.0|This is one of The Frey's newer albums which has the same great sound that they have had since their first album.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I totally enjoy Skyfall and I believe it is one of the best Bond movies that I have ever seen
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|First of all, this IS a wonderful app, and given the fact that it was free made it even more so. I am in middle of a very complex investigative writing project, the nature of which involves sorting through thousands of notes. This app seemed heaven sent because I could so easily create a notebook for each character, location ext. After using this app tor over a week,  I inadvertantly touched the &quot;select all&quot; function&quot;, then immediately touched it again,  and I just closed my eyes in dismay,  because I already knew what I had accidently done; lost an entire weeks worth of work, most of it unrecoverable. So beware. There are several apps on the market that have an undo function, so if your work is time critical, you might want to take this into consideration.
B009Y6X65C|5.0|I love it, great blues rock. Joe  is a great guitar player and is now the king.<br />If you like blues rock you cant go wrong,
B0063IH60K|5.0|If fireworks lighting up your screen accompanied by bells &amp; whistles whenever you win a hand is your kind of thing, then the odds are this isn't the solitaire game for you. On the other hand, if you have the time to spend playing a solid, dependable yet basic game like I do every now and then, then here you go.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book.  It wasn't steamy hot read.  But it was an intense love story.  It had a few OMG twists and turns.  And Holder is..wow.  This was a great great read.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Not too bad but I felt that it was a bit abrupt throughout the season. It did have some surprises that I enjoyed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a super legible and very easy tool to use!  I will definitely recommend  others use this product! SO GLAD IT WAS FREE!
1449410243|5.0|Another hit from the oatmeal!  I regularly let my guests read this book when they come over, and it is a definite hit with women (especially cat owners).<br />Tons of great humor and the wonderful satire I've come to expect from the oatmeal, definitely a must have!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a fantastic app.  I don't mind the ads at all.  There are enough sounds on the free app to layer to your heart's content.
0449013634|5.0|Mr. Sachs brings Harry Hole to life - he does a masterful presentation of the written word, especially here with The Phantom.  I strongly recommend getting the audiobook (though I found myself wanting to go back and reread the more poignant passages), simply because Robin Sachs' performance adds so much more to the story.  He's done a great job with all of the Harry Hole novels he's read, but IMO, The Phantom is his best work to date.
B004ZIAB2A|3.0|Tedious - kept waiting for the story to pick up and it never did.  The tantalising mystery got squashed under multiple perspectives and re-telling of the same story which wasnt enough of a tale to justify my time reading it.
1885167776|5.0|This COULD BE a book touting another system, focus on business, surrender to your top ten. great Sculptors carve away the inefficient, this book does the same.<br /><br />Keller's pragmatic peeling of the onion, using empirical proof and anecdotes, walks curious readers through to the end epiphany that, yeah.... You need discipline. Yeah, get to work early, yet here's why.<br /><br />And here are your pitfalls.<br /><br />Loved it, dog eared it, and lend it to friends with a highlighter. They always bring it back two days later, with their own copy already in hand.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Life of PI was definitely a big surprise every minute of the movie.  I enjoyed it very much and watched it more than once, which is unusual for me.  The acting and the animal effects were awesome and even though I knew it was CGI to begin with, I forgot I was watching CGI because it was so seamlessly sown into the live footage.<br /><br />This is a DEFINITE must see family picture.
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|Tim Burton has made some great films in the past 25 years. Movies like Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman returns, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy hollow, and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure helped establish him as an A-list director with a trademark vision. His films are characterized by a unique creative vision. Fans the world over have fallen in love with the dark style of Tim Burton, and I believe Sleepy Hollow showcases that vision better than most of his other films.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a re-telling of the classic American short-story written by Washington Irving.<br />Johnny Depp plays ichabod Crane, a flawed and eccentric detective who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a bizarre series of murders involving decapitation.<br /><br />While investigating, the villagers tell Ichabod stories of a headless horseman, who they suspect is the culprit behind the beheadings. Ichabod doesn't believe them at first, but it all changes when he comes face to face with the horseman himself. Together with a small orphan and a love interest played by Christina Ricci, Ichabod faces an adventure chock full of lives lost and secrets revealed.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is incredible in this film, portaying the character of Ichabod Crane with genuine realness and outstanding authenticity. Ichabod is tragically flawed, allowing his nervousness and fear to interfere with his duties as a detective. This behavior causes Ichabod to faint several times in the film, leading to many comical moments, such as a particularly funny scene in the bedroom. Ichabod continues Tim Burton's tradition of having the main character in his films be a misunderstood outcast from society.<br /><br />The spectacular visual appeal of this film is more than enough to dictate atleast one viewing. Tim Burrton's unique vision produces a dark and atmospheric environment in the film, perfectly representing the dark mood of the plot. The environment is so important to the movie that Burton demanded that the entire town and forrest be built onto a soundstage, so he could control every aspect of the environment.<br /><br />All the extra effort was definently worth while, because Sleepy Hollow is a very beautiful movie, and the best representation of Burton's unique vision since Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />Another great aspect of the film are the great costumes and character designs. The characters wear authentic clothing from the era, with everybody wearing a very interesting wardrobe. The most interesting character design is the headless horseman. Back when I saw this movie in the theatres back in 1999, I thought the horseman was the definition of coolness, with his black armor and black horse. Even ten years later I still think he's completely badass. His design is just so cool, and the fact that he's played by Christopher Walken makes him even cooler.<br /><br />Overall, Sleepy Hollow is a great, atmospheric film with interesting characters and an engaging plot. This isn't my favorite Burton film, but it's definently one of his best.that the entire town and forrest be built onto a soundstage, so he could control every aspect of the environment.<br /><br />All the extra effort was definently worth while, because Sleepy Hollow is a very beautiful movie, and the best representation of Burton's unique vision since Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />Another great aspect of the film are the great costumes and character designs.

B00947N6UG|5.0|I'd wanted to see this movie from early reviews.  My fiance and child had not really heard of it.  I found one of the later trailers and showed my fiance and she was interested.  We went and saw the movie and it was SO much more than either of us had expected.  My 8 year old daughter loved it as well.  We got home, and pre-ordered it that night.
B000002KDO|5.0|Sometimes the formation of a band can be compared to the aligning of the stars in heaven. When the members of Black Sabbath came together, it was the beginning of musical history. With their combined musical and songwriting talents, Bill Ward, Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, and Geezer Butler created deep and powerful music that broke new boundaries in terms of musicianship and song-writing, helping open the musical spectrum to a new level of heaviness.<br /><br />After the success of their first two albums Black Sabbath and Paranoid, the band came back stronger than ever with Master of Reality, an album brimming with classic songs from front to back. There is one heavy riff after another on this record, each one as memorable as the last. Looking at the track listing one can easily recognize many of Sabbath's most well known tunes such as Children of the Grave, Into the Void, and Sweet Leaf. This is an essential addition to any heavy metal fan's music library.<br /><br />In the early 70's Black Sabbath were at their prime in terms of musicianship and chemistry as a band. Bill Ward is one hell of a heavy and powerful drummer with an incredible feel as jazzy as it is driving. The riffmaster Tony Iommi is at his best here, especially on the masterful track Lord of this World. Ozzy Osbourne is obviously a legend with a highly distinguishable voice that gives the songs a lot of energy and personality.<br /><br />Master of Reality is one of the greatest rock albums to come out of the 70's. It features some of the greatest performances ever captured on tape, and listening to it provides an experience like no other. Black Sabbath are legends for a reason, and its because of albums like this. Get it already!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I really liked the game. I showed it to my brother and now he is terrified by slender Man. I really think all of you should get this!!

B004JRVQX0|1.0|Okay, so I finally got an apple computer so I could use all the apple software required for projects as a communications major at school, but $200 ProTools requires an iLok to run so I buy one for close to $50. My computer is not even registering that it is plugged in., when I try to run ProTools!

B00845PRDS|5.0|Heroes like these, rough, highly trained and vicious men, are the reason that people like you and I can sleep soundly in our beds at night

B004D1CK32|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  Pretty old, and tricky to follow subtitles and the many characters, but this is an awesome classic movie.
0345529057|5.0|The books are amazing.  These were the cheapest I could find online, and for the price, they are completely worth it.
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|Before all the how can you review something that is not even released yet bashing begins, let me first off say I watched the 3 hour documentary twice.  While all the live footage and classic era interviews are golden, the 1977 Hotel California concert footage is definitely the cream de la creme.  Secondly, the press release for this has been released.  Everything you saw in the 3 hours will be released with no additional bonus documentatry footage.  Also about 8 tracks from the 1977 concert will be released as a dvd part of this package.  Why not just release the whole darn concert?  I've got a boot of one of the shows filmed during the tour, but the concert footage show in the documenatary is definitely master film...so why not just release the entire concert????  Why only pieces of a show??? It's 2013...why not give the fans the real deal...
B000FBJAOG|5.0|It's very entertaining and logical. Great read if you need something to do between work or class. It's pretty good
1419705849|5.0|Compared to the other books, my 8-year-old liked it as much as the other books.  The author consistently gives this age group what they want.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I Love this movie! I can watch it 50 times...its a wonderful make on the fairytale we all grew up watching
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|It was a little dark and boring at first but the end really made it worth while! We ordered from amazon and the quality wasn't great.
B00BVYQ832|5.0|Love every episode and can't wait for the next!!!!!!  This series doesn't get redundant like most.  There is always something new. Story line is great!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I adored this book. Cheryl's story would be inspiring to anyone who read it. The honesty of Strayed's writing is engaging and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed accompanying Cheryl on her journey to both discover and forgive herself. You won't want to put this book down until you find out what happens to Cheryl!
0375842209|3.0|I'm a 30-year-old female - too old to be a young adult. This book was recommended by my adult book club, some of whom, enjoy young adult fiction. While I have enjoyed some young adult books, this was not one of them. I didn't enjoy the first 1/4 of the book. I was slightly confused with characters but assumed that it would be sorted out after a while. It was. But something about the style of writing wasn't my favourite. Then the middle portion of the book, I thoroughly enjoyed. Loved, in fact. I was attached to the main character, her father and her friend. Really enjoyed it! But after completing the book, I wasn't in love any longer. And it didn't have to to with what happened in the story - that was fine. But something about the book was just not my favourite. I read the book quickly and was interested to learn about life for a German during WWII where most books are about Jews or Brits. Great new perspective, but it felt young adult and so it was. If you are between the ages of 14 and 17, you'll probably love it. Older... probably not.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|The book seemed slow during the first third or half but got better once the adventures began. I gave it 3 stars because it is definitely worth reading, even though it isn't captivating throughout.
B008JFUNQO|5.0|always loved Dreamworks CGI movies and this is no exception, far better movie then what i was expecting and hoping when released on blu ray there no doubt be a gr8 transfer on to this format, i thought the 3D was really good in this movie, some funny parts and heart warming parts, will not give nothing away just go and see it for yourself !  carl
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Great read! Very witty, not what I was expecting-much better! I really enjoyed this book. Fiction with factual timelines, clever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|LOVED this book! I didn't really know how I felt about it at first because of the letter format but then I absolutely fell in love with every single character and eventually  the format as well! Amazing book.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is our second time buying this product as the first one got moldy from some spilled milk we didn't realize had spilled.  It's very sturdy and fits on our City Mini stroller perfectly while being less than half the cost of the Baby Jogger Parent Console.  However, it cannot be washed in the washing machine (gentle cycle) which we learned the hard way with our first one.  The metal support around the top cracked and popped through the canvas.
0553386794|5.0|I was introduced to this series by the HBO series based on the books.  I honestly never would have picked up this book if it hadn't been for the HBO series.  Fantasy is just not one of my usual genres.<br /><br />I did enjoy Game of Thrones and mostly enjoyed Martin's writing, although at times, it did seem a bit simplistic.  It is hard for me to truly judge the book because it ties so closely with the t.v. series.  They really did an incredible job at converting the book to screen.  Maybe even too good of a job.  It actually too me a while to get through the 800 pages of Game of Thrones.  I think this is because having seen the book brought to life on the television screen, there were no surprises for me.  But, that  doesn't mean that anyone who is a fan of the show should avoid books...quite the contrary.  I think the two make excellent companions.<br /><br />Even if you think you don't like fantasy, I would definitely suggest giving George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones a try....
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Gems are to hard to get and it takes to long to get coins<br />But over all the game is ok
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This novel involves multiple themes including class differences, ethical issues around the right to die, physical and attitudinal barriers encountered by disabled people.  As someone with an acquired disability, I found this book painful at times.  I felt the author had a deep understanding of the impact of a severe disability on the individual as well as those close to the &#34;victim.&#34;  Yet all is not gloom and doom.  It is a love story after all.  The growing attraction between the two is believable with moments of tenderness and fun.<br />My one quibble is the author's tendency to change the point of view from time to time.  It did not add to the novel's development.  Would have been better to stay with the same narrator.  Other than that, good job with a difficult subject.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game, interesting rooms, but the energy usesup too fast. I wish u could replace your coins for diamonds. Overall very interesting
B000AJIF4E|2.0|Had not used these headphones much (about five times) before one of the cushions/ear pads came off. These are not one of my main pairs of headphones that I use, as the cord is way too long to do some things with, so I was very surprised and disappointed when they broke. The sound is ok, not as good as I thought they would be, but they were comfortable for use at home so I had kept them. With so many options out there I think for the price you can do better.
B0064W652A|4.0|Amazing! Fantastic work. My only complaint is that you cannot read some of the am small print because there is no way to get a better look at the cell.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I first started to read this because of the movie hype, and I'm SO happy I read the novel first. I'll admit, some parts are a bit slow but overall I see [and enjoy] what the author tried to resonate here.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game, just wish you didn't need to post to Facebook to earn some bonuses. Otherwise it's fun, addicting and time consuming.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun to play, just like Call of Atlantis, which I play on a continuous loop. Adventure style match-3 game that progressively gets more challenging, but is still easy. Fun way to pass the time, short enough levels to finish in minutes. Colorful graphics and characters add to the experience. Great for all ages.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Amazing . I wasn't as fond of the end though. It felt too rushed, as if it ended because  it had to not because  it was able to.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three was amazing. I thought I was hooked before but season three was so much better than the other two. I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, can't wait to start the next one in the trilogy. Loved the suspense and the characters
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie had something for everyone! We enjoyed the fun characters, video game references, and clever jokes (for example, that they got stuck in &#34;Nesquik-sand&#34;). Well done movie that is worth buying.
B007712XAU|5.0|Loved it!  Hated for it to end!  Loved Season III too.  It is the most wonderful show that has been shown it years.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My grandchildren have a lot of fun playing temple run and they wanted me to get temple run 2 for them. I don't play it much, but have fun watching them.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|excellent movie, good guideline, good graphics and good histories<br />Effect 3d, very good. A my family them like much<br />100% advisable
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great story and keeps you interested.  As always Denzel is excellent.  Great lesson learning ending.  Would love to see it again.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|When an artist re-records a song you have listened to and loved for years most of the time it is a dissapointment. For instance my favorite song from the CD The View From The Hill was Broken Dream. The version on this new CD he replaces the acoustic guitar with a guitar that has a country twang like a steel guitar and replaced the synthesizer/mellotron with strings. HATED IT. Then he goes and does a version of the Moody Blues I Know You're Out There Somewhere that makes it sound like something that should have been done by that old group The Art Of Noise. I will listen to the CD again and see if the other songs make up for these catastrophies and post an update
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Watched it when it was new and love watching it over and over.  The second season is really the beginning of the end!
B00A18KCSQ|4.0|Foals, hailing from Oxford, England, rose to prominence pretty much out of nowhere with their excellent 2008 debut album \\"Antitodes\\". Their second album, 2010's \\"Total Life Forever\\", was not nearly as good (the dreaded sophomore slump). Now comes the band's highly anticipated third album.<br /><br />\\"Holy Fire\\" (11 tracks; 50 min.) starts off very strongly with several can't miss, lights-out tracks. There is the 4 min. instrumental opener, simply called \\"Prelude\\" but it doesn't feel like a prelude at all, as it immediately throws you seemingly deep into the album. It is followed by \\"Inhaler\\" (1st UK single), in which the band's arena-sized ambitions are clear as the song just sounds massive. That in turn is followed by \\"My Number\\" (2nd UK single), which is my favorite track on this album and has what I would call the 'classic' Foals sounds, reminiscent of \\"Antidotes\\". \\"My Number\\" is where Talking Heads-meets-Cut Copy, just outstanding. These first three tracks alone are worth buying the album for. But there is a lot more of course. With \\"Bad Habbits\\", the high energy continues, even if not as urgently as before. Things slow down considerably on the last song of Side A, \\"Late Night\\", the Foals equivalent of a ballad. Side B of this album rekindles the fire from the very beginning of the album, with \\"Out of the Woods\\", another highlight of the album, which is then followed by the high-charging \\"Milk and Black Spiders\\" and \\"Providence\\".<br /><br />In all, this is quite the album! It's hard to find any gaping holes in it, and this is one of the best album of this young 2013 for me, and sure to end up on my \\"best of\\" albums of the year list at the end of 2013. I saw Foals live at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver in September, 2008, when they were touring in support of \\"Antidotes\\", and they simply blew me away. They are coming to Cincinnati soon in support of \\"Holy Fire\\" and you can bet your last dollar I will be front and center for that. \\"Holy Fire\\" is a most welcome return to form for Foals, and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />UPDATE (May, 2013) I saw Foals at Bogart's here in Cincinnati, a small venue, and what a show that was! Playing many of the new tracks with of course some nuggest from the first 2 albums, Foals just BROUGHT it, and the place was jumping on many of their songs. Great, great set. Thank you, guys! Can't wait to see you in concert again!ome return to form for Foals, and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />UPDATE (May, 2013) I saw Foals at Bogart's here in Cincinnati, a small venue, and what a show that was!

B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all of the Harry Bosch books - great fun attempting to figure out where Harry is going with his murder plots.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Django brings a different language to a story we have heard a million times before. Quentin Tarantino is brilliant in his ability to bring humor and clarity to a serious and dramatic story. Quentin's rendition of history makes it relatable to all audiences and not only African Americans.<br /><br />The leading role is played by Jamie Foxx who is in search of his wife who has been sold by a slave master. He begins this journey with this corky doctor who is also a bounty hunter. The doctor makes him a deal of helping to find his wife if he will work with him. While on this journey they encounter some major slave traders who also have his wife held captive. Django must come up with a plan that will save the woman he loves but also helps him to get out freely as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie for the most part. There are some scenes that are overly dramatic and the language is rather vulgar. If you are familiar with Tarantino's style then he is at his rarest form. I will say this is one of those movies you will either hate it or love it. Very entertaining from beginning to end. Several fight scenes throughout the movie. This movie is for adult eyes only.
1568363931|5.0|I recently purchased a bento ([[ASIN:B000246GSE Zojirushi SL-JAE14 Mr. Bento Stainless Steel Lunch Jar, Silver]]) and my search for easy to make and healthy recipes brought me to this book. At first glance it is a little intimidating but once you read it, you realize that it is very easy and uses a wide range of ingredients backed with great instructions to help you. It also offers great time lines so you know what you need to make in order to save you a lot of time.<br /><br />What this book is:<br />It is a great recipe book that focuses on the food and offers useful tips on fresh items as well as leftovers as bento fare. It also includes a lit of foods that should not be included in the bento as well as ideas for which bento would be right for you (all of which are available on Amazon). The author uses a mix of Asian and American ingredients to make the recipes included. The book also offers substitutes should some of the ingredients used prove impossible to find in your area.<br /><br />Beautiful photos and instructions on how to pack each bento are included so you don't have to panic to make everything fit in your bento. I've found all the recipes easy to follow and not that intimidating.<br /><br />The website addresses included inside the book lead to very helpful sites geared towards bento enthusiasts and have given me many great ideas on new foods to try for my bento.<br /><br />What this book isn't:<br />This book is not geared to making cute character bento that are famous overseas. While a few ideas are given on how to use color and simple shapes to make the meal look better, this book focuses more on the food and preparation and less on the looks.<br /><br />Some of the ingredients may prove a little hard to find but one of the ideas behind the use of bento is improvisation. I've been able to find most of the ingredients used in this book at the grocery store as well as health food stores.<br /><br />Note: Most, if not all of the ingredients are available on Amazon at very good prices.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I would highly suggest this book to anyone who is getting into the idea of using a bento and looking for great meal ideas. My family quickly adopted the bento and has enjoyed may great foods from this book.le on Amazon at very good prices.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I would highly suggest this book to anyone who is getting into the idea of using a bento and looking for great meal ideas.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is absolutely fabulous! The scenes are remarkable and the location is beautiful. Even after 50 years the action is great and the story is entertaining from beginning to end. Adele's opening song \\"Skyfall\\" really sets the tone for the entire movie. Her voice is perfect for the elegance and sophistication shown throughout the movie.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a mission and James Bond is shot. Afterwards, he disappears untraceable until the agency is under attack. Not sure who their enemies are, they cannot trust anyone until they find who is responsible for killing the other agents. Bond does what he does best and tracks down the man responsible for tearing down the agency. Bond ends up having to save the very person who may have been responsible for his misfortunes.<br /><br />Action packed thriller from beginning to end! The movie keeps you going the moment it starts.
B002A9VJ40|1.0|This movie is dumb, even for an 80's movie, tom cruise blows, I got maybe 10 minutes in before it was off and I was watching something else, lol
B005LAIIQC|3.0|After being a fan of all the other Bourne movies I was left greatly disappointed. Bourne Legacy lacks the fighting and critical thinking skills of the previous movies. For most of the movie I was bored and waiting for the action to start. By the time the movie picked up it was basically over. Towards the end of the movie when he was in action his skills were greatly crafted.<br /><br />They are using experimental drugs on the patients and they become dependent upon those drugs. When they do not have those drugs in their system the affects can be life threatening. Things turn around when the hunter becomes the hunted.<br /><br />I was expecting more action as we have seen previously but they really missed the mark on this one.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|A VERY NICE AND FUNNY MOVIE. KIDS WILL ALWAYS BE KIDS. THERE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THIS MOVIE. GREAT ACQUISITION
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good book. Can't wait to read book 3. The twist at the end I didn't see coming at all
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|Just wanted to say that if you are a sci-fi fan and enjoy outstanding visuals, like me, you must see this.<br />They probably got the visuals concept from \\"Inception\\" but actually used them in the plot instead of just for show (not that I didn't like Inception - I did).<br />For me - and I guess I can say I've probably seen it all - this is the most artistic outstandng visual movie I've seen in, say, the last 2 years or so.<br />It has got an interesting uplifting love story with a rather uncommon arc that might keep you guessing until the very end.<br />Get ready for something... different.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|Sorry can't really say how it was.<br />Didn't get to play it at all. Couldn't download it at all.<br />But get it and try it out. I wish I could have.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Excellent film.  Very well done.  Ben Affleck is doing such a great job in his career.  I look forward to more from him in the years to come.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game<br />I gave it this rating because its fun to play and I like the way it is set up
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this!!!!! it is hilarious and i would totally recommend it to teenagers and young adults (20 yrs-35 yrs)
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I definitely recommend it. I charged it once, then charged my iPhone 5 five times and it still showed 3 out of 4 lights. Love it.
B0053O89WY|1.0|We all get it. After so many years of the \\"nerds\\" being wedgied, dunked in toilets, mugged for lunch money and overlooked by the hot girls in favor of the muscleheads and drug dealers, The Big Bang Theory finally poo-poos in the face of all of that and shows us that, \\"hey!,\\" these brainiacs deserve a second chance to find sweet love, all while saying things that no one would ever say in ways that no one would ever speak.<br /><br />This is, apparently, one of the most popular shows on major network television, and that alone should be telling of the fact that it aims real high for the lowest common denominator. Not a single character is likeable, the formulaic blueprint couldn't be any more appalling, and I'm pretty sure that the creator is the same creep who made the wafer-thin Two & A Half Men. Basically, that means \\"skip the hell out of this.\\"<br /><br />And then here, we have the complete fifth season. So, if you didn't blow your brains out after the first four, the Bazinga crew have been gracious enough to offer the viewer another chance.<br /><br />Buy this if you want to lose friends or think that your 18 daily hours of level-grinding on World of Warcraft is a worthwhile endeavor. If your situation deviates in any way, just cultivate a personality and spend the cash you would've spent on this on a package of condoms, a bottle of cheap booze with a mixer, and some GHB instead. Honestly, going to prison for rape is better than watching this show. Scout's honor.<br /><br />5th Season, just like all the others: .5/5 stars. Treat yourself with dignity and buy top-of-the-line ingredients to make yourself an amazing dinner.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|The concept of this album is genius, and the arrangements are first rate.  I put them in a playlist with actual jazz age recordings by artists like Louis Armstrong and they blended perfectly, except that your mind asks&#34;Hey, isn;t that the melody to an 80's song?&#34; Highly recommended.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think this movie did a great job of carrying on the Bond tradition.  I've always been a Bond fan and this goes on my favorites list for sure.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love having both Blu-Ray and DVD in the same box!  Best of both worlds.  Daniel Craig is great as always!
B004SUDPWI|4.0|One of my all time favorites.  Just had to add it to my collection.  It's great even though it's rather sad.
0307361012|4.0|Quite good for his first novel.Joe is quite a talent.On essentially same level as Michael  Connelly..cannot make up my mind as to who is better!!!
B007REV4YI|4.0|The usual Bond fare - plenty of action, just what the fans expect.  I still would like to know how Bond escaped drowning !!
B00AIZ276M|4.0|I was 18 when Nola came out.  I bought it, sold it.  Back then I was into all the other member's bands, the pre-requisite Sabbath fan, etc., etc.  But something about it didn't click.  'Bustle...' came out. Hated it.  'Over the Under' came out.  Loved it.  Couldn't get enough of it.  The 'Purple EP' is definitely more in that same vein, with dark, cultish lyrical undertones, a killer album cover, and awesome grooves.  I look forward to Part II.

B004JZBGWI|3.0|I loved the \\"sticky\\" notepad app I had on my Droid RAZR before the recent software upgrade removed it and other apps I liked. I haven't been able to find the exact same apps I was familiar with, so I had to settle for a different app to keep my reminders on the home screen. ColorNote was the closest I could find to what I had, but I'm still trying to determine if I can tweak the settings to make it do what I liked in the other app I had before the \\"update\\" made me hate my stupid \\"smart\\" phone more than usual, again.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I enjoyed the hidden objects, the graphics and some of the puzzles.  The story line was not of much interest to me because the game is what intrigues me.  That being said I found many of the puzzles difficult to maneuver which spoiled some of my interest in playing.  Found myself using the skip button frequently just so I could move on.  Since puzzles are a big part of hidden object games I am giving this a the star rating.
B008VBYN80|5.0|favorite game so far. I like the battling with friends I don't like that u need wifi.but else its a really good game
B000065K5S|5.0|I live in Northampton, MA where part of this movie was filmed. The story line to this movie, scenery & old \\"main\\" really make this movie remarkable. The fact is there are orphans today as we write our reviews. Sad but true. In West Springfield, MA there is Brightside an orphange that every year the bikers do a run in October to give money, gift cards & more to these orphans. This movie is a 10 in my personal opinion. It's moving, compassionate, heartfelt & more.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Sound City is an insightful documentary for rock music fans, musicians, analog recording enthusiasts, audiophiles and human beings. The rise, fall and re-birth of the Sound City recording studio is a terrific story by itself, but there are many other amazing story lines seamlessly interspersed throughout this film. The artists, the Neve console, acoustics, creativity, economics, and competition from digital formats are all explored. Very well done and by far the most exciting 'documentary' I have ever seen.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is the best game for kids and older people it is a good game because there is no blood and gory they could also improve their creativity skills. =D
B00064WSN2|4.0|First, I am a huge fan of this band--all of its incarnations. I own remastered versions of the [[ASIN:B002LLE3Q8 In the Court of the Crimson King (2 CD expanded set)]], [[ASIN:B00920QMLA Larks' Tongues in Aspic, 40th Anniversary Edition]], [[ASIN:B00064WSNM Starless and Bible Black - 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]], and [[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]], along with a disc of [[ASIN:B00064WSOQ Power to Believe]]. I own Discipline on the original vinyl and Beat in digital form. Because I have most of their best work, as well as AllMusic's overwhelmingly positive review (4.5 stars--implying near \\"classic\\" status), I thought I should get this second album. I remembered the work fondly from when it first came out, when I had a cassette version (yes, I am that old). Nostalgia aside, Poseidon is a second-tier album that suffers from the band's turmoil at the time. I'm not sorry that I own it, but I would not encourage anyone else to buy it unless one is a King Crimson fanatic.
B005C5QS9A|5.0|When I am stuck planning a class this book always gets me started. Great tool for teachers. Well written and nice description.

B002ITWSUQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!!! This movie is worth watching! It surprises me how few people has seen it.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Too bad they didn't make season 4!  I didn't know about Veronica Mars until I heard about the whole Kickstarters crowd-funding that it is going on right now.  I'm a person that hates watching old shows but it kept me going for all 3 seasons!  Too bad the awful Pussycat doll show and WB destroyed it!  Can't wait for the new movie coming up!  Highly recommended it!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is the best book I ever read on Muscle building. You will learn many basics about diet and  workout for optimal results. I would recommend this book to everyone who would like to gain weight or lost weight or just started working out or have been working for long time.  I wasted so much money on personal training before reading this book. After reading this book, I feel I no longer needed a physical trainer. This book is for every one who cares about them selves.
B00417HV14|4.0|though i like the earlier 3 piece band and the more basic/raw music.... this live performance is stellar.  i especially enjoyed the clapton tune.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|For someone that grew up playing arcade games in the 80's this was a great nostalgic movie. I really liked how they were able to capture the essence of the 8 bit games and they had a good story line. I hope they come out with more movies.

0307949486|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best things I've read in the last decade. The character of Lisbeth Salander steals the series -- she is one of the greatest literary characters of all time, as far as I'm concerned. I read the series twice, the second time very slowly, and kept stopping and asking myself why I loved it so much. The answer? I cared so much about Lisbeth Salander, and watched her develop from an abused woman to a warrior!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works great and the price was good.  It charges very quickly.  I would recommend it to anyone needing a charger.

0307352153|5.0|This is a relatively short and easy to read book, very well written, on a complex topic. The author, a lawyer by training and a self-described introvert, has a deep and valuable perspective on the topic. True to the style of an introvert, her writing respects the complexity of the topic and how different each of us is, from everyone else. The book explores the unique characteristics of introverts, which affect how we learn, how we relate to other people, how we solve problems, and how we lead.<br /><br />I really like the discussion of how introverts process information, how we mostly are as social as anyone else, but prefer one-on-one, in-depth interactions. There are great examples of how successful professionals such as lawyers, consultants, and salespeople use methods of pseudo-extroversion to function well in jobs where extroverted behavior is expected. Introversion is often an advantage in these sorts of jobs since introverts are inclined toward intense listening. Paradoxically, that makes introverts good negotiators.<br /><br />The book also has insightful sections on cultural influences, on getting the most out of introverted subordinates, on mixed marriages, and on parenting. I found that it was really easy to relate the material to my real-life experiences. Really a valuable book.

0811875040|2.0|I've been wanting to buy this book for a while because it is beautifully done with pretty pictures and tempting recipes. However, reviews for the book revealed many errors on the recipes so I held off purchasing it. Two weeks ago, I came across the book at Barnes and Noble and before buying the book, I went back to Amazon to quickly read through the latest reviews. The reviews were better - stating that the book has been revised for a fourth edition and professional \\"proof-read\\" for errors. I bought the book and couldn't wait to try the recipes.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried were the chocolate fleur de sel caramels. I read the recipe before I got cooking and was concerned that the temperature for the chocolate caramels was only 230 instead of the 246 that was indicated for the regular fleur de sel. But trusting that the recipe was correct and indeed proof-read, I followed the directions and took it off the heat at 230. Needless to say, the caramels did not set even after 5 hours in the refrigerator. So in order to salvage the caramels (along with the expensive callebaut chocolate that I put in it), I decided to melt the caramels again and reboil it to this time, 248 degrees. That did the trick.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried were the creme fraiche scones. Again, reading through the recipe, it looked like too much flour in proportion to the wet ingredients. But I followed the recipe again and again, the recipe flopped. The dough (if you can even call it that) was too crumbly, too powdery, and when set in an 8x8 pan and frozen, I still could not get the squares out without the dough crumbling and falling apart. I had to defrost it, put it back in the mixer and mix it again adding the rest of the creme fraiche (about an additional 1/2 cup) plus about 1/2 cup of cream until the dough was pliable and I was able to shape it into a flat mound and cut into eighths like a regular scone.<br /><br />So with all this pointed out, I am afraid to try yet ANOTHER recipe only for it to fail completely. I was going to try to make the tomboy cake but am afraid that the recipe will disappoint me again.<br /><br />Can someone please tell me how I can check if my book is the most current edition? I emailed the email given by the Miette website for any concerns related to the book over a week ago and have not gotten a response.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I heard lots of praise about this book, so I immediately bought it and started reading. I became quickly engrossed with it and simply could not stop reading. The characters are very well developed and the story is fast paced. I've read some reviews in which the readers found the ending disappointing, I did not. To me it seemed as a natural and logical conclusion that in the end the main characters were so entangled in their dysfunctional and highly toxic relationship (full of fear, distrust and hatred, but also ironically sincerity, because at last they have come to know and acknowledge the other one in the full dimension of their twisted selves) that they were completely trapped in it.
B007QUUIEA|4.0|Not the most original story line in the world however if you are after an easy read then this book is great!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This book is OK, but not as good as the first two. It gets boring from time to time and very predictable.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|Loved this book as Im a big fan of Rafa and this book showed what true dedication and ambition can achieve.
B007SGM084|4.0|I wish that the characters wouldn't have repeated some of the same lines over and over, other than that I enjoyed being lost in these books.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Definitely a perfect end to the trilogy and they saved the best book to last. Great read!! Well worth 5 stars.
B002RVCD6O|2.0|The movie is great, but the streaming quality was terrible and it wasn't my device.  The movie kept having to reload and sometimes the color was off.  This was not happening with Netflix, just Amazon.  Also, this hasn't been the first time I've been disappointed with Amazon's streaming quality.  Boo!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Music was excellent and was an upbeat movie. My husband and I were both surprised we enjoyed it so much.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Similar to angry birds but different enough to make it interesting.the graphics are very clear and vivid in color. Fun to play.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book reminded a little of Barbara Vine's work. A psychological thriller that leaves you really wondering about human nature. While the central protagonist, Amy, can seem a little far-fetched on occasions the author manages to make her, and her relationship with Nick, quite understandable some-how. Through out the book it was easy for the reader to understand the nature of their relationship despite the extraordinary circumstances.<br />The author changes voice effortlessly, skipping from Amy to Nick and back again with clever cross references and enough mismatches to get the reader asking questions before they are answered.<br />I think this is a brilliant piece of writing and thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.

B005S9EKCW|4.0|This was my favorite show on Broadway.  If you expect a normal movie, some are going to be disappointed.  The dialogue is all sung with reoccurring musical themes.  But most of the songs are beautiful. The only part that fell short was first of all, Crowe singing the part of Javert.  Javert has two powerful songs that usually garners standing ovations.  Crowe's voice could not handle them and he gave the impression he wished he wasn't there.  Sad when there were so many Broadway singers that do that part so well.  This is a piece of history with the plot kind of squished together so you get the feel of the era and the injustice of it all.  It moves toward quite an emotional ending.  However the ending was not as powerful as it should have been because I think the directors were afraid of backlash from non-religious people.  They dumbed down the ending and therefore dumbed down the hope that you were supposed to be left with.  Anyone who caters to the politically correct instead of what was written is bound to have problems making it flow. You should see this either on Broadway (get good seats).  Or see the 25th Anniversary DVD concert they did in England.  There was enough acting with the songs and movement you will know what was going on and you can see the intended ending.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Seems like a good cord, works fine. Arrived fairly quickly and was inexpensive, overall seems like a good buy to me
030758836X|5.0|This is a wonderful, inventive story about the heady beginning of a relationship and the progressive decline of the ensuing marriage. Nick and Amy are complicated and often twisted characters who are well-suited to Flynn's descriptive writing. The plot turns are gripping, and although the characters are not always likeable, they are always compelling and entirely unique. I loved the sheer creativity of the story, and though the ending is not neatly wrapped up, I wasn't disappointed and couldn't picture the book having a different ending. The cast of supporting characters, especially Nick's sister Go, are equally interesting. Flynn is a wonderful writer in a league of her own.

B002PEP4U0|5.0|School fees in many countries in Africa are substantial and beyond reach for many childern whose parents are poor. William Kamkwamba had limited schooling but he harboured the seeds of genius. With plans from a borrowed library book and scrap from the village junk pile he fabricated a crude generator and suppiled his parents' humble home with electricity. Luckily, his project was noticed by those in a postion to sponsor his higher education so his immense talent was not wasted. This is his remarkable story - an amazing account.

0553801473|1.0|I have never read any book that danced around the plot the way this author has.  There is absolutely no redeeming value to any character in these books.  I don't think he will ever get to the end.  There was something new and exciting in this world--a huge threat and a great menace.  But he has wasted such time in giving every single person in the entire world a POV, that I cannot in good conscience read another sentence.  I am disgusted by the characters in these books.  They seem to have no PURPOSE.  Give them a PURPOSE, man!<br /><br />cat

B00683JK9K|5.0|My wife and I both love this series.  This is the first Magic Puzzles I bought.  I then bought Ships.  It was just as good.  THe I finally got one with out the colon (:) and it now has about twenty puzzle sets in it.<br />Season and Ships both have click to place with out dragging.  This is a great feature.<br />One thing I wish is that XIMAD would change is the background of both the puzzle and the unplaced pieces.  Very dark area and pieces are hard to see.  My suggestion is red and white diagonal stripes.<br /><br />My wife and I play them every day. and I don't mind doing them over.
B009E3EYS8|4.0|There is no doubt that the time capsule captured here is priceless. The playing was phenomenal. The glances and smiles between the band spoke volumes. Jason delivered as only he could, and his dad definitely channeled through him. Led Zeppelin in a live setting could be hit or miss. Not because they couldn't do their job. But because they were always going for it. And sometimes when you're just cutting loose without a net you fall short. Thats what made Zeppelin exciting. You never knew where they would take things on stage. But here you can tell they rehearsed to point of finding what could work, and what risks NOT to take. They chose to take the path of showing a respect to the music they made and equally showing respect to each others contributions. And really treating this as the last time this will ever happen. Led Zeppelin has always fallen just short of the goal in documenting what they really were live.<br /><br />I think here they have done quite a good job. They delivered the goods I think better than anyone expected. There was no over indulgence. There was no filler. It was a well thought out set that must have taken forever for the four of them to all agree on. They did a nice balance of taking themselves and the fans into account. It was a planned assault by a band that once ruled the world. And they proved that if they wanted to they could do it again.<br /><br />Now here's where I feel this production falls short.... Obviously as many have stated, the editing is just dizzying. No camera shot lasts for more than two seconds it seems. I find myself with a headache trying to absorb what I can in the fast paced camera cuts. Its not so much a concert experience that your getting as much as it is a music video experience. And so many opportunities are missed. Things like focusing on the neck of the bass guitar while jason is in the midst of recreating his dads signature drum fills. Or focusing on Jimmy or Robert when John Paul is tearing it up with an incredible bass run. It just smacks of someone not knowing the music, and not really studying the footage enough to make notes and know what to anticipate while editing the shots together. The subtle interplay between musicians is evident. Nods, smiles, grooving together, and the \\"ok now!\\" looks, etc.. But it would have been better to watch it as four guys on stage not lightning fast edits to each of them. Basically they could have just zoomed the cameras out a little(wider shots) and slowed down the editing about 50% and it would have been absolute perfection. That would have given it more of the feel of four guys on stage I think.<br /><br />The sound could have been a touch more Zeppelin-ized. The old familiar tricks of their old live sound engineer Benji Lefevre would have been a nice touch. Things like using an Eventide Harmonizer at the right moments on Plants vocal. And using that touch of flange on the overhead mics on the drums (for the cymbals)during Kashmir. Little touches like that, which are so easy to do, would have really put it all on a different level.<br /><br />And lastly I wish they would have included something from the In Through The Outdoor album. In the Evening, or Fool In The Rain would have been killer.<br />But all in all its a must own document of the absolute baddest rock band to ever roam the earth. Its still a dream come true to see this.

B00APUQRPC|4.0|was hoping for more  but wasn't a bad movie at all . . . . . . . . .
030758836X|2.0|When I first started this book I wasn't sure if I would even finish it. The language is beyond foul and totally uncalled for. I found the beginning tedious,the middle actually enthralling and the end boring and predictable. On the plus side, it was like a train wreck...hard to turn away from. The actual premise was intriguing but I guess not my type of book. I wonder if Miss Flynn's mother knows that her daughter has a filthy mouth!

B009FZHYKU|3.0|The series is starting to go downhill. The last half of season 2 held a rhythm of 1 week of a good episode, then 1 week so-so until the last 2 episodes. This season they're dragging the plot out even more, with 2 weeks of sllloooowww episodes with one just to keep watchers hanging on, only to be let down by a long dragged out episode and stalled storyline the next week. Spend the money on a nice tight season instead of this mid-season slumber just to ramp up to 2-3 good episodes at the end.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The blu-ray version is great.  There was only one disc that had an issue but since there is a dvd copy we watched those episodes on that copy.  received this earlier then amazon estimated which is always a nice surprise.  very pleased with this purchase.

1594202842|3.0|I am a new mother and very interested in the topic of parenting styles.  I, of course, heard Ms. Chua's interviews when the book came out and so thought I would give it a shot now that I have to start molding my own style of parenting.  I agree with the reviewers who say that this is a memoir, not a parenting book, and so my review is not a critique of her parenting style.  Love and nurture comes in all forms.  I am just disappointed in the quality of writing and analysis in a book written by someone so accomplished and well educated.  She expects excellence in her own daughters and yet it seems as though she put little thought and effort into this book.  (I hope her law publications are better - though she writes about publishing on cultures without mentioning travel and field work, something I can't work out.)  Her writing style is easy to read but not particularly literary.  She also relies way too much on sweeping generalizations.  She should have written about her style of parenting without feeling the need to contrast Chinese Parenting with western parenting which - despite a caveat at the beginning of the book declaring she knows there are many types of parents - she presents as the only two options; the Chinese and everyone else.  As a non Asian who brought home a 98% only to have my father ask me what happened to the other 2%, the same father who 18 years later still expresses displeasure at my quitting ballet (even though I'm 6'0\\", not at all the build of a ballerina), I have a hard time taking the book seriously when it is based on such gross generalizations of parenting styles.<br /><br />Having said that it is an easy, quick read and kind of fun to be shocked indignant at the things she says to her family.  Therefore I give it three stars.  Read it on the beach or an airplane.

B004LWZWGK|2.0|Life is full of death, injustice, violence, false imprisonment, slander, crime, and abuse so you may as well become a hermit, thief, or a terrorist.  The villains made no sense.  Why does everything related to batman have to be such a downer? It's also hypocritical for a movie trilogy that has made billions in profits to have so many Marxist overtones.  A few decent action scenes buried in depressing whining.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like Harlequin books and this was a good book I enjoyed reading it it was very romantic and well written
B002U3CCF6|5.0|I read Gone Girl a couple of months ago and loved it, so I bought Flynn's two other books as well. I found all three of them compelling, but Sharp Objects was by far my favourite. Though my hunch on who was responsible for the murders was pretty spot on early on in the book, it was still an absolute page turner. I highly recommend it to all mystery lovers.
B007DIQB50|5.0|Really fast service, product just what was expected and at a great price. Enjoyed doing business with you and will again. Thanks!
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|I thought this movie was really good actually. So many horror movies nowadays are boring and lack uniqueness. I really enjoyed this movie and i saw it twice in theaters. Yes some of the scenes are corny and cheesy but some scenes are genuinely scary.Long story shot - girl finds box -box possesses girl. It sounds simple yet it is so well done. No this isn't going to compare to anything like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street . But compared to most horror movies coming out these days this is a really good flick. I don't like writing descriptions because i feel like it gives to much away but i would check out IMDB if you want to learn more.Some things you might come across during the film are ( bugs, runaway, hitting, sisters, garage sale, hospital, divorce, bone, yelling, teeth, dancing, etc)The acting from the kids is pretty good but the adults are much better of course. Good movie! Worth a watch!
B0059R5Q08|5.0|Michael Fassbender was a wonderful Edward Rochester! The casting was spot on! Dame Judy was a fantastic addition to this cast and Mia portrayed Jane just as I pictured her in my mind!
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I am not afraid to admit that i jumped out of my seat quite a few times in the cinema. What a creative, awesome, unique film this was. I was thoroughly impressed. If you want to know what it's about i would check IMDb. I don't want to say what it's about because it's easy to give something away. Somethings you may see in the movie ( dead body, hanging, blood, drowning, lawnmower, knife, family, kids, fire, cops, attic, suspenseful music, yelling, murderer, etc)As a huge horror fan old and new this film is genuinely good. Find a room in your house, turn off the lights, make some popcorn and watch this movie. There are some parts that are disturbing such as the lawn mower scene. I didn't even watch it i closed my eyes. The gore however is done very well and it is nothing like Saw or Hostel or anything like that. This movie has so many elements to it and it really is a classic horror film. You think its going to be one thing and it turns out to be completely different. The actors are absolutely fantastic in this.You won't be disappointed!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Watched this movie for the Benedict Cumberbatch and stayed for the tail of friendship between four life long friends dealing with the terminal cancer diagnosis. Brilliantly told!
B005LAIHCM|2.0|I saw this movie a few months ago and all i remember is how extraordinarily bored i was the entire movie. I don't remember what happened, i don't remember the ending ,it was absolutely boring. As a fan of horror movies this was dreadful. I believe the director thought he was being unique and interesting but he was wrong. When i saw the trailer i got excited because i thought it was going to be more paranormal and scary. It turned out to be more of a \\"kidnapping\\"/ thriller movie. I use thriller lightly because nothing about the movie kept me at the edge of my seat. If you want to see a good thriller movie with popular young stars than watch Disturbia. I love Jennifer Lawrence but this movie was rubbish and you will forget all about it in a week. If you are truly bored with your life it just might be worth one watch but other than that don't waste your time. I love scary movies and thrillers this was disappointing.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|You would think it’s comedy from all the pictures and GIFs you see online, but it’s a serious and dramatic show with bits of comic relief spliced in every so often.<br />I highly recommend it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Says a lot about humans & growing up & figuring what & how you believe.  More than a coming of age story. . Plus very entertaining.  For young readers & us older folks too.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Haha, title ... get it?<br /><br />Anyway, as an avid puzzler fan, I jumped on this as the FAOTD. (Would have definitely bought it, but it got lost among all the Amazon game apps available. How many more good puzzle games am I missing because there's not an easy way to search for puzzle games that AREN'T all about matching 3 tiles ad infinitum?\\")<br /><br />So, this game is a fantastic brain game where you arrange tiles to mix colored gasses and get them to their destination. The premise is similar to the pipe-type games, except that there's no annoying timer. Add to that the color mixing and portals, and it goes far beyond those other games. To me, it has the same play as Trainyard, mixed with the look of Rush Pipe (which, contrary to the name, is NOT rushed/timed). Good stuff here.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg! I love this game!  It reminds me of how, when I was a child, I used to ride a horse.  Thisgame has brought back so many memories....
B0058SNI94|5.0|I have an old pair of similar design.  Wore them out! Wear an eight, fits like an eight. Would buy again.
B000Q9INWC|5.0|I love the Rich Dad series. I read the truths that Rich Dad puts out and it's like reading the words of a Yoda in the financial sector. These books can help you to change your thinking so that, by expanding your mind, you can expand your financial possibilities.<br /><br />Near the end of this book Rich Dad asks Robert a question: &#34;What would you do if there was no risk and it required no money to become rich?&#34;<br /><br />Robert hemmed and hawed his response while Rich Dad waited. Eventually he asked &#34;Does this exist, is it real?&#34; Rich Dad responded. &#34;It doesn't matter. What matters is if you *believe* it is real.&#34;<br /><br />It is real. I know, I'm living it. I went from a single mom living in the projects to living off my book royalties, all without spending a penny of my own money. Read these books and you could join me. :)
B000067QMD|4.0|There are 6 in this pack, the only thing I noticed is that Avent has started making these much thinner than they used to.
B00A3SGWYC|3.0|The album wasn't amazing but it also didn't suck. It has its good tracks, with so many featuring artists it's a good listen through once. I enjoyed the remake of the macarena song and am completely in love with Feel This Moment right now with Christina Aguilera.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Dowager Countess (to Lady Isobel Crawley) &#34;You are quite wonderful, the way you see room for improvement wherever you look. I never knew such reforming zeal.&#34; Lady Isobel Crawley: &#34;I take that as a compliment.&#34; (turns and walks in the other direction) Dowager Countess: [laughs] &#34;I must have said it wrong.&#34; My all time favorite British period drama!  Beginning two years before the Great War, with the sinking of the Titanic, these first two seasons span the years 1912-1918 through the end of WW I. The series is set in the fictional Downton Abbey, a Yorkshire country house, the seat of the Earl and Countess of Grantham; and follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants during the reign of King George V. There is almost equal treatment of the Crawley's and their servants...a feature which I believe elevates the film to a much higher level than it would have held otherwise. The two big stars in the series are Hugh Bonneville, as Lord Grantham; and Maggie Smith, as Lord Grantham's mother, the Dowager Countess. They perform superbly, especially Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, with her acerbic wit. The exchange above w/Lady Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) is a case in point...sparks fly when these two are together. But the casting throughout is superb, both for the aristocratic Crawley's and for the servants. If you like period drama - especially British period drama - I'm betting you will love this. .
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I put off seeing this movie as I could not imagine how a movie could do justice to such an interesting book.  The movie amazed me...<br />and it held true to the book.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Love the movie, romance, laughter and tears.  Great overall story.  Wish she (Hillary Swanks character) was a little nicer, she's so bitchy at times.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  A totally improbable story line that felt very real and had us both wiping away tears at various times.  We have cats, and are animal lovers and the animal scenes are beautiful if sometimes very sad. The ending of the movie leaves you questioning and wondering what is real and what is not and if it really matters in the end. It is no wonder that it took home 4 Oscars as it is a very special movie, from the story line to the incredible production values and special effects.  I really found no flaws. It all felt so very real even when it was not.
B00000F6LQ|2.0|Buy the Blue Ray version, not the Collectors Edition, if quality of the visuals is important.  This is not, NOT a Blue Ray high quality rendition.  The quality of the recording is disappointingly bad.  Reading the cut and paste reviews, I know I got confused about which was what.  If you want the extra's, the Japan release for example, this edition is fine.  If you don't care about that but want a better visual experience, don't buy this one.  Buy the Blue Ray.
B000ION23A|3.0|It's a good movie. It has a good message and it certainly made my little brother laugh. I laughed too. I think the ante Nicholas Cage voiced was very fun. As a stage actor, I like looking at his character. It gave it a bit of depth and made the movie worth watching to me. I bought this for my brother as he loves 'ante movies' like this, Bug's Life and Antz. He liked this one as much. I actually ended up buying a used copy and it was PERFECT! Didn't even know it was used. Only difference was how it was shipped. Still two day prime shipping, but it wasn't triple wrapped in plastic. Fun movie, a few potty and nudity jokes, so if you don't like that, beware. They aren't that bad, just when the boy changes into an ante and back to human, he grows too small, then too big for his clothes. So they are just being true to life. The grandmother makes a joke about it, but otherwise it's ignored. There there is some jokes about peeing and more body jokes like that. So if you are really against that, this movie might not be exactly what you want, but if you don't mind, go for it. It is a fun movies.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game looks very easy but gets harder as you go on but it never loses its appeal so it keeps you glued to it very good for passing time.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I have seen Cirque du Soleil Iris and Cirque Eloize Rain and loved those, but I didn't really like this. I didn't like the costumes and the story had a lot of fighting and panic. I felt that the other two shows I saw had scenes that were very elegant with a lot of fluid movement and played with light/shadows very well. Some of the scenes in those shows were really moving, but in this show, I did not feel that. There were a couple of scenes I liked, such as the last one and the one where a male acrobat is working with an open cube, and I thought they could've done more interesting things with the vertical wall scene. A lot of the movie seemed really random, but I expect that from these types of shows. Overall it was just OK. Maybe I would've enjoyed it more had I been able to see the whole thing live. It may have looked a lot more impressive.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I'm going through divorce, and this is one recording that continues to bring me joy.  The man understands the suffering, and the rhythms and melodies are irresistible.  A definite keeper!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|its cool just like the clasic one i used to play but sometimes it dosent open or for shut down when you in play but it only happen a little
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Wayne Shorter Quartet continues to mature.  I like this set much more than &#34;Beyond the Sound Barrier.&#34;  I find the flow of the complete shows more enjoyable than these releases, perhaps.  Nonetheless, each track here is something to savor in its own right.  So dense, you'll have a complete listening experience one track at a time.  Improvised music as dense as the finest sculpted works of art.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|it has awsome graphics but you never ever do anything but land whohooo land and you dont really seem to go anywhere it could of been a cool game if a little more effort went in ti oi but mehh
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Don't want to give much away but like most TNG books I read I enjoyed it just found the background filler after the first couple of chapters set in &#34;the present&#34; might have been a bit to long but, that didn't stop me reading it or buying the next book in the series
B0015AARJI|5.0|I feel very good with this PS3 wireless controller. I like it, and I am really satisfied on it. Highly recommended.
B00BN2D5FG|5.0|The deluxe version is worth the extra money.  Bon Jovi continues showing their awesome talent.  Do watch Amazon's glitch with the autoRIP feature when you buy a CD.  When there is a price drop on a pre-release purchase, the autoRIP gets lost in the mix.  Amazon handled it but you have to call them.  They ended up giving me a $14 credit so I could essentially buy the mp3 version of the album I had already purchased and received the CD in the mail.  They hope to fix the problem!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is really addicting and a great time waster especially when you have nothing to do. Also you can get free BUCKS! Which you can't in other games. The only bad thing about the game so far is you have to level 10 to get to the water place. Over all its a great game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|With the number of kindle users growing in the house so I needed new a cable. Works perfectly. Happy it will work for any kindle we have.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|I got this product for my sister for Christmas.  She was unsure of its compatibility with an Android phone she was interested in buying. The company took several weeks to get back to her about the compatibility, but in its literature said it was compatible with Ice Cream 4.0. After trying to install and test the product, she found it wasn't working.  She contacted Withings again.  It took them months to get back to her.  Finally they said that their product is NOT compatible with Ice Cream 4.0, in direct contradiction of their literature.  Awful experience- don't waste the time / money.
B007Y612KA|4.0|Suspend your disbelief, accept that the cheesy acting fits the genre, and you will enjoy this action adventure. It is an art piece that fills every pixel on the screen. Very entertaining.
1400049628|4.0|This book is full of practical information.  From zombie hordes to natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes where being prepared can mean life or death, this book has what you need to survive,
B00BHMF578|3.0|I had much higher expectations for the movie of the year. We wish we had watched something else instead from last year nominations.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but I keep falling off the cliffs.  I also believe that there should be more chances to earn diamonds
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have this game on my PC, so when I saw that it was available for my tablet, I couldn't wait to get it.  It is just as great on the tablet!  Way to go Playrix.
0307891372|5.0|If you're playing on your Xbox or PS3 and don't want to head over to your computer and the internet every time you have a question, then this is great. It's got all the information you could want.<br /><br />But, if you're playing on your computer and you have internet (which I assume you do since you're reading this), then it would be much simpler and cheaper and quicker for you to forego this and just hop online for any questions you have.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|After the first listen, I was concerned that I'd not made a good purchase. But on the second listen, the songs started to sink in. Favorites are tracks 2, 3 and 6 but all are good. As others have said, Mariusz is an excellent bass player and his bass lines are a great mix of grooves and counterpoint to the other parts. The saxophone on track six is a nice touch, too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love it!  I was excited to see my old stopping grounds, Altoona, mentioned!  Very sweet book and I recommend it.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Not sure what to expect, but I loved the movie and story, I even cried!. Such a nice break from action, comic book hero films.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have an Iphone an ipod and a kindle. I have this app on every single device that I have. this app is a very good app for strong Christians like me. my reletives all have this app as well and they really enjoy it. it can be very educational for those who never really read the Bible. I totally reccomend it!!
0062238868|5.0|I simply couldn't believe seeing that well over 1,800 reviews had been written on this book as I came to review it myself!  I think that it's popularity has to do with a man worshiping his country, willing to commit to it 24/7 with every bone in his body, every cell in his brain, and every beat of his heart.<br /><br />I have found (because I like books in this genre) that we Americans are intrigued with these very special people who give all of themselves for what each are trained upon doing...keeping the enemy at bay off American soil.  We want to get to know these unsung heroes now that they have begun to open up and speak to us. 'So please, tell all!', is what many of us proclaim.<br /><br />Navy Seal Chris Kyle went beyond just being in Special Operations with the telling of his story. He started at the beginning so that we could see how he developed as a person in all ways, showing how his life prepared him to become such the gifted and successful Seal.  He was very proud of his life, but most of his pride had to do with what he did for his country.<br /><br />As significantly interesting as his life was, were the interjected writings of his wife (Taya), here and there, in some of his chapters, because never do we ever hear from the family of a Special Force Operator. But we did in this book and I am guessing that many wives in her situation (if they read this book) gravitated to her words and the parallel and significant issues/situations that would make or break marriages due to their husband's mistress--the job in special ops., more times than not, taking away their husbands in a heart beat for training or for the real coded operation. In that sense, I hope his wife's dialoge with us readers became an opening for other women in her situation to take a deep breath and exhale, due to the never ending similarities.<br /><br />If you like books reveling stories coming from our country's special operational forces, than this one is a tell all for you.  I am oneof these people who enjoys these real happenings, so I highly suggest it to those who share my interest.<br /><br />Lastly I'd like to plug the book NO EASY DAY:AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NAVY SEAL:THE FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT OF THE MISSION THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN.  If you don't have it... you may want to get it. Author, Mark Owen.  It's historical.
B0040I09RM|5.0|great show !<br /><br />Really  it would take more than a few words to do justice to the shows many complex universal themes.<br />I am retired psychologist & had too be manipulated by a friend to watch the show . Got hooked on many levels .<br />You just have to watch more than one show to begin to realize its complexity and raw enjoyment!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I purchased the entire season, it is nice to log into my account and my show is ready to watch! I can't wait for the next season!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great premise , lots of technical stuff but made simpler for the layman to understand. Couldn't put it down really. Made me long for space travel.
B000HZED8S|1.0|I'm not sure what was appealing about the film to other users. It's cast in an annoying hipster sepia hue, has a contrived beginning, and then, wait for it, giant flying robots start to fly into NYC. I mean, really? Oh, and the super secret evil guy who kills all of the scientists just happens to be carrying around a blueprint of a giant flying robot AND leaves it in the theater. I'd rate watching water hit windowpanes better entertainment than this.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|My daughter play with the app for only a couple of days, it may be entertainmet for small childrens she is 8..

0345522478|5.0|Hounded by Kevin Hearne<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan, the world's last Druid (possibly, at least), along with his trusty canine sidekick, Oberon, are the main characters in this well researched tale of hate, discontent, humor, and general mischief among the gods and goddesses of history.<br /><br />Atticus, a 2100+ year-old Druid currently resides in Arizona and owns a New Age book store. However, his seemingly benign persona hides an entity that is pursued by the Irish gods, the Tuatha De Danann, because he \\"obtained\\" a sword (Fragarach the Answerer) many years earlier in battle.<br /><br />The book is filled with sexy encounters, magic, shape-shifting, battles, and other thrilling adventures. Additionally, the main characters are witty, intelligent, and sarcastically humorous. Since Oberon is capable of communicating with Atticus via a mental link, readers get to hear the dog's very amusing comments throughout the book.<br /><br />There is something for those of all religions in Hounded. It is an equal opportunity novel.<br /><br />This is definitely a series (and an author) that should be closely followed.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I really love this movie it is a classic movie and even though I bought it used, it still works great.

B0049J2BSM|5.0|I don't see why you wouldn't love this movie. If you're soulless or had a bad experience with monsters as a kid, than I could understand. Who hasn't had their fair share of issues with the closet monster, am I right? I'm still scared of the dark, but watching this movie gives me comfort that if something makes its way out of my closet at night, it's probably just a loveable, fluffy, monster, trying to fill their quota.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a great book. Men could really learn a few things from reading it and in not only got sexual reasons but how to treat women.

B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It is the greatest game  ever...... until it crashes at level 23. I was getting really far but then it just restarted when I opened it up. If it didn't restart It would be great. I tried twice but it restarted each time at level 23 and 26.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This was a great read but discouraging at times as to the insecurity of our nations leaders and how some of the &#34;former&#34; leaders, mainly Nixon and Carter, went against the grain of helping the current leader.  Their ego's were just too big to stay behind the curtains.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|In what would turn out to be one of the greatest and most highly influential live rock         recordings ever presented in history, The Killers have gave their highly anticipated live         concert performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall which not only got the international         acclaim it fully deserved, but the absolute fanfare from some of their fans from across         the globe who attended.  What’s really amazing about the live landmark extravaganza         is that it not only captures the band at it’s best, but it also feature the breathtaking live         atmosphere, a series of brief interviews with some fans who had waited outside Royal         Albert Hall, electrifying live sets, finesse, band camaraderie, electrifying performances         and dazzling live footage of the band performing onstage.  Plus, the DVD also include         several live performances the band gave at several rock festivals in both Great Britain         and Ireland at the same time prior to the concert DVD’s widespread release in 2009—        it would even be selected from an international critics’ poll as The Best Live Recording         Of 2009’ in both the general music and rock categories with astounding results).  With         over 2% hours of spectacular footage and eye-filling theatrical aura, Live At The Royal         Albert Hall feature a special acoustic solo piano introduction of When We Were Young         as it concludes with the fans who had waited outside Royal Albert Hall as they enjoyed         the live event, a behind the scenes look inside the event, interviews with the crew and         live renditions of their greatest hits from the 2000’s.  Consisting of two nights the band         performed at The Royal Albert Hall, Brandon Flowers’ officially stated that the decision         to film the concert DVD there is because at he pointed out: “London always been very         good to us. They opened their arms to us before anybody else did”. And they believed         that Royal Albert Hall performance is a very special and iconic venue to perform there.         (one of his biggest influences was Morrissey, to whom he grew up watching his music         videos that were filmed there).

B0010WFGGA|5.0|I listen to soundtrack's more then any other type of music. It should not be a surprise then when I say I had listened to Doctor Who's soundtracks back in the 1980's too. The show has come a long way since then, These soundtracks today are far (far) better. You won't regret the purchase as you listen to some classical sounding theme one moment about Harriet Jones and wonder if she did the right thing or not; and then Rose's theme will play and if you are like my wife will cry over that She and the Doctor did not really get together (like that was ever to happen). If you actually watch the program,today's Doctor Who music will sending you back to a scene and may make you laugh (or some other emotion) -- I cannot say this happened to me when I listened to the original soundtracks of Doctor Who back in the early days. If I had to rate the 80's Doctor Who soundtrack's, it would be, I like it.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|This movies starts out very slow. If it had not been the winner of a number of Oscars, I would have given up on it. Some of the actors were difficult to understand at times. The movie does eventually turn interesting but almost cartoon like. The meaning of the movie is quite thought provoking and this is what probably saves it from being a major disappointment.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the film and felt that every performance merited an Oscar. I genuinely missed the characters in the weeks that followed. Finally broke down and ordered my 1st Kindle book after 15 months of owning the device.  Overall a compelling story.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Cool little redhead. Great story. Great message - for everyone. This delivers a message to both children and adults that we shouldn't have to fit into a mold.
0452289963|5.0|I started reading this book at my local library but I wanted to have my own to highglight the most important sentencec to really make of this great teaching a help to change direction of my stagnant life. Tolle doent miss out any aspect of life with a disarming honesty , and a caring support choosing the right words to avoind association with other spiritual teachings and therefore get the most out of it.
B004RPRXV8|3.0|Very difficult to finish. I had to make myself complete this. The story seems to go on and on and on. I stayed with it just to avoid being a quitter. Glad it is finally over.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I watched the long time. Not only is it funny but it's totally believable. A must watch for anyone who has worked in an office.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|my daughter just loved it. it was just what she was looking for. i would tell any parent to get this for their Dr. Who fan
B00A8ECU24|1.0|There are some pretty nasty hugs in both the kindle and aneroid versions. I played for a week and for a week and now for no reason the app won't open any more. I will have to unistall it and start over. What a bummer!<br /><br />The friend function would be great of it worked. I had to jump through all of gameloft's loops to get it to even sort of work.<br /><br />The game pacing is off as well. At first it's fun and interesting but the prices of shops and characters jumps through the roof. I was about a week in and at a stand still unless I wanted to spend some serious real cash.<br /><br />overall: what a shame. It would be a great game without all the bugs.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|Good exploration of an important topic. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job of portraying their characters and the difficulty of this subject. I think this movie is helpful to people of a certain age. And since there are lots of &#34;baby boomers&#34; now, that means lots of people.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I got this app hoping it would be like minecraft, but even though it was interesting at first it became terrible and immpossible to control comfortably.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Best thing Mattel has done in a long time.  Makes you think twice about buying the Barbie movies! Great buy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  Let me start by saying that I didn't read each installment individually.  I purchased the omnibus edition and it was fantastic.  I read quit a bit and frankly I've been getting a little tired of the same old sci-fi.  Don't get me wrong - there is a lot of good science fiction out there, but many of the plots are too similar.  Wool is a real departure from that.  The premise is both unique and interesting.  In addition, the author does a great job of keeping the plot moving.  The characters were also very entertaining.  All in all this was a great read.  I highly recommend it.
B008R14YBK|3.0|Only like about two songs on the whole CD.  We've been spoiled with Sirius radio and too much of one singer goes a long way.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I dont watch soap operas or series however I do now. Don t miss this! Good evrything, acting, story and the character development is the best. I care about these people!
B003NS2T9G|1.0|terrible.  does not represent the doctor who franchise.  Lacks the character development that the franchise is known for.  Captain Jack Harkness lacks the appeal and fun flintiness that made him so much fun to watch in Doctor Who
0345803485|5.0|Im on the second to last chapter. I forget if its 26 chapters, it sounds about right. Anyways that's besides the point. This book (takes a deep breath) is amazing! I NEVER wanted to put it down. I read it every chance I got. Now that's it's almost finished, I'm ready to start the next book, Fifty Shades Darker. Cant wait to order it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I never read the books, so I can't comment if the movie did the story justice.  Being a twilight reader / fan, I can understand when movies get it wrong.  As a non-reader of the Hunger Games, I loved this movie and it made me want to purchase the books to see how the story continues and ends, but I will wait for the next movie to come out.  Can't wait to see part 2!!
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|Im not really sure why I downloaded it. I am not that impressed with it and have not used it. It is kind of pointless so far. Hopefully I will find a use for it.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|My friend described this show as being similar to Eureka, in that weird science things happen, and he was right.  From the beginning I was hooked and just wanted to keep learning more, and evidence of J.J. Abrams involvement is in the mysteries and conspiracies, as well as hidden things such as the weird symbols seen on commercial breaks.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The guy who came up with this idea was a genius. Love it! Pinterest has given me and my family continued inspiration with our home renovations. ​
B007URVZJ6|4.0|have all the necessary information in order to star working on this! its free so don't think to much in order to download it.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Brings back the memories of days of old.  When people actually made good music you wanted to listen to all day long.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater, and loved it even more as we were able to purchase before the DVD came out. Requires an Amazon device for playback.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It's different to Angry Birds and requires greater strategic thinking as there are more possibilities and combinations of options available.  It's kept my 9 year old son amused for several weeks already.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is amazing. The twist and turns in the first two books are the best. However, the final book is quite predictable. because of the obvious love that Peeta and Katniss had developed in the second book. it is not a shock that they fell in love and had children together. It is a shock that they stayed in District 12. I thought that they would move to another district because of all the trauma that occurred to them in that district.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|I did not like this game.  It does not make any sense to me and did not entertain me at all
0545403359|5.0|I saw the movie first, then the play on Broadway and on the national tour.  Now I can't wait to read the book of this wonderful story.  Fast shipping and delivery.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is great game. Very interesting. I like the search and find. During Shah Baghdad change shake flash kids said shake shake shake
0783240287|5.0|I saw this show live once.  It is a fun musical with great songs, music, and lyrics.  This production is very enjoyable and a high quality production.  The special features are great too.  Fast shipping and delivery.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|As the final seasons of SGA approached, the cast, crew and writers became more relaxed and it showed in the writing and acting.
B007IUBU86|5.0|Great stuff here.  What can you say, all excellent musicians who seem to take pride in honing their respective crafts.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|yupp its an app it works it doesnt really freeze or anything idk it works just fine. mmmhmm amazon mobile
B001AG52AG|3.0|Graphics average and movie strayed from book too much. My child liked it well enough, but glad for a rental
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|The film was well-done and the acting was really amazing. Three stars may be a little low but it all depends for me what I'm rating it against.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|As always good music, specially for Zumba. I bought it because I'm a Zumba instructor, and I can use all his songs......Dale!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|I was happy to learn there was a camera app.  for my HD. Its easy to use and takes great pics.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was surprised when I started reading this book that it wasn't easy to put down.  It was easy to read.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played...... if you are debating on getting bike rake, you should get Beach Buggy Blitz instead.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|We really liked this movie.  It was an interesting movie with good special effects but it was also violent.  Overall, it was just an entertaining movie and I would recommend it.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Touching true story of a Polio victim, confined to an iron lung for most of the day, who employs a sexual surrogate to help him normalize his life.  Excellent performance from Helen Hunt and John Hawkes.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Very fun game. Worth every penny. The rest of this review is fulfilling the 20 word minimum. AMAZON YOU ARE RETARDED ALSO LET ME DOWNLOAD ON MY DATA PLAN ITS UNLIMITED U IMBECILES I DONT CARE HOW BIG THE GAME IS. Anyways, I love this game.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The movie is good and the process to rent it works well, but it misses options to include closed caption.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a suiting ending to this trilogy... was only going to read the Hunger Games BUT the ending stirred my response &#34;well what is now going to happen&#34; which lead to Book 2 and then Book 3... Katniss was an interesting character whose maturity you saw develop throughout the trilogy... loved it !
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book and looking forward to his next release. I enjoy the author and his other books very much.
B00127RAJY|1.0|This is an advance work-out program, not for the beginner! To add, to that it is very boring as well!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I play everyday and never had a problem.I would recommend this game to anyone no matter what age.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The whole series is amazing. This season is pretty good can get boring at times but its worth the hour of your life. Team Daryl &#60;3
0307346617|5.0|If your looking for a good read within the  horror genre than I highly recommend World War Z. Max Brooks did a fantastic job with his wordplay and story-telling. Hopefully the movie will be as brilliant
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Awesome movie.thank u.. I will be back to shop more movies. I love these kind of movies. Thanks so much for your service.
B00821OX98|3.0|Haven't finished it yet, but so far so good. If I can update this later on once I'm done, I will.
B00637D114|5.0|Love movie.its a good movie for family or children. Nice movie. My grand daughter loves it.. thanks so much. I shop with u again.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I would totally recommend this app for anyone with a kindle fire that wants to keep track of what going on on their device.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Loved it!!!!!!!  Great hidden object game.  Highly recommend it!  Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
B0093LFXIG|5.0|I loved this book so much it made me laugh and cry and made me fall in love with McFly all over again it really puts them into perspective and makes them human and shows we all have those up and down moments in our life
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I am terrified of this game and I'm afraid to walk around my own house. This game is amazing and fun. I'm excited for chapter 2!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually like fast paced teens dramas but this one really shone. Besides it has  the promise of other novels which should probably give the story more depth.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Took me a few tries to get a feel for the controls.  Once you know it they are very intuitive but I played through the third level a number of times before I realized that I could change the angle of the spout.  Overall a cute game and I enjoyed the puzzles.
B000OLROWC|5.0|I've been wanting to see this movie for years, having heard so many good things about it. It really builds up a nice storyline with Mr. Miyagi showcasing more of the true Martial Arts way. It was fun to watch the other evil sensei be evil ^_^
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game. The characters are cool, the places, the cars. I just think that this is one of the best games. THANK YOU VECTOR UNIT.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I would recommend to everyone if you like action and drama never thought I could watch a show about motorcycle gangs it is GREAT!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I have watched the first three seasons several times. One of the best in a long series of excellent masterpiece presentations. Highly recommended.
0718157834|4.0|This story would make a great movie and it was also a good book. A lovely romance with a bit more depth than the usual fluff.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfer!<br />Its fun quick and easy!<br />Its also really addicting!<br />I love the scenes to!<br />Like right now its rome and im being chased by a bunny!
B00004R99F|5.0|Disney great, Goofy, comes to the big screen and brings laughter and mayhem as he tries to get closer to his son on a family outing.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Movie was funny and had good acters in it. Too bad amazon's instant video app doesn't support hdmi output. Stinks's
B009A87ZKG|5.0|Pretty awesome movie. Old movie but still a great watch. Very well made. A great buy for the personal collection.
B007GEMQ2I|4.0|One of the best Lego sets I've had the pleasure of building. And an introduction to many others of the same kind I will be purchasing in the future.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Pretty awesome movie. Old movie but still a great watch. Very well made. A great buy for the personal collection.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Let me toss another 5 star review into this pot!<br />I just purchased this CD and haven't received it yet but I did listen to my AutoRip copy that came with the purchase.<br />What a wonderful album!<br />I won't try and rate each song- I enjoyed them all very much.<br />That distinct tonality that Eric's voice always had is there in full along with a terrific band.<br />This is a prize to be savored over and over again.
B004SIP7US|4.0|Pretty awesome movie. Must watch. A great buy for the personal collection. Very gritty and well acted by all actors.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Saw this in the theater and the one thing that made me mad was that it was SO LOUD that you could not sleep through it!  The story was lame, the acting was lame, the movie was incredibly boring and the special effects were so obviously photo shopped it was an insult.  NOTHING at all like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Wait for it to be free, on TV.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Pretty awesome movie. Old movie but still a great watch. Very well made. A great buy for the personal collection.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Really fun movie. Highly recommended for anyone with a love for fantasy, campy RomComs, and Tom Hanks. Need more words to fill this review--pairs well with wine and pizza, chinese food, and girls night in. :D!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I like the book it`s funny and great for kids and their families and I'm really recommending it for parents
B00AREIAI8|5.0|At first I thought it would just be another boring horse game bit it I'd actually fun and the graphics are really good
B00992CF6W|4.0|I thought this would have red stone torches, like the full minecraft. It also wont allow u to blow up TNT. There is also no flint and steel, fire, or water. Read this review before u buy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|If you enjoy games where you have to find hidden objects, this game is for you. I have been playing this game for years on my laptop, so I was really happy to see that there is an Amazon Kindle Fire version. The minute I found this app I installed it and started playing, and it's just as fun, as easy to navigate, and smooth as the computer version. I'd heard that a lot of the Kindle Fire game apps cause the device to freeze or haven't got decent graphics, but neither of those are true about Mystery Manor. So, again, if you enjoy hidden object games then install Mystery Manor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is SO much fun!!!  It's really entertaining and I love to play it.  I love how easy it is to play.  Overall, GREAT GAME!!!!!!!
0792844890|5.0|I picked up this Mel Brooks classic to add to my DVD collection.<br /><br />It was a great price and arrived on time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG.  This game is the bomb.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes temple run.  They're very similar.  Overall, probably one of the best games ever.  Go Subway Surfers!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I purchased this set as well as the Next Generation movie set to add to my DVD collection. I enjoy most of the Star Trek movies, having grown up around the time of the Next Generation TV series when the original TV series was also frequently in reruns.<br /><br />It was a good price and was delivered on time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is exactly what i was looking for. A nice, compact, more or less fairly easy to use (Free!) Bible app. Took me less than five minutes to figure it all out and work out how to use it. It's a pretty safe bet that i will be reading the Bible a lot more often now, thanks to this. Five stars! ^-^
B007REV4YI|5.0|I own all the James Bond movies and needed to add Skyfall to my collection. It is the first one that I bought as a Blu-ray. It fits right in.<br /><br />No issues with purchase or delivery.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is great that you can go against your Facebook and Twitter Friends.Also its great for me when I get bored.
B00364K6YW|5.0|On time and as stated in the add.  Great Price!  Ditto Ditto Ditto Ditto Ditto Ditto Ditto  Ditto Ditto Ditto
B003Y059EK|4.0|I like this movie because it has so many different characters. My 8-year-old son enjoyed the &#34;thrilling&#34; parts, especially the woman who wears different heads.
B000002UWE|5.0|There are only a handful of bands that got under my skin and seemed to shine a blue searchlight on my heart, and one of the most effective was Talk Talk. Their haunting arrangements and uniquely expressive lead singer set them apart as a band with its own powerful musical vision. This album shows how they progressed from eighties synth-pop tracks like \\"Talk Talk\\" to more moody, cerebral tracks, perhaps starting with the unforgettable \\"It's My Life.\\" Although they eventually released a series of mystical, compelling albums, all of which are stunning works of musical art, I favor some of their more  rhythmic tracks featured in this collection. Although \\"It's My Life\\" was, to me, their crown jewel (sorry Gwen, nice try but no dice), I also love \\"Life's What You Make It\\", \\"Living in Another World\\" and \\"Give it Up\\". By the time you get toward the end of the album and the awesome \\"Desire\\" you can see the direction they were headed. This was an uncompromising band with a mesmerizing sound, and you can tell their fans were passionately devoted by their response in the two live tracks included. I would've killed to have been there...what a brilliant band! I would not be surprised if Radiohead was influenced by this group, as there is a similar haunting quality to many of their tracks as well. By all means, be adventurous and discover this truly original band if you haven't before; you may very well find yourself talking about their creativity and uncanny ability to give you goosebumps.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book and when the movie came out I had to see it. I love this movie. Jennifer Lawrence gives so much life to her character.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The complex themes of the novel were told through the eyes are very well developed characters. I thought that the plot was fantastic and I could not put the book down. Be prepared to shed some tears. Great book club discussion book. Loved this book.
1616550414|5.0|Here it is Everything you wanted to know .<br />Very nice from cover to cover worth 2x what there are asking
B008AWBQGM|5.0|Great CD!! if you are a Skynyrd fan or not, this is a great CD and you will love it.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|Pretty good stuff with historical significance.  Well recorded and sounds as good as it can on a CD.  It took me about a half dozen listens before I started singing along.  I skip over some of the songs sometimes and one really has meaning to me, like many of Neil's songs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can't wait to turn to the next page a minute become an hour and page one turns into page one hundreds.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is perhaps the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. It is touching and moving, to the point of tears, without ever dipping into the maudlin.  Salvatore Cascio, the young actor who portrays Toto as a small boy, has an amazing range and ability, and not just for a child actor.<br /><br />The version most of us know has a lovely ending that still leaves most viewers wondering about an important loose end. The more recently restored \\"Director's Cut\\" ties up that ending, and is, I think, a better film, but leaves a much more bittersweet taste.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Crazy good. While capturing the feeling of an on a stage production, Little Shop of Horrors displays perfectly suited players. The film features \\"catchy\\" music played the way you would expect without knowing it. I enjoyed this \\"feel good\\" horror/musical dramady. Watch it!
B000FA675C|5.0|Read the hard copy when first available, but downloaded book to re read as I thought it was a great book and so much more convenient reading on the Kindle versus hard cover book.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very happy with this app, does what I want it to do...and well.  I have something similar on my iPhone which I like as well.
B0094FTKIA|3.0|There were numerous moments that were just plain boring.  I watched the whole movie only because I hate to leave things unfinished.  So much potential but it choked.  There were moments that were reminiscent of Boogie Nights--drug overdosing, wife-sharing--but they didn't get any further than a glimpse.  Other moments made me think of Showgirls--big, bad manager putting his top dancer in their place--but, again, not more than a glimpse.  They could have done so much more with the chemistry between Brooke and Mike...but they didn't.<br />Channing can dance, that's for sure.  That was a plus.  Matthew still looks good...from the neck down.  A sun-leathered face doesn't look right on such a great body but his performance was excellent as a seedy, greedy \\"entrepreneur.\\"<br />Want to enjoy some great male flesh?  Watch the movie with the sound off.<br />Want to enjoy a stripper movie with a better story line?  Watch Showgirls; shoot, even Striptease (w/Demi Moore) had a better story; or watch The Player's Club.<br />This movie did not live up to all its hoopla.
B0055S348W|1.0|I tried; but for some reason or another I just could not get this to work.  Save yourself the trouble, get Print Bot Pro if you need to print from your Kindle Fire HD
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a great series by HBO.  I watched it originally when it aired on HBO and was glad I could pick it up on Amazon
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|I can't say it's #1 among my all time favorite recordings but it is the Eurythmics.  Need I say more?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Affleck's film deserved the Oscar.  It is an exciting thriller that is often caustically funny.  Well cast and superbly acted.  Bravo!
B0041D843M|5.0|As a physician, I can attest that the vast majority of the information in this book is accurate, and is, as Dr. Campbell points out, not well understood by most physicians. Even those that do understand it, rarely if ever have the time to explain it to their patients, much less to actually convice them to make the lifestyle change that at first sounds daunting, but actually is quite simple and easy. Furthermore, the current healthcare system doesn't compensate physicians for spending the time it takes to explain this to their patients. It's much faster and easier to prescribe a medicine, and that's what we've been trained to do.<br /><br />The information in this book is invaluable and holds the key to future of health in this country. Americans are eating themselves to death, and bankrupting the medical system and the country along the way. The solution is so simple and inexpensive that it is criminal that we are not embracing this on a massive scale.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read this book, then read Eat to Live and/or Engine Two Diet to find out how easy, fun and rewarding a whole foods plant based diet can be. Over the last year my wife and I have switched to a whole foods plant based diet and it's been the most fun and rewarding lifestyle change we have ever undertaken.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved this story and these characters.  The acting was wonderful and the music was sublime.  Two thumbs up from me.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny movie. From what I saw in the previews to what I saw in the actual movie was different... better.
B007SGM084|5.0|Read the entire trilogy in less than a week!! It almost saddens me that its over. Definitely a must read!!
B008DK3PJC|5.0|Purchased, originally, for my eldest, I had to buy a copy for myself. The first thing played on my restored Quad.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Very addicting. Strong characters and interesting plots. Beautiful to watch. British aristocracy see themselves as a species going extinct after WWI.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I really like this game a lot, I just wish there was more to it. I finished it pretty quickly.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These are great books. Yes they can be a little graphic and not for anyone under the age of 18, however, they are great books. Once you get past the terrible editing, the story line is really good. Although the other reviews are correct, the author uses the word &#34;murmmer&#34; WAY to much. It helps while reading the books if you use your own words while reading it.
030758836X|1.0|I really wanted to love, love this book because everyone I talked to about it said they couldn't put it down. The author IS masterful at character development but the whole story  wasnt going anywhere until you realized, with a gasp, that you, the reader has been duped, none of the characters are what they seem. Yes, this adds to the depth of the writing, we were so easily fooled by the author, but this deception only made me scream even louder for the main character, Nick, to get revenge or at least vindication. So I kept reading, kept getting fooled, kept hoping that Nick would be granted a happy ending, all to no avail. Not that i always expect happy endings, but this story screamed for one. No way I can buy the end of this book!!! Is is like a fourth grader  who writes this crazy, long, involved fantasy story but has no idea how to bring it to a satisfying conclusion and just says &#34;It was all a dream.&#34;  The ending just plain made me feel like I wasted all of my time reading any of this story.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great edition! Peter Pan now available on Blu-ray for second time! Three-Disc Diamond Edition: Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy. Check it out!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this little amp for two reasons, one it was inexpensive and two it had decent reviews.  I have a pretty good set of headphones but everyone kept telling me to get an amp if I REALLY wanted to see how those headphones sounded.<br /><br />I am happy to say I will never be able to listen to music on these heafphones without an amp ever again. Yes an amp makes THAT much difference.  The three people I have let try it with tyheir headphones have now bouth the same amp.<br /><br />It doesnt just make the sound louder, it makes it fuller. I also use my heasdphones for gaming, and it makes games sound AMAZING!!<br /><br />The preset EQ settings are nice but IK find myself using the &#34;middle&#34; setting on everything.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|We wanted to watch this movie, we could not find the dvd.  We ordered if on ROKU amazon.  What a wonderful age we live in.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Muy buen producto, muy buen precio, y me llegó muy rápido! muy contento con la compra, esa compra fue de 5 Stars !!!
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Dont get me wrong I like this game but whene i use it it cant get passed the loding screen

0375413405|5.0|I thought I knew all I needed to know about cooking.  Was I wrong, Can not waait to start my next recipie
B002GOAH1U|5.0|she really likes this movie it is great its funny and she had one before but it got lost thanks
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I didn't love it as much as book three, and book five is way better!<br />But be ready to pay top dollar for it...
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a good trilogy......Could not put the tablet down as I was reading it. I wanted to finish as quickly as possible.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|When you get your grandkids as much as I do, a good,clean, fun movie, that hasn't been seen, is hard to find. This is one of the best.
B00BESCJII|2.0|questionable scripting, too much reliance on hipster music. good story, just clumsily completed.  Wish I would have waited on the cable showing of this movie.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|i don't use it, but my kids (7 & 9) enjoy playing it while waiting for Dr. appts. or while mom shops
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Great price.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Best book ever, read it in 3 days! Can't wait to read the other books. I loved it! It was great.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I watched this after the Academy Awards and expected better character development and more dynamic interactions. I was  entertaining but I believe the book or actual CIA file on this mission may be more interesting to read to some of the flat acting in the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the characters and can't wait to see the movie.  The turns in the book make you want to turn the page to see what happens next and the ending was just perfect kept me guessing to the very end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|App works well. The only con I would comment on is the persistent apps that pop up everytime you return to the play screen which I know I could remedy if I bought the full version but it isn't that big of a deal.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would most definitely recommend the second book (as well as the entire series) to any of my close friends.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Thrilling and disturbing at the same time. You won't want to put it down. Short enough to read it in a day or two.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is relaxing and fun.  Not overly addictive... just right.  I love it!  It is definitely worth the 99 cent price tag.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I enjoyed the first book so much I paid the exorbitant price the publisher was demanding for Winter of the World. What a waste of money.<br /><br />Whereas book one had real, finely crafted characters, great historical detail and a good pace to the writing, book two has none of these. The decedents of the book one characters are cardboard cutouts, many with little or no character development. The historical facts are mentioned more as a guide to what a character is doing at the time, rather than real and influencing events. The pace is slow to put it mildly, as Follett appears to prefer describing dresses to getting to the action. Certainly there is some action and these scattered episodes are done with the typical Follett aplomb but the whole narrative comes across as a soapy and a bad soapy at that.<br /><br />I can just imagine the publishers rubbing their hands and pushing Follett to finish the book so they could rake in obscene profits.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|This is my second Sigma novel and I find them thought provoking and entertaining.  I do enjoy the history related in the stories and the characters relatable.  The plot lines are somewhat formulaic, but it is what makes the series.
B009P0U7H2|5.0|The Particle at the End of the Universe is a very clear and easily understood summary of why the Higgs boson should exist and how it fits into the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics. I found it to be full of fascinating facts about the LHC and the discovery process, as well as good insights into the way that fundamental particles behave and interact. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has even a slight passing interest in the state of particle physics in 2013.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is the first review I've written for a game app: this game is so fantastic! Great visuals, easy to learn controls, and the music is so good!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I can't keep away from Sophie Kinsella's books!  I'm a huge fan, and this one did not disappoint!  Great quick read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|.  Great plot with interesting characters that keep you wanting more.  Great job in keeping with the period theme regarding costumes, props, etc.  Love this show.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I want to start by saying my husband and I both LOVE this movie!!!  It's hilarious, and has ridiculous moments everyone can enjoy!  I don't know if it's our internet speed (kinda slow), but we just have had the worst quality watching this movie!  We hook up the computer to the tv, and it's literally worse than non HD.  At times it was even blurry!  Realistically, this particular movie does not require HD quality, as it is not action or horror, but still it would be nice if it wasn't blurry.
1616550414|5.0|I think that this book represents a masterpiece collection for anyone who likes the series of the Legend of Zelda
B009UX2YAC|1.0|its just a kiddy rip off of temple run app designers need to be original not rip offs it really is annoying
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Love all the new songs as much as the classics. Awesome Bon Jovi tunes fun to listen to and sing along.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I am revising my review of this book because I had initially thought I was referencing another book.  I have only just gotten part way into Dark Places so I will enter my review at the end of the book.  Sorry.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is much better than the movie!  I enjoyed the author's perspective as he described what the husband/policeman was going though in his mind as he justified his own actions.  It made for a more realistic and exciting (and creepy!) story.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's the first time I have ever played this type of game. I loved it. So I tried the pirate one and haunted house.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hooked.  Once you start reading you really can't stop.  I felt it was move of a love story then the S&M book, it was definitely a main focus of the book but if you're a hopeless romantic like me you will totally overlook that aspect and fall in love with the underlining romance of the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great period show!!! I love the drama, accents, clothes, etc! Can't believe this show has been around since 2010 and I'm just now learning about it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great follow-up from the 1st book. Ana was a little cry baby to me which aggravated me some but overall I loved this book.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love this series!! It is superbly written and acted, the only complaint I have is that we have to wait so long to see season 3.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I liked the other 2 books better but its almost manadatory that you read this one to know how it ends.  Not the best one out of the trillogy but still a good read.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I purchased this app for traveling, but I have yet to get it to work.  I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy all the characters, both the &#34;upstairs&#34; people and the &#34;downstairs&#34; people.  it's refreshing to visit another era, with the views and rules that were prevalent then.  It's interesting (bothersome) to see how women and those with varying sexual orientations were viewed back then. I look forward to Season 4!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|perfect cover for my kindle, the back props it up to read, or watch video<br /><br />ipoio ipoipo jpoipoi asfdf ads

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I played this game on my PC a long time ago, actually played it all the way through more than once and loved it each time. I wasn't sure I wanted to get it for my tablet, but I did and I like it even better than the PC version I played. It has some differences I really like, it works great on my Samsung 7 Plus. I am so glad I decided to download it. It really is a quality game.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|idk what to say about this game because I have never played it and I never will because it looks dealt stupid!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game and enjoy some of the commentary on the chat room.  It's amazing that people from all over the world can share a chat HOWEVER! the chat room should be monitored.  I was playing a game and some jerk in the chat room wanted pizza and a f---! (his words not mine) and two 12 year olds was on this site.  I get disgusted with that kind of talk.  If he wants action there are sites for that.  Call me old fashion or what you will but there shouldn't be that kind of talk in a bingo game chat room.  I worry about the teens or tweens on this site.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Book was in great conditions, pages were intact and I am using it in college. I received an excellent deal for the price I paid and I will continue to purchase again through Amazon.com
B00BSBY38A|5.0|It's a great family movie, we enjoy watching this movie with our seven year old. Our daughter was a bit gross out by the scene where the animals eat each but it gave us an opportunity to talk to her about the animal food chain.
8866130931|5.0|I was really looking for a nice one.<br /><br />My friend recommended this one.<br />When I first saw this, I could not stand buying this.<br /><br />If you choice this one, you will not consider any other model.<br /><br />very nice..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked and don't know why!  These characters are so unrealistic but that's the way it was in those days.  Unbelievable!
0007350740|5.0|&#34;Bad Pharma&#34; will give you a good idea of what is broken in the American 'disease maintenance' system. Good reading.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Couldn't go wrong with the story line and emotion but very cliche in the acting category. Passed some time though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|People don't expect what you get on the pc. It's Alpha. The nice thing is you don't need to have a keyboard to play. Just like Minecraft on the pc this is a work in progress. If you could make it have a switch to turn off herobrine, different types of dimensions,bigger worlds,buckets,more food, cake(totally different), and Redstone. This game&nbsp;is awesome... everyone should have it on pc, X box, or kindle/iPad.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Outstanding!<br /><br />What's there to say; everything was marvelous. Music, direction, etc.  Also historical.  Now I'm just making up things to say to have enough words.
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|such a moving film -- and the music is just as touching.<br /><br />Must see -- must hear.  Must have.  : )
6305095442|5.0|One of the most ridiculous, outrageous, and eerie films pretty much ever. It never gets old, I could watch it time and time again, and always enjoy something else about it. It spans so many different genres, and themes, and does a great job and keeping a sometimes creepy, and sometimes funny but always entertaining story.<br />An Icon for sure.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|In this movie 007 seems indestructible, too much fantasy and not enough reality. OK movie, but doesn't hold a candle to the old 007's.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Wreck it Ralph was a great movie. An awesome film from start to finish. Disney has a winner on their hands. It's a must watch for video game fans young and old.
B007Y2W40Q|5.0|Because this will melt your face. Yet again Nile has not disappointed. It has the same feel as all of their other albums but is distinctly its own. If you like death metal and want to feel like the ground is splitting and you are going to be dragged down to the underworld, buy this record.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I thought the story was really interesting and the special effects with the animals was amazing. I was a little disappointed to find out that it wasn't a true story.
0345529057|1.0|Lousy pricing...Kindle so much more than hardcopy! BandN down the street is yet cheaper - and first time I've seen that.  And very poor Kindle packaging for a multi-book set - that's the problem with a Kindle-prepared collection of Dickens (a $0.99 bargain that wasn't) that I cannot make work except sismply fornt to bak for about a jillion pages...no way to go to the index, select a book and read.  Amazon's new low here.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Top notch. More of the same old stuff. Just plain old good story telling and something that you'll enjoy for years to come. I know these films didn't live up to the books (what film can compete with the reader's imaginings/expectations?  These films will stand the test of time. If you haven't seen them they are definitely worthy of your time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have enjoyed the graphics, music and overall game.  There is new content and reasonable amount of difficultly in leveling. I just wish the gems were cheaper, however you earn them at a steady rate so don't have to buy them.
6304493681|5.0|Excellent story, artwork and action. Simpy put: This is anime at it's finest. For the uninitiated, if this were to be your first experience in this particular art form, many others will fall short. This comes highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished reading the book and can not wait to go see the movie to see how they compare!
B0059XTUEK|5.0|The story, acting and cinematography were all beautifully done. And Ms. William's portrayal of Marilyn was the best I've seen. For the die hard Marilyn fans who've been on the fence; this will not disappoint.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|The case is great. It's sturdy, and protects my kindle like it should. but in the standing position like the picture on the description of the product, it doesn't stay up as straight as you'd hope it would. The back isn't entirely solid all the way down, there's about an inch or so of soft spot where the case bends, allowing you to fold the cover back or stand the case up, but with the weight of the kindle, it bends further back than you need it to.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Great book!  a great book for middle school, high school and adults.  Has a wonderful story to tell, about accepting people for the wonderful people they are regardless of what they may look like.
B003K16P3M|4.0|Probably my favorite book in this series!!! Really thrilling and action packed!-love it!!!<br />Spoiler: I can't believe po went blind though, but it's good he has his grace to help him
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Smoke'n fast....  Easily customizable, with lots of options in the BIOS.  I've actually got mine running stable @ 4.6Ghz. Yeah you heard me right, a 6 core running at 4.6Ghz....  You'll need a better cooling system to accomplish this though....  I absolutely love it...
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is awesome. I'm new to Pinterest, so I haven't enjoyed all the features yet. Have a lot to learn about it.
1416972242|5.0|I would recommend this book to everybody....a great read...keeps you wanting to keep reading and not put the book down!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry bird is great!! Good for passing the time. I'm getting pretty good at it. Love the Rio version. Good to have something new.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|this season is great and I will enjoy thanks to you, it met my expectations. I'll be around for the third season<br />Thank you
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Kept me mesmorized and the ending totally affected me emotionally.  In my opinion, it is probably one of his best!
1250006341|5.0|The pictiures were gorgeous.  The background information very informative. It gave you a history of the show and some of the lines said by the characters.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|FINALLY! Just picked-up **three** of these black 3-metre long Griffin cables, and they work well in all products tried:<br />iPhone 5, iPad (4th gen), iPad Mini, iPod Touch (5th gen), iPod Nano (7th gen) -- which are printed on the side of the box.<br /><br />It actually has quite a small plastic connector on the Ligntning end, making it fit in my transparent TPU iPhone 5 case without any issues, and its triangular shape makes it even easier to pull-out when finished with.<br />You can tell Griffin have worked very hard to make the connector end on this LONG cable as **small** as they can, given the cable has to presumably be 1.5x thicker to accomodate its LONG length.<br /><br />Whilst bigger then Apple's connector, it would fit most cases, I'd suggest, except those few that have hardly any cut-out whatsoever around the i/o slot on the device.<br /><br />These cables should be good for the next 10 years! Provided Apple don't decide to update the iDevices connection again sooner - or even remove them altogether in a few years time, lol.<br />(Mind you...unlikely, as they want to sell and license as many add-ons like cables as possible, wouldn't they!)<br /><br />So yes, does the job nicely, so I'd recommend, especially if bought at the right price whereever you are (eg. UK peeps look around for savings: 20 quid rather than 30 expensive full retail, can be had! ;-)
B008LC8TJI|5.0|This CD is excellent! Some of Adam Levine's best song writing to date! The rest of the band delivered a top rate performance and each and every song deserves air time! I really LOVE this CD

B00BSBY38A|4.0|What is your truth? Can you have faith in a world that demands measuremnt of everyone and everything? Pi can teach us all how to be authentically who we want and are meant to be.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm only up to about a quarter of the 4th book - so my review only applies up to this part of the collection.<br /><br />It is the first thing I bought on my new Kindle Paperwhite and I really like what I see.  The book is perfectly formatted to the Kindle.  The chapters markers are properly set (for those who like the new feature of &#34;time remaining&#34; until next chapter or until the end of the book.<br /><br />My only gripe is how the table of contents is setup - when going to the table of contents, you get taken to a list of the five books.  When you click on one you get taken to the cover page instead of the table of contents of that book.  It isn't a big issue - just requires a little getting used to when you use the table of contents to look for your further page read when the whispersync is not available.<br /><br />But all in all - a great buy !
0714864803|5.0|Great Book - One with pictures to go along with the recipes - You'll love this book full of great recipes.
B000001EXB|5.0|Classic Elton, love it all.  If you are an Elton fan, you will love this album.  Elton at his best.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|LOVED THIS BOOK, it kept me interested.  I think a lot of teenagers can relate to this story.  I would recommend.
1451695195|5.0|This is a well written book that is very enjoyable.  If you are an animal lover, and a person of faith, you will enjoy this book.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Very very much like perks of being a wallflower except with a better ending. Wouldn't recommend it but the novel wasn't terrible. Easy read
B00BNXOMHA|2.0|I've been waiting for all the Twilight movies come out, just for buying them all in a really nice box set... As it shows in the picture of this product, it looks like a thick box set, so I thought the movies were coming in this pack with each individual case and cover, for my surprise its a single box with all the movies inside (only the discs)... So I didnt like cause it doesn't come with the covers of each movie, neither information about them in this pack! Btw, the digital copies dont come in this pack, its comes with a code to you get them on line!
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I love anything with Maggie Smith in it. She adds so much richness to the story and character that she plays.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is an amazing writer, I cannot describe it in any way other than that. The Way of Kings is possibly one the best novels I've read in years, an epic fantasy novel that I needed to read. Now, when I initially bought this, I did so impulsively, after listening to Brandon Sanderson's interview on Sword & Laser. I jumped in feet first, not knowing how long the novel was, and that was brutal for me. Be warned, while this is an enjoyable read, it is also long.<br /><br />The Way of Kings follow's a number of characters that, while intriguing, represent different facets of the world's culture. The Knights Radiant are gone, the Heralds that lead them have vanished, and now, thousands of years later, a war is raging, one that will not end anytime soon. Kaladin, whose past is explored in this first installment of the series, was a compelling character, one that faced adversity and now, after a mysterious incident, is a slave. Kaladin is jaded, judgmental, and trusts no one, something I came to understand as I read through the book.<br /><br />The battle sequences, which range from small skirmishes to huge clashes, are well written, better than I've seen in a long while. Shardplate and blades add a new dynamic to war, weapons of mass destruction in this fantasy world, and spruce up combat to an exciting degree.<br /><br />Overall, The Way of Kings is an engaging story that everyone should give a chance. I found it to be worth the price, and hopefully those that buy it will as well.
0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I could hardly put it down. It's so good, I went and purchased the second one, I am a little over have way thru it, and I already pre-ordered the third novel for when it gets released. It makes you want to keep reading just so you can see what happens next. I recommend anyone to read it, especially if you liked the fifty shades of grey trilogy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't even have the words to describe this book as I am writing this. I loved how this book combined action and love into a wonderful book that described the troubles of a girl in a rogue place. This book gives you something that you never want to put down; outcomes you never expected, moments to grieve over, moments that you wish you could experience and cherish. I'm eleven and this book is one that you will want to read again and again.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|this game doesn't make any sense and I thought it was going to be like wipeout or some thing once again this game sucks
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game! Works perfectly! Please just update with the jetpack! One of my favoite games!  Deffinanly worth the money!  Yeah
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I bought this as a gift because whenever I play mine at home when I have guests they love it and they want wan too.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It sucks never use it I couldn't even find words I needed. Don't<br />Get it. It's horrible. !!!! !!!! !!!! It sucks
1567184855|5.0|This is a great book which confirms accounts of other sources, such as near-death experiences, Reiki, yoga meditation, etc. Not only it confirms, but it expands and gives magnificent details. Can't miss the heart present throughout all the insights. It's a must read.
B00006GA48|5.0|One of the best bands of the 60's and 70's! They knew how to infuse rock and blues for a classic sound.
1451695195|5.0|Great book for those who still don't believe in near-death experiences. This is the account given by a neurosurgeon who was a skeptic before but since his own near-death experience has been working towards educating his colleagues. The book is also inspiring for those who have read other material on the subject.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Epic. This movie had me thinking about it the next day and that is something special. A movie that captivates and causes viewers to fall into the world it portrays and form thoughts is simply that: epic.
0316228532|3.0|Not even remotely like her Harry Potter books. But what can be said about J. K. Rowling is that she can really write from a child's perspective, even in The Casual Vacancy -- the best parts of the book are when she is writing about children.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|If you are a gamer and have ever played Deus Ex: Human Revolution or any of the Deus Ex series and enjoy them, then you absolutely have to watch this movie!  Even the music was very Deus Ex like and the visuals were very futuristic and the setting was a human augmentation style Earth that was split into factions.  I'm not going to give any spoilers here or talk about the plot too much, but even my wife who is nowhere near the geek that I am enjoyed this film quite a bit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very convenient and accurate for this business traveler. All my favorite destinations are mere clicks away. I'm always prepared for every city and know exactly what to expect -- and when!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Oliver Stone has written a history book for &#34;thinkers&#34;.  He is able to explain many of the historical anomalies and the &#34;Why did the US do that?&#34; questions.  He tells it like he sees it and I have recommended this book to friends and relatives (and even offered to buy it for them).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for any student of US history, and think it should be required reading for ALL government decision makers.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock app looks nicer than all of the others and has almost every feature I need. The dimming is excellent, the settings are all easy to access and its elegant. The only thing it is missing is increasing volume.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this purchase!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome everybody should get this game It is highly recommended from me so so fun and addicting
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Loved how the story is developing and characters growing and changing as they repond to world events.  Great acting and set design.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun to play and enjoyable storyline. Also safe for the kids to play. Would recommend for the whole family.<br /><br />Also easy to play, although it does get more challenging.
B001TKD4RQ|4.0|The first problem you encounter while adopting Agile methodologies is how to refactor the code in order to make more readable, testable and maintainable. I found the book from \\"Uncle Bob\\" very useful about it but this book brings the design patterns to a new level, it adds context to the patterns. If you read this book you will be more able to recognize a common pattern problem in your code and refactor it in the right way.<br />I personally found this book well done, full of good coding examples and \\"in context\\" with what I am doing on a daily basis.<br />Honestly, I would say that this book is not for juniors, it really helps you if you have already knowledge about Design Patterns and TDD.
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|So far, I have yet to find one SD card that the reader will read. Using it in a MacBook Pro. The card icon shows up in header that it's working but cards put into it don't show up on the desktop. Stick with an external reader in my opinion...

B0006PV5US|5.0|Few of recordings of the digital era have the combination of splendid sound, spectacular orchestra execution, and atmosphere of this release.  Many of the Living Stereo recordings brought the home listener of the 1950s into closer, more visceral contact with great symphonic music than ever before.  This recording remains a success for that reason and for the sheer excitement and color of conductor Charles Munch's interpretations of Ravel and Debussy.<br /><br />One of the tragedies of the past 40 years is the scarcity of great recordings, in great sound and in great interpretations, that have subsequently emanated from the BSO.  RCA Victor unfortunately severed its ties with the orchestra.  The Seiji Ozawa era had an auspicious beginning, but soon revealed itself as lackluster and simply went on too long.  Isolated miracles still occurred (Davis/Sibelius Symphonies, Ozawa/Schoenberg Gurrelieder with the great James McCracken and Jessye Norman).  What happened in Boston also has occurred to a lesser extent in Cleveland, Philadelphia, and New York.  Only the talented production team of Georg Solti and Decca engineering kept Chicago going strong into the 90s.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It was a pretty good book. But was completely shocked in how it ended. It was a page turner towards the end.
1603427244|5.0|OMG if you knit...whether you're a beginner or not...you need this book!  I give it 5 stars. It's like a casting on/binding off bible! Fantastic reference book because it shows you all the steps on how to cast on and bind off... 54 types of them to be exact!  There are fabulous pictures that show each and every step, along with additional notes throughout the book that will help you along.  The author also gives samples of what each cast on and bind off is good for - whether stretchy or tight. Pictures show what the edge looks like when finished so you can see what you should be getting as well.  It's a small book so you can fit it in with your knitting stuff and it take it with you if you wanted to.  I would recommend this to anyone who knits - it can be either a teacher of new cast-ons, or a reminder for those you've done before but maybe don't quite remember how it works.  A definite keeper!<br /><br />Thank you to Netgalley.com and Storey Publishing for allowing me to review this book.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Great demystification of the process. Some vagueness but enough good info to help you get your book online. Great base information.
014241722X|5.0|I'm a little late chimming in on this one, but I've been using it in 6th and 7th grade remedial reading classrooms.  While I agree, it is for the more mature reader, I think someone mentioned it was \\"not childishly written\\", it might be a hardsell as an independent read, but it is a wonderful group read.<br />I loved the book from the first time I read it, but I'm not 12. I could see the potentials of the book, challenging vocabulary, courtroom procedures, immigration delimmas, only child, not a jock, etc. I was able to get a classroom set and the audio, read by \\"John-boy Walton himself\\"!  A chapter a day with discussion and my 6th graders were hooked for two weeks.  We discussed as much law as they needed to understand the story.  Many of my students might be illegal immigrants, so they related to that. The murder mystery is well done, we even got some old Perry Mason episodes and watched them after reading the book.<br />The writing itself is so good, it's not dumbed down as some adult writers,(cough,Patterson)tend to do. I think it's one of the best books of the past two years.  My students are demanding we read ABDUCTION before the school year is out. They feel like they know Theo Boone.<br />If you are a classroom teacher or reading specialist,you need to get this book and use it. If you are a parent who will read it with your child, you will be pleased with the content.  The only flaw we could find with the book was that Theo, as an 8th grader, wasn't interested in girls yet!  We might wish that was so, but not since I looked down the 8th grade hall last Friday.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|This DVD set includes a digital copy for download.  The first thing I noticed is the package sticker which says the download code is good until 12/31/12.  Since I ordered this DVD set on March 2nd, 2013, getting a package with a download date that expired months earlier is a major failure.  I contacted Amazon customer service and since I didn't prefer to send the DVDs back, they provided a partial credit to compensate for the missing download capability.  But based on the facts I believe it is fair to say that this is an unacceptable failure.<br /><br />This was an entirely avoidable customer disappointment.  One might imagine the download code would work to a date far beyond when one purchases the item, so this is obviously a very old package.  Amazon could have chosen to sell this at a lower price with an up-front statement that it does not in fact include digital download.  Then I would not be dissatisfied with my purchase.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love mahjong games in any form and this one is great because it has so many different boards to choose from. I lose track of time when I play this game.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I love this app.  Great for Identifying planets and star.  It's even got just enough color to identify star that appear reddish.  It has satellites too.  If I had a gripe it would be about the &#34;Do you want to track Santa's progress?&#34; in the middle of March!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best Books & Movies I have seen in a long time. Even my Husband said it was the best.. This is a must you have to read & see..
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|All I can tell you is that this app is extremely addicting, a real time killer but also a big distracting. It's a problem, but a very good one! Great app creators. Have fun everyone. Thanks!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I was so happy to get season 1.  This arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I will order other seasons when they go on sale.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is no professional boom mic. Nor is it trying to be. For what it is, it is a huge improvement over the built in mic on 99% of consumer-grade camcorders. The wire is very long, making filming across a small room easy. My only criticism is their use of watch battery. Make the case longer and use a AAA size. Replacing the battery two or three times will cost more than the whol darn mic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it! Impressive a lot of fun and very affordable....I can't wait for three to come out<br />This is so so so good!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Throughout the week I have multiple things to remember. I first attempted to do it with a calendar but my notifications were to soft and would go unnoticed. The thing I REALLY like about this app is that you get to determine if it is a one time, daily, weekly or Mon - Fri or just about any combination thereof.  I prefer the digital sound because it catches my attention even if it is in my pants pocket.  I personally think this is the best app I have found for daily time management and will tell anyone that it is definitely worth the money.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|What I like about this book the most is the straight forward manner in which the key information about building a bigger, leaner and stronger physique is presented. All of the key elements are addressed ranging from the importance of nutrition, the right type of exercises to perform, and all the way through to practical examples of putting those key elements together in a program. Worth getting for the first timer or someone who has been working out for a long time but just not getting the results.
B007REV4T8|5.0|great movie great stars worth getting very much like the 007 of old if you like james bond you will love
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This a great album!! All the songs sound fantastic, great quality & great songs. A nice collaboration with all the different artists involved.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game it deserves five stars. !^{ )  if you haven't played this game you need to get it
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I haven't finished this game yet, so I can't speak to the length, but the graphics are gorgeous,play is smooth, in-game problems are inventive and logically solved (except possibly what is used to light the fire!). I recommend it highly.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's a fun game that's easy to play with continuous things to do. Simple to make money and the pets are so cute! The graphics aren't too bad and I would definitely suggest this game~
B009E2WX3W|5.0|Always been a fan of Peter Gabriel and his eclectic style, but this remastered version of hone his best albums is amazing.  His songs never grow old and continue to evoke an emotional response
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very  good  apppp for traning hores snd stuff so yea i only did this for gems sooo sos so so so so
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a really fun game and I play daily.  However, there have been lots of technical issues.  For days I have not been able to receive credits sent as gifts from teammates, and unable to collect team points.  When I have attempted to contact technical support, all I ever get is a generic form email asking for my device info, and when I replied with it, I got the same form email as a response, or no response at all.  The fact that I've had to send more than one e-mail about the same issue is annoying.  It never gets resolved, but I just play my daily credits and hope for the best because it's a fun game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire. I love being able to quickly pull up the weather for the day without having to wait for it to load. Download this one for sure.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|When you pair these two together, you get an amazing movie.  The sets and cinematography are amazing.  The edition also comes with great features.<br /><br />This movie is simply fantastic.
B00174TKGI|3.0|The film &#34;American Gangster&#34;  is excellent.  It shows that the police in the movie are not that much different from the gangsters.  The police were corrupt and thought nothing of keeping the drug money that they should have been turning in as evidence during seizures for themselves.  The character portrayed by Russell Crowe was isolated within the force because he turned over nearly a million dollars to the evidence room. He was basically ridiculed. This indicates that the police force, at least at the time depicted in the movie, was very corrupt.<br /><br />The two different aspects of the film were interesting because it illustrated Denzel Washington's character becoming a drug kingpin while Russell Crowe was trying to put together a case against him using the law.  Also, interesting was the fact that Washington travelled to Vietnam,  which was the source of the drugs and negotiated agreements with the leaders in that country.<br /><br />The movie had some very violent parts but was mostly in keeping with the times and the tenor and themes.  Some nudity and some sex.  Showed a rarity, a Black man becoming an entrepenuer and this shocked the law enforcement who did not think that was possible.<br />All in all, excellent and I would suggest it to others.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|This movie is amazing every time I see it.  The cinematography is fantastic all of the way through.  Even though I know how it ends, I'm always full of suspense because Hitchcock is that good (which is of course why they call him the master of suspense).<br /><br />Just watch it, you won't be disappointed.
B0014JGDUC|5.0|If you are looking for a good keyboard and mouse, this does both very well and it is easy to install and work. Switching between devices is a breeze. Greatly recommend it.
B008Y73940|5.0|Very entertaining. The ending was a bit of a SUPRISE to me. I never saw it comming. McConuaughey played his roll to perfection!!!
B0041LG08U|5.0|Great diver!!! I decided to buy it based on the review at the worn&wound website (see below). I even got the same Hirsch leather strap. I gotta tell you, the combo is a killer!!! For the money it is hard to beat. I have plenty of waterproof divers so this one is going to be more of a dress/casual watch but I'm sure it would easily withstand an occasional splash of water;)<br /><br />Worn&wound link: [...]<br /><br />If you prefer different bezel/dial colors, Seiko makes three different color combinations, too: SNZH55, SNZH57, SNZH60...<br /><br />Specs:<br />Case: Polished and Brushed Stainless Steel<br />Movement: Seiko 7s36B 23-Jewel Auto with Day/Date<br />Dial: Metallic Blue with Steel inlays<br />Bezel: 120 Click Unidirectional with Blue Acrylic Insert<br />Lens: Domed Hardlex<br />Case Back: Screwdown Display Back<br />Strap: Steel Bracelet<br />Water Res.: 10atm (100m/330ft)<br />Dimensions: 42m, 45mm to crown<br />Crown: Pull-out<br />Thickness: 14mm<br />Lug Width: 22mm
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The way the author understands the issue of mental illness is quite amazing, it's as if he has had first hand knowledge of this subject.  Outstanding!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Life during World War 1 was really tough. It changed the way the world worked and the way women were treated. For rich households it changed the whole dynamic of upstairs - downstairs. This show is so great, can't wait for Season 3 to be added to Amazon Prime for free.
B00A3XWB10|5.0|I thought music like this was gone, but then the Savage Playgroung from Crashdiet came along. From start to finish, this album rocks! The song that caught my attention first was Cocane Cowboys..then came California....then came Circus and they just kept coming. I was impressed with singer Simon Cruz. Reminds me of Sebastian Bach. If you like late eighties, early nineties rock like Mötley, Skid Row and bands of the such, you'll love Crashdiet!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I think this is a very great app to get. It is great for synonyms and definitions. This dictionary is different from the others which is good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 year old and all of her friends love this game. She plays it a lot!! Have to take the kindle away sometimes!
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|Wong-kar way + Blu Ray + Criterion: need to say more? Yes: amazing audio/video quality - - - -  -
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Transformers as great action movies. The only thing that could be improved is to make it easier to understand the transformers.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love all of the Angry Birds games but find I'm getting spoiled now with the extra add ons to make it easier to hit your target :)
0385360177|5.0|This was better that the first I would recommend it. I loved the first but this one surpassed it I can't wait to read the final one and to see the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I stumbled on to this show by accident and got hooked after the show. It just draws you in.  Great family show that the whole family can enjoy. It well written.  Great story line and all the actors are excellent and believable.  It's different from what's on tv now days.  So this show for me was very refreshing.  It is filled with history, drama, suspense, romance, no profanity, no violence and no sex.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I absolutely love the show, I just regret buying it on Amazon Video because I ended up getting HBOGo shortly thereafter. But if you don't have HBO, you should definitely should buy it. Can't wait for season 3!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I down loaded to my kindle fire bingo blitz and its one of the top three games i must pay everyday..  It fun and addictive.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Thank you thank you thank you thank you.<br /><br />No, I don't know what any of the lyrics mean, but I still understand the music. Sigur Ros is beauty in sound form. Thanks.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It hard to use my finger  I have a pin for my kindle fire but it hard to make the man move in the direction I want him to move in.  This game for me is definitely a challenge.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|All 5 stars because this album (especially Ara Batur) reduces me to tears on a regular basis with its ineffable beauty, purity, depth, and all-encompassing grandeur.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who has a soul.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good game. no problems on the kindle fire. not fast, but not too hard<br />third game by this company and so far all have been entertaining
B009EANE3M|4.0|Reading how bland this album I read \\"The Script #3\\" was supposed to be, I had low expectations. Maybe pop-fueled, euro-hip-hop leaves critics wanting, but don't count me among them. #3 is wonderfully fun if white rappers aren't a turn off for you. The album highlights include \\"Hall of Fame\\" with will-i-am, the soaring and inspired \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" and the hip-hop in the round, college jam \\"Give the Love Around\\". The album is full of hook-laden pop and live show fist -pumpers. If that makes it bland, then flavor me vanilla.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's true the Elementary follows the &#34;quirky detective solves crimes no one else can solve&#34; formula, but it executes this formula flawlessly, and is a hugely satisfying experience for those of us (like myself) who can't have enough of quirky detectives.  Lucy Liu has a challenging job playing against Jonny Lee Miller's very kinetic Sherlock Holmes, but she stands her ground and is wonderfully convincing in her portrayal of a Watson whose talents and vision supplement Holmes' blind spots and make her a real partner to the genius detective, and not a mere foil.  Is it high art?  No.  But it's a heckuva lot of fun!
B004BSFC46|5.0|Great quality!  Glad I ordered it.  Exactly what I wanted and it is very good quality.  Would buy again.  I would recommend.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like all of his books. Always keep me interested.<br />A little too many assumptions near the end. I need more realism.
0425264351|3.0|I found this book to be mediocre.  The character of Reacher is a little too over-the-top, and somewhat unbelievable.  The story got a little far fetched as well, but as this was the author's first book in the series, I plan on reading a few more to see if he develops Jack's character a little better.  The fact that Federal Treasury agents are disappearing and being killed in a busy airport, and the Feds aren't swarming all over the place is really unrealistic.<br /><br />I bought this book in the Paperback edition.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Some silly girls sexy dreams. Not of any interest to me.<br />Sell to teenyboppers with twisted moral values. Very dissapointed.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I liked the story line and the action, of course Denzel Washington is a fav actor of mine<br />in short: worth watching
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I can see now that we've been speaking different love languages! Such great insight. I recommend this book to any and everyone. Every person has a desire to feel love, imagine what a better place the world would be if there was more love.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|slow and boring is the first thoughts about this movie, time waster<br />Yes, I'm aware that it has won many awards but the acting was dullsville...would have rated it lower but that would have been vindictive on my part
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Was in middle lost transmission. Not happy about paying for a movie and not getting to see it in its entirety
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This Movie is so much fun to watch over and over with all my family and friends.  I need more copies.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Prime example of the growth and vision of her personality in both her writing abilities and the performances she brings to her public both tour and videos.
B009CGGCSC|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now I can watch it anytime, anywhere, whenever I need a lift from the stress of life.
B003WTE886|4.0|Just plain good music !  I have followed her performances for several years, and none of her records have failed to pervade value for the money spent to obtain them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this at least a couple of times every night after work, it really helps relieve the stress from the day.
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|I went into this expecting it would be too long, given the running time, but wow, did it do a lot of meandering. I enjoyed the opening and the returns of some favorite characters from LOTR, but there was so. much. filler! Especially in the form of long fight sequences. One section (involving orcs) felt exactly like playing an RPG -- or rather, watching someone else play one. Just too long! Martin Freeman is really perfect for the title role, though.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I have the book, the DVD and now a copy of my kindle fire,  I should be all set whenever and wherever I need to watch this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has kept me entertained for WEEKS. I must admit, I was reluctant to jump on the 'Angry Birds' wagon, but I am ever so glad I did! This is a clever, if simple game (sometimes those are the best) and while they offer upgrades and unlocks if you purchase them, the game itself is free and those are just specialty add-ons. Fun if you can afford them, but not necessary for the overall game play. This is definitely a game I recommend - and if you are hardcore about your Angry Bird love and have the cash, I would definitely say purchasing the extras to expand upon your experience is well worth the money and effort. There are a few annoyances with advertisements, but they are easily closed out of as you continue your game-play. They are hardly worth considering, really. Good game. Fantastic for hand-eye coordination and 'thinking outside of the box' on certain levels.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I started playing about an hour ago and I really love this game! I can't wait to tell my friends and family.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|LOVE Mahjong. Big collector of Mahjong games, really (it's an addiction) and this one was loads of fun! Good number of levels per section, fast paced fun and a good rating system. My only hitch was that doing well in this game did not 'unlock' or open new levels for you. Once again, if you wanted more and a wider variety (and additions/updates) you had to purchase the upgrades - but until then, you received four sections with at least seven levels per section. So there is plenty to keep the casual gamer interested for quite a while. Definitely worth a purchase if you are a mahjongger like I am and you have the extra cash!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best Dragon game ever you have to get this game there's the coolest Dragons ever! And it's free
B00003CXIP|5.0|Ordered this movie for my daughter and it arrived in no time, unopened and unused as advertised!!  The price of the movie was great as well!!  I would definitely do business with this company again!  Very happy
B002ECQB46|4.0|Although there are some 1 star reviews for this movie I actually ejoyed it very much. I was never was a hudge fan of Beyonce, but suprisingly she really showed her acting skills in this movie. As for the movie in general it was pretty interesting, a little predicatble but still enertaining to keep you watching it. The attic/house scene was a little ridiculous but still the movie is your typical drama/dramatic-romance type. Kuddos to Beyonce.
1616550414|4.0|Lovely book.<br />I wish it had more of the background process of making the games.<br />Also, it is quite big on the Skyward Sword part. Maybe not so odd because it is quite new and fresh in memory.<br /><br />Otherwise a quite sweet book.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|A mi sobrina le ha gustado mucho, es muy llamativo y de buena calidad. No ha perdido el color y la hora la marca perfectamente.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|There's a lot of things that you can like from this book, it has history, technology, love, fantasy, and a really appealing story.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is awesome totally better than any radio Eva.the best part is you can change it as many times as you want<br />It is sooooooooo awesome thank you tune in you guys keep rocking
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It is very addicting and is a fun time-waster if you're waiting for the doctor or just lounging around at home!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is soo good I absolutely love it however you need to get the new Rome version I prefer that one way better so May you please put the new Rome version on
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This film was probably made with the idea of shedding light on scientology and Landmark.  But, it's a big budget production with no point.  It meanders, it's ponderous, and it ultimately goes nowhere.  I had heard mixed reviews and am a fan of the cast, but I was astounded at how empty it all was.  The ending was almost laughable in it's pretension.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am not a JB fan, but my husband said this was a great movie.  Must be, he has watched it 6 times already.  Thanks for quick shipping.
B008220C56|5.0|It was an accurate and well done movie.  I had previously read the book.  Some of the effects were not quite as graphic as in the book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love fb because it is a great way to connect with all my hommies and its just fun to be able to have that fun expirience
0066620996|4.0|The concepts in this book relate to any business environment or time period, but some of the companies selected as &#34;Great&#34; have seen better days. Wells Fargo, Fannie, and Circuit City are all on the list of great companies. Prior to 2008 this book was probably great, now it is only very good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|like i said before the bible is awesome and should be advertised more it is super awesome and a great way to spend the day on it
0439023491|4.0|For the second in the Hunger Games series, this definitely filled in the back story on the districts that was missing and glossed over in the first volume. I'm a huge fan of that sort of storytelling so that was a huge plus for me. The narrative seemed to peter out towards the middle before picking up steam with a surprising number of twists that kept me reading (I actually finished it in one sitting, unable to put it down before I'd finished) voraciously to the last page.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game altogether, the perfect substitute for temple run and in my opinion better. It is my new favorite game that I play (other than minecraft) and the challenges are fun to complete.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game has great graphics.  Interesting story that keeps you involved.  Better than some of the other games I have play.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Best quality out there. Come in spanish like it said it would. You would not be desapointed I got it for my Kid.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this knowing fully what I wanted, but when I caught my younger brother reading it I was all smiles and just thinking &#34;Yes another Zelda fan in the family&#34;. The artwork is so beautiful and well done just as I had hoped for, but the information is what I was mostly interested in. All in all I'm very satisfied with my purchase of Hyrule Historia.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Was a good movie, I wish I saw it before I heard about all the awards it won.  There was just too much hype that it couldn't live up to for me.  The acting was good, it was a great period piece.  But for some reason the movie just never grabbed me or got me emotionally invested.  That's why I have it 4 vs. 5 stars.
B000FA675C|5.0|One of the most creative writers alive. Dan Brown is certainly gifted. His book is highly entertaining and indeed it is very difficult to put it down before finishing it. Once I read the book, I felt sad for not having more pages to read.<br />The details of the characters and places are just right. The events are revealed in the right moment. It is filled with action but not in an over the board way. What is very interesting to me was that the book managed to drive me to know more about many of the symbols or  artifacts or places mentioned in it. Yes, it is a work of fiction but very well connected to history and life. I cannot wait for his Inferno.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|I have been a huge Taylor Swift fan since her first album.  I love her sweet songs about love, loss, and funny moments in life.  However, the first single off of this album just lost me.  It was this teenage anthem that seemed to take Swift as an artist and move her back into lame, teeny-bopper category.  I was hoping for more mature music to appear as she gets older, but that has not been the case with this album.  I couldn't stop listening to Fearless and her live album for quite some time.  This album I've only  managed to get through a few times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game always a challenge.  Playing solitaire a long time and glad I can do it on my kindle fire and not loose any cards.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I started watching Downton.  I thought it would be a fussy British show, and instead, it has turned into a drama that my husband and I love watching together.
B0031R5K8Q|3.0|I purchased this book because it was recommended by ine of my friends mom to a 8 month old... I read it as i was trying to get a better understanding of my newborn... It proved helpfull en some point, like learning to pay more attention to my baby so i could understand him better, getting some insight into the different kinds of baby so we could more easily fullfil his needs but the rest of it wasnt very helpfull after 15 days of trying to stablish a rutine and put him awake in his crib (wich we tried for hours, usually until it was time to feed again) and also tried to lenghten the time between feedings at night,  and not having ANY succes we decided to do it our way and so far we have got a better rested baby, and parent wich are able to take a shower and not spend the day putting baby to sleep... Im just saying its theories might not work for every baby or every parent but there is probably something in this book you will find usefull.<br />Will retry some tips in a couple of  weeks when my baby is older to see if it fit us better...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this book down!! It held my attention through out the entire book! I highly recommend it!

B000IDEORY|5.0|This movie is a classic film! I am not putting it in the same class as Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind, a different kind of classic. If that makes any sense.<br /><br />I love the great quotes like, &#34;I carried a watermelon....&#34; or &#34;Nobody puts Baby in the corner....&#34;; those two are my favorite. They are iconic to my sister and myself. Its how Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze say them as well... their tone and acting quirkes really add to this film.<br /><br />This film has a WONDERFUL soundtrack as well. Perfect music for each scene... kind of makes you want to dance as well!
B005HSL626|4.0|I find myself trying to beat my own scores. The only thing is after a point it's impossible to earn a new feature especially if you only have online access part-time at best.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. It was funny and very entertaining, I love Mark's attitude in worst case scenarios. Brilliant!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is great worth the money only problem is you can not listen to your music will playing with head phones

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Like I tried Temple run and Temple run 2 but it's not as great as this game! Like it has more details and better graphics! I reccomend this game
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I found this cheaper at target right after I got it. oops Arrived on time in good order. I love this series
B001MKVDPS|4.0|This movie is a throwback to when horror/supernatural movies didn't have to be filled with blood and guts.  Its suspenseful and eerie. Peeks the curiousity into reincarnation and makes you wonder what if.  I remember when it was aired on television when I was a child.
B009YX02T8|5.0|This was the perfect soundtrack for this movie. I haven't seen too many movies where the music stood out to me as much as the movie did. Great movie, great soundtrack!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you have not read the books I would suggest it as there is much missing due to time constraint But Over all great series that relays close to the books I have loved so long!!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I was looking for a bit more substance on the process of capturing Osama. The book delves into his life in early years and dreams of becoming a seal.  I am a Navy Veteran and a Seabee.  I have much respect for my seal brothers and love reading about these guys. I have read better seal books, so this one was not up to par.
0446554995|3.0|This is the first time I've read anything by Preston & Child, so I really have no previous work to compare this to.  It seems to be a pretty popular series, which is one of the reasons I thought try reading it, however, I am not a huge fan.<br /><br />The protagonist, Aloysius Pendergast, seems to be a larger-than-life type of hero, with Mission Impossible-like capabilities. I didn't enjoy the way-out-there plot.  Like other reviewers, I also didn't like the 3 separate story lines. I really prefer more realistic writing.
B009QW7HMC|4.0|I enjoy this show although the past 3 episodes have been really boring. I am dying for episode 14 and 12 hours after airing, it's still not on here. Where is it?!?!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderfully written! I couldn't put it down. Another great work of Sparks'! I was eager to finish before the movie was released but the movie did not do it justice.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The movie is awesome since it keeps you engaged during the whole movie. The performance of Denzel Washington is amazing.
B00009P1O2|5.0|If you wanna be a show man of a Rock Band then this is the holy grail concert to watch. I teach singers and performers stage presence through this video. It has now become my defacto teaching aid for performers. Superb concert - no BS - great sound quality and worth every $ spent on it. Essential for all Queen and non Queen fans... Its a great concert to see the Genius in action.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|While the book lulled at parts. This is a really great read overall. Manson provides an in depth look at his childhood and early band struggles. It is well worth your time if you have an open mind. This book isn't for the faint of heart.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Big Steve Vai fan ., what I didn't understand is why this was shot in 2007 and released in 2010 .. Vai at his eclectic best... love the format and the stage. You may get pissed with the 1 second camera shots in some songs which looks cheesy... Video effects aren't a Steve Vai thingie for serious concerts but this one has some BS which hard core Vai fans may not like  ... (like the live at Astoria) ... But never the less. Vai is Vai...

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am sad that the trilogy is over. It is hard to put any of the 3 books down. She keeps you wanting more. It has been awhile since an author has held my attention like that.

0525478817|5.0|Its so good. I never knew a book could make me feel all the emotions that the characters felt! John Green is an excellent writer. This is one of my favorite books. Words can't describe how awesome it is!
B001EBYMAI|5.0|This film was great and beyond other films like it keanuu  Reeves was a great choice for the hero and the rest of the cast was also great to&#62;

B003G4W49C|4.0|Card writes a great story that examines the personal life of a hero. This very intense and emotional story that captivates young minds can also capture older ones. Ender is a character everyone wants to relate to; who doesn't think they're a potential genius who could save the world when called on? He overcomes adversity, not because he wants to, but because he must, and that is why his story resonates with us. His struggles are human, and it makes us believe we'd behave the same as him in his situation.<br /><br />One complaint I have was the amount of dialogue. This most likely comes from Card's past as a playwright. The scenes with Ender's siblings were a nice little diversion. They show how someone of Ender's intelligence could be used for evil in his brother, and how that same intelligence can pacify great evil as his sister does. However the focus on the siblings was too light to adequately explore these other sides of genius, leaving the whole work a little lightweight. If the siblings' story was left out, Ender's story alone would have been much too narrow. Despite this, I couldn't stop reading. The story always left me wanting to read the next chapter, and the next, despite the need for sleep.<br /><br />Ender is also not a clich&eacute;d hero who ends up being loved by everyone. The fact that he will save the world isn't a relief but a burden that he must carry in every relationship he forms. He is one who is great because he was tested to be, and has to be, or nothing else matters. The hero isn't chosen by prophecy or ominous signs, but through rigorous scientific tests and calculations.<br /><br />The story also brings up the dialogue about necessary violence, and what sort of evil deeds are necessary for the greater good. Like many heroic journeys, the hero must kill to achieve the goal. But here, the killing is not glossed over by the characters. It is argued, debated, condoned, and concealed by those in authority. Card never preaches whether the murders were right or wrong, only that they happened. The ending is an insight into the life of a hero after the heroics, continuing his personal vision of a hero. Here, it is simply and mundane, not the stuff of legends, and is an excellent way to leave Ender's story.e right or wrong, only that they happened.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this book its an amazing story of love, strength, humility, and more. This is a book that one would read over and over again throughout their lives.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a cool game anyone who wants to play it its soooooooo cool! You will love it. I promise.
0525478817|5.0|This is a fantastic book--could not put it down.  It was funny and it made me cry.  It's labeled Young Adult lit but it's for everyone and it's written on such a high level that adults can love it too.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is high concept and reminiscent of 70s scifi; from the deseign choice, music and the get up and go pace of the story.  Best action movie I have seen in years and very well acted.  Dredd is the future cowboy I've always wish Sergio Leon directed.  Also the 3D is stunning, interesting use of slowmo.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Story keeps you engaged,  wondering if she will succeed or get caught.  Rich details in a society that fakes wealth and beauty.
B0053TMP24|5.0|THIS WAS AN AMAZING BOOK almost as good as the last Olympian I seriously can't wait for me to read the Mark of Athena it will probably be even better
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|We weren't going to watch any new shows,even though we thought the show looked really good, so missed first 2 episodes and heard so many good things and family watches it so we started DVRing the season and watched first 2 episodes on Amazon Instant Video and the show is awsome and keeps you guessing.
B008VVT51U|5.0|The characters in the movie potrayed what it is like for many in real life.  The movie brought so many thoughts and emotions - all wrapped up in one movie! - comical (I laughed); sorrow (I cried); happiness (I praised and cheered) for each guest of the &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34;.
B00846WWVM|3.0|its a good game keeps you busy and entertained when bored.might need some sort of power ups and upgrades within each levels.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I loved this series and hope to find more British T.V. on Amazon. I'm pacing myself, I don't want it to end.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|At the beginning of the movie, there are several still shots of wildlife and animals in a frozen wasteland. When I saw those, I thought &#34;Oh dear, what have I just rented? Is that a &#34;club&#34; film?&#34; I was glad that soon I was relieved of my fears when Eric Bana appeared on the screen (Not that he couldn't star in a club film). The movie quickly picks up the pace and throws Hanna into an unknown situation. There are nice moments when Hanna runs into technology that her sheltered life didn't expose her to before and that were completely unknown to her (eg.: TV)  Without spoiling the movie for anyone, the action is fast paced Liam Neeson style, contrasted with slow, thought provoking moments of stealth action. Sometimes the rating on Amazon can be at odds with the quality of the product, like in the case of Red Dawn which is rated 4.5 but in reality is a very very very very bad movie (and I don't say that too often), Hanna deserves a high rating and you'd do well to watch it.
B0016MJ6T2|1.0|This was just a horrible movie in every way you can imagine. The set pieces, the acting, the script, just everything about it. I watched it with my girlfriend and we tend to finish a movie we start even if its bad and every so often we would look at the clock to see how much longer there was and it would seem like it should be half over but it had only been 15 minutes.<br /><br />The acting was god awful. I'm sure a lot of people would say it's supposed to be bad to emulate the vacuous and empty club kid lifestyle of the characters and supposed to be cheesy. But no, it was just bad. I've been around enough people who do hardcore drugs to know what they are like and drugs were a big part of the story but they played it so horribly bad it was embarrassing. The rest was just awful middle school drama club quality of acting where everything is so over the top it's painful to watch. The kind of acting where you can't tell if they aren't taking serious and goofing around by being so over the top, or if they truly honestly think they are these great actors really digging deep into their roles and impressed with what awesome actors they are when in reality public access shows have better actors.<br /><br />I understand low budgets and I appreciate the fact but this went beyond low budget, they simply didn't care. You can't take a unfinished wet basement in some rundown apartment building, turn off the lights, put in a mirror ball, put some streamers up and have 5 people jumping around in costumes that looked like they were made by 12 year olds and expect me to suspend my disbelief enough to imagine that this is supposed to be the hottest and hippest club in New York. Or that the biggest club planner in the city has like 10 people in the back of a tractor trailer in some abandoned parking lot.<br /><br />This movie feels like it was specifically designed to be some cult hit. As if the people behind it were checking off a list of what they think a cult hit movie is and did everything in their power to hit that target. They don't realize you cant make a cult film on purpose. But this felt like it was just trying to force itself and fake being a cult movie. Even the casting felt like it with a bunch of notable indie actors like Chloë Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne, right down to Marilyn manson. And then you have to throw in some has been actors like John Stamos so people can say \\"Om my god its john stamos!\\" Casting people that convey a character and be believable is important, but when you do it just for the sake of having a certain person to attract a certain audience is just laughable and never ends well.<br /><br />Worse yet I felt like I didn't discover anything, gain any insight or have any real moral so to speak. It was just a bunch of people taking drugs, staging mock rave parties, killing someone and then it ends. And to add insult to injury the pacing was just pure crap. Die hard was a better constructed film than this and that is just about a cop who gets trapped in a building and shoots people.<br /><br />This movie is purely bad film making, bad acting, bad scripting, bad sound, bad design and we are all dumber for having watched it. I like a bad movie that has some sense of substance or a purpose, but this movie has neither. It is a virtual turd pinched off in some cheap attempt at gaining notoriety with the indie kids. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would.
1400069289|3.0|With hundreds of customer reviews already posted, I'm going to cut to the chase.<br /><br />This book was about 100 pages too long.  Of course because I'm a creature of habit and usually finish any book I start reading, I wish I'd discovered the Appendix before wrestling with each and every chapter offered beforehand.<br /><br />- Identify the routine.<br />- Experiment with rewards.<br />- Isolate the cue.<br />- Have a plan.<br /><br />This is the framework which Charles Duhigg calls the a reader's guide to applying the book's ideas. The irony in all this is that I felt good about having read this book and now must wrestle with my habit loop to become a more efficient reader.<br /><br />To the author's credit, he weaves a good tale and his research is both wide-ranging and the notes thorough.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like the Fifty SHades of Gray Trilogy - You will LOVE this book. I'd like more of a story line - can't wait for the next book.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Arrived in time for Christmas! What a great gift! My friend was so excited when she opened the gift! Yay!
030758836X|2.0|I´m sorry, but this book was just not for me!<br /><br />*SPOILER ALLERT*<br /><br />Although well written and able to captivate me until almost the end, the end itself was simply awful! I was really skipping whole paragraphs to get to the end, cursing the characters because of their dumb decisions and was not finally rewarded with a satisfying ending! I couldn´t believe that the book was over and I was reading credits on my Kindle! That´s why I´m giving this book two stars, actually: yes, it was well written, no, I will never read this again or recommend it to anyone who is not thinking about killing him/herself. I think that if the author would have given us some closure at the end, this would probably be one of my keepers. However, as it is, I felt dirty and angry with the whole world. I even fought with my husband and had to apologize afterwards explaining to him that I was extremely frustrated because of a book I have read. It´s not that the characters weren´t flawed or unlikeable, they were, all of them, but the fact that the big bad psychopath at the end wins, with a lame \\"I´m sorry that you have to wake up being you every day\\" as punishment, was the unacceptable issue! Totally depressing! Definitely, this was not for me!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It ws fast moving and exciting.  I thought the author wrote extremely well as<br />it kept me turning the pages quicky to ascertain what was happening next.  I did see a comming attraction<br />on television for the movie and it looked like I would enjoy this.
B00004VYPF|3.0|Somehow I missed that this was actually done in French. The jacket was English, but not the inside! Luckily, we were able to find one we could truly understand.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Takes one back to the old days when music was fun to listen to and the musicians were actually real musicians...Great CD!
B00000DGUY|5.0|Great CD! All the best of Dire Strait on one cd. These guys are timeless. Mark Knopfler will live on in true rock-n-roll hearts forever.
B00BMCLCG6|2.0|I am sure the product is amazing, however, I could not figure how to download it on my computer or iphone, after I downloaded the Amazon MP3 loader, so today, I tried a different tactic, just to find that the Bon Jovi download was no longer available. I paid $5 for nothing. Would really like my money back and don’t want to use the Amazon MP3 loader. It may have been my fault, but if I can’t figure it out, there is no use having it.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Can't wait for season 3!  Like the multiple story lines going on at any given time and how unpredictable this series is...  you never know what's going to happen!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching both seasons one and two on Amazon Prime. I especially enjoy the fact the series deals with both the aristocracy and their servants lives and the overlapping of both. The only thing I didn't like was how the author handled the deaths of William and then Mathew's fiance. In both cases they seemed to on the mend and then suddenly died after having a medical crisis. The series writers use this again in season three for another character. However, all in all this is a pretty minor issue. The series is excellent overall and I would highly recommend it. I enjoyed it so much I purchased season three and can't wait for season four!
B00BS4U8VS|5.0|This is a very great show. I cannot wait for the next expisode. I think the season ends to soon.The seasons should be a little longer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has better graphics and cooler things in it then the first one!!! I think you should get it! You get chased by a giant monkey and there is also a mine cart you ride!!! THIS IS GREAT!!!!
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|I wasn't pleased with this app at all. Im not sure why but it seemed to be dysfunctional. It simply did nothing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very much like this product. Another stress buster. Can be played at any time for as long as your able. You can stop at any point and it just waits for you to return.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|Not sure how to bring this product up for daily usage.  I need for appointments. Need to keep track of times scheduled for and length of Dr. appointments.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really enjoy this product.  Would recommend. It's very healing for me.  I really enjoy getting most game correct. Would recommend to anyone as another stress reducer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So happy that I found Amazon I was looking for a long while on how to catch up with all the episodes and came across amazon which works greats for our busy schedules. We can watch the episodes anytime..
B000069KE0|2.0|I am old enough to have bought this when it came out in 1970. Chicago's first album was fantastic and sounded great. What happened when they recorded this, their second one? Some really great tunes, but they sound as if they were recorded in a basement with wall-to-wall-to-ceiling carpeting. Flat! Horrible! So all these years later is a Rhino \\"remaster\\" and it sounds no better at all. I am a devoted Terry Kath-era Chicago fan; somebody, please: give this recording the remaster it deserves!
1885167776|5.0|Up front, I want to acknowledge that I think the word \\"thing\\" is worthless. Because it can refer to everything (NOT every thing), it refers to nothing. Think about it: \\"no thing refers to no thing\\"? Nonetheless, it remains one of the popular words in the English language. This book and its title offer a case in point.<br /><br />However, semantics aside, with assistance from Jay Papasan, Gary Keller rigorously examines a very important insight: The sharper the focus of our attention and effort, the bettter the result will be: answering the question, solving the problem, achieving the objective...producing the one result... that is MOST IMPORTANT.<br /><br />When Keller first began to time block, the most effective t**** he did was to put up a sheet of paper that said, \\"Until My ONE T**** Is Done - Everything Else Is a Distraction!\\"<br /><br />These are among the highly informative passages that Keller provides throughout his lively narrative, in addition to a series of effective Figures (not T****s) as well as a \\"Big Ideas\\" (not \\"Big T****s\\") section at the conclusion of each chapter:<br /><br />o Six Lies That Are Barriers to Success (Page 30)<br />o Extreme Pareto (39-41)<br />o [Brain] Food for Thought (66-67)<br />o Counterbalancing - the Long and Short of It, and, Life Is a Balancing Act (79-82)<br />o Going Big (87-91)<br />o Life Is a Question, and, Anatomy of the Question, (104-110)<br />o How to make the ONE T**** strong enough to achieve extraordinary results (117-118)<br />o How and why the path to a great answer begins with a great question (119-127)<br />o Happiness On Purpose (139-144)<br />o How and why lives are driven by the purpose they're given (147-154)<br />o Time Blocking (159-170)<br />o (176-188)<br />o The three essential commitments to the ONE T**** (175-188)<br />o The four \\"thieves\\" of productivity (190-206)<br />o How and why success is an \\"inside job\\" (214-216)<br /><br />Keller obviously understands and appreciates the power of metaphors because he makes such effective use of them. The domino, for example, that serves at least two separate but related functions in his skillful hands: as a cause and as an effect. ONE MOST IMPORTANT T**** leads to (enables) another ONE MOST IMPORTANT T****:  Do what must be done (if nothing else) today so that you can then do what must be done (if nothing else) tomorrow; only then can you do what must be done (if nothing else) the day after tomorrow. You get the idea. Throughout this process, keep in mind that whatever else can also be done during this hypothetical three-day time frame is probably a distraction.<br /><br />As I read and then re-read this book prior to composing my review of it, I was reminded again of two quotations. First, from Abraham Lincoln before power saws were available: \\"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\\" Now, from Peter Drucker: \\"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.\\" I agree with Gary Keller that, to achieve extraordinary results, it is imperative to select and then do only what is most important while ignoring almost everything else.rs because he makes such effective use of them.

B00AA0TZTW|3.0|give it 3 stars out of respect for JH's overall artistry and body of work.  Nothing new or exciting here.  Axis and Electric Ladyland stand as his greatest creative expressions and the exploration of his genius will be mostly complete there.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have seen this movie 16 or 17 times before I ordered it. Then when I finally ordered it I have watched it 10 times since then. The movie came in the mail and It was properly packaged. Not hard to get open and played very well.<br />Giving 5 stars because this movie is worth the money. And you will NOT be disappointed in it.<br /><br />&#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 I LOVE this Movie...
B00BMCLCG6|2.0|Sad thing is that BJ of today (or the last 2-3 releases) sounds like Hootie & the Blowfish-college-frat-style-AOR released in the wrong decade. Big disappointment from a once stellar rock outfit!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A fun game. Great storyline and graphics! The hint button will help you if you want just a nice casual game or you can make it harder if you want to challenge yourself. I would reccomend this game!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The announced demise of Google Reader forced me to lookfor alternatives. Feedly has syncing across devices including Aneroid phone and my Kindle Fire. The magazine format turned out to be good for general reading and I can view just titles via web browser for voluminous feeds. They will likely add that function to the Android app before too very long.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|My favorite blood splatter expert!  My son and I just love this show.  So entertaining.  Dexter's inner dialogue is hilarious!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. The writing style and parallel story lines that intertwined made this a compelling read. Learning about the plight of the Parisian Jews during WW II was horrifying yet the story was so well written, I thought about it for days after finishing it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My son and I just love this show.  So well done!  I haven't read the books yet but if they are half as good as the show I'm in for a treat!  Very well done!!

B000002J1O|5.0|Here you have real music for real Genesis fans not substituted garbage for poserfans to listen to. A lost song called Deja Vu was rehearsed by Genesis during the recording of this album written by Peter Gabriel however never finished the song. It was given to Steve Hacektt and then finished in 1996 off his [[ASIN:B000002SII Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited]] album. In 1973 Steve Hackett and Phil Collins(along with John Wetton) played on former Yes guitarist Peter Banks' [[ASIN:B002GHFSF2 Two Sides Of Peter Banks]] on \\"Knights Reprise\\". You can hear bits of the Genesis song Twilight Alehouse in the song. This cd is a MUST GET for real Genesis fans! The fakes can listen to Easy Lover and Sussudio.

B00BRR66SA|1.0|There's a place for competent pop music.  Unfortunately this effort has no place at all.  There's just nothing here. The simple 2- and 3-note melodies are worthy of a middle school songwriter, but nothing to run out and buy.  Likewise, the lyrical themes could have been written by a high-schooler at the lunchroom table.  Besides being incredibly weak musically and lame lyrically, the songs become LONG 6-8 minute mindless track loops.<br />They'll likely sell a bunch of this tripe due only to hefty advertising and seemingly endless plugs on every TV show that would have him. There are much better choices available, even for grade school girls with more hormones than judgement. Don't stoop to this cynical attempt to cash in. Keep looking.

0316069434|5.0|Only a writer of Michael Connelley's skill could take two major events in recent U.S. history -- Operation Desert Storm and the Rodney King/L.A. riots -- and bring them together into one cohesive narrative. The opening sequence, a rapid fire flashback at the horrors of the L.A. riot, brings Bosch and his old partner, Edgar, into an alleyway where a foreign journalist has been executed. At the end of this sequence, Bosch apologizes to the corpse of the beautiful Danish girl whose death would haunt Bosch for two decades. Why he apologizes is never articulated, but it doesn't have to be.<br /><br />To me, \\"The Black Box\\" is a departure for Connelley. He has tracked down cold cases before; it's his job after all. However, with the exception of looking into his own mother's murder, this one is very personal. He is allowing the past to come back and compel him to solve the mystery. In a way, this novel is much like Dennis Lehane's \\"[[ASIN:0061998850 Darkness, Take My Hand]],\\" although not as... well... dark. Still, it is a gripping mystery with a satisfying resolution. But getting there is half the excitement. There is plenty of it. There is the obligatory \\"someone in the department is out to get Bosch\\" subplot, but even that gets turned on its ear. All around, great stuff.<br /><br />In his dedication page, Michael Connelley thanks his devoted readers for keeping Harry Bosch alive. Is he kidding us? We thank him for continuing the Harry Bosch series!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I would give it 5 stars except that I can tell this is going to be one of those addictive games that wants you to buy &#34;more power!&#34;  But it really is fun to try to figure out the  trajectory you need to fly the birds at to help the other caged birds escape.

006114665X|5.0|Which was most important, the spark or the powder keg? There are probably enough books on the origins of the First World War to rebuild the great wall of China with. Thanks to the influence of the 'annales' school and its long view of history, however, and then of Marxist thinking and its predilection for structural causes, most of that literature has focused on the powder keg. In Sleepwalkers, Clark chooses to ask about the spark: how the First World War came about rather than why, though how is of course also expected to inform the question why. The book thus devotes close attention to Balkan politics, and it includes what must be one of the most detailed accounts of the Sarajevo murders anywhere. In this sense and to a degree, it is a return to the 'battles and princes' history of earlier times. Look for irony in this if you like, but Clark makes the point that our twenty-first century multi-polar world, with its fluid politics and shock-prone environment - think 9/11 and its aftermath - resembles the pre-WWI era more than much of the twentieth century, and perhaps makes that era more approachable.    Sleepwalkers is actually divided into three sections. The first, which I found the best, deals with the Balkans, Serbian irredentism, the Black Hand, and the Habsburgs' fraught involvement and Russo-French investment in the region. The second teases out longer-term risk factors over the ten to fifteen years to 1914, and the third section puts the characters and events immediately leading to the war declarations under the microscope. Inevitably the book's second section rehashes already well-covered points: the hardening of the alliance system, mobilisation plans, colonial competition, though it does make the important argument that not every trend pointed towards military confrontation. The originality of the third section is probably that it restores the roles of a variety of second-line characters. It also remains, as any account of these last few weeks, morbidlyfascinating. I thought, finally, that Clark might have expanded a little on the interesting cultural factors he touches on, such as militarism and male insecurity, or the role of defensive discourses in blunting diplomatic initiative - perhaps at the cost of a shorter second section - but this is already a long book. Sleepwalkers' chief merit, anyhow, is to remind us that WWI originated in the Balkans and that, if we want to understand why it happened, we need to grasp why the Balkans came to assume such an overblown importance in Great Power thinking.    One last point: as many of the Amazon reviews seem to confirm, Clark to a large extent argues with the 'German adventurism' historical school. My wish is not to engage in polemics with fellow reviewers. My impression is that this school of thought, having originated with post-WWII German historians, was more about guilt over what happened after rather than before 1914. Nor do I privately understand how it can all be blamed on the Germans: my own, French countrymen were sufficiently fixated on Alsace-Lorraine to share in the responsibility. Whatever the case may be, though, it should be mentioned that Clark is an Aussie who teaches at Cambridge University. Though he has written a history of Prussia, there is no reason to brand him a German nationalist. It is correct that Sleepwalkers dilutes the blame, and it does paint - rightly in my view - the Habsburg reaction to the Sarajevo murders as legitimate. But if the book tends to absolve the Germans of excessive blame for WWI, this should be taken as a serious contribution to an academic debate, not as an opinion piece.

Not to mention the only free bingo game that's multiplayer that I'm able to even load. I'm also able to Facebook connect unlike a few other apps that say you can but can't via kindle fire. The only issue I have is that, with limited connection, sometimes I get kicked out of rooms. I do get a message saying I have had those lost coins put back into my account.<br /><br />I love the season bingo rooms and I like playing the slots when I'm out of bingo coins for the day.

0765325950|5.0|I started reading this series in '98 when I was in middle school. There has been a lot ups and downs, but the ending was amazing. It was more than I could have asked for, Sanderson couldn't have done a better job.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|While I'll admit to being relatively new to the world of Les Mis, having listened to and compared all three major cast recordings (London, Broadway, and this one), there is no question that the 2012 film soundtrack is the definitive version. While there will be many who disagree with me on this point, in my mind, it is about as close to perfect as a musical album can be, and the fact that it was all recorded live makes it even better.<br /><br />I won't attempt to give a long, in-depth review of the film, the story, or music itself, but rather illuminate what makes this CD different from its predecessors.<br /><br />As everyone probably knows by now, 99% percent of the vocals were recorded live as opposed to in a studio. This gives the album a rawness and virility not usually heard in cast albums, and certainly not ones from movie musicals. The songs, being sung by actors, take on a more natural and less \\"stagey\\" sound, which certainly helps heighten the feelings within the music, and makes them pack a far harder emotional wallop. This is the first musical album I've ever listened to that honestly brought me to tears. While one's opinion of what makes a great singer is incredibly subjective, I found the whole cast to have uniformly good voices, with no one seeming too out of place that they completely ruined it for me; and to anyone who complains that so-and-so doesn't sound as good as they should have, I'd like to know how good their voice would sound after 12 hours of continuous singing!<br /><br />As with any kind of adaptation, there are going to be obvious differences between the old and the new, but here many of the changes are good ones: new arrangements, new incidental scoring by Schonberg, a new song for Valjean, and some extra dialogue. Avid fans of the stageshow might bridle at the cutting of certain lyrics, or the rearrangement of several pieces, both for clarity and time, but these are very minor qualms when you take into account the fact that the prosvastly outweigh the cons.<br /><br />Unlike the previously released Highlights album, this set has ALL the major songs, including \\"Who Am I?\\" and \\"A Little Fall Of Rain\\", as well as extended versions of the \\"Epilogue\\" and \\"In My Life\\", among others. My only complaint is that this isn't a \\"complete\\" recording--i.e., a few sections of sung-through dialogue written for the film are strangely absent, and a few songs, most notably the \\"Work Song\\" are truncated from how they are heard on screen. Being a two-disc set, I don't really understand this, as there is ample space left on both discs to include the omissions I mentioned above, but, I guess you can't have it all.<br /><br />Despite this flaw, I recommend this set very highly, as well as the Highlights (the cut of \\"Stars\\" is done better on that CD than this one).

1616550414|4.0|The art collection in the book is definitely great, showing lots of design for characters and other objects in Zelda universe.  One small problem is that the art focus too much on Skyward Sword instead of focus on all the titles in the series.<br /><br />The &#34;historia&#34; part is also misleading.  While the book does have the complete history of the Zelda series, however it doesn't go into detail on the story of each series and how they interact.  The artworks does show progression of Link and Zelda over time, just doesn't focus on the history of Hyrule as the title suggests.

1442474440|5.0|&#34;Treasure Island&#34; has traditionally been called a &#34;boys' adventure story,&#34; but that description now needs amending to eliminate its 'sexist' slant.  Let's just call the novel a &#34;great adventure story&#34;--one that will appeal to almost anyone who enjoys reading about, well, adventures.  True, the story is a bit short of female characters:  There's only one, Jim Hawkins's mother, and she is left behind (literally) early on in the narrative.  From that point on, &#34;Treasure Island&#34; is exclusively a tale of a boy's adventures in a man's world.  This may lessen its appeal for very young girls, but the way the story is told, and the language it is told in, has guaranteed it a wide and varied readership down through the years.  The story is narrated by Jim Hawkins, who seems to be about Huck Finn's age, as well as his equal in the ability to intuit adult character and motivation.  But whereas Huck narrates his tale in his own vernacular version of English, Jim Hawkins sticks strictly to the 'King's English', which makes his story more available to the older, more sophisticated reader--and somewhat less so to the younger, less well-read one.  (Of course, Huck Finn's vernacular English poses differing problems for both the older and younger reader too.)  In my own case, I first read &#34;Treasure Island&#34; when I was under 10 years old.  I loved the story, but I must have struggled at times with the language in which it was written (although I have no recollection of doing so).  Nor do I have any recollection of being unduly affected (i.e., traumatized) by the numerous acts of violence and other instances of man's inhumanity to man that occur in both &#34;Treasure Island&#34; and &#34;Huckleberry Finn.&#34;  Could it be that young readers, like these young narrators, possess the wherewithal to &#34;process&#34; such acts without incurring lasting psychological damage?  At any rate, it seems so to me.  One last note on the edition of &#34;Treasure Island&#34; I am reviewing here.  It is a facsimile, published by Simon and Schuster under the Atheneum Books for Young Readers logo, of their 1911 edition and contains N. C. Wyeth's famous illustrations to that edition.  These illustrations alone are worth the price of the whole book, and then some.

0670026603|3.0|I don't remember what I was looking for, when I happened upon this book.  I was surprised to see that a book tackling the themes of disability and assisted suicide had become so popular.  The reviews were glowing, albeit with many references to weeping. Despite my reluctance to get sucked in by what seemed to be a tearjerker of a romance novel, morbid curiosity got the best of me.  Between the historically-overused \\"quadriplegic who wants to die\\" theme, and the romance angle, the potential for this book to mis-handle its topic and carry absolutely abhorrent messages was, frankly, vast.  And clearly, thousands of people were not only taking in this author's message, but finding it deeply affecting and convincing.  I wanted to see what it was she was putting out there.<br /><br />Considering how infuriatingly bad this book could have been, I was very pleasantly surprised. (I listened to the audio edition, which was well done.) First of all, irrespective of the overall content, Jojo Moyes is a highly engaging writer, full of wry and witty observations about her characters and about the human condition in general. I would read more of her work. Secondly, she's clearly done her homework, both on the issue of assisted suicide, and on the topic of what day-to-day life with a significant disability can be like.  As a relatively informed reader, I found that the picture she painted rang true more often than not; and the idea of an uninformed reader gaining her first exposure to these topics through her words did not trouble me - rather, I felt that she was opening the eyes of her readers to a reality that many of them have probably never encountered.<br /><br />I would argue, though, that the author's depth of preparation qualified her to write the first half of the book far better than the second half. There is a lot to take in about life with disability.  The parts that that stand out most to the uninitiated are often not the parts that are truly the most difficult. One aspect of getting to know what life with a disability is like, is coming to appreciate the sheer range of inconveniences and indignities. \\"Not walking\\" is really just the tip of the iceberg.  This book does a great job of drawing the reader into the reality of the challenges, and that is huge - getting more people to understand what people with disabilities deal with every day cannot be a bad thing.  Ms. Moyes leads the reader through that process of discovery, without sentimentality or pathos.  She's obviously been through this learning process herself, in one way or another.  Furthermore, even as the picture she paints of disabled life grows in size and detail, she does not let it outpace her character development - she engages her readers' curiosity about Will as a human being, such that he is not overshadowed by his disability.  Of course, this is achieved in large part by showing us Will through the eyes of Louisa, who is not only getting to know him, but (as promised by the \\"romance\\" hook) falling for him.  It's an effective device, though, and it's not overdone; in fact, calling the book a romance really promises more than it will deliver to anyone who's counting on Romance-with-a-capital-R.  The point is really that Will emerges as a person that Louisa can love, and that the reader can appreciate through that lens. Once that transition is made, though, I feel that the story weakens a bit, as the focus shifts toward Louisa's frantic attempts to convince Will to go on with his life.<br /><br />This is where I suspect the author's experience begins to fail her: in her treatment of the real-world context that the vast majority of people with disabilities do want to live, and do find a way to go forward with their lives.  The book does not, by any means, contest this fact; on the contrary, it makes an earnest effort to make this point. As many reviewers have pointed out, there are characters in the book whose chief purpose is to articulate this position.  The problem is that we only see these characters from a distance.  They are placeholders - proxies for the \\"life can be worthwhile\\" platform.  If the first part of the book were less vivid and heartfelt, this might feel adequate.  But in contrast to the clarity and power of the author's portrayal of the difficulties of disabled life, this testament to the fact that people survive, adapt, and thrive feels weak and one-dimensional by comparison. There's a big difference between knowing in the abstract that people forge new, meaningful lives, and knowing *how* they do it, and what that feels like.  I suspect that the author's life experience stops short of having deep knowledge of how this reality plays out for the many people who live it.<br /><br />Also, while there is much about Will's day-to-day life with his disability that is illuminating and rings true, he really doesn't represent most people I've known with similar injuries. especially given the substantial financial resources at his disposal.  A real-life Will would not need to be a virtual prisoner in the home of his parents, drained of all autonomy.  Forfeiting his career would have been far from a foregone conclusion. He would have connections with peers from rehab, and at least a few pre-injury friends, even if many had let him down. He would most certainly have had access to an adapted computer, long before his technophobic caregiver came along and screwed up the courage to brave the public library to research his options.  Medically speaking, he would surely have his ups and downs with respiratory and urinary tract infections, autonomic dysreflexia, and the like, but the level of fragility portrayed here seems exaggerated for a previously healthy 30-something man. (Plus, his overall level of physical capability seems low for a person of his stated neurological level of injury, but every injury is different, so maybe that's splitting hairs.) Good care is necessary, but good care normally enables survivors of an injury like Will's to be far more autonomous and physically resilient than Will is portrayed to be.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author does not touch on the fact that many people who live and thrive with disability are, in fact, the most staunch opponents of assisted suicide. They have experienced firsthand how readily society is willing to validate the idea that their lives are not worth living; and thus they experience the \\"right to die\\" movement, not as something that empowers them, but as something that threatens to amplify the oppression and disenfranchisement that they already face.  Moyes' token non-suicidal quadriplegics never object to the idea that organizations like Dignitas are so eager to endorse a disabled person's impulse to throw his/her life away; they only go so far as to say, \\"Yes, disabled life is rough, but suicide isn't for me.\\"  There are many, MANY people with disabilities who have far stronger and more compelling statements to make than this, about how the prevalent sentiment of \\"I'd wouldn't want to live if I were like you\\" impacts their lives, the quality of their medical care, and their standing in society.  After reading Jojo Moyes' eye-opening portrayal of the difficulties of disabled life, I had no doubt that she would be up to the challenge of making clear to a reader why so many people with disabilities have strong feelings on this subject, and how seriously we should all take their hard-earned perspective.  I would love to see her tackle this broader subject matter, but sadly, it isn't in this book.  Nor is any fleshed-out portrait of even one disabled person with a fulfilling life.<br /><br />If I could have my way, there would be a sequel to this book.  Louisa would not only go on to live and grow just as Will had hoped; she would also connect deeply with at least one disabled person who had built a vibrant, rewarding life (or become such a person herself, should the author wish to throw more adversity her way).  She would see the contrast between what life with disability *can* be, and the relative shallowness of her desperate campaign to convince Will, through a frantic parade of recreational activities - how \\"happy\\" he could potentially become.  She would come to question whether an offer of \\"choice\\" is always empowering, or whether it can carry an insidious message and destructive power of its own that can potentially derail what might otherwise have been a triumphant life. This author has sold me on her ability to convey ideas as subtle and complex as these; I would love to see her finish what she started in raising these issues for her readers.  There is a bigger story to tell than the one that ends with Will, and I would love to read it in her words.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Great twist on match three genre. graphics in overall presentation are really nice and professional. gameplay most importantly is fresh, fun and highly addictive.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game.  It is always nice to have a heroine for a change!<br />  I really liked these puzzles.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|A little harder than average to find hidden objects. Not the most intriguing scenes to wander through. Would buy again.
0805047905|5.0|This is a great book to teach colors, imagination and it helps with memory by listing all the animals at the end.  This book has been replaced a few times since my triplet grandchildren want to read it all the time and it gets a lot of abuse. Enjoy!
B002ZG983M|5.0|I absolutely love action hero movies, and this movie is that with a wonderfully fresh twist.  It's honest, quirky, funny, high-impact and very well written, directed and cast.  It criss-crosses several moral lines, back and forth, and does not try to hide the complications, ironies or the quandry of neccessity. The top cop is crooked and \\"the good guys\\" are a lame, but learning, well-meaning teenager, a vengeful anti-hero and his highly trained, counter-assination level daughter (all of 11 years old).  Oh, and the villain?  He's a \\"family man\\" who really loves his teenage son - he actually wants him to \\"eat his oatmeal\\" and keep his nose out of the family business a bit longer while one of our heroes has made his 11 yr old daughter the central thrust of his vengence. Just absolutely wonderfully played. I highly recommend it.
141694737X|5.0|I bought this book because of reviews I read and I am glad I did.  The children get to excited to see or later tell what is under the flap.  They love to tell me 'that's silly'.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I am so happy to have received my all time Hitchcock movie. Finally i can watch this suspense thriller in high quality plus all the extras!!
0978545095|3.0|But cannot delete my accidental review. It looks great, and the scans and reproductions seem to be high quality. I am really interested in Maier as a photographer, and in her interesting history and story as a former Chicago resident who indulged in some street photography of my own.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally read it in one day.  The end was a surprise to me.  Can't wait for the next book and then the movie.
8866131377|5.0|Could use monthly overview calendars between each month instead of bunched together at the beginning, but I really love this product. It is almost perfect.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|LANTERN SHINES BRIGHT AND IS COMPACT IN SIZE. I GAVE IT 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5 STARS, BECAUSE GETTING THE BATTERY COVER BACK ON IS VERY DIFFICULT. A SMALL LED LIGHT STAYS ON, WHICH I ASSUME WILL DRAIN THE BATTERIES. I LEFT THE BATTERIES IN THE LANTERN, BUT I REVERSED ONE OF THE BATTERIES SO THE LED LIGHT IS OFF WHEN THE LANTERN IS NOT IN USE.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really couldn't put it down. The stories characters are very intriguing,like nothing else I have ever read. Quick , easy read, but not for minors.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|As all Crichton's book, the science and action sequences are great; however, much richer character development here than other books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I logged into Amazon using my iPad and download the books just fine. I downloaded the Kindle app so I can read the book while off line. I only use wi-fi with my iPad so being able to read books while not connected was a major plus. I was happy to find an alternative to Apple when buying e-books. Seems Amazon's selection and price is way better than the Apple iBooks store.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I like it. The graphics are nice. The story plot is ok. I recommend trying it. The game gets progressively challenging.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's worked exceptionally well for my kindle fire hd. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants something simple and serious.
B0006N2EZ0|1.0|I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of this product.  I thought by now, the dvd would've more enhanced and not so blurry.
B00B7VZN76|4.0|I don't own this item, but from everything I've seen and read, I definitely want this.  I can't afford it at these prices, though, so I was hoping to see the new HD/blu-ray versions on Amazon Instant Video, as it seems to indicate here.  By Amazon's own admission via email, these HD/blu-ray versions are NOT on Amazon Instant Video, so their inclusion here is misleading.  Only the traditional standard definition (not remastered) version is available for instant streaming.  Amazon, you either need to not mention it, or give us the HD/blu-ray versions on streaming!
0312330855|5.0|I have read James Herriot's whole series previous, but my book club wanted to read it and it is purely delightful a second time around.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely an adult read. Although as is rumored the 'bedroom' scenes are described in vivid detail, the storyline is not lost to them. Highly recommend!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|After a long successful career of iconic films, Schindler's List was a radical departure for Steven Spielberg. You will not find any long effects-laden chase scenes, adolescent protagonists, or friendly aliens here. This film takes the viewer by the scruff of the neck, pries his eyes open, and forces him to stare into the abyss that was the Holocaust in a way that few people other than the ones who witnessed it could possibly know. Unlike in most films, the camera does not turn away as the cruelty that human beings can inflict on one another is played out in agonizing and personal detail.<br /><br />Well-deserving of the Oscars it won for Best Picture as well as Spielberg's first Best Director nod, this nonetheless is not a film to lightly just pick up and watch on a Saturday night. It is a journey; a fascinating and visceral ordeal of barbarism punctuated by moments of compassion, heroism, personal sacrifice and courage. You will not be the same after you watch, nor will you want to be.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I enjoyed it as a child, and now my children enjoy it.  My husband and I liked the 3D version, but our kids are a little too small to care.
B009MF56GC|3.0|While not as awesome as the first film, the sequel nonetheless is quite entertaining, with even more 80's action stars brought out of retirement to take names and kick proverbial behind, as well as a lot more screen time for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger (who were both just walk-ons in the previous film).<br /><br />The plot? Who cares. This film is all about the weapons-laden, explosion-y goodness, punctuated by cheesy one-liners and impossible escapes, that made the 80's action genre so awesome. A film that caters to the 15-year-old boy in all of us. :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantastic<br /> Not at all what's expected from the information I received<br /> About this book. Loved reading it, very unexpected ending!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Ben Affleck is to this generation what Kevin Costner was to the 90's. He has crafted an intense, suspenseful yarn that grabs hold of you and never lets go. One of the best historical dramas I have seen in a long time. An absolute must-own!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is quite an eye opener and fills a lot of gaps in the halo game universe. It was very well written and honestly I wasn't looking forward to it ending. I haven't played halo for quite some time (COD Convert). I have to admit that now I'm beginning to appreciate the story of halo again and I'm actually going to purchase Halo 4 when I get off of work!
B007REV4YI|5.0|... though I would hesitate to call it the best Bond film ever. I still think Goldfinger or Thunderball hold that distinction. I also think Casino Royale is superior to this one as well. Still though, an enjoyable yarn, well-cast, which does an excellent job of bringing the Bond saga full-circle. Daniel Craig once again delivers a powerful, gritty performance as the best 007 since Sean Connery. Don't let this one pass you by!
B001SGEUMY|4.0|But not so sure for the casual rocker. Some great track here. Not as good as Morning Glory. Buy used if possible.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|I am pleased to see Willow make the leap to high definition. I had not seen it in at least 10 years and wondered how well it would hold up compared to the memories of a (much) younger man. :)  The answer is: pretty well! While the acting can be quite stiff in places, the breathtaking visuals continue to astonish, even by today's CGI-laden standards. What makes it even more amazing is that most of the effects were accomplished the old-fashioned way: with miniatures, bluescreen compositing, matte paintings, stop-motion and even hand animation, all played out with the awesome vistas of New Zealand as a backdrop (nearly 15 years before Peter Jackson made it famous!). It even has a very early, pre-Terminator 2 scene of CGI &#34;morphing&#34;, which works quite well indeed. If you're a Ron Howard fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up this gem!
B008HFWF3U|2.0|I have more than twenty Cd's of Pat Metheny, and I'm following since the year 1986, and he has very good and good CD's, but this it's the worse I listened and bought.
B00003CXWV|3.0|I love this movie, absolutlety AWESOME! If you love Donnie Brasco, Casino, Scarface, or Heat, this will become one of your favorites.
B007PWXQWA|5.0|Of course I recommend this super CD of John Abercrombie, it's quiet, peaceful and good to rest with the correct music.
B0027WGWQ0|5.0|When a man has a daughter, he holds her extremly high, higher than anything else.  But when she becomes defiled by drugs, what can be worse a father would ask?  She can become a prostitute for her drug use...  A well means of a family with an easy high 6 figures a year family, watches their only daughter become hooked on Meth, where they put her in a Re-Hab.  But the beautiful young blonde sneaks off and without any money, sells herself to a Black African American that is slinging dope theu an 4 Square Electical Box Blank Cover over his front door.  They show her laying naked and doing drugs as he climbs on top of her and uses her again and again.  when the drug dealer is done with her, the next scene, she is getting balled by a fat Euopean Pediphile where her Dad finally rescues her and she is so out of it that she does't know where she is.  The Dad quit his job to focus on his daughter and to make things right as they have both made mistakes.<br />This movie is not for the faint of heart of the squimish.  It is an accurate depiction of how woman get drugs in America and the results of drug addiction.  Atleast she had a Dad that wouldn't give up.  So many young women of our society, simply do not have that, or anyone else that will protect them. Leav your heart at the door as you will have tp put on your roller coaster stomach to find yourself watching the credits!
B0099114WO|5.0|I went to this movie alone, the theatre was filled mostly with women......unfortunate since men could really benefit from this movie as well.  They brooch an uncomfortable topic for most marriages in a humurous and touching manner.  You can't go wrong with Meryl and Tommie......great casting, their chemistry is extrodinary together.  Highly reccomend!
B000C20VPA|5.0|This has to be one of the best gangster/mob movie of all time, talk about epic!  Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci NAILED IT!!  The scene at the end is so intense where they bury them alive for all the wrong they did, it feels like cruel justice of an animalistic type.
0375703764|5.0|I've lent this book to two people, haven't gotten it back. This is my third time purchasing it. Worth it.
0425263908|3.0|it was almost a carbon copy of 50 Shades book. While I did enjoy the book it just seemed like a copy cat
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not the greatest show ever but definitely do not regret my decision to buy and watch it. Above average zombie genre show.
B002KKCVXC|1.0|cof.star trek - season 01 - 10 (12dvd) italian import (2010)<br />Explains that this is an import!<br />I didn't buy it because it's an import.<br />I guess reading is too much trouble before buying. It's more fun for some to complain instead of taking personal responsibility for themselves.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We started watching season 1 and 2, and had to get to season three as soon as we could. Love this show.
1402270275|5.0|Really enjoyed this start of a new series.  I like the mix of all the supernaturals and Frankenstein type characters and scenery.  Cannot wait for the next one!
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|absolutly great!<br />would recommend it to everyone. Lots of great new songs all about partying on spring break. definately a must buy.
B00913P6G0|3.0|Kendrick just doesn't care what the people think, and it's immediately obvious. He came into this album doing whatever he felt like doing and due to all the critical praise it's received, it worked out pretty well. Good Kid: m.A.A.d City is not a bad album under any means, but the overall lack of emotion, sometimes annoying vocals and overly long songs, comes out as a muddled affair from Kendrick Lamar.<br />Mr. Lamar released two singles before dropping the album. The Recipe and Swimming Pools (Drank). The Recipe was released with much anticipation but failed commercially charting only at 23 on the Billboard Rap section, not even cracking the hot 100. Swimming Pools (Drank) was a completely different story the song was received with great critical acclaim and sales numbers charting at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both songs though failed lyrically. The Recipe was all about smoking marijuana hence the instrumental sampling of \\"Smoking weed with you, because you taught me to.\\" It's a little overly obvious the message he's trying to get across. Swimming Pools (Drank) is even more guilty with the entire song revolving around alcohol. Let's be honest here, how many of us have not heard a million songs about weed and the sauce? On top of the creative but overall bad lyrics, the songs themselves get increasingly more annoying the more you listen to them. Lamar's nasally singing voice doesn't do wonders for the ears.<br />Luckily after the two mediocre singles the album gets a little more deep. Lyrics get a little bit better and there are some songs that are very well done. Both of the songs Good Kid and m.A.A.d City stand out as two of the best songs on the album. Lamar finally gets a little zing in his flow for m.A.A.d City being a little more upbeat over the spitfire steel drums. Lyrically the song Compton is the strongest with both Dr. Dre and Lamar talking about their roots in Compton.<br />Unfortunately with Good Kid: m.A.A.d City for ever good there is a bad.A few of the songs featured on the album go from boring to just straight up painful. Under that painful category would be B*tch Don't Kill My Vibe. The guitar instrumentals do absolutely nothing to grab your attention while the hook for the song is painstakingly awful, I haven't heard a worse hook in a song since Tyga though repeating the words \\"Rack city b*tch\\" over and over passed as a good song. Later in the album we hit the tracks \\"Sing about me, I'm Dying of Thirst\\" and \\"Real\\" one right after the next. Between these two songs we get 19 minutes and 27 seconds of incredible mediocrity. Forgettable hooks, boring rapping but ultimately just drawn out for several minutes longer than they should have lasted, I look at those two songs as a very late 20 minute intermission to the album.<br />Kendrick Lamar's debut album comes off as a unique but long, boring and at only rare moments great. The critical reception given to this album has been incredible but undeserved. Good Kid isn't a bad album, it just comes off as dry and almost completely emotionless.<br /><br />6/10
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this is a very good game even better than temple run and it also allows you to unlock people and boards and I love the new upgrades

B007XGJK4G|5.0|If you loved Bob Marley back in the day, you will love this in-depth look at an icon.  So many things, I, as an American fan in the seventies, never knew about Marley.  This is a  really wonderful, informative look at the man, his times, and his music.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book blew me away. I bought this book on a whim, I had no clue who Adam Brown was. I don't think I've ever read a book faster than this, I just couldn't put it down. Adam's story has changed my opinion on addiction and his story has inspired me. Read it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Too obtuse as to why Charlie acts the way he does. did not get all the hidden meanings in what had happened with Aunt Helen
B002AS463W|4.0|It will definately keep your attention!<br />I love this movie - it's funny, dramatic, sexy... everything!<br />It's a love story - but kind of twisted!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This a great read with old pictures in it that keep you going. The only two things that I do not like about this book is that even the ten to eleven year olds can handle the bits of romance but not the very bad words. Also I would wait to read it until you are pretty sure you will remember it in in January 2014.  Why? Because the end of the book is a major cliffhanger and the sequel I will not be out until January 2014.  The photos are fascinating and what amazes me is that the photos are real at have undergone a tiny bit of editing from the time period around : 1938/39-1940.Wow amazing book. If you like this book read the Hunger Games series and the long but worth it Maximum Ride series.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is definitely entertaining, but you really have to separate yourself from book and movie. If you LOVED the books, take it with a grain of salt that this is a movie and it's not exactly like the book. Otherwise, I enjoyed it and the cast was great! Much better than I expected (especially after Twilight epically failed).
0307352153|5.0|I just finished Susan Cain's Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking and while I was reading I loved to talk to everyone about how introverted I am. I mean everyone: family, friends, co-workers, complete strangers. Anybody and everybody.  And not many of them believed me either. After all, in any given group, I am easily the most obnoxious person in the room. I am boisterously social, and love public speaking. These are not really introverted traits.  On the other hand I can just as easily pass up social gatherings for a quiet night reading, I am highly self reflective  and love listening to people's stories. I have a little of both in me.<br /><br />Cain's term for someone who is both and extrovert and an introvert is ambivert. I am not sure that, that describes me, but extroversion and introversion exist on a continuum. You will not find a pure extrovert or introvert; yet we have our tendencies toward either pole. In Quiet, Cain draws on a broad range of research  about introversion. She describes in these pages the \\"man of contemplation\\" (which contrasts with the extrovert, \\"man of action\\").  In praise of introverts, she describes the gifts introverts bring to the table in a world that often holds up the charismatic extrovert up as the ideal.<br /><br />Cain describes this ideal of extroversion as a relatively recent phenomenon. Before the likes of Dale Carnegie, self help guru of public speaking and author of How to Win Friends and Influence People, the self-help section of your bookstore had more to do with character development. Today positive,  gregarious  go-getters (i.e. Tony Robbins) help you get ahead in life and \\"be successful,\\" often dispensing advice on relationships and public speaking.  However  this growing cultural preference for extroversion overlooks what introverts bring to the table.  Independent thinkers who work alone come up with technological breakthroughs; think tanks produce group think.  This isn't to say that introverts do not need extroverts to help them get their ideas across, but sometimes the creative process demands a more singular vision than a communal process allows.<br /><br />In part two Cain describes the biological and psychological factors which make extroverts extroverts and introverts introverts. Children who are hypersensitive to outside stimuli tend to grow up to be more introverted .  However temperament is not destiny and introverts can function highly in a variety of jobs which are traditionally seen as more extroverted roles (i.e. sales, public speakers, etc.) That isn't to say that these \\"roles\\" do not take their tole on introverts but by providing space in their schedule for introverts to `recharge,' they are able to take on roles and functions which serve them in pursuing their passions.<br /><br />In part three of this book, Cain examines the Asian-American experience as an example of a culture who's ideal is not extroversion. She tells the stories of various first and second generation Asian-Americans and their struggle to navigate  America's extroverted culture (especially in regard to academics and business).<br /><br />In her final section, Cain turns her attention to how extroverts and introverts relate to one another, when and how much introverts should act more extroverted,  and how to cultivate and challenge quieter kids in their development.<br /><br />This book was great throughout. Susan Cain makes a compelling case that introverts bring essential gifts to the table. In one section of the book she describes how risk-adverse  introverts knew that the crash of 2008  was coming while the extroverted \\"Men of Action\\" charged on full speed ahead.  The introverts had thoughtfully weighed the evidence while the extroverts didn't stop to think. But there voice wasn't heard because they didn't assert themselves the way extroverts do. Clearly we need the gifts of both extroverts and introverts in our communities.She also talks to introverts aboutmanaging social anxiety and fear of public speaking.  Cain has had to face her own fears of public speaking but with practice and preparation she has become more comfortable and successful at it.<br /><br />Cain offers her book to introverts and those who love someone who is an  introvert. Certainly that describes us all. However I liked this book because it helped me get in touch with aspects of my character which are more introverted. Even if I'm still the most obnoxious person in the room, I give this book 5 stars ★★★★★<br /><br />Thank you to Random House for providing me acopy of this book through the Water Brook Multnomah Blogging for Books program. This is my honest review.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Fantastic cast, great graphics, and entertaining and creative story about childhood characters from Tooth Fairy to Santa Claus and hilarious Hugh Jackman as the Easter Bunny. I highly recommend!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wholesome, clever, and charming. The characters are fantastic and the stories are engaging. It's a shame that they only made 4 seasons. We need more television programs like this. This show does not have to rely on sex and violence for it to be addictive. It is like the British version of Little House on the Prairie and at the same time very unique and refreshing. This show will entertain any adult but you can feel safe watching it with your &#34;little'ns&#34; :-) I can't say enough good things about this show. You will love it!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Hate to say it, but even tho this was cheaper, I bought the Target special edition one. The extra 2 songs are always nice when you're dealing with a cd that only has 10 songs to begin with. But several of the songs on here are > 7-8 mins each, so you definitely get a great amount of music still.<br />Songs are amazing. Album is great from start to finish. Just buy it. You won't regret it.
B007REV4T8|2.0|I found that this was not a full-screen product. It detracts from the presentation. This fact was not on the promotion.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Its justa great sound from two veterans that still can deliver ... love the &#34;harmony&#34; of Steve and Eric ...did  4 degades ago and still do.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is simple and fun so far. But right off the bat they start throwing quests at you that require gems (the currency you have to buy) to complete. This is not a good sign for things to come.
B008S4FZHI|3.0|A very good story with a diabolical villain. A little slow in places when bogged down with medical details, but worth the read
B00422LESO|5.0|This is a fantastic play on Jane Austen 's novel. It doesn't mimic the novels like most authors try to portray, but instead Hale takes significant pieces of Austens works and turns them into a modern story. Great read!
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|There is nothing new here.  There is a reason these tracks never made it to print before and that is because they are poorly recorded and mixed.  I am a huge Hendrix fan and this left me not only disappointed, but actually angry that this garbage was released.  Go out a get a copy of Jimi Blues and hopefully it will erase the memory of this junk.
B008MM9630|4.0|it seem to be a neat game I just. started playing it so I have not made it far enough to really make an oppion yet
B007H1HQW0|4.0|This definitely takes some practice! I suggest using all different types of bottles to practice with. I started off with beer, mikes hard, snapple and even spaghetti jars. It takes some time to get used to what pressure is best, as well as the best grip. Definitely watch you tube tutorials, and invest in more sand paper, it will make evening out the bottles and smoothing out sharp edges a lot easier!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|If you like pop music, you will love this CD from the king of pop! All of his greatest and hippest songs are piled into this compilation and you can just sit back and let it play over and over again. Get your boogie shoes out! And grab a kleenex for songs like Ben! A[...] Have fun with it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love the toons they are so funny. I cant wait for ep2 where's my crown.  I already saw the first ep. chuck time
B009H2PCNC|5.0|I just had to get that \\"Music for\\" line in the title. The sounds on \\"Lux\\" really do recall Eno's \\"Music for Airports\\" (Ambient 1, 1978) and his \\"Discreet Music\\" (Obscure no. 3, 1975) releases. Simple, slowly moving, sketches, based around, what I presume is a treated piano (credits just say \\"Written and Produced by Brian Eno\\", specifying \\"Additional Musicans\\" Leo Abrahams on Moog Guitar, and Neil Catchpole on Violins and Violas). The sustained dissolves and fades of single notes, at times bring to mind \\"Apollo\\", with its sense of calm and accompanying suspense.<br /><br />The four tracks are almost anonymously titled, \\"Lux 1\\", \\"Lux 2\\", \\"Lux 3\\" and \\"Lux 4\\", each being close to 20 minutes long, with none actually hitting that mark. The disc could pleasantly run as a continuous loop, achieving the desired background music effect Eno descibed in the liner notes to \\"Discreet Music\\" (1975). \\"Lux\\" is taken from a composition by Eno for The Great Gallery of the Palace of Venaria, Turin, Italy. According to the website Volumina, \\"Brian Eno's sound installation '12 Seasons, Music for the Great Gallery of the Palace of Venaria' was created expressly for the Great Gallery of the Reggia di Venaria. The sound installation created by Brian Eno explores the possible aesthetics offered by new technology in relation to the ambient, with a series of musical movements which stratify into each other. To take full advantage of the acoustic characteristics of the Great Gallery, Eno worked directly inside the room in order to obtain the proper balance between the sounds and the acoustic reverberations. The twelve movements are played over the speaker system, with two speakers located at the entrance and two at the exit of the Great Gallery, surrounding visitors with sounds that vary according to their position inside the Gallery.\\"<br /><br />From this, Eno distilled the four parts found on \\"Lux\\". Of some interest, Peter Chilvers performs the task of \\"Additional Mixing\\". Chilvers is know for his work on the Burning Shed label with Tim Bowness and Theo Travis among others, his solo piano album on that label, his recent work with Eno, and his recent band with Bowness, Slow Electric.<br /><br />There are four cardstock \\"exclusive prints\\" (by Eno) in the \\"First Edition\\" of the CD (and the LP), bringing to mind the fact that Eno included four prints by artist Peter Schmidt in early UK editions of \\"Before and After Science\\". The whole package is attractive in an LP-style, gatefold sleeve, the prints in one pocket and the disc in an inner sleeve in the other pocket. The whole presentation appears as a genuine and successful effort by Eno to revisit his early experiments in ambient and minimalist music. I was more than pleasantly surprised to hear that, after 38 years, Brian Eno is still able to achieve the necessary restraint to craft music of such unimposing and subtle qualities.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The rebirth of Doctor Who in 2005 has been fabulously done. They have kept alive the story of The Dr through the ages and brought new life into it. The continuous story within the episodes makes you have to watch from beginning to end but it is worth it. The outcomes are not always expected and not always happy like so many other shows. For fans of Doctor Who, you know that he does what he has to to preserve the timeline and the people of Earth. The characters throughout the season have been pretty well cast and make the experience enjoyable.
B00164GDD2|1.0|This is the second &#34;blue ray&#34; DVD I get from amazon and again it looks really grainy. Since its only for our sons play room I will keep it, but do not buy this if you want a high quality &#34;blue ray&#34; copy do not buy this no matter how cheap it goes.

B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Prime Cuts: Victor's Crown, Magnificent, In Jesus' Name<br /><br />The name Darlene Zschech is synonymous with worship music.Fronting the worship of Australian mega church Hillsong for years, Zschech has had revived the popularity of live congregation worship music since their 1996 breakthrough album \\"Shout to the Lord.\\"  Where worship used to be rigid and dull, Hillsong has taken the stiffness out of it by stripping away the \\"weirdness\\" of raising our hands and dancing up and down before God's presence.  With worship favorites such as \\"At the Cross,\\"\\"Hosanna,\\" \\"Worthy is the Lamb,\\" \\"Made Me Glad\\" and \\"God is Able,\\" Darlene Zschech and her Hillsong camaraderie make worship music zestful, memorable and engaging again.<br /><br />However, despite selling over 12 million records, releasing 20 live albums, being nominated for countless Dove Awards and having \\"Shout to the Lord\\" enlisted by many hymnbooks alongside the timeless canticles of Wesley and Watts, Darlene Zschech has never released a solo live worship album. Though she has released three superb solo studio albums, Revealing Jesus is her debut solo live worship record. Recorded at the Church of the Highlands in Birmingham, Alabama, on September 28 and 29 of last year, Zschech has outdone herself. This is truly a seminal work!<br /><br />Though Revealing Jesus utilizes the Hillsong template of panoramic, built-for-stadium anthems (and who can blame Zschech, since most of Hillsong's records were helmed by her), it also adds a welcoming nostalgia with the inclusion of a couple of revamped hymns and Hillsong oldies. Also, Grammy Award-winning producer Israel Houghton and superstars such as Kari Jobe and Michael W. Smith are able to give this record an added dose of variegated flavor. Though it's only February, it's safe to say that Revealing Jesus towers as one of the best worship records released this year for at least three reasons.<br /><br />First, and perhaps most foremost, this disc is Jesus-centered. Never reticent about whether or not the mention of the name \\"Jesus\\" will sell records - or not - Zschech makes sure that each and every track here is about Him. This is what every worship album ought to be patterned after. Jesus never gets more glorified than when Zschech sings about Christ's finished work on the Cross with the newly penned single \\"Victor's Crown.\\" And if there is going to be a follow-up to one of those explosive, anthemic-building ballads in the vein of \\"Mighty to Save,\\" it's \\"Victor's Crown.\\" It's majestic and powerful, and when Zschech deftly sings \\"At the cross the work was finished/You were buried in the ground/But the grave could not contain you/For you wear the Victor's Crown,\\" a thousand hallelujahs would not be enough. On the other hand, \\"God is Here\\" is a full-pelt opener which hurtles along a flurry of urgent, spunky guitar riffs and flailing drums with Zschech singing of her desire to reveal Jesus and \\"seeing him face to face.\\" Vocally, this Hillsong matriarch has never sounded stronger and it is a treat to see her tackle such a propulsive barn burner again.<br /><br />Second, \\"Revealing Jesus\\" is an important album because it reveals the pastoral heart of Zschech. While few artists are not that generous to share the microphone unless they are singing with a mega star, Zschech shares the spotlight on numerous occasions with her backing band. She truly lives out the coda of the title of her former book The Great Generational Transistor when she has her prot&eacute;g&eacute; Barry Southgate handling most of the vocals of \\"All That We Are.\\" Interesting, though, is that the \\"whoa\\" echoes and thundering drums of \\"All That We Are\\" have a striking resemblance to Hillsong's \\"Running.\\" When Zschech shares the microphone with Kari Jobe on \\"Yours Forever\\" (a re-recorded track from her You Are Love Deluxe album), she reminds us of the times she would sing with the then-inexperienced Brooke Fraser (on \\"Hosanna\\" and \\"You'll Come\\"), tenderly nurturing her tomaximize her God-given singing potential.<br /><br />Third, these songs demonstrate that Zschech is more than just a singer, she is truly a worshipper. Instead of just singing on \\"In Jesus' Name,\\" Zschech takes the time to minister to the women gathered that night who were suffering from cancer. And when she sings about how God fights for us over this bombastic spiritual warfare anthem, you can't help but feel ministered to. Another highlight is her take of the old Hillsong oldie \\"Magnificent\\" (originally from Hillsong's Blessed). Adorned with some angelic sounding harp and gorgeous strings, \\"Magnificent\\" is such a ministering moment that one can't help but bask in the goodness of Jesus. Even when Zschech does the hymn \\"My Jesus I Love Thee,\\" she doesn't let an opportunity slip by when she turned the ending of the old church favorite into a time of proclaiming her love towards Jesus. All in all, Revealing Jesus lives up to its apt title. Here Zschech reveals Jesus in all his beauty and glory; but more than that, she also reveals her heart - a heart that beats with love and worship for the King of kings.God-given singing potential.<br /><br />Third, these songs demonstrate that Zschech is more than just a singer, she is truly a worshipper.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game but I don't like that fact you don't get any of the perks if you don't have a facebook I think they should give you an option to pay for things with your coins so you can get the extra chips without having to go on facebook.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I think this book was fantastic! I absolutely loved everything about it. I could actually feel what every character in this book was feeling. There was not one flaw in this book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that loves to read. I would give this book five stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app was well worth the $6.99 that I paid. It was a very nice to see such a good game because I used to have survival craft. This game is very nice. The only thing is I wish they had more mods and minecarts. Also they don't have a use for Redstone so I can't mine it. But other then that this is epic. Btw I have 6.1
B00B99KJR0|2.0|it says it's a 4.99 game yet I only got 3 levels to play. fun game but not worth the headache of actually downloading it.

B005S9EKCW|1.0|1) The gross miscasting of Russell Crowe. Not only does he have a mediocre singing voice, he simply does not carry off the role.<br /><br />2) The overuse of extreme close-up. (Unless you watch it on a smart phone, I guess?)<br /><br />3) The director's choice to treat the orchestral accompaniment as if it were typical movie background music, and thus the balance is so bad the lyrics wind up sounding sterile and weakened without the integral enhancement of the lush orchestration. What an ignorant approach.<br /><br />I would only buy this video if there were two features:<br /><br />1) An optional voice overdub for Crowe's singing. They could choose from dozens of candidates who daily knock these songs out of the park in theaters around the world.<br /><br />2) Separate volume controls for the vocals and the instrumental track so the listener can restore the balance that the composers (and every singe other musical every written) intended.
B0091WQ58E|5.0|Enjoyed in the theater and counted days til I could get DVD.<br />I bought this as soon as I got my Fire.<br />Love Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.<br />in BOTH movies.

0744014549|5.0|Tomb Raider: The Art of Survival is a comprehensive art book that details, well, the art of the recent Tomb Raider. It has over 200 pages of high quality art of the characters (especially Lara), enemies, weapons, and, most of all, the gorgeous environments. The book itself is huge (11.7 x 8.6 inches) with an enduring image of Lara on the front cover. Also, the paper is of high quality. I would definitely recommend this for fans of the series and those who enjoyed the latest Tomb Raider. Revisit your adventure with this amazing art book. :)

B000002MG1|5.0|After signing with a major label and releasing two albums that a few would argue were more commercial, R.E.M. decided not to tour to support Out Of Time (1991) and instead return to the studio to record what may be their finest record. Released in the fall of 1992, at a time when grunge was huge, the band came out with an album that had little more hope and sentimentality in it. It's ironic because it was orignally intended as a more angry answer to the band being accused of becoming mainstream. What became of it was the band making a more introspective work with Michael Stipe's lyrics reflecting on the pains and struggles of life. Many singles released here but the two most popular were \\"Everybody Hurts\\", a song that is brilliantly simple and direct, as well as \\"Man On The Moon.\\" Other highlights include \\"Try Not To Breathe\\", \\"Sweetness Follows\\", \\"Nightswimming\\" and my personal favorite \\"Find The River\\" which may be Stipe's best lyrical moment.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|This is an all time favorite. It seemed I had just ordered it and it arrived so fast. This is great. To dream of Depp and eat chocolate.
B000002O1P|5.0|While critical and public reactions have been mixed, this album from Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, released in 1985, is in my opinion one of their best. Released at a time when Bruce Springsteen came out with Born In The U.S.A, this could be compared to that in a way. Originally concieved as a concept album, creative differences within the group made it a frustrating record to complete legend has it. It may be over produced and I don't know what exactly the concept is, this is still a good set of songs with plenty of variety. The popular single was \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\", which included an Alice In Wonderland style music video. A different kind of album for Petty and the group but a great one at that.

It was a great story and I'm really looking forward to the sequel told from his perspective.  Sure, there were spots that could've used a smidge more development, but all in all, I'm ready to read the book again...that's saying something!

0307887898|4.0|Last week I picked up a copy of a book called \\"the lean startup,\\" which I'm almost done reading.  Unlike other business books which focus on strategy, this one diverges away and focuses on experimentation, feedback, and  learning.  The reason I particularly like this book is because it offers practical advice for entrepreneurs.  It doesn't come without flaws, however, as the author fails to provide enough examples of non-technology startups who have used his methodology.  The author still maintains, however, that his approach can be applied to any startup, regardless of industry.  I think that if you're going to make that kind of claim, you better be able to back it up with more examples.<br /><br />Aside from that discrepancy, this book is a breath of fresh air.  It offers some great tips on how to gauge demand for your idea in an efficient, cost effective way.  The premise is that if you're making a product that nobody wants then it doesn't matter if you're on time and on budget.  The lean startup methodology seeks to help the entrepreneur learn this ahead of time, before pouring a lot of time and money into a failing cause.  At the heart of the lean startup is this idea of short feedback loops, which aims to get quick feedback from consumers for every feature that's being tested.  In this process of constant iteration, the entrepreneur is able to better match the product to the needs of the market.<br /><br />It's definitely worth a read, especially if you are interested in technology startups. Highly recommended<br /><br />Feel free to follow my blog I just started on technology and business.<br /><br />oreocookie88.wordpress.<br />com

I have tried 9 times and it appears as if everything is going fine until the very end when it switches from downloading to what should be installing. It is extremely frustrating because the game sounds as if it would be quite enjoyable if I could get it to work. everything else on my device is doing great so I am at a loss.  I will keep trying though.

I was hanging out with a group of friends inside of a shopping center in Yokosuka, Japan and heard the song \\"Like I Love You.\\" I also own his Future Sex Love Sounds collection and had to check \\" The 20/20 Experience\\" in order to compare musical sounds. \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is definitely a music departure from \\"Future Sex Love Sounds.\\" However, many of the songs are remarkable and there is something for various men and women in this compilation.  Currently, I greatly enjoy the musical tracks \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", \\"Suit &Tie\\", \\"Spaceship Coupe\\", \\"Let The Groove In\\", and \\"Mirror\\". Obviously, the most favorite songs are going to vary from person to person, but \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" by Justin Timberlake is a suitable collection for those who are open to listening to romantic R&B music with subtle hints of pop music.
B00992CF6W|4.0|in the beginning I was impressed with this app then a few weeks later it deletedmy previous games and all my data was gone. I was angry with it because of the features it had compared with the Pc version. will be a rip off if not improved.
B009DBKKIY|5.0|I have had previous good experiences with other Caf&eacute; Del Mar collections and trusted that this \\"The Very Best of Caf&eacute; Del Mar\\" compilation would be just as high quality or even better. One of my first Caf&eacute; Del Mar compilations is Caf&eacute; Del Mar Vol. 9. I had purchased it in December 2005 and reviewed it on August 8, 2011.  \\"The Very Best of Caf&eacute; Del Mar\\" is even better and includes among some of the following satisfying songs: \\"Beautiful Strange\\" by Bedrock, \\"Breather\\" (Arithunda Mix) by Afterlife, \\"Get Back To Serenity\\" by Vargo, \\"Sun Is Shining\\" by Reunited, \\"Holding On\\" by Miro, \\"Transmit Liberation\\" by Single Cell Orchestra, \\"Art Noveau\\" by Jens Gad, \\"Desire\\" (Ambient Mix) by Blank & Jones, and \\"Morning Light\\" by Swen. The Very Best of Caf&eacute; Del Mar is a three cd set containing 13 songs each by various artists and is best for those who like lounge and/or chillout music compilations.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The was so engrossed in the first book that I could not wait to read this one. Both have lots of details and great character development. The intriguing story continues and you can't put it down
B005K17RU0|4.0|I never fail to check out this app everytime I use my Fire HD.  It's very good and the graphics are very engaging.  I visit all options it offers.  My favorite is the Activity Forecast, which gives a fairly accurate assessment of how the current day would turn out and give good suggestions as to which outdoor activity is best to undertake.  The map is good and gives a bird's eye view of what type of precipitation is currently in the area, or over the whole state.  One thing I noticed though is that there are occasions in which it wouldn't refresh itself whether automatically or manually so it could display the current weather information at that very moment.  Other than that, this is highly recommended especially for those weather geeks and outdoor enthusiasts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Why did I buy it? I saw the movie and decided to try the book.<br />The book was much better than the movie. The movie had view details and you reall did not get to know the characters and their back grounds.
1449415881|5.0|This is definitely one of my new favorite cartoons.  Great for a laugh as I head out the door each morning!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lots of detail, engrossing characters. I am disappointed that Stieg Larsson for my selfish reason that I would have liked to have read all ten books that he planned to write
B005BC3MBQ|2.0|The Video quality wasn't much to complain about. The audio quality was fairly good for the film but... The two stars are because the disc had no scratches and looked completely fine. As I got through the film it froze completely towards the end. I couldn't use my remote to turn it off or anything. I sat there stunned and unplugged it and now am immediately getting a full refund. (3/10) wouldn't buy again.
0316228532|4.0|THIS WAS A HARD BOOK TO GET INTO, TOO MANY CHARACTERS.  BUT ONCE YOU GET STARTED YOU REALLY WANTED TO GET TO THE ENDING.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend most of my time online using this app. It's easy to use and makes organizing my pins no trouble at all.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|i LOVE JOSH AND ANYTHING HE SINGS, EACH CE IS BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE. CAN'TWAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app will help you understand the meaning of how to take care of a horse it help me a lot but I'm still waiting for a horse on my b-day
B007V2UGPE|4.0|A great way to pass the time. You won't be disappointed with this app. It is a great way to pass the time.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book because I've been a bi fan of John Green on Youtube for quite some time. due to massive amounts of talk about Hazel and Augustus and their relationship i was worried this would be a more love story for females. (me being male, decided that i'd give it a shot anyway) and all i can say is...worth it. Yes it is a love story, but it is SO MUCH MORE all rolled into one amazing story which i read faster than any other book I've ever read. and it is easily one of the best. worth the money, worth the time. if you're emotional, bring the tissues so not to stain the wonderful pages of this book with your TEARS (seriously, if you are emotional, you will cry.)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Very addicting show!  Once you watch one episode you get sucked it.  I was glad friends told me about it.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I liked the case.  But due to a 5 year old in the home and the fact that the kindle is also used as a reward and teaching tool we replaced it with the Otter box.
