B005Q1W10A|5.0|Product came quickly and in excellent condition! Terrific DVD with the English version.<br />Would recommend this to all fans of Downton Abbey.and English
B007SGM084|5.0|What a fast pace book..very detailed..leaves nothing out.you see what is happening...almost like watching a video.take the time to read it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Nice story don't know where its heading and enjoyed the characters.  I would recommend this book some parts were slow going.
B009NUV0E8|4.0|This movie really pushed the action movie envelope to another level. It has fighter jets, attack helicopters, a tank chase scene, plenty of guns, action and hot women! It also has some good acting and special efx! A must have for every 007 fan!
B00005JL0I|3.0|I'm not old enough to be nostalgic for the 60's. Relatively silly, even compared to Austin Powers, which wasn't supposed to be taken seriously.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! I've watched every episode of every season at least twice! I canf wait for a new season!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Loads of fun .<br />The beach is great,sounds and graphics are fantastic.  Having a great time playing this game app<br />.
B008J34466|1.0|The laungage is not acceptable.  Sad that such a talented women has gone down this path.  i brought the CD thinking that I would see her in her upcoming concert and there is no way I would go now.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think this is one of those books that every person should read at least once and, more importantly, do the exercise at the end to establish what your Love Languages are. Even better is if your partner (or kids) do it too.<br /><br />It really does somehow distill what makes people tick (from a love perspective in terms of how you treat them / how you would like them to treat you) into 5 elements.<br /><br />It's not a long read and is certainly worth it if I look at how it has changed how I interact with my partner (and kids) and vice-versa.
B009L6UDUG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It has plenty of action, spy gadgets and a good story. It looks so much better on blu than when I 1st saw it on dvd. The audio and video is superb.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|Bought it for &#34;What Makes You Beautiful&#34; and was also looking for upbeat and fun music.  This was that, just fun fluff of songs.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I love Keira Knightley, but this is not the best movie she has been in by far.  I felt like the movie was all over the place and was not sure where it was even really taking me...it still never seemed to take me anywhere, but it was entertaining enough.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The characterization of the girl in foster care and the relationship  has with her social  worker is fascinating . The Bay Area setting brings the book home. one learns a lot about taking risks with one's emotions.  and  we learn to look at plants in a much<br /><br /> deeper way.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|This is truly a great show and although I think this season was good, it wasn't quite 5-star good for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on my Kindle Fire (original), as well as many other devices that I have. I think Evernote is great and the software is well-written and of good quality.<br /><br />I use it a lot for to-do lists and so having the tablet nearby is a handy way of doing quick updates to the list.<br /><br />Evernote are pretty innovative, which means that there are relatively frequent updates, but I am happy to put up with the slight inconvenience for the new functionality they bring out every so often.<br /><br />Great software.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. The audio and video quality are awesome. Lots of action and great special effects.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Had not seen Raiders in some time and was amazed when seeing it again how truly entertaining it was, even after all these years and having seen it many times before I still loved it.  Having it on blu-ray did make a difference in the clarity of the film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching season 1 and not even a month later I watched all three seasons.  I love movies/tv shows from this era and I can't wait to see season 4.  Although I do have a love-hate relationship with these season finales. ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. It's so cool how you can take pictures of the horses. The one thing I do wish is that you didn't have to pay for anything.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Follow up to Cold Fact but just as good. I wonder how today's artists would fair if they had to wait decades to get fan approval. Great job.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|I use this software on my (original) Kindle Fire ... mostly in emergencies (to restart servers, etc) in a pinch. It works fine in as much as trying to control your server remotely on a tablet goes.<br /><br />I would not really use it for much more that what I do, but that is more a limitation of the device than the software.<br /><br />However, it installed easily, comes across as quality software and was fairly intuitive to get up and running.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Oh man I just love this movie. I watch it often! I think i am officially a TREKKI! Just waiting for the next movie now.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|I WAS SO EXCITED TO KNOW HE HAD PUT OUT A VINYL COLLECTABLE I JUST HAD TO GET, THEN CAME A CD. SO NOT TOO HAPPY.
1476712042|2.0|After reading all these wonderful reviews I was thinking I was in for a great love story.... I was wrong! In this book Travis (the lead male) seems like a complete psychopath. He seems obessed with Abby, very creepy! The writing was good but the story could have been better... less stalkerish! HATED Travis in Beautiful Disaster but Liked him in Walking Disaster.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I like the cd, it kind of grows on you after a while. It is a totally different type of music.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|So far I have been bored.  I liked the thought of an angel story but this one ranks as absurd.  I expected more depth.
6305781427|5.0|This items was exactly what I had expected when placing my order.  I am pleased with the item and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|Very original plot, which is so hard to come by these days. I don't know how I went so long without seeing this movie but it's definitely lasted the test of time.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|The on-air rant was poetic... I enjoyed the feelings that were expressed by the different characters. Every pregnancy is indeed different!
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla is cute and she's got style. She's the perfect addition to our monster high collection. Would recommend especially if you are into monster high.
B000669GAI|5.0|As a teenager in the early 90's, Pearl Jam is OBVIOUSLY my favorite band of all time. This album is a great mix of some of their best songs......although I think every track from &#34;Ten&#34; should be on here, it definitely has a good mix of stuff.  If you love PJ this is a great purchase!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|this solved my problem for a couple of days, my kindle fire will not charge at all now.  my kindle fire started turning itself off even though it was charged and now I can't get it to turn on or charge.  don't know what its problem is.  my kindle fire is  a little over six months old and apparently is dead
B004HWYTP4|1.0|After ordering it when i tried downloading it said unavaliable please try later.  I tried later and it said the same thing.  I never got to see the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it deffinatly passes the time. a couple boards were easy but others were more difficult.i like it and im gonna keep playin it
B00821OX98|5.0|Very interesting. Aliens and Survival topics.  What more can you want?  Can't wait to see season 2 and the follow-on.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|just started playing this game and so far I'm enjoying it!  its for kids and adults.  if you haven't tried it...I recommend it.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Gifted to daughter,she loves that show........She says it was great and will buy more series on show,thumbs up people! Done
0689835604|5.0|I am a speech therapist, and I purchased this book in order to teach basic body parts and for answering &#34;where&#34; questions.  So far, the child I am working with loves this book!  It keeps his attention, and he is learning from it.  He also enjoys lifting the flaps, which is helpful for fine motor skills.
B007M0UF6A|5.0|This is a very good movie. Problem is that it arrived in less than perfect condition. However, I did enjoy watching it. (At least for the first few times when the DVD was playing correctly.) This is a great movie,  though. Lots of action and adventure. Good watch!
0307970299|3.0|Enjoyed the descriptions and hardships of hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Parts about how mother's death and divorce from Cheryl's husband affected her got a little repetitious. It seemed like she never overcame the innate immaturity of having to use careless sex to keep her going.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|son ordered game when I wasn't home. don't approve of it's violence or it's grueling graphics. Not the kind of game I approve of.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works great. Since the kindle did not have a built in clock, I downloaded it and use it daily as my alarm clock. I have had no issues!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|his game is the best....its better than temple run and temple run2 . its funny and keeps u playing.its great for anyone of any age....this game is great. u wont regret getting it.... :-)
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Love this game! Its fun and gets your mind thinking. I would definatly recommend this game for people who like a challenge.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|These are excellent movies! Much better than I had expected. These are very good actors in the film. I recommend these movies to everyone! Thank you very much! I am very pleased with this product.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Ok, so I will admit, I expected a lot more from this book, that's not to say I didn't like it, because I did, but I have read over and over about how funny this book is, just as funny as Wallbanger, but it was just kind of funny, not lol funny like I expected. Which is fine, everyone reads differently and has their own opinions, and that's just mine.<br /><br />The story as a whole wasn't anything new, but it was a good story none the less, well written and it flowed really well, it was one of the books where you say, \\"One more chapter\\" then four hours later and the book is done, Ya I read it in less then a day. I think it was because the beginning of the book you know they get together at some point, you just don't know how, when or why, so you want to keep reading to get there. I will say the second half of the book was significantly better then the first, I felt the first was too business, but the second half was great.<br /><br />Now for the reason for the four stars, I don't think I've read a book written in this type of POV before, I felt like it was one of those extras on the DVD 's where the director is doing commentary over the movie, there was even a few times Drew says Pause right there. He would also say things like, See that look on her face, No I don't because you haven't told me what the look is, this is a book not a movie. I just didn't care for all the talking right at me thing. But again, just my opinion.<br /><br />I still really liked the book, it had great characters and I look forward to more books in the series.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Every nine years Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy & director Richard Linklater have made a 'conversation' movie. Progressing through time with the same characters to the current release 'Before Midnight' is fun for fans. Not everybody likes intelligent conversation. But if you do, this film starts the cycle. All participants contribute to the writing & it shows. Start with this, then go to 'Before Sunset' & 'Before Midnight'. Then wait another nine years for the next treat!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app has great activities that my daughter enjoys!<br />The biggest thing us that it works great and the pictures are well done.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is just as good as the price! pretty cheap for a good looking mouse and with an above average performance.<br /><br />The software that is downloadable from their site is easy to use. Lightings are pretty cool and the way how you can change the Anchor Logo, I was hoping that I'd be able to change the whole lighting effects, but that kind of turned me down.<br /><br />I also like the weight adjustments for a perfect feel and accurate movement.<br /><br />I dont recommend this mouse for people with a small hand (like really really small).<br /><br />The packaging is so simple, but the thing I didnt like was when I pulled the mouse out, everything that came with it just fell/scattered. Or maybe I just pulled facing the wrong side?. But that shouldnt happen however, if the packaging is right.<br /><br />Overall, an above Average Gaming Mouse.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good game just wish you didn't run out of energy so fast and have to buy diamonds for everything...
B009NG1Q96|5.0|What will happen next!??  If you liked the previous selection books you will not be disappointed. I could not put the book down until the end, then I was wondering about when the next book will come out. This book kept you in suspense andleft you wanting MORE<br /> You will enjoy it!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show, completely addicted! Doesn't hurt that they are super hot, but the acting is great, story line is believable, just an all around great show!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awsomeness I love this game its great yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .... yaya.  :) :D opp pp opp opp farts farts. my life is like a fart.  just kidding.  this review looks stupid to you.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Very good I liked it so much I hope everyone that reads this book finds it as good as I did!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have only watched the first few episodes, but I can tell that this is going to be a great series.  It has top notch acting and great story line.  I recently finished the Breaking Bad series and this will be a suitable replacement.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|And small enough to keep in your bag without any concerns on space. I'm unwired probably 90% of the time but having the option not to be is great.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed the well told story because of the depth of each character. Reading And The Mountains Echoed, was time well spent.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is relaxing and I love the noise. Great game!  I play this game every day and all the time.
145210655X|5.0|The little ones love it and still find myself chuckling whenever I read it to them. Very sweet story for adult and little ones alike. Darth is a kind, patient, loving dad just like all others. Luke is a very fortunate young Jedi.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is really fun to play. My dad loves to play this game on my kindle. He finished the game on his phone, so he is doing it on my kindle now.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I traveled to London with my school's orchestra and this was one of the tunes they played - I really like the song and listening to it reminds me of that wonderful trip
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Sorry about this review people!<br />I am really having a hard time with this book and the author. Don't take me wrong, I am always interested in different points of view. This would be very interesting if I knew nothing about history the time or Jesus. But I do!<br />And my thoughts are WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!<br />Aslan says he has a PHD? And he is a Historian? I think he is more of a creative writer!<br />Aslan I don't understand the point of your twisting history and facts to the point you did. It only leads me to the conclusion your trying to hide a agenda in here.  What is it? Is it some kind of 1900 style progressive revolution theory?  Change the literature so you can manipulate history?<br />What is it that the progressive always says? It's ok to lie as long as the results are the one you desire!<br />Warning to young Christians who want to learn more about Jesus! This book has a progressive hidden agenda; it is NOT useful in ANY studies. This book was written to confuse and create doubt for you!<br />This book was written for what the Progressive call useful idiots and buba.<br />My advice is Learn the history/ culture of that age elsewhere, the Romans and Greeks knew how to write back then.<br />Then you will know the facts for yourself and then make your own Judgment!<br />I havent put a book in the trash in a long long time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is very cool and good for your hand eye coordination me an my siblings love it
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Bingo is  a good game lots of people have Facebook by I'm only 10  because my mom's said I can't have Facebook.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I can't put her books down. She has the kind of creative mind that weaves a story with foreshadowing throughout that makes you go back to re-read passages and chapters and still thinking for hours, WTF just happened?!  Her books always make me feel that way and I can't wait for more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game I usually don't give game ratings but I love this game so much that I have. The super jump shoes though I don't like. It's harder to not hit trains with them I wish there could be a disable shoes button, but other than that I love this game I recommend everyone to get it... :)
B000QXDED6|5.0|This movie is straight up beast. Nonstop action and adrenaline. The acting was great and the battle sequences were freaking awesome!
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|Well written, well acted, and incredibly real. Certainly not a light hearted movie. There is no real heroin, but you find yourself rooting for both main characters. Great movie.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Fun town builder game. Not too expensive to upgrade to the full version and tons of play value. Good non-violent option for kids. Caution! This is addictive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Any One In Your Family Can Play This It's Really For It'll Get You Saying OMG I ALMOST HAD IT!!!!!! Hahaha But Its Really Fun And Its FREE!!
B0037DGH4A|5.0|It just makes me feel good every time I listen to this music. I have loved Carlos Santana for years. This is some of his best work
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love this app for finding off boredom. It's cute, it's fun, it's challenging and on the whole very entertaining. I can't think of any cons. I highly recommend it for anyone, any age.
0061122416|5.0|It is the best book I have ever read and would read it over and over again. Awesome book and i would recommend it to everyone, especially to those who feel like giving up in life. This book is an inspiration.
0312588887|5.0|I loved this book again!  I've read it nearly yearly since it was first available.  Fantastic read.  A wonderful author.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Incredible app that lets you take notes share ideas and it is searchAble. Love it. I use it for work at home and to capture ideas on the go.
0812550706|3.0|I had heard much about this book and thought I should finally read it. I was ready for a truely great book as it had won both the Nebula and Hugo awards; a feat that is rarely accomplished. I think that the concept was interesting but it felt like a short story that had been fluffed out into a full length novel; which I guess it was. And as far as being on par with other double award winners - it is no Startide Rising, it is not Neuromancer and it is certainly not on par with Dune by any stretch of the imagination. A good book? Yes, but not a great one that will change the way you look at the world like Dune...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of the best stories I've ever experienced. It grabs your heart and mind, throws them in a blender, and pours out an emotional mind twisted smoothie.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It will let me install but it won't let me play I tried to uninstall and do it again but same result?
B006QQQ5SI|3.0|It does give some incite into the passion of birders but it was  not an exemplary movie.  The plot was contrived.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|after reading about 5 pages- I was hooked! This book Is impossible to put down- you'll be in love and attached to the charectors nearly instantly!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why did it end so early? Needs to be added to the list of movies that ended before their time.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Slow to start but necessary to deliver the fascinating conclusion to a story that leaves me thinking about the possibilities of our universe and ourselves within it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the idea for  this game and the love with minions banna a boy a boy oh a boy  and bable are my favorite sayings
B0063IH60K|5.0|It keeps me occupied for hours when I'm bored and you don't have to purchase Amazon Coins to continue playing.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The story of forbidden love, combined with the supernatural, and imagery that takes you there....this is a great read.  I will start the second book immediately and then wait for the third with the same impatience as very one else. And did I mention history and time travel? It seems preposterous but it all holds together, and will not let you go until you get through the last page.
B000P7V45S|5.0|For me this is the finest Genesis album of them all, musically and lyrically. This was the first one made after Peter Gabriel had quit, and it showed that the band could easily cope without him. The music explores various genres from the jazzy Dance On A Volcano, the folksy Entangled, and a title song that could have been a Sgt Pepper track. For those who prefer the more whimsical side of Genesis, there is Mad Mad Moon, and Robbery, Assault And Battery. Where the whole album differs from the Gabriel period is that the band have tightened up musically. There are no longer the self-indulgences  and theatrics that was Gabriel's speciality. But the band sound all the better for it.<br /><br />And of course there was Phil Collins assuming lead vocal duties discovering that he had a rather similar voice to Gabriel which was pure coincidence. Whatever you think of Phil and what he went on to do later, there's no denying his talent as a vocalist and as an excellent drummer. The track Los Endos captures his drumming skills perfectly.<br /><br />This is arguably one of the best prog albums, with no sign of any pomposity or pretentiousness that is the bane of so much within this genre. There isn't a dull moment and it remains timeless.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Some people will be annoyed with me but i only watch the new star trek movies and don't watch the old movies or shows.<br />Great movie great special effects and very exciting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Caring for your own horse is tons of fun!! This app gives a city boy like me a chance to see how real cowboys care for and raise thoroughbred for realistic competition. It's a lot of fun.
B004QCJA7W|1.0|We were sent 'Little Men' instead of Little Women...  Who knew it even existed?  I'll keep the book because it is 50+ years old and I love antique books, but it didn't help my high schooler who was in need of this book for a report!  We finally found it at the library after we realized ordering it again would take too long.  Oops!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game it is adictting once u start so this is a great game for u to download its good for people who are 10 -up so yeah but other wise its a really cool game
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had never heard of this until I stumbled upon it here. Very good show. I highly recommend watching it.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Enjoyable the whole movie no bad parts and a great plot along with the actors who make it very enjoyable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A good book is precious.  What more need I say? I spent hours enjoying this book and will recommend it to my friends.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|The movie was good but I couldn't stand the fact that Seth Rogan looked down (like a scared child) every time he talked with Barbara Streisand - which was most of the movie!
0061900656|4.0|I like how this book explains how babies need help and are too little for things like solid foods. I recommend this book as one of many to explain babies to older siblings, but it wouldn't be my top choice if you had to pick just one. (My favorite is &#34;When You Were Inside Mommy&#34;, also by Joanna Cole.)<br /><br />Thin pages (normal picture book, not board book) might be difficult for smaller children.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. I love it! So sad to hear its ending. Goodbye Dexter
B008M721MS|4.0|it is a very great app to use but ONLY ADD PEOPLE U KNOW AND DENY PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW  because i guy that friended me asked my to first have skype sex and then marry him THAT WAS CRAZY if that  happens to you immediately tell an adult and they will help you.  Love the app but just watch out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than temple run.it's better because they got more  characters and you can fly on a jetpack and more.
1401941893|5.0|This book is amazing I loved it and it changed the way I think to the better! I love Miranda Kerr she is a great example to young women like myself.
B00422LESO|4.0|A quick foray though all the Austen love plots played out through a modern protagonist.  It was a good read with some predictable turns but each one a pleasure to encounter.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|[[ASIN:B007FIY3VW Olive Office Premium]]Olive office premium is great app. The one that came on my Kindle Fire HD with 32th would not work properly without upgrading to premium. So download the app and enjoy using the app.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I mean... it was good but not very exciting.... nothing like the last two and the ending was just thrown together... the next one will hopefully make up for this one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever and u all should get it! I play it everyday and like every hour!! Really should get it! If u don't like it u r crazy!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I love the Robert Langdon series. Very thought provoking. Keep em coming. Oh yeah, when is the lost symbol movie coming out? Gotta have one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love the different styles to choose from, styles I have not seen in a free game. It's a good game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive I love Tasha. Kiloo & Sybo rock for making this app . But Prince K is so expensive
B00BKTFABE|3.0|When I first got it it was great I could take pics and videos but I went to HD and pressed one and now it says can not open or something like that .-.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I don't understand I thought u played the game candy crush but no all it does is show u what to do! Like how u can cheat and get help! I just wanted to play but no! I would rate this a 1 star!!!<br />????????????????
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Pretty quick read.  Loved the characters.  Loved the story in general.  Would love to find more from this author, and would love a continuance on this book, to see where life takes them!
B0000640S3|5.0|This is my favorite of all Rambo movie,  I simply like Rambo and my number action movie for all time.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so amazing. I just love the movie despicable me. even better I love the minions!! :) love it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After having only used my Chromecast for a few hours, I have to say, Google pretty much hit a homerun with this little guy. After a slight hiccup with the setup process (I had something called Client Isolation enabled on my router, no idea what it is), I was able to get everything running great; I was streaming youtube, play music, and netflix instantaneously. The whole setup process was literally only like 10 minutes (including having to configure my router) from unboxing the Chromecast to streaming content on my TV. I did encounter a couple crashes when my brother tried to stream content from his iPad and his Galaxy S3, but to counter that I experienced no faults or hiccups when I was casting from my desktop Windows PC, Galaxy S Blaze, MacBook Air, and my Nexus 7. All in all, I'm extremely satisfied with how simple it is to get something on my TV from a swath of mobile devices and computers. Well done, Google. Well done.
B00CXAAG6I|1.0|I love Grumpy Cat on twitter, but I just have a keyboard Kindle and the drawings fail in black and white.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT HAD BOTH THE 3D AND BLU-RAY BUT IT DOES'NT IT ONLY HAS THE 3D AND A DIGITAL COPY BUT IT IS STEAL GOOD BECAUSE IT CAME WITH A OFFER TO GET THE BLU-RAY FOR $5.99 SO IT IS WORTH IT.
B002361MLA|5.0|i read this a week after my grandfather killed himself my girlfriend broke up with me on our two year then started sleeping with my good friend. its a great book and is deff worth reading. i know i dont regret it at all. some concepts are hard to pertain but the book overall is a great read for someone with a full plate and it feels life just keeps adding on
0060873175|4.0|If you've read most of Crichton's novels, and enjoyed them, how can you skip this?<br /><br />I was prepared to give this novel a poor review, because it definitely is not as good as many of Crichton's other novels.  Nevertheless, it is our last chance to read anything that he wrote, and isn't as terrible as many of the reviews indicate.  The setup chapter of the novel, describing the results of an attempted break-in of a scientific laboratory, reads as if Crichton had written it himself.  The concept is something the Crichton would have thought of, and the collection of characters is similar to his other works.  Crichton could never be accused of detailed character development, and this book is no different.  For the most part, the characters are cartoonish - but I can say the same for Jurassic Park.<br /><br />While the basic concept of shrinking humans to the size of insects seems a little unbelievable, resurrecting dinosaurs from DNA retrieved from amber is equally problematic.  If you are willing to overlook the problems with the concept, the description of the micro world appears to be realistic, and is backed up by a bibliography indicating quite a bit of research on somebody's part - probably Mr. Preston.<br /><br />One thing that is missing is a discussion of the pros and cons of the technology.  There are allusions to the problems and benefits that could come from micro-technology, but no detailed arguments between the characters, which I would have expected from a Crichton novel.  I also cannot remember a Crichton novel in which one could be disappointed by getting attached to a favorite character.  You know the evil characters are going to get what they deserve in the end; in this novel, the carnage is not limited to them.<br /><br />The book is not perfect, but I read it quickly without skipping anything.  It would have been nice for if his fans if Crichton's last novel was one of his masterpieces, but it is not.  But I'm glad that I didn't skip it.
B000J1AGQI|4.0|Here's what I like. It's determinedly anti-intellectual.  I don't mean it's stupid. I mean it's not clever or sophisticated. It's not supposed to be.  It doesn't attempt to justify or explain anything. It serves no political propaganda cause. It doesn't try to validate or contradict anyone's political views or opinions about war.  It simply depicts as best it can what happened to some men -- citizen soldiers -- who were called the day after they were peacefully barbecuing in their backyard to fight other soldiers on the other side of the Earth, for no obviously good reason except duty, and how it went.  This includes the families waiting at home for the outcome -- not whether we won or lost, for that is irrelevant to them, but whether or not their husband, father, or son, was dead. This thing came crashing in to devastate their lives. Soldier and wife sharing their fate each in their own way.<br /><br />At the end in the aftermath, there's the nice little encounter with the press who remind me of the Washingtonians who came out to picnic while watching the Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) during our Civil War.  Jackass intellectuals, one and all, as they remain today. I found the actual battle scenes somewhat tedious and confusing at times, but that's probably commensurate with how it actually goes.  And it underscores the ebb-and-flow of the armies' encounter as well as the stark contrast to the life our men had just left and which their families still lived.<br /><br />Sam Elliott as the Crusty Veteran Sarge was hackneyed casting and no surprise.  But it's hard to imagine another big-name star disappear into the role of no-nonsense, no-Hollywood Hal Moore as well as Gibson.  (Well, Harrison Ford could have).  He manages to not be charismatic while being heroic due to the character, not persona, of the man he's portraying.  He does it imperfectly with the \\"Gibson is acting\\" apparent at times, but usually he's low-key and sincere and therefore convincing.  He plays itflat, and I give him great credit for that no matter his other failings as an actor.  As I do Stowe as his wife, who's beauty is apparent but who manages to be heroic in character and deed like her husband.  She is strong and a leader, a wonderful copy of Moore.<br /><br />Realistic? I don't know and don't much care, within bounds.  It must have been something like that, and that's enough.  I can't imagine many women liking this.  Some men would find it lacks glitz and fails to look like a comic book.  Others will find it fails to make \\"statements\\" about the Vietnam War, war in general, the US policies, bla bla bla, and will therefore find it unintellectual.  Good. That's it's value.

B005HED11Y|5.0|The first season of the original Star Trek revolutionized the presentation of science fiction on television, bringing to TV's broader audience the literary tradition of addressing political and philosophical issues by setting them in another time and place that had blossomed in the monthly science fiction magazines during the McCarthy era.<br /><br />Sci-fi, like other literature, had a progressive &#34;we're all in this life together&#34; stream as well as a reactionary &#34;every man for himself&#34; stream. Trek was firmly in the progressive stream.<br /><br />By spicing its allegorical tales with the rough and tumble of an adventure series and good old fashioned American optimism and idealism, Trek's &#34;Wagon Train to the stars&#34; (the sales pitch made by its creator, Gene Roddenberry) won not just the West but the East as well.<br /><br />There were many great episodes in Trek's first season, from the poetic &#34;The Devil In The Dark,&#34; in which a terrifying monster becomes an ally, in classic &#34;quest&#34; story fashion, to &#34;The Naked Time' in which an epidemic of madness on board ship gives the audience a window on the inner lives of many of the most important members of the crew.<br /><br />The restoration of the old film that was done for the series' reissue on Blu-ray also benefits the Amazon streaming version. While not full 1080 resolution, the 720 looks very good, and the 5.1 Dolby Digital is good as well. Don't miss this.

B0065QUD8W|5.0|If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan and if you own a Kindle, then this collection is almost a must.  You simply cannot beat the price here and you most certainly will not beat the quality when it comes to formatting and ease of navigation.  The stories, as the product description states, are in chronological order.  They also state that \\"This collection features most of the Sherlock Holmes stories....\\"  This is true but for the life of me I cannot figure out which ones they have missed.<br /><br />Actually, between my wife and myself, we own three other sets of the \\"complete\\" works - all in paper.  Having all these old beloved stories handy is wonderful.  When we travel we load ourselves down with books and this Kindle edition has taken quite a lot of weight out of our travel kits.<br /><br />As I said, the formatting here is great.  These things have been carefully proofed and you do not find all the many annoying errors so often encountered in quick cheap Kindle books of this sort.  This is truly a quality product.<br /><br />This work indeed contains 48 short stories and 4 complete novels and I wish that all the inexpensive Kindle books were of this quality.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|For anyone who has seen the Alien movie (part 1) this film is almost like a remake on the same theme.  A group of scientists travels to another planet in order to find out who is the creator of the human race.  They are all employed by the powerful corporation that is funding their trip.  Most of the crew is male and only two (out of three) females have important and significant presence.  One of them is Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron.  An ice woman, beautiful but unapprochable who from the start makes it clear for the entire crew that \\"her job is to ensure that everyone on the mission does their job\\".  In other worlds, Meredith is an ultimate project manager.  Her decisions are made rationally, she does not expect to be anyone's friend (even her living quarters have special accommodations) and she is shrewd - she makes sure that everyone understands that they are employees and nothing else.<br /><br />Everything else in this film is so \\"Hollywood Formula\\" style that it is not worth writing about.  So for the evening of so-so entertainment you can have this movie and is you feel lukewarm, after you watch this film - you will still feel lukewarm.

B00CZAYNOC|1.0|FFDP decided they had so many great songs they just had to make a double album. Maybe that's what they thought, or that's what someone wanted them to think. The band also stated this album would be a return to The Way of the Fist. Somebody needs to get their ears checked.    There are fourteen tracks. One is a cover, and three are repeat songs with guest vocals. In the remaining ten, FFDP show what they've been reduced to: formulaic generic crunching. The defined groove and melodies of their first album is completely gone. Despite my distaste for FFDP, I've always considered Moody a talented, powerful singer, except he now sings like he's paid $6.50/hour. Or I guess in his case, getting paid a lot.    Lyrically, it's \\"people do s*** to me so they can frack themselves.\\" \\"Burn M.F.\\" has \\"Burn mother f----- burn\\" a few thousand times, reinforcing my hypothesis that Ivan Moody is indeed a poet.    The only worthwhile part of this album are the guest songs, minus Tech9's appearance, which is a good reminder of why nu metal disappeared for a while. Rob Halford, Max Cavelera, and Jamey Jasta all show up to give some fleeting shining moments.    Even for commercial hard rock, this is low. I saw bros at FYI eagerly buying this album. That's how low it is.    **The deluxe version comes with a live concert so you can listen to all your favorite songs in crappy quality with an unconvincing performance.

B0012YYZYK|4.0|I`ve seen this movie lot of times: in cinemas in the 70's and 80', later in VHS, DVD, and now in the top quality of these days: the Blu-ray.<br />Even if the audio and video quality is great, there's a few seconds audio dropout, at the start of Moby Dick, in the Dolby True HD track, this is why I rate it with four stars: is incredible that this Blu-ray comes to the market with such a problem.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just love this game. I started playing this on my cell phone and was hooked. I never thought to look for it on my kindle and was so excited when I found it!! I also down loaded this to my husband's kindle for myself and he too can't stop playing!! I just love it period!
B007Y36K46|5.0|Before seeing this movie all that I had heard about it was that it had been bad for Disney in the box office, so I just assumed that it wouldn't be that great, but I was wrong. I found that this was truly a good movie and just had a bad rep because it did not bring in tons of money. I liked the movie so much that I showed it to some of my friends, who enjoyed it as well. This movie had great special effects and good acting, I would advise anyone that likes this genre of movie to go ahead and watch it because they will most certainly like it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed the challenge and sense of accomplishment finishing one level and moving to the next. Can't wait for more levels.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a really good game. It is also very addictive. The only negative thing that I have to say is that some of their objects in the game don't really help you, instead they make you mess up. I still recommend it.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who would have thought that a period show would be interesting to someone that's not really into historical type shows but this show keeps my interest. It has all the twists and turns of all the best dramas and of course end of season cliff hangers.
B00BNNJHXO|4.0|This is exactly what I expect from Soilwork...X2!  I was wary because it was a double album, some bands just try and jam half written songs and odd riffs into double albums, but all the songs feel well written and thoughtful.  I still have my favorites like \\"Stabbing the Drama\\" and \\"Natural Borne Chaos\\" as my favorites, but this is definitely going on repeat for the next few months.  To be honest I am relieved since \\"The Great Divide\\" was so mediocre for me.  This is a must have for any Soilwork fan, and a great album for anyone who is a fan of the Swedish Metal, or Metal genre.

B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This movie is so bad that it would make excellent fodder to lampoon from the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast. Excruciatingly awful. I hope Robot Chicken gets a hold of this movie.<br />The cast is for the most part great but the acting is wooden. The story line is disjointed and made more glaring by the awful editing and directing.<br />The most enjoyable way to watch the movie is to be your own MST 3K crew who are forced to watch dreadful movies.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I am not a big fan of movies that have songs in them. But i can honestly make an exception on this one. It is a highly animated movie, and one deserving of five stars. If i could give it more i would.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am not a young person. I do love to read. I was so curious about all the hoopla about this series, I decided to see what it was all about and ordered all three of the books. Spent an entire weekend parked on the sofa reading all three. Couldn't put them down. Like many trilogies, by the time the third book came around, the story seemed to be getting a bit contrived. But the pace was good and the story had a nice conclusion (predictable). Encourage everyone to read the books. A nice way to spend some time.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I ordered this watch yesterday, and chose to have it shipped overnight for $7 along with a couple other items. Everything arrived together, and very well packaged. The watch box had 2 large air bubble/pocket/pouch things to keep anything from moving around while shipping. The watches box was in excellent condition.<br /><br />The watch itself is exactly as described. I love that the back of the watch is clear. It shows all the mechanics inside, and you can see how the auto-wind works. To set the watch, you pull out on the button. Half pull wound forward changes the date, wound backward changes the day. Full pull changes the minute/hour. The second hand keep right on ticking. I've set the watch to exact atomic time, so we'll see how accurate it is in a couple days (hence the reason for only giving 4 stars). It deserves a 5 star rating, but I'll wait to see how accurate it is before I do that.<br /><br />Great watch!

Made me want to get to the third book quickly. Encourage everyone to read the books. A nice way to spend some time.
B003G94BZC|4.0|I was kind of disappointed that Tennant left, but Smith does an amazing job as the Doctor.  His version is a bit awkward with the ladies, but he still finds a way to turn a bad situation around.  I will be interested in seeing what else happens in series 6.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was hooked right up through the end ... but the ending was such a huge, anticlimactic letdown that it kind of ruined my feelings about the rest of the book.
B00821OX98|4.0|Many great shows in this genre have not lasted more than one season. 'Falling Skies' might have the actors, writers and directors that know how to keep this show going.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|There is no need for a plot review, as that has already been covered.  The plot however, is very well developed with quite an unexpected outcome.  The story is interesting with the right balance of levity, humor, sadness and suspense.  The backdrop of the orphanage was painfully rendered.  The main characters felt like real people.  They were flawed and at times anguished, and yet they were charming and believable.  The use of dialect was perfect.  I really loved this book.  I recommend it completely.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Honestly I've been watching this series since it first premiered on USA, and I loved it so much that I just had to pick up the season so that I could watch it again before the new season started.<br /><br />I would recommend this show to absolutely anyone.  Even if you hate lawyers, you'll still love Suits.
B003K16PAU|4.0|I was so enthralled with George Orwell's account of his days in Paris as an impoverished restaurant \\"go-fer\\" that I could almost overlook the egregious editing of this edition. This book has been \\"bowdlerized\\" that is, the obscene words are totally deleted and replaced with dashes. Not even an initial to give you a clue on which word Orwell used. This is critical to one chapter in particular with a glossary of street argot. You can't read it. This should have been revised because who cares nowadays if every other word is the F-bomb? It doesn't raise eyebrows. I assume the Harcourt edition was initially to be used in school, where F-bombs are deleted lest there be student snickering in class (they all know the words, of course. But they make for a lot of immature giggling.)<br /><br />Leaving that aside, this memoir is a good insight into George Orwell's life, writing and philosophy. You'll notice passages that make their way into chapter of \\"1984\\" (in particular, his vivid descriptions of squalid surroundings, bug-ridden, dirty and odoriferous.)<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the chapter on his life on the road as a tramp in London. He'd come back to England on the promise of a job, a not-very-good job caring for a mentally disabled person as a sort of caretaker-nurse but the job was delayed when he arrived in London. He had a month to live on his wits and no money. The description of charity public wards and workhouses, Salvation Army and church lodgings, a diet of \\"a cup and 2 slices\\"--meaning tea and bread with margarine are a glimpse into a life rarely described. Like Dickens, Orwell is that rare breed of educated and intelligent man who has experienced true poverty and survived to write poignantly about it.<br /><br />Highly recommended, with the caveat about the bad editing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Stayed up all night to finish this! Made me laugh a lot, made me cry a lot, and is one of the best books I've read in a long long time.
B00571F26Y|1.0|I stayed away from anything wheat for 2 months and my RA symptoms only go worse instead of better.  My boss's acid reflux did get better and no longer needs to use his medication.  I think it may depend on your ailment or the person.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|I am not a big Sci-fi fan, but there are a few I've read and really enjoyed. This is one of them. I LOVED Blade Runner, and I read the movie version of the book.<br /> I also heard of the original story the book, and movie were based on, DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? By Philip K. Dick. I've planned to read that one for some time, and finally got around to it.<br />Not exactly like the movie (when are they ever?) but close enough, and Dick's story, and imagination are the real winners here. I liked it. I plan to read some more of Dick's books in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great reading.  Didn't know they put out a movie so I guess I'll have to see it.  Thinking about getting the next book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|left me wanting more, but the final few pages were very anticlimatic.  seemed like author howey got bored writing it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loads of fun!  Give yourself a chance to solve the puzzles before you look up a walkthrough. You may just solve alot more than you thought you could.
B009A87X80|5.0|Nice selection of her songs.  The appealing, plaintive quality of her voice is highlighted by the choice of musical performances.  It always touches my heart.
0385523394|3.0|True, it is an important personal story but i wish the author had asked her many fans to send books and other mail to her fellow inmates who did not have the same \\"opportunities\\" as she describes for her own self impressed background.  It is truly sad that someone would be so proud of her elite education when clearly she did not learn good judgement there and did some surprisingly stupid things.  Piper blames others for her own bad decisions, of which there were many.  Very interesting read - did not want to stop reading but disappointed in lack of maturity and wisdom from author.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son, and I'm the one that cant stop playing it. I even had to delete some games in order to make space for it, but based on its reviews I had high hopes. super happy, definatly worth it.  keep it up!!
B00144VBBS|5.0|Have been listening to and enjoying this since I got it.  Really like the music and the singer.  Makes day go easier.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The first two episodes; could have stopped without giving it another thought. But with the rave reviews, I stuck with it...totally hooked after the third attempt.<br />Love, love, love this series.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game provides you with a &quot;target&quot; ball that you must paint, using the tools provided.  It's a clever set-up and fun to run through the levels.<br /><br />There are only 41 levels though, so it's easy to play through quickly.  Clearly, morelevels could be added, so here's hoping for an update.  Also, it would be nice to replay to get the minimum number of moves for each level, which the game does not currently display or track.
B006O6FK2W|2.0|Anyone who gives this five stars is living in a dream world. There is a reason this thing is more than 50 percent off. Does anyone remember dust buster vacuum cleaners? Paint it black and put two plastic darts on it, and there you go. The canopy for the action figure is held down by a black rubber band, not pictured. Yes, I said a black rubber band. Yes batman is only made to shoot out of this vehicle and is not very sturdy. I love the dark knight, but the quality, practicality and build of this product leave much to be desired. Instead of the \\"bat\\" they should have named this the \\"crap\\".
B000002AGN|5.0|A great new addition to my music collection.  You don't need to be a jazz lover to appreciate this brilliant production.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I owed my wife a chick flick night and so &#34;had&#34; to watch this. It was excellent. Really funny movie for husband and wife.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|When opening links contained in emails, the app frames the link, thus none of the features for sharing, etc. Work.  THIS IS MAJOR TO ME.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I have all their albums and this is just as good as the others.  They never let me down on anything they put out.
159562015X|5.0|This book is less of a book and more of an eye opening experience.  Nothing beats the confidence gained from knowing what you are good at.  Following this I recommend taking a step further and getting the &#34;Stand Out&#34; book which builds on this new empowerment in important ways.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to this game... I LOVE LOVE IT... Thanks to whoever invented it and thanks for the freebie :)
B002UBRFDC|3.0|I was surprised by this book. I didn't love it. What the miniseries gave us was intelligence and beauty, with fully fleshed-out characters. The Japanese portrayed in the book were dimwitted and almost clownish, a far cry from the brutal yet beautiful characters of Toranaga, Omi, Ishido and Mariko in the series. Poor dialogue and too many boring scenes made me stop reading 65% through the book, and I'm not sure I'll pick it up again. Disappointing.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Very challenging.  Great game  really makes you think.  Great for kids and the elderly<br />Need to give more coins graphics are great.  Awesome
0345803485|3.0|I just cannot get into this book.  I have tried and tried to sit down and read it.  I like Zane's erotic books better, I can read them from front to back in 2 days.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I was a blown away by this movie...I was  unable to view it when it first came out in theaters, and I'm extremely upset that I missed the chance to see it in theaters.  This entire movie was epic and on a scale in comparison to Star Wars and all of the other movies similar in its vein.  I had so much fun watching this...I want more.<br /><br />This movie deserves a sequel, most importantly, and I think the extremely positive reviews here and elsewhere prove that it's needed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A couple levels got me frustrated but once I got past it the game was really fun I just wish they had more levels but the new levels are coming soon!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so sorry the character, Matthew, was eliminated from the series.  Too bad, there was so much more that could have worked out in and through his new ideas in the family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game & my son's loves it.  The only bad thing is that it take awhile to re-down load to play again.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Ii found the film very moving. I think the way the film focused on the political wheeling and dealing regarding the slavery issue made ithe whole issue more understandable to modern audiences. When I think of this film losing out to a film like Argo for so many Academy Awards it really underscored my belief that Hollywood is shallow. Danial Day-Lewis was superb as was the entire cast and the story was very well told.
B009FRS9CA|5.0|The detail of the item is Spot on .<br />Will be a good pick for collection of Dark knight series .<br />Quality of packing is not so good but given the price , its more than a worthable item
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I liked it because it was interesting and easy to follow along . :) this would not be a great book for a kid to read  because there is alot of cuss words in it but in the end it's a great book :)
193700788X|1.0|I won't be buying this book after seeing all these terrible reviews.I have a suggestion, why not go back to Ms. Harris and ask her to do what \\"Dallas\\" did, when they killed off Bobby, only to bring him back as \\"Pam's bad dream\\", then perhaps her readers will be happy? Bring back our characters, make Sookie totally spooked about what could happen if she doesn't share the potion with Eric, bring them back together.
B003VPOXAE|5.0|this book is by far one of the best i have read. i will admit i think that the story slows down somewhere around the end but all in all it was a terrific read and i loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for the fourth series to come out. This is a great story and is written and acted well
B008Y5UADK|1.0|kept waiting for something of significance to happen. it never did. very disappointing. i would rather read a good book. i suppose this movie was supposed to be artsy but it missed the mark.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My children and I all play this. Sometimes we have competitions to see who runs the longest it's a great game :)
B008UTV6S8|4.0|Great album - yet it makes you wonder why they omit some 'performed' songs and keep others. All in all really like the album. Have not watched the DVD yet.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I play games to relax and take my mind off of the real world. This one makes you think way to hard or something.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I purchased this book because of all the buzz regarding it. I found it to be very predicable and felt it more like a young adult book. I should have gotten a sample first! Perhaps it was just me, but I wish I would have saved my money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a great book. Couldn't wait to read the next one. The kind of book that kept the pages turning.
B006Y5EDRG|2.0|Seemed intriguing at first, but after three episodes found it too predictable and a pretty stupid plot line.  would not recommend
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|nothing spectacular - maybe more because it just is not my kind of game really. Check other reviews for reviewers that play similar games to you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just found out that my Prime membership gives me free access to tv programs so my first foray into the schedule is season 1 of Suits.  I had watched the first episode of season 2 and was wishing that I could get caught up when the good news about my Prime membership arrived.  Thanks, Amazon, for the commercial free television...what a great concept!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|i really didn't like it, its for kids .... i'm not a kid, i'm an old f*#t, if you are a kid or have kids it will probably be good for you
B004B8DH98|5.0|A great drama, filled with tension. The production values are excellent in this movie, and it's clear the director comes from a photography background. Each frame and scene is expertly composed, and you really get a sense of what it must be like to constantly be looking over your shoulder, waiting for an assassin's bullet to come from the shadows with your name on it....
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I just could not get into it. I do not know how one would get engrossed enough to purchase the full version
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Could not believe we paid money to watch this movie.  I thought the acting was cheesy, story line sucked, it was slow to start... Really didn't like it.
1623360277|5.0|Finally I can eat filling and satisfying foods like potatoes, corn, rice, legumes etc. and not gain weight, not feel deprived, and not feel at all hungry.  I never want to go back to animal products.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Doesn't work for me. I hate it. Would not recommend it.  Slow to load videos. Can't subscribe to channels or favorites.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I feel sorry for the people who this app won't work for, mine works smoothly, I have not experienced any problems or lags at all. I would strongly recommend at least trying, it is free so no harm in trying. I hope it works for you!
B003TH14H4|5.0|We really love the show.  It always has a great plot and it is usually impossible to figure out who the killer is.  Love it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not worth the $35...It is very hard to set up and not friendly with dual band routers.  Roku is much better and easier to use.
B004UID2LC|1.0|doesn'T play youtube playlists, takes forever to start and won't play playlists and search engine sucks !!!! if I could rate properly = minus 5 stars.<br /><br />Basically not a single youtube app actually works, and the few that do allow me to log in to my account and access my playlists don't play over 80% of my songs and keep cycling between 2 or three songs.<br /><br />SHORTLY SAID ALL YOUTUBE APPS SUCK B***** SO FAR!!!
B008220BLG|5.0|Excellent movie. DVD played as it should. Zombie lovers should like this movie a lot. It even has a little love story for the ladies.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Me and my husband enjoy watching this show.  We look forward to our Castle every evening.  Great story line.  We are never disappointed.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|This film is Orson Wells at his storytelling best.  Great cinematography with a profound theme:  what profits a man if he gains the world but loses his soul?
B004UNX1LS|1.0|doesn'T play youtube playlists, takes forever to start and won't play playlists and search engine sucks !!!! if I could rate properly = minus 5 stars.<br />There is not a single youtube app that will play my full playlist with no problems, FREEdi youtube player worked great at first but now it does the same ting as these apps, will not play my playlist properly.<br />Is there not a app out there that will play youtube nice and problemfree?
B005ZD8I6K|3.0|It was ok, I don't see how it sparked the goth scene or whatever the fanboys made of it. z
B003THHIEM|5.0|We are hooked.  The show is really quirky.  Love the story line and plot.  The actors do a great job.  Love all the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a fun game to play and reminds me of temple run but it freezes too much.  Hope the freezing can improve.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|doesn'T play youtube playlists, takes forever to start and won't play playlists and search engine sucks !!!! if I could rate properly = minus 5 stars.<br />There is not a single youtube app that will play my full playlist with no problems, FREEdi youtube player worked great at first but now it does the same ting as these apps, will not play my playlist properly.<br />Is there not a app out there that will play youtube nice and problemfree?
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think this book was amazing even the fifth time around. I highly suggest that you read this awesome book more than once. Yeah it's that good.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This was a great action flick especially if you like a bit of tongue in cheek and cliche'd lines. It was great watching all the classic action guys in the same movie. Great production, great sound. Don't take it too seriously, have fun watching!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app until it got an&quot;upgrade&quot;. now it won't even load on my kindle fire. I'm deleting it and looking for another weather app.
1591845556|1.0|Most of the book is about how to learn to do things I either already know how to do (and teaching how to do them wrong) or how to learn how to do things I do not want to learn about.  Is is even worse when the first lesson is &#34;only learn what you love to learn, what you can fall in love with&#34;.  Well, I don't want to learn Yoga so why waste my time with half the book being on it?<br /><br />Basically only one chapter is valuable; and it reads like a collage student plagerized everything from a shallowly written ehow blog post and then did everything they could to make it read longer.<br /><br />Bad news for me as I paid for this craptastic book, but good news for you because that one chapter has already been summarized by multiple people and is freely available on the internet.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|You can tell he loves this country and their people.  I have read a bunch of these and will continue.  This is the first in the series so start here.  Not a lot of action, just regular people who live in Botswana being themselves.  Gives you insight into the culture and the history of this area.  The characters are great and I continue to follow their journey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Niece loves this app and I love that we get to share and play together even though we live in different States. Very cute.
B00181MHQU|4.0|I saw the original Broadway production and nothing can compare to the very first serious musical conducted by Leonard Bernstein, himself!  It was spellbinding.  But, the film is wonderful and the dancing, spectacular. Only problem is with the dubbing.  Not everything Natalie Wood sings is in sync.
161655164X|5.0|Must have for fans of the game.<br />Art book enthusiasts wont be disappointed.<br /><br />*High quality.<br />*Nice, big size.<br />*Amazing artwork of the characters and environment.
1476734941|4.0|I love the concept.<br /><br />I'm the type of person that feels deprived when on a diet.<br />This fasting diet works for me since I can eat anything I want on the non fasting days.<br /><br />As for the fasting days, I am getting used to the idea and have a system in place to space out the alloted calories.<br />Trying a little bit during the first days of fasting.<br />I drink tea when I feel a little hungry.<br />Then I get through.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|It's an engrossing original story.  The author makes it seem plausible even though raising the IQ of a mouse seems like a fantasy.  Trying it on a human is even more fantastic.  We watch Charlie go from retarded adult to an intelligence outstripping his professors.  Charlie is overjoyed that he has finally become &#34;smart&#34; but knowledge proves detrimental when it opens his eyes as to how he was treated before.  It's a fascinating take on whether scientific advancements are really for the better.
B00594XOZU|3.0|This app is great but Amazon does not have the new update which totally sucks. I cant really correct with my friends anymore
140006922X|5.0|I ordered the book out of curiosity,  due to the Islamophobic reviews and press. I got a thorough,  interesting and HISTORICAL bite of the world of religious studies. Dr. Aslan provides not only an insightful perspective on the various beliefs in Jesus, but uses history to give context to those beliefs. His list of sources is not only helpful and extensive,  but points me to other books I can read next.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought this was a Good movie. I enjoyed it a lot. I was entertained throughout the movie and thought they did the book justice.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love the series. Got into it after I watched Beautiful Creatures the movie. Which by the way is not even close to being as good as the books but helps give the characters a face and a sound. Read all of them. Great read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book!! I seriously think it was adorable and I couldn't put it down!! I loved the point of view it was written in :) READ THIS!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only disappointment I found with this game was the fact that I made it to the end in one sitting! I wanted to keep playing and anticipate the future rooms to come!! Graphics were beautiful as well.
0375869026|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read it! There are many lessons to be learned from Auggie! I cried several times throughout.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves this game. It is perfect for all little girls who love dress up. I even as a dad got into playing it with her. It is fun for her so that is what counts.
1476735115|5.0|I've only read the first few chapters but I can tell this is going to be a great one. Good job Mr. Howey. I can't wait to get the next book after this one is finished.<br /><br />P.S. Get the hardcover edition, it looks great.
0451450523|4.0|The Last Unicorn was worth reading twenty-five years ago. I know. I did read it then.<br />Thanks to aging and failing memory I was able to read it recently and enjoy it all over again.<br />This is one of the original fantasy books of all time and a must-read for any lover of fantasy. I think she'll like them both. Peter S. Beagle might be one of the most under-rated writers of our time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read his first two books also.  I enjoy his style of writing, and his stories are always very interesting.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Great music. Not kidding. Bought this with my new Kindle Fire HD. One Republic makes good music. Will be looking forward to their next CD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the cool gadgets and all the battles with vector and the minions. also with the minion of the week chart
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this on my LG Marquee and on my Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire doesn't include the specials or El Macho's place. So if you're going to play this game, play it on your phone, or a better tablet.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is totally awesome, but when I get to the green slide thing  my kindle won't let me turn , so my minion falls off track
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Well I bought this game after several days of lobbying by my son. I put it on my Kindle Fire HD. My son absolutly loves this game. He has built quite the little dragon land.
0307730700|5.0|This true life story is way beyond a Navy Seal fighting and dying for our Country.  It's a story of living a life and making it worth living.<br />I'd suggest this book(already have) to anyone.<br />Sorry I never met Adam.  David
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Waste of time. Why would you want me to say 16 words of how much I dislike this app.  Boring
145211207X|5.0|Pixar art books have been getting better and better.  Compared to the original Monsters Inc. art book, this one is way better!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app, but I hate the latest up date. How can I fix it back to how it was? Any idea?
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|USB micro cable used to charge kindle. It does what it is supposed to do what ore can I say.it is simple,you plug it in, it charges then you unplug it. Enough words?
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I am a big fan of the Wizard of Oz and have watched all programs that have been made.  I was very happy that this turned out to be a prequel to the original.  The color was absolutely beautiful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun game! It reminds me of temple run and subway surfed put togather! There r more things to do though like defeat vector and grow huge to take out minions!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie had me scared! I was watching this alone with my significant other in the dark and let me tell you it had me shaking. Still loved the movie! Great suspense!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Hosseini writes in such an easy style, and the flow of the story carries you along, you just want to read and read.  The Afghan culture is an eye opener and the struggle for a better life is gripping.  I highly recommend this book.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I am not much for this type of game, but my grandkids love to play.  Thanks for offering through Amazon Apps.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Fun for fans but tough to play on tablet when you need to continually rearrange. Don't like how long it takes for resources.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This game is so fun, I see myself losing hours to this game. Bye bye life. See you in about 2-5 years
B000ICZD5M|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite movies. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Timeless classic that's great for any age. Always fun to watch with the kiddos and just a good story with a good moral.
B00000K3D4|4.0|Received the dvd as described. Shipping was fast. The DVD was scratched slightly but does not affect the play quality. This is one of my all time favorite movies and now my 4 year old daughter loves it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I was thinking next you could give the man a helicopter to catch up with the jet pack and make a new level called subway surfers night
B0015AARJI|1.0|I guess I have to read into but why would anyone want to wait over a month for a remote control something like couch or a pool table yeah sure but for this come on.... I 'm a nube at amazon I'll learn.. but that's crazy. If it's in china then don't sell it to me and I know it doesn't take a month to get to China... I just want to cancel can I dot that?
0375714839|5.0|Finally, in the early 21st century do we receive a woman's view of life in Iran. Persepolis deserves to sit among Hirsi Ali's Infidel and Husseini's Murder in the Name of Honor. Perhaps because he parents were not overly devout Muslims, Marjane was permitted to read to her heart's content. She assimilated copious quantities of political dogma at a young age, which enabled her to see things from several perspectives.<br /><br />We are shown life through Marjane's eyes from her days in elementary school (even then she is a bit of a rebel, unwilling to wear the burka in the desert, though she is not alone here). Growing up in a society where social class and gender matter more than anything else, she feels genuine grief for her maid, who is doomed never to marry the neighbour she loves. Fortunate enough to evade the bullets through serendipity before the Shah's overthrow, she is forced to mature rapidly and learns that she must not blame children for the atrocities of their parents. Perhaps the most profound moral of her childhood tribulations is the price of freedom and the tragedy for those left behind, hoping, worrying and fearing for the fate of their loved ones who were imprisoned for being enemies of the state. Everyone living in the democracy must be grateful they are not suffering the fate of North Koreans.<br /><br />Always, regrettably, the dark puppet-masters are omnipresent. Willing to aid despots in their quest for power, the common people are often forgotten and seen as expendable. With no means to resist armed police (or escape from a barricaded cinema), their insurrections are often easy to quell. Recurrent themes are the deadly chains of hatred, vengeance and bitter grief. Forgiveness is a laudable goal, and though Gandhi succeeded in his endeavours, one is always left wondering whether the cost in human lives was worthwhile. Was there a better way? Could the soldiers have been convinced or coerced to turn against their own oppressive regime if necessary?<br /><br />Although told from Majane's perspective, the stories of her uncles, friends and extended families also receive their fair share of space. Each chapter of the first half reveals more of the history and culture of Iran in the 70s and 80s. No detail is omitted and the harsh realities of a country in the throes of anarchy are laid bare for readers to vicariously experience.<br /><br />Her secondary education in Vienna enabled her to learn more about the world beyond Iran's narrow and artificial borders. Like Anne Frank's diary, as Marjane matures, so too does her writing style and vocabulary. Despite being a comic book, the latter half is full of text and can be quite vexing to slog through. The most poignant and tragic moment comes when Marjane rejects her homeland and chooses freedom over a patriarchal dictatorship.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I picked up this book and had planned to read it during the last week of my summer vacation. Instead I sat down and immersed myself in the book, reading it from cover to cover in hours, single sitting.<br />It is a story, a grown-up memoir of a fantastical and slightly scary chain of events. Pure Gaiman at his best. Definitely recommended!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|glad I finnaly found this game.  was looking for knights and dragons but this is awesome..  great game play, can plan online, and best of all its free...  if I had money I would have paid for it..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun, and combined all my favorite  things.  (Minions, despicable me 1+2 and a fun game) SOOOO FUN!!!
1476733953|4.0|I'm fed up with post-apocalypse stories and I had planned to be super-critical about this novel, but in all truth, it won me over. WOOL takes some time to get off the ground and as an author, I can recognize when someone is trying to figure things out. But as it hits page 200, the book takes life rather beautifully.<br /><br />Juliette is clashing with most female character of her genre, because falling in love and getting pregnant is NOT one of her priorities. Howey treats her as a human being before anything else and this is where the novel shines and sparkles. In the moments where Juliette is battered and torn and has to keep forward. There were some narrative slip-ups, unoriginal ideas, but overall, WOOL is a smart, dynamic novel that understands how to create drama. I wouldn't say it widened my perspectives a lot as the idea it vehicles are a little obvious if you've read some dystopian fiction before, but it sure transported me in another world. As long as a book can do that, it's fine with me.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|BLACK STAR RIDERS IS A SOLID ALBUM. FEATURING FORMER THIN LIZZY AXE MAN SCOTT GORHAM THIS ALBUM REALLY ROCKS. IF YOU LIKED THIN LIZZY YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS.

SHE MEANS TO FIND YOU !
B006M6NV0M|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for The Expendables, because most of the cast turn out grade C and B action flicks. But this was so much better than I expected, and Sly's extended director's cut was even better than the theatrical version. No where near as campy as I expected, and GREAT dramatic moments that fleshed out the characters. If you like action movies, don't pass this one by. Inferno, the Making of...is also amazing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great game and is great for children about to get a pet.<br />Also this game is a great way to play with an animals
B000SGSU58|5.0|The Harry Bosch novels are so good and extremely hard to put down, I like how the books flow from book to book. I have yet to find a Michael Connelly book that I didn't like. I gave this book 5 stars because it was a true mystery and kept you guessing.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Very funny movie and every mother has a bit of Streisand's charater in them - no doubt every person can relate whether it is your own mother, your mother-in-law, or unbeknownst to you, YOU

B009KKLQVS|4.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan for over 50 years. I recently saw the concert at Darien Lake N.Y and could not have been more impressed.  I was disappointed that the DVD only showed a brief portion of the total concert and left out many of their greatest hits.  I guess something to remember this great group by is better than nothing.  For those who want to really appreciate the genius of Brian Wilson, this DVD may well be your last chance.  I wish this was an &#34;Endless Summer&#34; and that the music could continue but all good things must come to an end. To America's greatest band, bravo.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was excited when I read that Chromecast would allow me to cast anything from my chrome browser to the tv. Since I've already got a [[ASIN:B007KEZMX4 Roku HD Streaming Player]] (and because not everything I watch is on Netflix), that was really the only feature I really cared about. Given that I ordered early enough for the Netflix promotion, I thought it was worth the $11 investment.<br /><br />Despite my interest in casting Chrome from my computer, my first trial was casting Netflix from my phone. It worked beautifully, and I was very happy with my purchase... until I got around to casting from Chrome. That was an utter failure. We've got enough bandwidth that streaming video has never been a problem, either on the computer or through the Roku. But stream to the computer and Chromecast to the tv, and suddenly stops and starts so much, it's unwatchable. In the moments when it's playing instead or pausing, the video doesn't even match the audio.<br /><br />I still think the Chromecast has potential if more developers start incorporating it, and it works well if all you watch is Netflix and YouTube. But if you want to stream video via Chrome, Chromecast won't cut it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just a few additional notes, based on comments posted by other users.<br />1. Chrome tab casting is in beta. Thanks, for the reminder. Let's hope it gets better.<br />2. Computer performance can significantly impact quality of casting. Our macbook is several years old, so that could be a contributing factor.<br />3. Video quality settings can improve the performance. We tried the low resolution setting. It improved the performance but not to the point of making it watchable.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE: I'm not sure if there have been upgrades to the firmware or if it's because I've been careful to make sure all other programs and browser tabs are closed before starting a video, but I've been having more luck with streaming video via Chrome. We use it regularly now, and, although it still has issues, it's no longer \\"unwatchable.\\" It freezes or produces mismatched video and audio most times we use it, but those issues rarely occur more than once (sometimes twice) in an hour-long show (I do have to restart the video whenever this happens). Given the problems we still have, we don't even bother trying the HD stream. But if other users are having trouble, definitely make sure your computer isn't trying to do anything else while Chrome is casting, and that may help. Although it's still not perfect, it's performing quite capably for a $35 piece of equipment.l has issues, it's no longer \\"unwatchable.\\" It freezes or produces mismatched video and audio most times we use it, but those issues rarely occur more than once (sometimes twice) in an hour-long show (I do have to restart the video whenever this happens).

B00DPUB59W|4.0|The concept behind Neil Jordan's film BYZANTIUM is compelling: A mother/daughter vampire story.  The grabs the attention right away.  Jordan as director makes in more interesting, and an eclectic cast that includes the rising Gemma Arterton, the unusual Caleb Landry Jones and the excellent Saoirse Ronan makes it a must-see.<br /><br />BYZANTIUM is moody, atmospheric, often bloody, sometimes funny and always interesting horror tale.  It is not a SCARY movie...nor is it trying to be.  Vampires don't really scare anymore...but Jordan proves that they can be interesting subjects for story-telling.  BYZANTIUM is also often very slow moving and isn't quite as gripping as it thinks it is.  I enjoyed the movie, I guess...but in many ways I APPRECIATED it more than I loved it.<br /><br />I don't really want to give away too much of the plot, because much of the film is really the slow telling of the backstory of these two vampires.  The film is set in modern times and shows how these two make their ways in the world.  (These vampires can go out during the day, by the way.)  They could probably settle into a \\"normal\\" life of sorts (except for the need to feed on blood and the lack of aging!), but they are being chases by a group determined to kill them.  Again, I won't say more, because finding out the history of these two and their relationship to the group attempting to root them out is the fun of the film.<br /><br />Arterton spent her last few years of \\"real\\" life as a prostitute, and even centuries later, she is a vampire who makes a living in the sex trade.  Ronan was her daughter, abandoned to a convent as a baby and raised by nuns, and carries with her an intense guilt for what she is and a burning need to tell her story.  Normally, she writes her story down on paper as a cathartic device, and then destroys her writing...only to begin again.  Vampire OCD.  But when she meets the brooding but interesting Landry Jones and the two begin a tentative romance...will she beable to stop herself from sharing her story?<br /><br />Eventually, of course, events from both the past and the present must collide climactically...and I found the resolution of the story to be quite satisfying.  While this film never quite got my blood pumping (I'd say Jordan is at his weakest as a director of action scenes)...I did find myself quite invested in the Ronan/Landry Jones relationship.  And I loved much of the tone of the film...it feels old-fashioned in so many ways, and tells a touching backstory.  This movie is an intelligent vampire film.  Yes, there are still moments of silliness or times when credulity is strained...but it's well plotted and well acted.<br /><br />It's leisurely pace DOES keep it from being a visceral experience, as I said.  You care about the characters and you have an interest in the story and its outcome.  But I wanted to be swept away just a bit more.  Thus, I can only give this 4 stars out of 5.  But I believe it's well-worth seeing...particularly after the TWILIGHT movies and the speedy decent into camp that TRUE BLOOD has become made vampires either laughable or boring.  BYZANTIUM shows there's still plenty to explore in the dark realm of vampires.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I just love this book. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. It was great to escape into a world of much simpler and more pleasant times. No T.V's, no cell phones, and polite people.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I LOVE this flash - I'm usually a natural light photographer, but for evening events (especially receptions!) I've struggled with environmental lighting (or should I say - lack thereof). I usually shy away from using a flash for fear of the dreaded directional lighting dilemma, but I did lots of reading, practice, and purchased a diffuser with this flash and couldn't be happier with my end result. My event photos look so naturally lit that looking at them you forget how dim the actual event lighting was! Just be warned that if you're taking lots of photos at once, the flash does overheat and delay - I try to plan my shots so the flash is well rested for the vital moments. But there are shots here and there that I miss because the flash overheats, and this can be a bit frustrating. However, for the price and performance overall of this flash I'm incredibly happy with the improvement I've seen in my photos.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I choose this rating because while some aspects of the book were predictable other parts kept you wondering. It's the wondering th a t always keeps you turning the pages.
B00CLD65X0|3.0|Of course we love watching Downtown Abbey, but so far this season seems to be lacking.  I have to remind myself that it’s set in the roaring twenties because everything seems to be so archaic.  Maybe that's just the English, but I would hope they would have been a bit more progressive.  So far, it’s just a little boring.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I USE IT FOR A SMALL AREA AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, AS A NIGHT LIGHT. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED, IT LIGHTS UP THE WAY DOWN THE STAIRS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, BRIGHT ENOUGH TO KEEP ME SAFE FROM ROLLING DOWN THE STAIRS. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!

B008D36INE|5.0|This movie was great! Weicz and Hiddleston are the perfect couple that loves so much they destroy each other. This movie was sexy and sad and lovely.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very fun game. it really works my brain. Its a fun game to play when I have nothing to do.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My kids loved the first 2 puzzle sizes. They argued over whose turn it was. Even my fiancee was itching to pull my kindle fire away so he could try his hand at it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game i am so addicted to playing it. It's one oclock in the am an I'm still up playing.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I would rate this movie at 3 stars. Ok acting , entertaining but not Avitar quality. If you have nothing else to watch it will be ok
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|In my previous review I wrote that the USA/local authorities knew the World Trade Center would be destroyed on 9/11 because it is the same as 911 the police emergency telephone number. A Cobra rod dropped from a massive satellite on any major city would be devastating. A missile like a space rock falling at 50, 000 miles per hour would be far more deadly than the World Trade Center razing. Something akin to the size of a refrigerator  or a garage would completely level Times Square killing tens of thousands. Any company can launch anything they want in America.<br /><br />The 3D was impressive considering it was not shot in true 3D. Many things in this action flick are credible. Some of G.I. Joe<br />is comic book stuff. Shake well and you have an entertaining action packed flick. Alack, another traditional ending. American film makers have to know you can not foil the enemy every time. The rods should have made landfall at least once.<br /><br />The targets were China, North Korea, France, England, USA to name a few.<br /><br />This movie is watchable a dozen times. It is cool.They made a real effort to give 3D.
055358202X|2.0|On the one hand, I can sum up \\"Feast\\" like one can sum up a Dothraki wedding - With no murders it was a rather dull affair.  Miraculously, the viewpoint characters survive to the end of the book.  (Except one that may have been murdered, but we don't know yet.)  Compared to \\"Feast's\\" predecessors, which had nail biting action, this book focuses on intrigue.  It is interesting, but not nearly as action packed as the others.  I mean, after the Red Wedding, it's rather pathetic in the action department.<br /><br />  On the other hand, that is not to say that it does not have it's enjoyable parts.  I liked the look at the happenings of the other parts of the kingdom, in Dorne, the Iron Islands.  There are some juicy bits with Cersei's viewpoint as well.  As usual, it was all well written.<br /><br />  On the other other hand (Jaime's missing hand?) - it could have used a good edit.  Compressing the story would have made it a much tighter better story.  Another problem is that some of the characters are more or less in the same place as they were in the start of \\"Feast\\".  Which isn't to say that things didn't happen.  Things did happen, but they took fore-e-ever to happen.<br /><br />  On the Other's hand, while I judge \\"Feast\\" harshly, I think it was a necessary part of the story .  Why?  I believe this is a last harvest of sorts before the \\"big one\\".  I have faith (perhaps blind faith) that everything that has been set up in Feast will go off with a bang, because when Martin is at his best, he is brilliant and we will be rewarded for our pains in the end.  Sometimes the story is like one of the blue eyed wights.  It may be ugly, it meander here and there, the pace may be slower than we would all like, but in the end, it will reach its promise.<br /><br />  Overall, I judge \\"Feast\\" harshly as an individual book.  Still, I acknowledge it as a build up towards the climax.  And so I move on to Dance with Dragons.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's awesome even a baby will say it's awesome very cool game good job Warner bros and game loft your awesome
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I love a challenge and I got far but at a certain point I had to let it go because it was a hard stage and I didn't have the time to commit to it lol
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|This movie is a nice western spaghetti movie! My little girls like it. The graphic is well done and Johnny Depp did a good job.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|Just couldn't stay with this one. In several places Jo Nesbo's narrative became stylized, which I found confusing and a little distracting. I don't recall comparable style exercises appearing in his previously published work. Not a bad story but it just didn't keep me engaged enough to care; I put the book aside about three fourths of the way through.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|After having read &#34;Under the dome&#34; I approached this not expecting too much.  It was, however, a pleasant surprise to get into this book.  It held my interest from the beginning.  Although a very long book, King was able to make the absurd very enjoyable.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Not the rock of Cinderella, but a cool collection of bluesy-rock from the former front man.  Here's four more words.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I dont think I have ever not liked an ep. that has come out so far. I liked the series so much I played the video game and even that was on point. I hope this series lasts a while but doesnt loose its creativity.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I first watched Miyazaki's take of &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34; before I read the book - but once I discovered what it was based on, I added the book to my wishlist. Kindle was offering it on sale for one day and I purchased it immediately. It'd been a while since I'd seen the movie, so I think it helped me soak the story in even more.. it's just a magical tale. I love the imagination that went into this and the book is even better than the film - if you've watched it.. read it!
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This app works for me and nothing else did the trick!  It may be using some web shortcut but who cares because it does the job and supports the various New automatic inbox categories in gmail nicely.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|This album is as good as their first album, which is saying a lot, since their second album pretty much sucked. I didn't read the inside cover, but they must have gotten the original song writers back or something. Every song is well written and catchy. If you liked the first album, you will like this one. If you liked their second album, shame on you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Similar to Temple Run. It has a lot of challenges and can become easily addicting. The graphics are great and you can't beat free.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes reading the Bible easy. I love doing the reading plans. It gives me some kind of accountability. Keep up the good work. It's changing lives.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Lots of explosions but nitpickers will point out the deal with the sea plane. Otherwise action packed movie. Bruce Willis needs more fighting lessons.
B00005O3VC|5.0|A must have for all the Monty Python fans! Histerical lunacy! Every once in a while just have to watch it again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is probably the best runner I have plate  so far, it's really exciting, kind of weird, and the power ups are cool.<br /><br />It takes a little getting  useful  to if you are used to temple run.<br /><br />But once you figure it out its cool.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. A very believable story<br />It was true to the book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a cute game, loved the movies! just wish I could beat that vector, can't beat him no matter how hard I try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I actually got the game for my grandchildren and they love it. The graphics, colors and sound are great. The kids spend hours playing this fun game.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Do not waste the money!  Deleting it only took half the time it took to install but the deletion felt good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game is very addictive can play for hours shared with friends from work ,have seen the movie twice loved it will be buying it when it comes out
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game and so do my children. We all have it loaded on our tablets and I also have it on my cell phone.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|loved the movie...even my teenage daughter enjoyed. lots of action, good acting.  Had my concerns about Mark Ruffalo (sp?) as the Hulk but he did a great job.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I enjoy this and other escape games. My girls like it too. It is a great way to pass some time and relax.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have not ran into any problems with it and it has been as accurate as one can be about predicting weather.  I love this app and use it all the time it is way better then weather bug!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest apps in the store and it's free! I love despicable me (yes, at 18 i still love it) and this game did not disappoint. So much more entertaining and advanced then those such as temple run (because unlike temple run the course isn't always the same). Never freezes, lags, or force closes and the graphics look great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00384NXX6|1.0|It was scratched and would not play after 15 mins into the movie.  I am very disappointed.  Nothing i can do.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|I wanted to extend the range of a headset so I could put my phone in the bike trailer.  With headset alone, would cut out sometime.  With the transmitter, would cut out 80% of the time.  Made it worse!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|**5 out of 5 Amazing Stars**<br /><br />Read my full review at [...]<br /><br />I don't even know where to start with this one.  Wow...that's all I can really say.  This book grabbed my heart in a vice grip and refuses to let it go.  I have avoided this book for awhile because I knew what I was in for.  I'm not sure I could even be prepared for the twists and turns that came with it.  It's an amazing book.  I loved the characters.  Lake is strong, not because she wants to be but because she has to be.  Will has his own issues but he still tries to put what she needs first.  Impossible situations come up and the way they handled things...Wow.  Talk about integrity, these two have it in spades.  I loved the reading style but the only complaint that I have is wishing I knew what was going on in Will's head throughout the book.  I read it straight through and I refused to put it down.  This book tears at your heart.  It makes you feel things and then it leaves you wanting more.  It's one of my new favorite books!<br /><br />All I can really say about this book without giving away anything is prepare for the bombs to drop.  There are two of them.  I didn't see the first one coming at all.  They meet and there is an instant connection between them and things are going great.  They go on an awesome first date and they are getting ready to start a relationship and then the bottom falls out from under them.  Once they begin to get their bearing it happens again.  This book is about overcoming obstacles and trying to find a way to make love work when it's forbidden and impossible.<br /><br />This book was AMAZING!  Read it!  You will not be disappointed.  The ending was a little abrupt but I'm ok with that seeing as how book 2 is waiting on me as soon as I finish my review.  I give it 5 stars even though that's not nearly enough!  It's hands down one of the best books I have ever read!  My hate is off to you Colleen Hoover!  Amazing job!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I had been to a doctor's appointment and had learned of an illness that I had so I wanted to view a movie that was lighthearted and had music in it.  I found it back when there were movie rental stores and it was highly recommended to me regarding the wanting a great movie that would lift my spirits.  My Mama asked me what I wanted for Christmas a few months later and I told her about this movie and she said to go ahead and buy it and she reimbursed me!  Not that it cost a lot, it was just so wonderful that she wanted me to have a great movie that I would watch over and over again.  It's just that good!  Take a look at it, you won't be disappointed!  Thank you.
B007OV6AT8|4.0|Adam Dagleish - always one of my favorites.. P.D. James is never a disappointment. Besides, you learn so many new words!
B00932A4XE|3.0|It did have its funny parts but all in all was kinda boring.  Glad it didn't cost anything due to the prime membership.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I REALLY CAN'T SAY HOW I LIKE IT OR NOT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T USED IT AND THAT IS BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I PURCHASED THIS FOR OR WHY I PURCHASED IT. I MUST HAVE BEEN HALF ASLEEP WHEN I PURCHASED IT. SORRY BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYMORE ON THIS BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This version of the soundtrack includes songs that were not on the original movie soundtrack CD.  It also includes more &#34;dialogue&#34; parts of the film so the story comes through beautifully.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Okay, I have to say I was skeptical but once I startedes I had to finish the entire series.  It definitely has a  &#34;teen&#34; edge to it and the heroine and hero can come across as a little dense sometimes  but it catches your interest and some of the other characters are quite interesting- Especially Magnus Bane.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The end of the triology. I thought it ended pretty well.  Overall. Great movie to add to my collection.<br /><br />HISHE fans.. &#34;Knock Knock&#34;..and you say &#34;who's there&#34; I say 'BAEk&#34;, you say &#34;Baek who?&#34; I say. &#34;Because I'm BATMAN&#34;
1781162646|5.0|I have read a lot of Stephen King, and this book is definitely one of his best. Yes it is short for him, but there is no filler here. Every moment is pure King at its best. Great characters, great setting and mood, just a wonderful read. You forget that it is a mystery novel and just enjoy the ride. Recommended for anyone Stephen King fan or not. Great followup book to the sour taste Under The Dome left me with. Like cold lemonade on a hot summers day. Not going to spoil anything just go read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a<br />a bit slow at first but definitely worth the wait<br />Great story can't wait to read sequel
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Although there were many negative comments and I really had to wrestle through book 4, I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons. There are still some 'stupid' plot twists, that leaves me behind with a feeling of &#34;why did I have to read  the previous 300 pages to come to this end...&#34; but the nice reading outweighs the strange plot.<br />To make it short: I will buy book 6...
B009LGO88E|5.0|Trying to find parts for my 3ds xl is a little bit harder to do than a standard. However when I saw this I jumped on it, it works great and if you're playing a game like monster hunter it's a must have.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you haven't seen the pre-quels, may be slow and confusing. But it does build up, and pulls it off at the end. Makes you wonder about all types of sequels for the future (sub-avengers, avengers).
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|One of the best made tablet protective sleeves I've seen so far. Great padding. Well constructed. I wouldn't trust another except for Belkin. I give this 5 stars, and a big thumbs up! Highly recommended!<br /><br />***DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.
B00DURGZHW|5.0|Fantastic!  Great Huckleberry Finn-Style movie!  Love Matthew and Reece in any movie! Great Surprise Ending!<br />Never bored watching this film once!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Plenty of action, thriller, entertainment, etc... Overall a good family movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel Comics.
B002J2WGLI|5.0|Like many of QT's movies, it is a little shocking / uneven upon first review  (3 stars). However, while the first experience is good, it takes several viewings to really enjoy it to the max (I guess he has the same experience making the films). I would say the 3rd time watching raises it to 4 stars, then afterwoods 5 stars. The irony film work, cut scenes, and stunts are truly amazing. It's years later, and I watch it once a year to keep the memories fresh. Never a letdown! Uncut version with Rosario Dawson is much better, along with the music that grow upon you, but then again, I am a male.
B002361MLA|5.0|This an old favourite of mine and it was wonderful to revisit its wisdom with the magic of whisper net included. It was very powerful to hear this book read by its author.
B009GX69RK|3.0|pretty funny. not as much as the first season, but definitely has it's moments. zooey is, as always, hilarious. :)
B000FVE3AC|4.0|This watch is incredible looking. Much larger dial and markers than other pro diver watches. The skeleton window on the back lets you peek inside at the inner mechanics which are quite impressive looking. I love the stainless steel and I get compliments all the time. Looks and feels great and the price cannot be beat. The only thing that I would change is the thickness of the case itself. It is quite thick and a little bulky. I wish the back of the case of the watch was flush with my wrist.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Great background info, although a very mixed part of her life. Music/success rising, personal life declining, but her musical/entertaining others success makes the file.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|One not to be missed in your Christmas film collection, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a treasure trove of Christmas spirit, giving, and familial bliss during the holidays--or the lack thereof for the majority of us.<br />Christmas cheer gone awry is the tone for this one and it'll put a smile on your face from start to finish.  Nothing says Merry \\"EXPLICATIVE\\" Christmas like this film--a must see during the Holiday season and all year round.
B000ICXQOM|3.0|hilarious! if you're a fan of evil dead 1 & 2, you'll enjoy this... it's a great one! the story line is genius. :P
0399226907|5.0|My son got this from me for Christmas when he was one and a half, he's turning two on Monday and its one of his favorite books. This book is still intact when most others show significant wear from my tot! There is a movie story too so if you play it your kids can follow in the book its so great he's learning to count and knows what some foods are he's never eaten :)#
B0067TQQI8|3.0|I ordered this specifically to provide my HTC One (M7) extra battery life for the Pearl Jam Wrigley 2013 concert. \m/ I ordered it late and didn't think it'd come in time but I got the notification on my phone that the Amazon pkg was on the mail carrier's truck and out for delivery and I spotted my mailman as I was leaving my neighborhood on the way to the concert and got it! I figured, I'd have at least an hour to charge it up maybe halfway while driving. Much to my surprise, the unit was already half charged, which was awesome. I don't know if it was 100% fully charged by the time I had to unplug from my car, but after an hour of driving, all 4 lights were lit. So, the charging seems to be pretty quick which is a big plus.<br /><br />Now, the downside, at least with my unit...<br />The concert had a nearly 3 hr rain delay and my entire group was scattered about. I was one of the few with a little juice still left on my phone's original charge. I plugged my phone into the battery pack with the microUSB connector and set it quietly in the pocket of my purse where it wouldn't be disturbed. I checked it about a half hour later and my phone said it was unable to charge. I thought maybe I didn't have it in the right USB out port of the unit so I switched it, but it immediately said the same thing. After fiddling with it for a bit, I realized the microUSB connector/adapter that attached to the phone was at fault. It didn't have a good connection. In fact, it was so loose, that it literally falls out of the port on it's own. No wonder it wouldn't charge. If I could manage to get it to have some type of connection and hold it extremely still, it would charge. But 9 our of 10 times, I couldn't even hold it in a way that would make a good connection. It's impossible to charge the phone with this faulty adapter.<br /><br />I'm going to be exchanging my unit and hoping the replacement one has better connectors. I *hope* this is just a fluke.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Delivered with a partial charge<br />+ Appears to charge quickly<br />+ Helpful lights indicating charge level<br />+ Lots of adaptors for lots of different devices<br />+ About the size of a deck of cards. Not nearly as heavy or bulky as I feared it would be. It fit just fine in my small purse with my phone. Guys can probably stash it in a pants pocket fairly easily.<br />+ Easy to use, in theory (see instruction notes in cons list)<br />+ LED light is a nice plus; more useful than I had expected.<br />+ convenient pouch for all the connectors and cables.<br /><br />Cons:<br />+ Horrible connector/adapter(s) -- at least the microUSB one I had. I did not check the other adapters.<br />+ Instructions are very limited and never advise what voltage USB output port on the unit should be used for what device. Some type of guideline would have been helpful and much appreciated.<br /><br />I'm going to exchange this through Amazon and hope that the replacement adapters are of better quality and fit correctly. IF they are, I will update my review and increase the star rating. But if I have the same problem, there's no way I can keep this at a 3-star rating, as without a properly fitting adapter, the battery pack is useless. I'm giving this the benefit of the doubt with a 3-star rating at this time, seeing as how few people have mentioned the same problem and therefore it seems to be the exception rather than the rule in the product's quality. We'll see what happens with the replacement.
B0091UGEVY|4.0|This remake of a well known classic puts a few changes while keeping the spirit of the original. The overall story is darker with some good action and sprinkled in with humor. Nothing really scary but I wouldn't recommend it for the youngest of audiences as they would not get most references and probably get bored.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|it's definitely the worst one of the series, but it's not horrible. if you're in the mood, go for it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game. It's mind challenging. I hope they make a follow up game.
0425264351|5.0|I love the fact that the foreword gives a background of Lee Child and how he came to write this first novel. It grabs you from  the first and keeps you rivited all the way through. I couldn't sleep until I found out what happened. The Jack Reacher character is one who will keep us all busy reading further books by Lee Child.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Like that you can custom the work out because I have a bad knee. Would recommend to anyone that has the desire to work out but only can get 10 to do so.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|i found this version to be the worst yet... all the singing did NOT help... and i'm not someone who doesn't like musicals, i usually enjoy them... not this. ick.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Vintage Rollins and Sigma Force, with the technical focus on quantum theory and space-time warping this time, with some history from mthe Genghis Kahn era. Another materpiece!
B006FTCH2E|4.0|Brit Marling's acting in this film is exceptionally affecting, in a story stemming from the idea that in a universe that seems infinitely large, odds are that everything exists more than once.  And if you consider the earth as only a geological  thing, this idea may be relatively easy to get your mind around.  But if, as this movie seems to do, you consider the second earth to comprise not just the identical geological object but also identical duplicates of each and every living entity on it, then the concept is harder to accept.  And especially when this improbable phenomenon is also in easy viewing distance from your hometown.<br /><br />But movies require some suspension of disbelief, and if we manage it for this one, we can share in Rhoda Williams' eagerness to migrate to the second earth, in effect turning back the clock and placing her in a world where her terrible misdeed never happened and where her new friend, the professor still has his happy family.  At the end, I'm wondering about the logistics of having two Rhodas.  Can the newly arrived Rhoda simply live a life away from the family on her new planet, so that they never know of her existence?  Or will the publicity attending the arrival of this first batch of visitors make that impossible?
B00CC1JXYE|2.0|Not bad looking but pretty flimsy. Would have figured to be more sturdy for the price, However the wallet one doesnt look bad and it has the button to close it maybe i'll try that one..
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Strisand (sp?) and Rogen are hilarious in this! Great unexpected duo! I loved it! Thought it was pretty believable story line too.
B0099116AY|5.0|I wouldn't have put Meryl and Tommy together and thought it would work. But they played off each other and together they were magical. This is one of my favorite movies that I've seen in a long while.
140006922X|1.0|Do you want to know what the Muslim view of Christ is? Well, here it is, just like it's been since the Koran was written. Not that it's marketed like that. Absolutely nothing new is here, save the dishonest descriptions of this book.
B009K0OTVM|3.0|Season 2 has its high parts but not as many as season 1. All though season 2 is enjoyable you can tell the writers really lost their focus. Victoria seemed to get more revenge then Emily, since the writers lost their focus the main character lost hers. Now granted I'm only on episode 14 it doesn't seem like much is going to happen the rest of the season.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I think there was just so much hype for this movie that I went in with too high of an expectation...
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I have read 8 Jack Reacher books so far and still have a way to go. I like the character from the books and was thrilled when a movie was coming out, but Tom Cruise playing a 6' 4&#34; 265lb part, no way. I had read several negative reviews and decided to see for myself. I liked the movie once I got past the size comparisons.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|The movies were great, we really enjoyed them. The movies were well made and kept our interest, they did a good job of updating them.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|It's challenging and starts simple and progresses to more difficult to get you used to the ways to play.  I can't stop playing!<br />Really fun!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|i haad to wait for this to come on instant for what felt like forever... after all that time, it wasn't worth it. i usually love paul rudd, but not really in this one. :/
158270208X|4.0|Lovely book and it's a great way to motivate yourself to write daily, specifically relating to gratitude. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated (perhaps I should have paid more attention to the details of the ad) but that does make it easier to carry it with me when I'm out. I purchased one for my daughter, too, and she is very pleased. You might want to also have a look at the author's written books, especially the ones dealing with gratitude, creating peace of mind. All in all, I would purchase again and I'm looking forward to begin writing in the book. I have a lot to be grateful for and, sometimes, I need to remind myself of that!
B002KVZBGA|5.0|I loved the sarcasm and dry humor of this film! It's a must see for any car nut or Michael Cain fan!!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|When reading and playing games, I can look up words for meanings, and to see if the word I use is appropriate.  Valuable!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show... keeps getting better... i cant wait for season 4... one question though: who's mowing all the grass? ;)
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|The help was only for certain levels.. The guide didnt help or explain how to clear all levels. This guide was a waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing for kids and young people who love horses. It could be a teaching/learning app too. It shows how to care for a horse.
1845761502|5.0|We bought this book for our son, a huge fan of Stan Winston's work, for his 13th birthday. Of all of his presents, he showed the most excitment about this book. It is a HUGE hardbound book (easily 12\\" x 12\\" x 1-1/2\\" thick) with an AWESOME cover! It is full of amazing full color production pictures, stills, and artwork and is a thorough examination of Winston's long and illustrious career in Hollywood. The book is a little pricey at $30+, but it is well worth it when you see the wealth of material presented between its covers. It is by far and away the best \\"career retrospective\\" book that I have ever read.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The excitement surrounding this book made me think it was going to have a great story line. I was sorely disappointed. The sexual allure is definitely not disappointing and very graphic,  but if I had to read the main character say &#34;his breath hitched,&#34; &#34;my breath hitched,&#34; or &#34;fifty shades of f***ed up&#34; one more time, I don't know what I would do. Sigh.
1490313370|4.0|I enjoyed the book and realize it may not be for everyone.  I do most of the daily practices mentioned but the one about coming up with ten new ideas everyday.  Now that Is harder than I expected.  I have not been able to keep that pace but I have come up with some bad and great ideas.  I think we all need to push our minds beyond the ordinary and this is a great help.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The free version is excellent and lots of fun. :-)<br /><br /> There are 4 different levels and 12 games within each level with varying degrees of difficulty
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is the best game i played. i play this game every day all day thank you for this game
B008JFUPBC|5.0|Sadly, there are some people that are still disillusioned by black skin that they can't see beyond it to give this movie a fair shake.  I was super excited to see this film on the big screen but couldn't understand they horrid reviews until about 20 minutes into the film....no white people on screen.  I won't spoil it for those interested in seeing it but overall the movie is great and Jayden does a superb job as well. It is a story of family struggles and bonding. Don't be fooled by those that can't see beyond blackness.  Had the film centered around a white family or perhaps if there was a white side kick it would've received better views.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun version of the game. Happy it is free. Great fun for all ages. Just wish I was better at the game...lol
B007C3TVEY|2.0|'Birthed' a bad seed, did you? Oh well, mother, however you child turns out . . . especially if he's smart, manipulative, hateful, violent, - - that is to say, really, really violent, - - mommy dearest, it's all your fault. Never mind what anyone else does [especially his father] you are to blame and don't you ever forget that. If you had loved this disturbed child enough, had you read him the correct books rather than the one you chose, who knows?<br /> he may have turned out a darling.<br />  Come now, the theory that mothers are responsible for 'bad seeds,' for autism and other conditions characterized by 'abnormal absorption' with the self was punishing and out of date 30 years ago.<br />Even a brilliant actress could not save this flick.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I thought it would just be okay. I love Jamie. I love Kerry. I love Leonardo. I love Sam Jackson. And I STILL thought it was going to be the typical cheesy slave movie that they make every 3 or 4 years. This was far from it. I didnt even think I would be able to sit through 2 whole hours of this crap. I was SO WRONG.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino did his thing!  It had me dying of laughter one minute and angry the next. It was GREAT.<br /><br />Definitely a must see.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is just amazing.  I saw her in concert recently and realized what a golden voice she has.  Now I've been buying all of her older CD's and just falling in love with them.
B007U8UBGI|4.0|Let me start this by stating that I am neither a Jack White nor White Stripes fan.  Sure, I have a couple White Stripes album and listen to them occasionally, but I find it a little too pretentious and derivative of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.  With that said, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself really digging this album after I purchased it on discount on a whim.  The music is a bit less white-boy-reinterpreting-the-blues and far more &#34;rock,&#34; in the best possible way.
B008133MDK|5.0|I am a Sherlock Holmes fan starting with Basil Rathbone! So to see the updated version was exciting for me. Benedict is a great Sherlock. The acting was outstanding as far as I am concerned. I hope they decide to do more.
140006922X|5.0|Religious fundamentalism is the bane of the world, in any religion. The uproar on this book is by Christian fundamentalists.  To them Aslan is more dangerous than Richard Dawkins because while he is defending religion, he is portraying Chris as he really was as a historical figure.  Why don't his critics realize, that Azlan is the best defense for religious belief.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had the Chromecast for a a few days now.  I was one of the lucky ones to purchase it from Amazon before the 3-month Netflix subscription cutoff time.  It's great for streaming content from a mobile device to TV.  I have a iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy S4, and Nexus 7 in my household and every device works flawlessly.  I know the SDK was just released and will take some time before more developers adopt this into their apps.  But as a developer, you'd be smart to adapt this asap since the Chromecast is flying off the shelves.  It beats the Apple TV and Roku by price at this point.  Once more apps hop on board, it might be a game-changer for this niche market.<br /><br />I have it connected via USB-powered through the HDMI port on my Panasonic Plasma.  I could care less about the auto-turn feature when connected via power adapter or HDMI 1.4 port.  All I care for is content on my TV without connecting multiple devices.  Hopefully, this is the future for all streaming media.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I had been ignoring every reference to the Game of Thrones TV show in order to avoid any spoilers.  I was adamant I should read the books before I sat down for a typical marathon tv-viewing session of the GoT.  This 4 book set seemed like the easiest (and most economical) way to go [outside of buying the books used].  Let me say: I am so glad I read the books!<br /><br />The series is fantastic.  I have dabbled in the fantasy genre (I read the Wheel of Time, Tolkien [of course], and part of the Sword of Truth series), but I would never consider myself an aficionado by any stretch of the imagination.  The books are extremely well written, the characters well thought out engaging (with the exception of one or two characters who fail to develop or are very unrealistically developed), the dialogue realistic and witty and the &#34;world&#34; convincing.  The true gem of the series, however, is the plotting, scheming, backstabbing and undermining [i.e.THE game of thrones].  Martin does not shy away from sex or violence (thereby making the story in some weird way seem &#34;realistic&#34;), but the story is relatively fast paced intricately planned.  A fantasy book for both fantasy and non-fantasy fans alike (which is why, I think, the tv show is so popular).<br /><br />Now regarding reading the series BEFORE the show: I read each book before its respective season (e.g. book one, watched season one, book 2, watched season 2).  This was very good, especially for condensing and solidifying the main themes. The tv show departs somewhat from the book (starting in the second season), but this is not necessarily bad - the choices were interesting.  However, be warned that certain things from future books do start leaching into the earlier seasons and certain aspects foreshadow future events more than they do in the books.  I don't think there are any particularly big &#34;spoilers&#34; from this, but it is something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Last, concerning the form of this kindle book: It is very nice to have all the books in one spot.  However, it is difficult to flip back-and-forth to the maps.  Moreover, because it is such a LONG series, it is difficult to gauge how much progress you make in each individual book because the &#34;percentage read&#34; is for the ENTIRE four books rather than each one.<br /><br />All in all, this book (i.e. 4 books) is a great value and great read if you have a few months to kill and/or want to read the books before the series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a good read - the ending was a surprise - the characters could use more development of their personalities.<br />I would read it again and I would recommend it - quick enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|SUPER FUN GAME!! Keeps me entertained while I'm bored! I love the fact you can play offline as well so I don't always have to have Internet.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has been a big eye opener not only about the food we eat and how it reacts in our bodies but also what is going on in the crops we eat!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|terrific preamps and it looks good and feels very durable. I almost immediately upgraded to the pro40 unit from focusrite because I loved this things
030789701X|4.0|I bought this almost as a record of a how great the game was, for my library, however i did try and use it a few time while playing the Dragonborn expansion, sadly there is just so much information that looking things up can take quite a bit of back and forth, and much of the text is in 6 point or even smaller copy. It is almost always faster just to Google any questions you have. Still i don't regret buying it, it is a great and though guide to the game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Put one psycho-bitch wife (Amy) together with one narcissistic husband (Nick) and you get one heck of a detonation. Marriage values sure have come a long way...<br /><br />Gone Girl is a suspenseful crime thriller that is absolutely over-the-top intriguing. When the wife goes missing, of course the first suspect is always the husband! In every aspect, the cheating bastard is forever guilty. But wait, just when you have it all figured out, the story comes to its climax, and all hell breaks loose. (It reminds of the movie War of the Roses. Certainly, there is no correlation but the fact that husband and wife stay together with such vengeful dislike, they might as well off each other.) Brilliant story! Absolutely Fabulous! Highly Recommend!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Some of the best action movies out there!  All in one boxed set?  Even better!  They look fantastic on my 46&#34; panasonic!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Excellent read good use of imagination . Easy read my granddaughters love this book. They look forsard to each chapter
B001EN71CW|5.0|We saw it the last four episodes when it first aired.  When the DVD came out, we got and watched and watched.  Now we are introducing it to our son.  We have lent out the set to several friends. Well, we are ready for the Blue Ray!! Cannot wait to watch them all over again.
B00DB3HJ8E|5.0|Extraordinary! House of Cards...Best. Show. Ever.! I believe Kevin Spacey has reinvented himself (Spacey for President): he is OUTSTANDING as character actor Congressman Francis Underwood. And you know, he has those devilish facial features that fit right in with DC's power-hungry, rat-bastard, dirty politicians (of course, not literally labeling such derogatory adjectives towards true-to-life US politicians *cough, gag*). And I also thought Corey Stoll (Peter Russo) gave a stellar performance up to his last breath.<br /><br />I just have to say, casting director Laray Mayfield (et al) deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the show's success because the entire cast and their over-the-top performance just fused this oh-hum political satire into one of the most spectacular dramas of all time! The writing is as equally as phenomenal, but the all-star cast did it for me...they just melded perfectly! Honors go to Netflix for their adaptation of this incredibly remarkable series! Highly recommend!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love these movies!  The first two movies look like they were made in the last 10 years or better.  They look absolutely phenomenal!  Number 3 & 4 look great, but it's not a huge change from the original releases.  I haven't had a chance to go through all the extras, but there are a TON of extras.  It could take me a while!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I just think this is an awesome and exciting app!!  Please make even more so i can enjoy the  surprises around every corner
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works very good, u need to have high speed internet, no issues with my 40 Mb/s internet speed. Hope they hurry and add more apps to it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fantastic for children and adults alike. my two year old lives Despicable me, she tries to play the game with me but she also loves to watch the minions tun around, fly and tun into things. Sound effects are also accurate and fun.
B001G8XON0|5.0|My favorite movie- spectacular in Blu-Ray. An epic, trippy, heartfelt masterpiece. And don't pass up Great Gatsby by the same director.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are fun.  Well some of them.  I like that they are short so that you can play them quickly.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book in the series was the best!  The final book is ok and finally bring closure to the tragedy of the Mocking Jay character.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app. It is very simple to use and has very good info. I would recommend this site to others
006178480X|5.0|Absolutely love this book. James Rollins at his best (again). Read the book in three days. Couldn't put it down.I have every book he has ever written.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this.  I just downloaded it a few days ago.  This is fun and has stickers, paint, crayons, pencils, and markers.  Really easy to use.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I love this series and can't wait for more to come. We highly recommend it.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It was a good book but it didn't end as well as I hoped:(  I'm hoping there will be another that explains who truly wins the game of thrones:)  This book killed off many of the main characters and players, but it didn't out right let you know who truly won.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book for anyone looking for an unusual side to a murder mystery.  The main character is very believable and the reader can really relate to his situation.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It's a great movie, not directed towards kids or teenagers. I thought it was at first, then I watched it andI loved it
B0011NVCO8|5.0|I bought this movie for my boyfriend. It is is favorite movie. When I recieved it I almost thought that it was not going to play because of the HD DVD but I was able to play the Standard DVD. So be sure to pay attention that it has both and not just the one, like me... overlooked it too fast. I was just happy that I found it for a good price. If you like/love this movie I recommend adding it to your collection.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When I first started using the app it crashed every time I launched it. After it got over that problem and actually started letting me watch videos, the video freezes every few seconds. It buffers or something related to that. It would be a good app if the freezing would stop because you can't enjoy the video with all the freezing.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|As expected Michael Connelly weaves an interesting plot around the troubled life of Harry Bosch.  You can't go wrong with this one.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Western movies ever made by Sergio Leonne watch Henry Fonda play the ultimate bad guy which is quite a bit different from the roles usually played.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|We bought our daughter a hape wooden kitchen and bought this set as well. It's adorable and so well made. She's thrown it on the floor and it seems very resilient.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I couldn't watch videos on it all it does is lag and lag and lag every time watched a video it would just stop and load for ever it would go for 1 second and then it would load again so I say to not get this because it is stupid and can't watch videos
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|Once again Shinedown rock the hell out of ya! This is a kick-ass CD. Loved this cd from begging to end!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|If you're a Sigma Force fan, you'll love this.  Was a quick read and I couldn't put it down.  Love the historical mixed in with some potential real life situations.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the Crossfire series it is fantastically wonderful! I have to say that I like it better then Fifty Shades and I have told everyone I know the same. I can't wait to read what the future holds for Cross and Eva.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Love the game but hate that my kindle fire updates are rarely on time.  Sometimes it takes almost a week to get the new city.  Fix that and will make my review a five star.
140006922X|1.0|Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.  He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br /><br />With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is not a new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views thatMuslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.<br /><br />I am disappointed in Amazon for presenting this book as some sort of History when in fact, it is just more Islamic trash.
B002APU580|4.0|This movie was great in every way except the music. I will watch it over and over and over again.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|There wasn't much to this game. You are a ship on a 2-D Screen as it scrolls enemies at you from top to bottom. As you destroy the ships they leave mines that track you. Sometimes you get a power-up. I didn't understand how you got it and there were no instructions. The game became very boring within 5 minutes. Not to good.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We're using it for iphone 5 and Note 2, it charges without any problems.  We're going to pick up another for the second car, it saves another cig adapter for something else (if you have two in your car).
B00BIPCY14|4.0|It's semi addicting. I'm watching it in conjunction with house of cards. A must for political buffs. Get on it!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app everyday on my Kindle Fire and I'm so glad I got it. Considering it's free, it does quite a lot for me including keeping tabs on weather in other towns, States and even countries! I would reccomend it to anyone who asked!

0142428280|5.0|Ken Follet is  an amazing writer.  He has written a captivating story intertwining historical events and wonderfully interesting characters.  It is a book that's very difficult to stop reading....even at two o'clock in the morning!

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|There needs to be more levels! I was having such a blast figuring out the order of the puzzles that I just kept going and before I knew it, the last level was complete! A fun little game! I got it as the free app of the day, but I'd gladly pay .99 for it. I'd also gladly pay .99 for a new level expansion pack or a part 2! (Hint, hint, Bart Bronte!) I'd suggest this for anyone who likes figuring out silly puzzles. :)
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Steve Mcqueen and racing at LeMans, need I say more. If you like racing, you need this movie in your collection. Put it right next to Grand Prix.
B00DU6UD0I|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. the references and parodies are awesome!! Love to watch it again and again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is incredibly fun to play and doesn't get boring too quickly. It's nice to be able to go at your own pace while still completing objectives.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is highly addictive. I get lost on it for hours. Don't tell my family though. I'm actually doing research!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't get enough.  Turns in the story I did not see coming. What great ups and downs. I can hardly wait to see what season 4 will bring..
B000HX6DCO|5.0|This is good if you like the TV Show. This is like a long version of a TV episode, only awesomer J
B00AALX5SI|5.0|If you like her music, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />It was entertaining, raw, and emotional.  I highly recommend this movie!
B0086700CM|1.0|I have no choice but to hate it since it never successfuly downloaded to my phone.  The game purchased with no problems but the download never started.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|After 5 books I was looking forward to some closure, instead I was introduced to an entirely new group of characters that add little<br />to the overall substance of the storyline. It's one thing to write with a suspenseful ending, but to keep killing the characters then reviving them is getting predictable and annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Greaaaaaaaaaaaat game nice work I really enjoyed it and my sister loves it can u guys create a subway surfers 2
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This product does exactly what it is supposed to. Just follow the instructions based on the operating system you have in the supplied install guide and it's pretty much plug & play. Note for non-XP operating systems: You will need to run the supplied disc (or go online to retrieve the drivers, which is usually easier anyway. If you do decide to use the disc, pick your OS (Win8/7/etc.). I found that for Win 7 or 8 (32 or 64bit) if you select those drivers it just takes you to the drivers themselves and doesn't actually load anything. However, if you go to the 3rd option which has a bunch of numbers it actually has an installer. Once installed, connect Ethernet cable to adapter and plug adapter into USB port. Done.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I have no choice but to hate it since it never successfuly downloaded to my phone.  The game purchased with no problems but the download never started.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this game constantly for the last few months. Definitely the best of this type of game. I got quickly bored with Temple Run 1 and 2, but keep on playing this one. The graphics are good. Only gripe:could do with a better choice of background music, or a few to choose from I play the game with the sound off.
B0091REZMW|3.0|game isn't bad it doesnt work well on my kendle fire it keeps lagging buti used to playit on face book and it was a good way to
B00AEBB932|5.0|This movie was part of a Father's day gift.  My dad is old school and he absolutely loves this move.  He talked about it all the time as being the best Western ever made.  When I surprised him with a copy he made everybody sit down and watch it.  Great classic.
B00013RC8O|4.0|It's an old one from the early 70's I think.  The cars in the movie are big V-8's.  The cop cars are old model cars, it's an old movie but it's a pretty good movie.  Stands the test of time.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|It was way too cheesy for my taste. Good action scenes but everything else is very predictable and cheesy.  Also VERY graphic.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Can't wait until number two is out on blu-ray! I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes funny comedies
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Love it . I am so sad about Cory Montieth. I'm glad I can rewatch anytime I want. RIP Cory.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Can't stop playing! Wish there were more levels free or that the coins were easier to get...but still love it.
B00AF82WTO|4.0|I love this film! Thanks for offering it! I appreciate your quick reliable service and the secure way you package my ordered items!:D
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. This app is really fun and you get to fight monsters such as creepers,zombies, skeletons,ghost,and lots more. And you get to build houses,mine for diamonds,kill animals,bake a cake,and lots more!!!!! So buy minecraft it's great so get it now for $7.00!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I did not think this show was going to be as good as it is. The characters are well developed, with sufficient motivation for their choice of actions. I am hooked and cant wait to see how things are handled. So glad I know there are a few more seasons. All the good Sci-Fi seems to get canceled too soon... Lead on
1476733953|5.0|This novel definitely lives up to the reviews that have already been posted. I thought it was just as thrilling as The Da Vinci Code, which is the most thrilling novel I have ever read. It has renewed my interest in the science fiction genre, which I have not touched in over a decade. Hugh Howey has a gift for making the reader turn page after page.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|You should get this game. It is cool. It is good. Blob blob blob of the blogosphere blob blob blobs
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It has been a long time since I stayed up until I could no longer keep my eyes open and then up early to finish it before doing anything else.<br /><br />A beautifully written story about love and choices. I highly recommended this book with a big box of tissues by your side.<br /><br />I am still thinking about these characters hours after the last page was read.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci once again executes a thriller that I had to make myself stop reading when other duties called. Great characters. Already began The Hit and or appears to be as good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this app! I can't wait for more rooms to become available to work my way through! My children also enjoyed playing it with me!<br />r!
B00CW665VI|5.0|It's a book that makes you giggle on Subway.<br />Then you know you have to stop cause either you laugh like a freak or the part is too hot to handle..
0446571415|4.0|Needed this to complete the Camel Club collection. David Baldacci is always fun to read. This series is a lot of fun.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Very interesting to read the other reviews.  I enjoyed myself, but do wish I better understood what the author was trying to do with the son, the son's girlfriend, and Patty.  Warning: I did find that it did drag in sections.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I was surprised at how much fun this game is. It's challenging but not discouraging. Excellent choice. I, however, would recommend the ability to save during page challenges.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|Here's how you watch this movie. In the opening sequence, quickly press fast-forward and wait until you see the alien spaceships. Observe for a minute or two. Fast forward again until the spaceships turn into naval ships. Observe. If any of the humans star talking to each other, press the FF button as quickly as possible (you'll thank me for that). Keep fast forwarding. Pretty soon, you'll realize that you miss nothing by watching it in fast-forward. Play the movie normally only when you want to see the aliens in more detail (although, not much to see their either). Hopefully, you'll fall asleep somewhere in the middle, like I did. Next time I want to see a movie about space aliens, I'll watch Predator or Aliens for the 100,000th time, and it's still going to be a zillion times more entertaining that this flick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing that's wrong is that on other devices its version 0.7.2 and for me it's 0.7.1 so yea
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Easy to understand. Challenging but not too challenging. Would recommend this for teens and older. Unless really good at math may be too challenging for younger children
B007REV4T8|1.0|As a true Bond fan, I absolutely hated this movie. Stupid and boring are the only two words that come to mind right now. Horrible acting all around. No story whatsoever. Let's see. A renegade double O agent as a villain? Already been done in a real Bond film. Moneypenny is an operative and a sniper? How cute. Q is a computer hacker? They don't make gadgets anymore? What do you mean??? This is a Bond film, for Christ's sake! It's one really dumb thing after another. One scene was somewhat promising though, the very last one where the M's office looks like the M's office and M finally looks like M. At the end of the movie, I was ready to give up on Bond altogether, but this closing scene gave me some hope. \\"Bond will return\\"? I sure hope he will, but I don't get my hopes too high. As it is, Skyfall is the worst Bond movie ever, and that comes from someone who watched every single one of them a million times.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|The CD arrived today, and I've listened to both disks 3 times so far. Every single song on the CD is awesome! Buddy Guy is one of those rare gems that only get better as time goes by. Rhythm & Blues is classic hard hitting Chicago Blues......only turned up to 11.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone... who can play it. I love it. I play it everyday and it is very addictive!!! 8)
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Jeffrey Archers books. He is a superb writer.<br />I recommend his books to all who love a well-told story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun you can go to different places it is so much fun.It is very attractive to kids.:):):):):0:0:0:0:0;)
1573226521|4.0|I had seen the movie \\"The Beach\\" and really liked it - I was fascinated by the dark angle the story had.  I almost never read fiction, and I've been trying to get more into reading, so I thought I'd give the book a try since I enjoyed the movie.  I actually liked the book a whole lot more.  It was well written, but not complex, and was an easy read.  I much preferred this book to another by Alex Garland, The Tesseract, which I am currently reading.  The Beach has a much more developed story line and Alex Garland, in my opinion, writes better as the narrator/main character than he does in 3rd person.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is awesome but I'd like it even more if you could collect Redstone ores and have flint and steel on creative, and ad levers. Besides that it's a perfect game!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|In my opinion Lotus and Bionic are the best albums in her career. It's really sad the promotion of these albums because they're excellent..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who looooovvvveeeesss horses!!!! it is really addictive and enjoyable... all and all its awesome!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fast paced really fun and I never get tied of it.Keeps you coming back to try to stay ahead of friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun<br />love it this is a good game for all ages. I would recommend it to everyone. from children to adults
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game fun and its not boring such as temple run is i like this game because i loved the movie
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Really liked it, lots of cracks about their old movies. It just one of those movies, not the best acting, not the best story line, but worth watching just for the laughs
B00CF34B2I|5.0|its magic. a lot of fun. may have getten me to play the card game again. a little annoyed that I cant build the clone deck the Ai used against me.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|But the discs were for region 5&6. Totally unplayable in the US(region 1). Totally bummed out, was planning a mini marathon for the weekend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved the characters. The book is way better than the movie for sure. Way more descriptive and you can feel as if you can relate and put yourself in Charlie's position. The story ending is okay. But I would definitely recommend it to someone in high school or anybody
B0015T7Q98|4.0|Out of all this band's work, this is the most laid back and, for lack of a better term, happy. The melodies are light and heavily instrumental with orchestra and the like, with a modern twist. A \\"country folk\\" sound is frequently featured.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Tragic story with no happy ending but so is life sometimes.  I would have liked to read more about the girl and the angst she was experiencing.  Her mom should have let everyone else know what she had discovered in the diary.  It may have helped everyone else get some closure.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I give this show 5 stars because I love the sci fi genre along with the post apocalyptic genre so this show is a hit to me. Falling Skies is very entertaining for all ages.
0446310786|3.0|So I just finished reading this book which is considered as a big classic. I felt it was lacking in terms of story base and by the time the end finally grabs you, you are too bored to care. Also nothing materializes about Dill, his character introduction was great. At times, you also felt Scout's narration is intentionally skewed in the abyss of a lost child. Yes, Atticus was interesting, the whole court room workout was great, it was the beginning of a new era back then and that I can respect, but the overall province of the book is good, albeit slightly boring. I thought maybe I am too old for a book like this but maybe if I was younger too, I wouldn't have found it very interesting. The writing is just about alright and the start is kind of draggy.<br /><br />To people who can get their hands on the audiobook, I feel it may just be more rewarding as an audio book.<br />I wish there weren't so many neighbors, it was quite annoying to lose touch.
1451627297|4.0|**NO SPOILERS**<br /><br />If I could give this book 4.5, I would. 5 stars is reserved for perfection, and this book comes close. With such a lengthy novel, there is plenty of room for character development, which King does a fantastic job of. While it seems like there may be plenty of story lines to keep track of with this many pages, King keeps the story very centered around the mission of Jake Epping. While that mission may change, I kept becoming more enamored with Jake (George) and his life in 1958.<br /><br />The only downside to this book is that about halfway through, King seems to hit a plateau and the story becomes quite stagnant. It is not to the point of sheer boredom, but it does not seem to be moving forward at the same pace it was before. After this section however, the story picks back up and gives an ending that makes it hard to put down the book in the last 250 pages. I loved this story and the characters involved. I will not pretend to be a Stephen King fanatic, but it would be hard to find anyone that I would not recommend this book to. Incredible breadth of a story that I hope many people will enjoy.
B0001MLMKY|2.0|It was just too small. Their unisex size is really small. I have always loved swatch and will continue to wait until they release this style watch in a mens size
1451626096|1.0|Usually, I cannot put down Gregory's books. I really wanted to like this book, but I find myself struggling to finish reading this book with such a sad main character.<br /><br />The author relies too much on her previous character developments in her other books on the White Queen (Queen Elizabeth) and the Red Queen (Margaret of Beaufort), and spends no effort in having you relate to the plot/character of Elizabeth of York and Henry of Landcaster. The whole book is just a rather naggy, tedious description of how miserable Elizabeth of York's life is (really, I get it, Henry VII doesn't trust her, don't need to recount that every single page. Yes, he is also a Mommy's boy, and the mother is a religious freak, I got that 100 pages ago, no need for yet another paragraph).<br /><br />If you are expecting this to be a lovely conclusion to the War of the Roses series from her, you will be disappointed.  I think, with this book, I will end my following with the author.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this is a great version helps pass the time<br />great to be able to play with friends and random people not just a computer
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't like Facebook this still allows people to post every second of there life you should go outside and tell your friends how your day was not the whole internet
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is my favorite game to play. And it is good to get mind off of things and just playing for fun. I would totally recommend it it for Video game people people this this product is always a five stars
B009S33I68|5.0|Wonderful book with excellent detail on events. Nice addition with comments from soldiers in the trenches. A victory for air assault and brilliant tactics against a seasoned force.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Is very easy and addictive the graphic in each nivel is nice. I am very happy with this game and the initial download is free, the bad is buy other upgrade.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Based on a true story.  The acting was superb all around.  Don't miss this one!  An absolutely excellent film.  Couldn't recommend more highly.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It  was good I had a hard time to  put it down<br />I'm glad that I bought the book it was worth every penny
B000003CMD|5.0|I had this disk in the past and have always been a big fan of the Allmans.  The disk got lost in the shuffle at some point and made this purchase to replace it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love Love Love Downton Abbey.  That says it all - it is not quite as tragic as Season 3 so enjoy while you can!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums.  Lost my original disk somewhere and took the opportunity to replace it as a great price.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Honest, introspective, real.  A great read for those of us wishing to choose the path that lies within us. Bravo!
B001VFTYWI|4.0|Four stars because I did not enjoy this one as I have many previous Cornwell's.  This one felt like a part two.  No real new crime until the end.  The whole plot was an explanation of Black Notice and Point of Origin!
140006922X|1.0|A Muslim writing about what he thinks about Jesus Christ and Christianity.  I wonder how that will turn out?  This book is purely opinion and will not shake the faith of millions of Christians.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The bag itself is great. I like that you can configure the main pocket to your heart's content.  It easily stores my Nikon D5100, 3 lenses, a bag of various charging cables, the Nikon’s battery charger, a AAA/AA battery charger, two iPads, passports...all sorts of stuff.  Construction looks solid; the shoulder straps are well-padded.<br /><br />Now...here are the problems.  The buckle on the right shoulder strap was mounted backwards.  This makes it impossible to adjust the shoulder strap since the little grippy parts of the buckle are facing the wrong way....you'd pull the strap to tighten things up but it would slide back since there is no friction to hold it in place.  Next, the snaps that buckle together on the shoulder straps were sewn on unevenly.  The left one is about 2 inches higher than the right one.  This makes it impossible to comfortably strap them tighter to relieve stress on your shoulders.  This bag is getting returned.  I'm hopeful that Amazon will send a proper bag next time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great new game for my grandson to play on my kindle. Don't like the ads to suggest you buy points.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great for kids and adults its fun and keeps you coming back . the voices add an extra quality that is fun .....if you love the movie you will love this game
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It does not seem historically accurate in how the characters talk and act with each other.  They act more like it is 1965 than one hundred years ago.  It makes me think there is a strong agenda taking place in the writing.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I started watching it and was drawn to the story. It's a beautiful love story with a sad ending to me. Loved it.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|This show looked interesting, but I wasn't able to follow the series each week and then I just quit trying to watch it. I think watching all the episodes sequentially really made the complicated plots easier to follow. It took a few months for me to watch them all.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun flow and cute graphics. Time seems to fade away quickly while my appetite grows at an alarming rate. Easy game to learn and play. Fun for the whole family.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game, my kids and I love it . Level 22 and still have not regret downloaded it.very good animation,.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's so wonderful and I can go all day playing it and not get bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is extremely fun and it keeps me and my boyfriend entertained for hours. There's nothing more fun them watching minions run and hit other minions and obstacles. Enjoy it very much!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I like the different puzzles in this game. Even those that frustrate me or take me too long to finish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I personally am a minion fanatic I love them I also love temple run and subway surfers. This mixed my fav apps and made it different with battles backgrounds from the movies and cool power ups definitely a winner!!!!!!!!!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Saw this movie on television.  Loved it so much that we bought a copy for us and a copy for our son.  Great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did not want to put it down.  Can not wait to read the sequel.  One of the best books I've read lately. - Teresa Wagoner
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I could play all day everyday everyone should get this game.you get coins and prizes.you can also unlock other people .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't watch fast enough!! Want more!! I cannot wait for season 4. Superb acting.  Great story line. i watch it on my kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great it's better than subway surfers and temple run even though it freezes up from time to time it's still a really good and addicting game to play
B00821OX98|5.0|Just started watching this year. Really enjoying the show. Not too slow paced, keeps new action coming and manages to answer questions. Looking forward to seeing the remainder of the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game  is so awesome and give a idea to kids how to take care of a animal. It also teaches kids responsibility.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was difficult for me to put down. Very surprising ending. How tragic and frustrating it must be for those who suffer from any type of memory loss. This book captured the essence of starting your life over every day due to amnesia. Great book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|You shold get the game it is awesome I highly recommend it. If you've played it you will understand.The WAY to play is easy and the best of all is that it never ends , you keep running and running.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I love this board. Great UI, everything fits nicely, and the debugging LED is extremely useful.<br /><br />Just remember to put the cover on BEFORE putting installing it in the case--I forgot to do this and it would require me to dismantle my entire machine to get the plate on, so I'm living dangerously right now.<br /><br />Also, the power button and BIOS light glow orange, which was an awesome surprise since my case is also orange!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|It's Michael Buble, need I say more?  I like his music in the car since it relaxes me.  It is also a much better choice than what is on the news.  Michael's voice does justice to all the songs.
0345803485|5.0|I have never read a &#34;naughty&#34; book before, I was never attracted to the harlequin romance novels, but I heard so much about this one that I decided to read it. It was exciting to read and very hard to put down. After I read it, my sister borrowed it and read it and her husband is reading it now. I have since bought the other two books and am reading the last one now, this is a great read :)
1603425381|5.0|I've used many of these borders on blankets I make for Project Linus.  I've also used a couple on other crocheted projects like scarves and sweaters.  Clear directions and great color pictures.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun awesome game that will keep you intertained for hours on end but wait there's more use your coins to get things it teaches real life lessons
B00E8B1358|2.0|This sequel to \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra\\" had half the action and a very disjointed story. Time spent on highlighting the \\"A list\\" actors (ie. Johnson, Pryce, Willis) slowed the pace and lended itself to boredom. I didn't expect a riveting plot, but I did expect at least the wall to wall exciting action \\"popcorn flick\\" that the first one was...I did appreciate the HD quality as well as the presentation in Full screen.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I love movies with small cast and one location. additional disk showed the background of the star and the making of the movie. very interesting. The special effects were amazing. The animals were incredible and the acting superb. Not a boring moment in the movie for me. I really enjoyed it. A great movie for collectors. Buy it.
B00847KFDS|5.0|What a great CD the arrangements were great and the blend of the artists are great. If you don't like John Fogertys music then you will after you listen to this amazing CD.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Action was nonstop, lines were cheesy but hilarious. Video quality was great. It was cool to see so many action heroes from my youth in one place. Highly recommend. Language wasn't as bad as Part 1.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I found that I had to read to the end to find out what would happen to this bad character!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Such a funny movie for young adults and teens. Funny plot and characters are great. Channing Tatum shows his funny side.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I do believe this could be 100 times better. I completed it in 5 minutes with no sign of Slender man whatsoever. I dislike the graphics as well. It definitely could have been better.
B000067FP8|5.0|This movie is a lot more funny than the previous gremlins gremlins movie... i think that this movie is also not as dark.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Being a fan of live concert DVDs, this one is my favorite of all time.<br />One of the greatest bands ever showcasing their unique portfolio of songs and sounds.<br />Great showmanship like only Freddie Mercury had.<br />Highly recommended!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|There are a lot of bad comments about this movie here is another one EWW !!! All of the orginal actors weren't in the movie plus movie didn't flow together correctly just all together so stupid.All of the movie money when on Bruce Wills and the Rock. WASSSTTTEEE of $$$$.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Love playing big fish casino, big wins, lots of different games to play and love the challenges and the ability to socialize with others while you play.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just got it on the mail and installed it on my TV using my Samsung Galaxy SIII in 2 mins. I turned on Netflix and it works perfectly with full HD! And it loads even faster than my computer. Before I was looking for pricey DVD Players with wifi in order to stream Netflix on my TV, but now with Chromecast I dont need to spend on a pricey DVD Player to get what I needed.<br />Must buy!
B001LXIDVS|5.0|The final chapter of the trilogy brings love to Doc Brown, as the story comes full circle.<br />&#34;Your future is not written yet, so make it a good one!&#34;<br />Words to live by!
140006922X|5.0|I am very surprised by the hair on fire reaction to the book. Please read and make up your own mind. That's why you have one!
B00B97SNJI|4.0|The sound and the song writing are really great!<br />I look to hear of great things to come from them.<br />They are really gifted.<br />Terry Lee Sartin
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love this series! The characters are fun and the storyline is unique. The writer is not afraid to have a little fun and humor with the script.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Just the game to relax with. It is very simple, just my level! I like the way one need only to tap a card and it jumps to it's obvious place in the order of things. Great fun. If you like card games and want a non taxing one this is for you.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game.  I just wish you had more coins to play with without buying.  I do like the graphics but it is so hard to get the prizes when they always fall off the edges. It is fun to play so I will continue with my 40 coins that regenerate daily.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addicting! You run out of coins pretty quickly, so it's more like a play-a-day game to me, lol.
B00AW57L96|4.0|There is a lot of interaction and blending with the people in this story, which is related in a very organized fashion.  Lots of secrets come from the male side, but make no mistake, the female side has a lot to share.  Who's baby? is the end question.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|Not his best work.  Dialogue a bit hokey, but story line is fun to follow.  I like the complexity of his stories.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read the book in anticipation of the movie. It was alright. Took me longer than usual to read it. Never a good sign.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app I live in the city so I can never have a horse so this will do but this is an awesome app
B009NY43NY|3.0|Thank goodness. I am definitely over these books. They just got sillier and sillier. I like Tue Blood much better
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Yep, it's as good as everyone says. Finished it in two days, and it's a sizable work. Plenty of action, intrigue, a story that moves along at a decent pace, a magic system that doesn't overshadow the story, and a protagonist who is easy to like but no Marty Stu, as the author actually allows him to fail. Well worth a read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son has wanted to get this game for a while. I finally gave in and it was well worth it. Great game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My household just can't seem to get enough of this series.  Series 3 was every bit as good as series 1 and 2.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie and the Hero of the story is also the &#34;villain.&#34; My 9 year old has autism and major sensory issues. He is rough with things but has a heart of gold. He just wants to do things with and for others, but is often shunned due to his inability to be delicate and soft handed. Ralph is a flawed &#34;person&#34; and yet he is only a villain in the sense that it is the role he must play given how he was created. He is honestly the biggest hero and in the end he is loved and accepted for how he was made. God created our son perfectly and he is exactly who he should be. He watches this movie at least once a week and he really loves Ralph.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|stays out of the way and tells you the percentage battery you have left, im sure there are other features i'm not using but purely as a battery gauge it is worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's harder than it looks or what you think it would be for a kids game! It is SUPER cute & very addictive! One of my favorites.  Good luck. .. u will need it.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|the game will not let me expand. no point to playing it if I cant grow my game not happy
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Before reading this book I did not think to become author, to write for Kindle. So if it was changed, anybody can conclude what is power of such book. Amazon with such books and authors can improve the culture of any society. Now we have possibility to become active participant of society, to contribute sharing love, truth, and freedom with others. Will I write now, or in one month or year is less important than FEEL that I can be free to write what I want. For such experience I am grateful because my dream is to share what I think with others.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I LOVE IT! I have watch this movie over and over again, it always lifts me up and get me motivate to do more....
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Helps you understand the HBO series better giving  and explaining nuances possibly missed when seeing it in television. Good read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|nice new graphics. easy to read. I especially like the pages with the forecasts for the upcoming ten days. this is a good app made a bit better and a lot easier on the eyes.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I WAS VERY PLEASED with the ease of installation and use of the application on my Kindle Fire HD. I was concerned if it would work as many apps do not say say fire HD only Fire. I was able start its use in a matter of minutes.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie! Have since I was a little kid, and that hasnt changed at all. :) :) :)
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was very surprised of the knowledge that.Tesla had an his vision and ideas. I guess I never really thought much about Teams till I read this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fascinating story. Could not put this down. Haunting and realistic, this book will stick with me for a long time to come.
B004N622EY|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read. Hard to believe it might've gotten by me if not for Robert Jordan's keen eye.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great on my new Kindle Fire HD tablet, so far no issues with it. Ads are kinda w/e since they're located in a small box at the bottom of the app so you can easily ignore it.
B005PM3YII|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read. Hard to believe it might've gotten by me if not for Robert Jordan's keen eye.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I ordered this on Amazon Prime for my grandchildren to watch on movie night.  Not only did they love it, so did their parents and I.
B004H4XAXO|4.0|I think one of the first things we fans of B.Sanderson have to learn is just how good he is at creating new worlds and ideas. You don't pick up &#34;Way of Kings&#34; and get &#34;Mistborn&#34;. It is really a great story that has little to zero similarity. Worth reading.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I bought this CD for my 8 year old niece and I ended up stealing it.  I have since purchased a new one for her :)
B003XNTTYY|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read. Hard to believe it might've gotten by me if not for Robert Jordan's keen eye.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|i can't wait for the next one to come out.  who ever wrote and produced and got the actors for this tv show really did a good job.
B0087GYY92|4.0|I loved John Scalzi's &#34;Old Man's War&#34;, which is seemingly a completely different genre aside from also containing sci-fi elements. Redshirts is really funny, but I'd have to say its kind of like &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; but in written form. Worth buying for anyone who is familiar with Sci Fi tropes, even if not a Star Trek fan.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|This album has some great dance inspired songs. The song B.E.A.T. Makes me wish I had a system in my car again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the game is great! nice graphics, realistic, and time killing.. I wish you could get gems easier though.....................
B00003CXRM|5.0|Cult classic!  great soundtrack!  always a joy to watch with my husband who can not enjoy George in this movie .
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was just fantastic. Who could have guessed that this would happen. This book is stroke of genius. Go Ender!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|i LOVE TO READ SO IF i CAN FIND A GREAT PRICE ON BOOKS i TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BLAH
B001WCN23W|5.0|My favorite Stones album and I have a budding sax player nephew.  Bought it here for me to get the cloud version and him to see what a rock sax sounds like
B004EC5IV6|5.0|What I can I say but this is some peace of work very good detail with the plot and characters and a lot of suspenseful action and the ending just blew me away I cant wait too see the next one !
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect.  Very good. It started out sad then odd then funny.  I think it's a drama/comedy
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|I used to watch evangelion as a kid and seeing this version of the series as a movie is simply amazing really enjoyed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game but after a while it gets kind of boring so after about a week  you end up not playing it due to boredom
B0085A9J18|5.0|a lot of ass kicking action and with a big twist at the end, if you like guns with martial arts fighting then this is a must own
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I love the book but was dumfounded and speachless at points of the story and was kept cheering for are heroin America the whole way.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|My order came as a quick delivery before the estimated delivery date.  We LOVE Denzel Washington as he is a GREAT ACTOR in ALL Movies he is in.  FANTASTIC MOVIE I RECOMMEND to any Denzel FANS!!!<br /><br />One of my Favorites scenes in this movie:  The plane was inverted, flying upside down!!!!<br /><br />Another BEST scenes in this movie is having to choose to be completely HONEST in a difficult position when it could have been easily lied and the evidence covered up.  CHOOSING TO BE HONEST IS  a \\"Brave\\" thing  along with the great morals and values!!!<br /><br />~~~Amazing and Great movie!!
0425263916|5.0|Loved this new series...glad I have something good to read after finishing 50 shades...Good pick for any Mr. Grey fan!!
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I liked this movie more than \\"MIB\\". It's a nice \\"good vs. bad\\" story that whole my family enjoyed together.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Completely and utterly disappointed. It doesn't read like a Sookie Stackhouse book, nor does the storyline follow what we would expect. Cannot believe this is how she chooses to end the series. I've now lost all respect for Charlaine as she is definitely a sell-out. Wish I could unread this book.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|I bought the Simple Strategy ebook, I just tested this morning on CL (crude oil), and it made some quick profits!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun to play. good app for being free. takes time to receive gems though which is a little inconvenient. but it's still fun.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Wow.. Sly Stallone has made his worst movie and that is an accomplishment after some of the duds he has been in. I can not say enough bad things about this movie or Stallone.<br /><br />When he was younger he used to be the funny, stupid dolt. Now Stallone is just pathetic. His \\"acting\\" has gotten even worse if that is possible. He is stiff and OLD in this chronicle of his attempt to remain young.<br /><br />The non-existent story line is in direct proportion to explosions and shooting people. Which Stallone has come out as being ANTI-gun as long as he is not making money from the shooting. Hypocritical at best, Stallone campaigns against self-defense while wanting YOUR money for himself. Must be the hits he took from boxing the few time she actually did it.<br /><br />The numerous cameos show a serious lack of character development and pandering to the slack-jawed adrenaline junkie whose only desire is to see \\"shit get blown up.\\" A yawn fest if you have an IQ above 3. Adrenaline junkies are better off watching golf.<br /><br />Sad, Pathetic and a waste of time and money. Straight to DVD Stallone..
B004P9FAK2|5.0|We now own all the Ultimate Editions and we love them.  The extras included in the set and on the discs are quite worth it.  If you are a true Potter fan these are the way to go.
B0090SI582|4.0|Solid superhero film that focuses more on the character and fate Logan then on saving the world. Jackman is charismatic, and while the film is not perfect, it is certainly better than the awful Last Stand (thanks Brett Ratner) and X-Men: Origins (thanks for ruining Deadpool!), and is a good set up for the bigger, more epic Days of Future Past.<br /><br />The location of Japan is beautifully realized and shot, with amazing cinematography and location setting! And of course, Hugh Jackman is as cool and charismatic and mean as ever.<br /><br />In a world of superhero movies filled with CGI city-destruction and spandex-clad heroes \\"saving the world\\", The Wolverine is refreshingly focused and small-scaled. Get ready for a few hours entertainment at the movies!<br /><br />P.S. WAIT in the theatre for the great post-credits scene!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|What a great set!!!  The presentation and audio is impeccable and the first two movies are just superb.  The others are good movie but just not the quality of the first two.  The set is very well put together with chrome reflective packaging and individual trays for all the discs.  The extras are hours and hours of information that only diehard fans would sit through but some of it is definitely worth it.  Overall, excellent buy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is amazing best game ever it is so awesome I love it people get ir la la la la la la la
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game, but it constantly force closes on me... repeatedly. and besides that it'll force close on me right when I'm about to start a game, and then I don't get my tokens back or get to play the game... very irritating.. other than that its a great game
B0034G4P80|5.0|Now thnis was a dvd worth its weight in gold,Chris  Heimworth was awesome,Anthony Hopkins surper as usual,the theme of the being of Thor was well written each character had its own identity and brought the story line together.BRAVO, BRAVO,BRAVO
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it! I wake up every morning and check on my dragons! Buy it and put a thumbs up! XD
B00821OX98|4.0|Great series, but took 1or 2 shows to be addictive. Can't wait for season 3!  Already saw season 2, which was also great.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is Awesome! There are three dimensions, the regular under the sea and glacier! Get it and rate 5 stars! XD
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book held my hand every step of the way from start to finish. Definitely a simple and concise guide for the first time writer (such as myself)!
B0012CJQY6|1.0|I did not see when I ordered that it would only show in the UK area..so this DVD was useless to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not only that I love the movie, I love the minions too! I was looking up for free games and this came up first. So glad I found it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome for anybody who like horses you can feed the horse take care of it add new horses and more i love it!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|After Draw Something stopped working on my Samsung phone, I was super bummed out.  Shortly thereafter, I bought myself a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  Delighted to find DS available in the app store, I downloaded it.  It was able to go thru the first phase, where it shows your opponent figuring out the drawing you'd last sent them, but immediately after that, it crashes with some \\"marmalade\\" error.  I tried uninstall/reinstall but got same problem.  A search of the internets indicates that many many people have this problem.<br /><br />BOO.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages of adults but especially good to see heroes that are older than 30.  Helen Mirren is the highlight of the movie!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Fantastic and not to be missed. Very surprised that for a third season this show rocked! Can't wait for season four :-)
1781162646|5.0|I have read everything Stephen King has written.  I thought this was a lot of fun.  I liked how he adapted his writing style to the hard boiled decetive genre.  Perhaps the broken heart of the narrator was a little over done, but the adventures at his summer job amusement park and subsequent inolvement with the little boy and his mother was great. I went on a haunted house ride with my grandson at a county fair in Oregon last week and had vivid thoughts of the novel--fortunately our ride was not as scary.  READ IT.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A lot of characters and not all of them essential to the story.<br />So you find yourself reading about some of these characters and wondering what part they play in the storyline, then you find out there really is no connection.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This product is easy to use and syncs up well across my different devices and PC.  I highly recommend it for those looking for an easy &#34;to do list&#34; application.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I thought this movie would be at least as funny as Knocked Up.  After the first 2 minutes, I didn't find a lot of humor.  And how many husbands and wives talk like that to each other?
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game was a lot of fun for my grandma-age brain.  I agree with those who want more levels.  The last ones get a bit tricky, but as a puzzle it is a lot of fun.  The only thing I wished for (many times) was an \\"undo\\" button.  I  hope to see a more extensive sequel to the game (maybe one that incorporates various shapes and a cutting tools?)  Great free app... I think I would actually part with some of my coins for a good sequel.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Hard to beat a classic.  Amazing that my kids still love old movies like this.  Too bad actors and actresses today aren't as multi-talented.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|Acting was good enough, but seemed predictable. Good finish to a rather blood-thirsty plot. I would have to rate this movie as somewhat average in content.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was wickedly good and the writing format was refreshingly clever.  If there were a word for MORE than a page turner, I would use it here.  I just wanted to gobble this book up.  I couldn't read it fast enough.  This author has an amazing imagination and way more than her share of creative talent and excellent writing skills.  I just loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It was easy to set up, and works reasonably well with the services that support it.  Casting using Google Play Music on Android has an issue with locally stored music not being able to play (&#34;cannot play sideloaded music&#34; is the specific error.)  The Chrome browser extension that allows you to cast a tab doesn't work with services that use Silverlight (including Amazon Prime.)  Hopefully more services will add the casting function, and the unit will be able to handle locally stored media without having to open each item individually in the Chrome browser.<br /><br />People who already own another streaming player will probably find this unit doesn't offer a lot that they need at this point.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|While I have known about this show for years, and the awards it has received, but only this summer when I needed something to watch other than the paltry offering from broadcast TV did I turn to the Good Wife.<br /><br />Intelligent writing and excellent acting make this an enjoyable show that does not insult your intelligence or rely on gratuitous sex or violence to keep you watching.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|How about we try writing a movie that makes fun of turning 40 rather than a movie about turning 40 that makes you want to run out and jump off a bridge after you see it?
B000JML7EC|5.0|I've always wanted to read this book but had never gotten around to it until now. Was a great read, enjoyed the language and the way it flowed. Wish I'd read it sooner.
B00486070K|5.0|This Apple USB ethernet adapter works fine with the 2012 Mac Book Pro Retina and Mac OS software version 10.8.4.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I downloaded this when it was the free app of the day. I have not been disappointed. It is challenging and fun...makes you think hard on some of the higher levels. I recommend this to anyone that likes puzzles...or challenges.
0761174192|5.0|This is a gorgeous calendar.  I love it so much I've ordered it the last 5-6 years.  Each day (except Saturday & Sunday are combined) is a portrait of a new cat or cats (though there are some casual action shots too).  The photos are professional and printed on high quality paper.  While it is bigger than the page-a-day calendars, you're getting larger pictures that look so much better.  There are no dark photos that could benefit from a flash.  The print quality makes each page look like a photograph (you could even frame them or make a collage they are so good).<br /><br />If you're a cat lover and prefer to be able to see your kitties, this is for you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved hearing the man's side of the story. Thanks for the new perspective. Looking forward to reading more titles by this author.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The title of the review says it all, so save your money and go get something chiper from Walmart, probably will have better success.
159463176X|5.0|great writer - couldn't put the book down at the end. Would recommend it to everyone.  I need to read his second book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Raised on Dracula movies? Think you know the story? Read it the way it was orginialy written. Puts others to shame.
B000FA6720|3.0|Usually it is the opposite...the book is better than the movie, but in this case if you see the movie you basically read the book!  There were very few changes in the movie from the book but I think if you see the movie you basically get the gest of the book.  The book is a short story about Robert Kincaid who is a fiction character who is a photographer for the National Geographic magazine who falls in a love affair with Francesca - an Iowa farmer.  The story talks about their affair but really it feels short lived and the book does very little for me in capturing the romance and affair.  Perhaps it is because I have seen the movie several times.  I would recommend reading the book and watching the movie.  It is always fun to do both:))
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game kids and adults will love it.  Why not have angry birds in the hood? Maybe angry birds battle steroids accusation.
B001974DG0|5.0|This book was referred to me by my father, a veterinarian. It was really an amazing story!! Great from open to close. I'm a sucker for a good book about an amazing dog! J hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for the whole family. Challenge you kids the winner gets a bunch of bananas. Good family fun for everyone.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|I love this movie! It's one of my favorites! Thank you so much for making this satisfactory for me! You all did an excellent job!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|How can you screw up a classic game. Seems they tried too hard. This isn't grandmas game she wouldn't waist her time with this one.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I've been into AIC since about 94-95, shortly after they released Jar of Flies.  This puts me squarely in the borderline gen X / gen Y, early mid 30s, wife and kids demographic.  I know my music and know what I like.  I'm not some fearless over-confident snot nosed young hipster wanker who probably wasn't even born when these guys released Dirt.  An AIC record behaves like fine wine.  Being that it just keeps getting better, stronger, richer & revealing hidden details the more shelf life you give it.  Dinosaurs is no exception.  Let it ooze into your head over repeated listens and appreciate the bands brilliance.  Jerry & Will's dual harmonics are beautifully rendered.  A lot of people have said the mastering falls short on this album - I think this point is slightly over emphasized.  This type of music is gonna sound loud if you play it at wall-of-sound levels, that's simply what the band does.  Turned down a little bit on my 2 channel system (mid priced quality separate components), I can hear each individual instrument & Jerry/Williams voices clearly crossing over each other, but yes the sound will thicken íf you wind up the wick, which is like most grunge.  Pearl Jam is far far worse, my copy of Ten is a dirty screaming mess.
1878424319|3.0|I read this many years ago, and then at the advice of a \\"healer\\" who said that listening to it would change my life in a different way than just reading it i bought the audio set. Listened to it 5 or 6 times. That was about 8 yrs ago.I loved the 1st listen. Then each listen afterward got me  more and more depressed as things didnt change outwardly nor inward. My life despite trying to integrate Ruiz's advice ...... doesnt make me feel happy when Im depressed, doesnt help me earn more money or feel better on rainy days. Isnt anyone noticing this past decade that motivational books dont seem to motivate as much anymore. Are we just fed up with our country? our govt? THE FACT that many, many of us are being pushed out of what I call the good \\"wait until then\\" jobs like post office, and so many city and govt jobs by God knows who so that while we are waiting for the right time to build our dream we cannot even labor in a relaxing,non toxic environment with  ...God-forbid, , people who are  not always complaining or down, or need to borrow money, or something! Why with all this new technology do all my friends feel totally trapped in their jobs that are over 50? And worse...totally left out of what the future of this country is heading towards and we have no say in anything anymore. The middle aged people are now being treated almost like people in a retirement home. The lie unfolds........40 is not the new 25. Truth ??????  BEING 50 IS THE NEW 70. A FIFTY YEAR OLD HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS A 70 YR OLD DID IN THE 50'S. UNLESS HE GORES BACK TO SCHOOL AND THEN GUESS WHAT...HE WILL BE ALMOST IN HIS 70'S. WHATS WRONG WITH THIS WHOLE PICTURE AND WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT IT.  Feel free to contact me if you want to start a blog or put something together. Your 40's and 50's are supposed to be the best yrs of your life. I dont see that happening for hardly anyone. The emperor isnt wearing any clothes ,people. When was the last time something new and exciting was built in your town besides a McDonalds? We are all suffering the generic suffocation of smeness...a real Walmart nation where we dont have beauty ANYWHERE anymore if you live in a city especially. I live in Florida by the beach and the beach is dead almost all yr around compared to 30 yrs ago. Why? We buy gym memberships and stop using them after 2-3 weeks. We come home from work and there is no place but a stinky old bar to drop by and unwind. Something very sad is happening in this country.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|These work exactly as expected with my Galaxy S4. I didn't notice the free bonus tag when I bought the 10 + the key chain, so I was pleasantly surprised.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I would give it love it but it sometimes dosenot work and it freeze but it okay and it stop and then after that I die and I get upset but I'm able to complete quest and login to face book on mine and play againist friends I'm about in 2 place I got 11 people that play but it ok I like it I play it almost everyday but so far so good and I'm in the streets!! yea!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun game. For all ages. I can't wait to see what is next. If you love the minions you will love this game.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|I had the standard DVD with the DTS option. The HD blu-ray edition made the video on my HD TV, well worth the up grade!
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|I don't normally write reviews, as I am just not about spending time on them. But this warrants my frustration. As a fan and after waiting for almost a year for this release, I am HUGELY LET-DOWN! Why would anyone who already owns the first trilogy release or is interested in this edition fork out an extra $50 for 3 cheap plastic toys, a couple of paper cards, and  two documentaries. It doesn't make sense. Had they been extended editions, I would have paid  whatever price they wanted, be it over $200. What was WB thinking when they released this?Clearly not about the fans.Look at what a fantastic job the L.O.T.R. extended editions did. I happily and gladly paid the $100 tag on it as it was well worth it.This, I just don't know what to say. It's kinda an insult and cash grab more than anything else. Anyone looking to order this, you are better off with the original trilogy release,unless you want to pay extra for collectible plastic and paper ornaments.The fact that the pre-order price has dropped by $30 should say something even though it is yet to be released. If you really want to purchase this, then wait till the plummeting sales force the retailers to lower the price even more.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would not be considered a fan of the genre, but I am a fan of how Max Brooks weaves together an amazing number of first person accounts that touch on our cultures, politics and the little things that we take for granted every day.<br /><br />I must admit that I was drawn to the story because of the trailers for the movie, but was very disappointed by the movie.  Just as I was Jurassic Park, The Firm, etc.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book touched my heart and soul deeply. A must read for young adults and adults alike. You won't be able to put it down!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Not having read any of Khaled's other books, I was interested in seeing what this book would be like. I found the storyline interesting and very easy to read.<br />I loved how the characters lives intertwined with each other..<br />  Will definitely read his other books now !!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|I bought this product for Garmin Edge 810, fits like a glove and there is no interference with the mounting arm that came with Garmin bundle.  If you are going to spend the money on a 800/810, spring for this case and know that your Edge will be safe if it falls.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I like the game very much. Nice gameplay, beautiful graphics.<br /><br />Sometimes the game did'nt start when you click on a level. You much scroll to left, before you can click to start the game.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|The movie is in great condition. The movie is very suspenseful and makes the viewer think. I would recommend It to you.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|One of the all time best costume dramas.  Perfectly cast and well acted.  The pay off is worth the wait.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie but it turned out to be very scary. A word of advice - don't watch previews, they ruin a lot. I went into the movie blindly having no idea what it was about and it was fun and surprising and extremely creepy. If you liked Insidious, the Conjuring, etc. you'll probably enjoy this. Not to say that they are extremely alike, but they do have some of the same quiet dread element.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's awesome, just like any shooting game you've ever played! Classes are awesome, and guns are boss, I rate 5! Derp!
B00ARAO720|1.0|I ride a fixed gear bike. Because I like the way it feels. Evidently someone in Hollywood heard about fixed gear bicycling and messenger riding YEARS after it became &#34;cool&#34; and decided to make a movie about it?!? The production value is garbage, the whole thing comes off incredibly lame. It's trying way too hard. If they had made a movie that included some of this type of riding that might have been fun to watch, but this is someone shouting in your face OMG NO BRAKES FIXIES OH HOW FREAKING COOL! It's unwatchable.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Literally... the weather at your finger tips!  I like to be able to access current weather conditions while I am having breakfast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game made me feel like I really wanted a horse. You should get it now! It is an awesome app
0307950654|5.0|Death comes to Pemberley brings all the great characters from the beloved Pride & Prejudice into a great suspenseful mystery! I read this because its going to be a mini series. There were so many times I had thought I solved the mystery & I turned out to be wrong, and it went into a whole new direction that I didn't think about.  There were a few parts that it was a little slow but quickly got back to the excitement.  I found it very interesting that it had tied in another beloved Jane Austen book at the end & how well it blended. Definitely a read again!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|If any readers of this review are &uuml;ber fans of Austen's Pride and Prejudice I suggest you read no further.  I rather disliked P & P.  For so long P & P has been trumpeted as a great romance, but in that regard I found it wholly lacking.  I liked Elizabeth Bennett but I found her rather two dimensional, and I just thought Darcy a miserable fart I enjoyed the more odious secondary characters and the bite that they provided far more then the romance.  Okay now that I've gotten that of my chest let me talk about Emma.<br />Emma is a flawed heroine that I loved surprisingly quickly.  Sure she's a nosy busybody, but she's our nosy busy body.  Austen makes her likable, which is a feat in itself, getting to watch Emma mature even more so.  I loved the use of Emma as an unreliable narrator.  We can see far in advance her shenanigans in matchmaking and assumptions of love and intrigue in Highbury are way off the mark.  This adds a wonderful layer of humor to the story.  Finally I enjoyed watching the romance develop between Emma and Knightly, something I found so lacking in the Elizabeth and Darcy relationship.  I loved that they were a little combative  and  at odds with each other sometimes.  With the book Emma I finally understand the appeal of Jane Austen.
B005544V6A|5.0|They had me from the very first episode!! Everyone should make this a requirement for law school students, it is simply one of the best storyline dramas about a legal firm I've watched in a long time!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I plugged this into my windows 7, 8, and my mac. It worked on all three, with drivers of course. Even with USB 2.0 I was getting 60M per second transfer rate on my gigabit LAN. Over 100M with my USB 3.0 windows 8 surface pro.<br /><br />I recommend this product, especially with an 18 month warranty.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Fast service. Movie sealed. Played perfect, and what a wonderful movie.  Pity we<br />wont see any more, except on PBS perhaps.  And with Out Russell.  Mores the pity.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Easy to listen too. Phillip has his own style and I like that. The Songs seem to flow together well
B009GEYX5E|1.0|DOESNT WORK! WASTE OF MONEY.  I spent way too much money and the film does not work at all! DO NOT GET!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Works great on my rMBP. It also works in windows 7 on my rMBP in bootcamp. I may have had to install an extra driver on the windows side, but nonetheless still works if you look up how to get the drivers.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Have had many different camera bags this is by far the best.  This hold up very well to bags 2-3 times the price.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, with a different and interesting storyline. I'm a sucker for shows like this. You can daze off and still not lose the plot. Really like it.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|I am not into this kind of game mostly, it was okay, but will not play it much.  I may keep it for the kids to play
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book is good, and explores a lot of different aspects of a zombie apocalypse. Has a lot of different stories to vero all the aspects, that's a little bit why i dint like they start telling a story and when your getting hook on whats happening there they switch to another.<br />Still it manages really good points about a zombie Apocalypse.<br />Its only related to the Movie in the name, and a similar scenario.
B003629IPW|5.0|Even if it IS a rehearsal- it shows Michael Jackson for what he is. A masterpiece. Any fan, big or small, will love this. And if you aren't even that big of a fan I think you could really appreciate him more after watching.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|If you just expect a movie with a lot of people dying and just a action movie with weak plot this is a really good movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super cool, especially since the location changes every month. You basically travel around the world and it never gets boring. Kid friendly too :)
B000002VSN|4.0|Worth owning. Whitney is a classic. I true talent that will be missed in the music world. It is worth it to collect her music and movies because their will never be another Whitney in the music industry.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is  a really fun game that I'm sure you will like it is addicting I play it all day every day
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Great seeing A-list stars play funny characters. I was very impressed with Aniston, Farrell, and Spacey but especially Aniston. She rocked her character.  Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day are on their way to being top actors. I love their work. Jason can play serious or comedic characters. Jason Bateman is a classic... He started as a kid and still bringing it as an adult. Overall, good movie and worth owning.
B0091REZMW|5.0|A very addicting game for those who love these types of games.  Each quest keeps you going to the point you don't want to put your device down.  This is not a game where you do so many boards then the game is over.  The quests keep coming.  Love it.  Definitely a keeper!
B000002VSN|5.0|This is an excellent CD with excellent Whitney vocals. This is great inspiring and motivating music made for the movie. If you are a Whitney fan, I would highly recommend adding this to your collection!
0375714839|5.0|It was great. When i recieved it there was nothing wrong with it. It was like new it, love it
B000002L9Y|5.0|This is some great music by Fleetwood Mac. They are still a great group. I highly recommend their music! It is a pleasure to listen to!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game blew me away and i think it is 100% better then the Temple Run Series.... Every four wesks you get to look forward to a new update.!! I LOVE THIS GAME
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy it very much! the only thing is that I don't like to connect games with fb which doesn't allow to complite most of the challenges ... But still love it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is tremendously good I recommend it for everybody that know how to play temple run but this game is perfectly good for all ages
B002V091K2|5.0|Brilliant!, well written, enticing. Thought provoking , emotionally attaching and exciting.definitely a must read! Can hit home for any reader
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I bought this game for my grandchildren, ages 4 and 7. It is embarrassing how much better they are than I am. I love the menu which allows for different environments. The further you advance, you are confronted with innovative challenges and obstacles. I cannot put it down. It is a simple game but lots of fun for all ages.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|What else can I say?  Two troubled psychotics meet and rescue each other, with Deniro in the backdrop and the stars getting more endearing as the show moves on.  Don't miss it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I've read many books about religious history and early Christianity. I'm an atheist, but the subject is interesting since it has affected so many people over the millennia, and continue to do so. This book is unique in that it is fairly short, but also how it takes the discussion one step further and truly explains why, what we now call Christianity, despite the best efforts of Jesus' survivors, became the most popular global religion.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|I haven't read all the negative reviews, but I'm surprised that more people are not giving this movie 4 or 5 stars.  I thought it was great. Jeff Bridges and Mary Louis Parker have great chemistry.  Ryan Reynolds?  I tend to agree with the reviewer who wrote that Reynolds just did not seem right for this movie.  R.I.P.D is obviously a take on the Men-In-Black movies, but who cares?  How many movies are its own version of Die Hard?  The movie has plenty of action, and it also has some very funny scenes. I about lost it when Jeff Bridges describes what a coyote did to his skull after he died--and that's all I'm saying.  Just know it's one of the funniest movie moments ever!!  R.I.P.D is approximately 90 minutes long.  I appreciated there were no scenes where I found myself wishing things would move on.  It's a fun movie with lots of action, mostly good acting, and a sci-fi plot that was not overly far-fetched.  Go watch it.  You'll be glad you did.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|If you've listened to Backatown, this one will bring you back home.  More traditional, it comes right from the streets and shows T.S. versatility and game!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|By comparison, this double album may help Stone Sour's \\"House of Gold and Bones\\" solidify it's status as a masterpiece... but that doesn't make it any less fun. From the overly aggressive lyrics, to the brutally relentless sound to the obvious \\"I'm a non-comformist\\" message... this album sets out to pound itself into your skull. It's twice as good as \\"American Capitalist\\" and a sure pick for a sweaty morning workout where nothing less aggressive will do.
B0060AY85C|5.0|The book was so interesting that when I finished reading, I wanted to read more about the two main characters.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|Really a great movie with unbelievable shots inside the submarine.  I thought the tension between the characters was good up to the end
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I downloaded the free app of the day and only have positive things to say about it so far.  I haven't gotten very far in this game yet but up to this point it's been really fun.  I like the mysterious storyline and the hint feature is really nice.  Unfortunately, I have played games without this feature and end deleting the app.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Can't belive that I have been missing out on this show. I love and enjoy everything about it except that their are no more just yet.  Can't wait to see the next installment!  Amazing acting, brilliant writing, and I love the quick wittiness of the characters.
B0031R5K72|5.0|From the first page to the last I just couldn't put it down. great and wonderful, made me cry at the end.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you go into this expecting GOODFELLAS or THERE WILL BE BLOOD, you will hate this. If you go into this expecting to laugh at ridiculous one liners, you will have fun with this.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|great movie! I watched it with my 7 year old son and 9 year old daughter. They really enjoyed it! streamed beautifully. A+
1623420148|5.0|So this book was so funny. I loved how well she was able to think like a guy. The best part was how she always had a snarky comeback for what I was thinking at a particular part of the story. Well written, defiantly different and I laughed so hard through this whole story.<br /><br />My daughter wants the guy on the cover and she is only 11. I think I am in trouble ladies.. lol
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Yeah, it was too violent and the relationship stuff was right out of junior high, BUT it was just fun to watch. Nicolas Cage doing the TV Batman impression was so cute. However, the real star was the young, purple-haired Hit Girl. She was just awesome. Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game.  must have a good phone. can't win with glitches.  great graphics for the cartoon.  play and advance or spend money to advance quicker. your choice
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The first movie was better. I enjoyed seeing all the action heros of course but stuffing them in like they did without much of a backstory left little time for character development. I guess that was the point, just give each of the guys a chance to blow up, shoot and kill as many bad guys as possible.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Factory balls is the type of puzzle and reasoning easoning game that I absolutely love. Some of the  balls made start to tear my hair out but I adore something that gives me a challenge and tests my logic skills.<br /><br />My Pros: The game is very forgiving when it comes to making a mistake, you cannot get stuck just because you missed a step. I also found the game to run very smoothly. The controls are quite intuitive and you will find yourself catching on very early in the game. Some of the designs look daunting but all are very possible to with some patience. You will never feel rushed as there is no time limit to complete a design. I also found that while the puzzles were challenging, I didn't have to spend forever completing one design which made the game wonderful for playing during short 5-10 minute wait times.<br /><br />My Cons: I really only found one con during game play for me. Most of the objects that they introduce into the game as you go are easy to guess how you would use them, but some of them you have to figure out by trial and error. Like the grass and flowers, plungers. I would have preferred to have a small tip explaining the object's use instead of just assuming the player would automatically understand what to do with it.  This con was not enough to warrant the reduction of a star as it is very easy to reset your ball to try again.<br /><br />So overall, if you enjoy procedural logic puzzles I would highly recommend this game. I got it as a FAOTD but I would have happily paid for this game myself if I had known about it sooner. I am sad that I am out of boxes and eagerly await more!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is so refreshing to be entertained with good wholesome stories of peoples lives and how they come together in a community of love and compassion for each other.  No swearing, no sexual exploits - but love and tolerance for each other.
B006RZFACU|5.0|FOGGY DAZE is a cute, rhyming story that young children will enjoy before bedtime or anytime. The author has a real knack for using great imagery in his poems!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|don't know If a plane can actually do that but I'll watch just about anything involving military or civilian aircraft (I worked on them for 20 years)
0547978847|1.0|I found the pace of this book so slow and the story so boring, I don't understand how a child is supposed to maintain the interest. I think there's too much hype about the book. The reviews are too generous.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This app has great graphics,sounds &amp; storyline. I enjoyed playing it until about 20 minutes in when I realized I would need to purchase the full paid version to continue. I plan on buying the full app &amp; would've given 5 stars if this would've been described as more of a free demo.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great series. Waiting to see the movies. Definitely for older kids. Wouldn't want my 10 year old reading these books
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We do not have cable or satellite TV. We have 2 TVs in our house, one with an Xbox and one with nothing running to it. We could stream on the Xbox but now we can currently stream on both TVs. I literally just plugged this thing in and within a matter of minutes I was streaming Netflix/ YouTube on my TV that was just sitting there never being used. I would strongly suggest this product to anyone.
B0037471XK|5.0|This is a &#34;no punches pulled&#34; Harry Bosch Mystery. It has plenty of intrigue and and spell binding passages. Once the first chapter has been absorbed, it's almost impossible to put down and the conclusion is a real statement of how Michael Connelly knows his subject.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app would not play at all! It took forever to load and then would never play! Do not get this app!
140006922X|5.0|The main thing I want to point out to people here is that anyone with an internet connection can read Aslan's dissertation. It actually looks really fascinating and also entirely in keeping with the apparent perspective of his book on Jesus of Nazareth. In both cases it appears that, as a sociologist with a specific interest in world religion, he is working to illuminate the connections between religious movements and movements for progressive social change. It seems strange to me that something so straightforward could be controversial<br /><br />Here's the link to the dissertation:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If, especially if you are someone who calls yourself a Christian, you are not interested in learning more about the history of efforts made to eliminate institutionalized inequalities between people - or worse: you think that such history should not even be investigated at all by anyone - I would be very interested to hear why not in comments to this review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is real fun trying to collect all of the coins u see. My version absent updated yet. One sentence to describe this is. Better than temple run 1 and 2 combined.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|It has plenty of padding and pockets. Toss your favorite shoulder strap on it and it's good to go. I've had it over a year now and it isn't showing any signs of wear yet. What more could I ask?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A Wildly Fun And Hilariously Fun Game To Play And Crazly Addicting Game That Realy Delivers On Fun And Laughs! So Worth Playing! I LOVE IT!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Pretty much feeds the same hunger for a feel good, magic-of-childhood craving that can also be sated with Peter Pan. Animation alone has me watching it repeatedly, and Jude Law's voice as the baddie makes that no hardship. A refreshing spin on Santa, Tooth Fairy, and Easter Bunny in a society tangled in the need for toys, monetary rewards, and candy.
B001UE27X8|5.0|I have always loved Tony Bennett's voice. I have always loved Bill Evans piano playing. This is a pure delight to have them together on one album.
B001NKI60W|5.0|bought for someone who was ill and totally cheered her up as she had not seen it  it is a happy movie but adult theme-not for children
B0052GACNM|5.0|Lady Gaga was fantastic in the &#34;Lady is a Tramp&#34;  I like all the singers on this Duets CD.  It is enjoyable to listen to.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was beyond amazing, probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. The plot was intricate and complex, but it wasn't as if it was extremely hard to follow. It keeps you guessing and you will have to watch and rewatch several times to see what you missed, kind of like you're in on solving the magic mystery. It's funny, action-packed and the actors portrayed their roles extremely well. It was great! and it annoys me that the average rating is only a 3.9 because let m tell you, that is very, very misleading from the audeinces I've seen there and the amazing grace of this blockbuster hit.
0762777931|5.0|I love how she writes.  This book is so informative, yet doesn't feel like a novel.  She's funny and breaks everything down into short segments so it's a very easy read, but still stocked full of great information.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've been a fan of Logitech for some time, have always enjoyed their keyboards and mice and decided to give their wireless headset a try.<br /><br />Sound quality is fantastic, and the headset itself is quite comfortable. Battery life is okay, I generally get 4-6 hours depending on how much sound activity I have going on. The range is better than I need it to be - I am able to walk anywhere in my apartment and still maintain high level sound quality and voice reception. The only flaw I have had with this product, and the reason I do not give it five stars, is that I seem to have occasions where the connection will cut out for a few seconds and I lose all sound and voice. At first, I thought this happened when the battery was low, but I have observed this behavior happening after only 10-20 minutes of use after hours of charging. It happens so infrequently that it's really not a serious issue, but it still is an issue and thus four stars.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|I know nothing about music, and I still found this movie entertaining. Definitely a good rental. I probably wouldn't buy it or watch it again though.
B004I744AS|5.0|love this app.  I love to play word games on line and this is not only educational but fun and addictive I especially. like the word within a word game and spend hours trying to guess all the words haven't bren successful yet but I am still trying.
B003G94BZC|4.0|Exellent but the streaming technology that we Windows PC users are limited to is not all that good. Consider allowing local catching of content, even if temporary.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is great i play it all the time but beware what you click<br /> it does use real money
B000WOT406|3.0|An album as loud, and as sophisticated as an F22 Jet! However, just like that jet, most people wont be able to fly it. In other words, well crafted, but relatively inaccessible.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|It did nothing to stop ads on my kindle fire. Although I do love it on my laptop. Word count
B005UG53NS|4.0|Part of a classic series of movies, but ... the streaming is not particularly reliable. Consider providing a reliable way to catch contely locally, even if temporary.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The best cop show ever..... Never a boring episode.... Great acting... Gridy n very entertaining... Based on th la crash unit
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Great show, but, the streaming is not very reliable. Amazon would do well to provide a reliable wasy to down load these type of purchases to standard windows computers.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is one of the best things Ive spent 40 bucks on<br />The mouse fits very comfortable in my hand. Ive read reviews about some people having problems with the 3 mouse buttons on the left side, but for me it fits almost perfectly - I have large hands and use a palm grip style, but i can see how people that use a claw grip have problems with the side mouse buttons.<br />All of the programmable mouse buttons is great for the game I spend most of my time playing, World of Warcraft.<br />Ive yet to put the 8000 DPI through a real test but I cant foresee any problems.<br />Overall Im very satisfied with my purchase
B007Q476KU|4.0|So much more than just a horse enthusiast&#34;s flick. However, I whithold one star as it does not download to a standard Windows PC, and the streaming was unreliable. These things should be made clear before purchase.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved this book. I have 're read it several times. Can't seem to get enough of it. I won't delete this from my carousel!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Great show, but, the streaming is not very reliable. Amazon would do well to provide a reliable wasy to down load these type of purchases to standard windows computers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is fun. Word games are my favoiite but when I just need a relaxing few minutes without any thought, solitaire is just right.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Plain and simple:<br />Nephew said I would love it. I did!<br />All 3 books were an easy read.<br />Young and old will all enjoy.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|Love the movie and great service keep up the great work. Thanks watched it last night very good. Love the art work<br /><br />Johnny
B000FBJAOG|4.0|As a fan of Zombie anything I really enjoyed this book.  Was different then other things I read which is always nice.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's really hard for me to get into books this one catches you from the start to the end. You feel the pain, love, worry, frightening feelings the characters go through.  Amazing read it's my second time reading the series. The only complaint I have about this book is if you just want to re-read the second book you have to search for it at about 33% for the second or 66% for the third book.  They are all bunched together but who can complain I got all three for $5
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! I was disappointed that this season was only offered on Amazon instead of Hulu Plus like the first two seasons, but I willingly paid the money so I could watch it. ;)
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This was another Kindle purchase - only so that I could access one of my early favorites on a whim.  This is the quintessential murder mystery - especially fine, since Christie did not rely upon moving the plot forward via the work of one of her detective phenoms.  It is a delight ... I was thrilled, when as a kid, I figured out the murderer ... but still stayed a bit unsure until the bitter end .... If you are new to AC ... Try Murder on the Orient Express next, (which I would never have figured out) ... and then any Marple or any other Poirot thereafter.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. Moves fast. Quick read. Satisfying ending.  Wish there were a fourth so I could keep reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book wad easy to read. I was captivated and entertained the whole way through. I would read over and over again.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|This is a good movie.  I watched with my two teens, 13 & 14.  They enjoyed it.  Compared it to the adjustment bureau.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This gaming app has adds but these are an irrelevant afterthought once you get playing. The ability to undo and change card and background views takes the monotone out of things. Well worth the download time.
B00377V6IS|5.0|One of my favorite albums along with Damnation and Ghost Reveries.<br />Well...<br />All of them actually. I extremely recommend supporting this cascade of musical beauty that enters your ears. I personally like physical copies.
B0018CMJSU|4.0|This is not the Blu-ray i thought i was gonna get, but the Quality of the first and second disc's are some what better than the original i bought years ago.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Maggie Smith is in it, along with all kinds of real life singing talent, so that's great. The script is just a bit lightweight and predictable. It was pleasant enough. Worth it to hear those voices since Happy Birthday, really.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would play this game all day if my battery wouldn't wear out. (LOL : )<br />aka ( never seen anything other than this game well other than temple run and subway surfed.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Just picked this up and it was a bargain with the 3 month free Netflix promotion they had going (I don't think you can get that any more).  I tried it the very first day it arrived and so far it works great.  Both Netflix and YouTube come through crystal clear, and I love the fact that you can continue surfing on your device while the content plays on your TV.  Been wanting to do that for ages, so that's a huge plus.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars if you could get Amazon Instant Video and HBO/Cinemax/Epix etc. apps to play, but Google was up front about them not working as of launch.  Setup was easy and definitely a good pick if you don't have an App enabled TV yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Paris subway surf  but haven't try`d the China subway surf but I hope that it will  be good as the Paris.  I truly hope there will Pandas in it cause I always have loved  Pandas.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Maybe it's just the fact that I watched this growing up, but I love the fact that this movie is typical 80s:  fun and not overly sensitive about language and being politically correct.  Don't get me wrong....there's nothing bad in here, it's just that the way the kids talk would have a very hard time making it into a movie today.<br /><br />Very cool story and can really bring out the adventure in your kids!
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I love this app it is a good game because there are amazing graphics and amazing world war 2 aircraft.I love the  variety of this game<br /><br />  it is amazing<br />  Alex Coffey
0143122916|5.0|Actually amazing. Not only that the camps exist but that once away from them the world travel is so available. It has the feeling of the new movie ELYSIUM.  Makes that more real.  Sadness and pain that exists and we do NOTHING about it is devastating!!This is a must read!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|A software i have that scans my phone told me that this was a malicious app. Ago after wards i deleted this and realised this app made my phone run really slow.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I am so tired of reality TV. Downtown Abbey has given me back hope that there is still good programs out there. It has a bit of everything: mystery, drama, romance. Can't wait til I can get the next season!
B0018CENUC|5.0|I so love Toby Keith and this album is great. There so many of his great, and familiar songs on it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|pros :<br /><br />You tube app works fine.<br />Cheap price.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Tab casting is painfully slow. Videos can not stream fast.<br /><br />Doesn't support 5GHZ<br /><br />Lack of apps(I think right now only YouTube/Netflix works)<br /><br />Overall Roku/Apple TV does much better job(if you don't compare the price) Roku and Apple TV does what they say in the product specs but Chrome cast doesn't do what it say in the product specs. I think Chrome cast is a beta product.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Seems to be accurate with little lag time. Gives a lot of info on the main screen. Works well and background shows the current weather conditions

B0016JBCJW|3.0|Rented the movie so that I could see Owen Wilson in it. He was mostly wonderful in a peculiar plot.  The movie's greatest virtues were the colorful scenes shot on location and the ongoing daffiness of Wilson. Worth the rental fee just for those.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I wish, for my children's sake, let alone humanity's, that more would open their minds to thinking such as this. I could not agree more with Mr. Dawkins, although at times he presents himself in a bellicose light, I am learning that such presentation is occasionally necessary to provoke people to think. I do worry at times that the response will be defensive which often places a yoke on actual reflective thinking. However, we must not be silent or passive. We are obligated to expose our children to the wonders of science as soon as thoughtful interaction is enabled. I find it tragic that so many put such societal stock in faith. It undermines what we can be and will damn our future. Thank you Mr. Dawkins for carrying the torch of reason so well!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Wow. My head is spinning. This blew my mind. The plot changes direction about six times in just over a hundred pages. A very clever, intricately plotted brain-twister with about three huge twists. Loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading hundreds of books for many decades. This one is not just an incredibly interesting story; the emotional intelligence of the author truly shines through this tale, breathing into it a depth that fully engrossed the reader. Well done, and one of the books I'd put in my lifetime top 25.

B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I'm kinds stuck at the third puzzle. So far I enjoyed the game (although there are some duplications with other big fish puzzles). However I am at the end of my patience. With the dots and lines (squares) puzzle you have to be very precise otherwise it draws lines where you don't want them which is fatal in the end game. You cannot zoom either to improve precision. Sad. Game over.
0375714839|5.0|Such a different theme for a comic book. I love it. Not that there's anything wrong with the more typical story, but this one is just great. One of my favorites.
B006JRY2QG|4.0|Streamed through my Xbox 360 on an old Sony LCD and seperately on a networked Sony TV (KDL-32EX710).  The picture quality was terrific on both with no issue.<br /><br />As each SOA season progresses, the show gets better.  Some acting seemed forced at first but as the actors got to know their characters better, the story and show improve.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As Reza Aslan points out in this well-written and fast-paced reconstruction of the historical context surrounding the \\"greatest story ever told,\\" the Romans who put Jesus of Nazareth to death were, if nothing else, meticulous record keepers of their activities throughout the empire. Using what we know of Roman rule of the dominion of Palestine and the few textual clues from the Gospels and epistles that intersect meaningfully with this historical knowledge, Aslan constructs a convincing portrait of a courageous and charismatic leader of men who rose above the run-of-the-mill majority of messianic prophets of the time to become one of the world's most influential and revered human beings. This portrait won't suit evangelicals or anyone whose faith requires ironclad validation of the historical accuracy of the biblical portrayal of Jesus the Christ, and (conversely) it won't surprise or significantly expand the knowledge of anyone who follows mainstream scholarship about the historical context of early Christianity, but for those with little knowledge of biblical scholarship who read the book with an open mind, there is much here to challenge one's preconceptions and to inspire an even more profound appreciation for the man and for the movement that transformed a provincial prophet after his violent death at the hands of a brutal imperial overlord into a figure of widespread admiration and worship.  Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the first APPS I downloaded after getting my Kindle fire hd.<br />I've been on the net since the 90's and always relied on weather apps &amp; sites because we lived in areas prone to tornadoes and later, hurricanes.  I am very careful to make sure the app is accurate. I check it against my local weather channels to be sure. That's why in the end, I went with AccuWeather. The only request I would have is more of a localized radar v/s large regional. We love it.<br />.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Just read Mr. Rollins latest novel.  Kept me glued to the very end.  Like how Rollins mixes science, history, and religion all into one.<br /><br />Book was about family.  Seichan and her mother were reunited.  Duncan and Jada Shaw were drawn together, and liked at the end where Rollins states that, when we die, our consciousness goes to other realities.  Wondering, why in our universe Rachel and Vigor both died, but in an alternate universe, Rachel is alive and Vigor is cancer free.<br /><br />Also, liked how Mr. Rollins mentioned the meteor storm that hit Russia only a few months ago.<br />And that a comet will be hurtling towards Earth in November.<br /><br />Only complaint, wish Tucker and Kane could have gone on this mission.

0062073567|5.0|There is a special pleasure, in the case of a really clever detective story, in rereading it even when you remember perfectly well who done it. And whatever her shortcomings on the literary front, Agatha Christie was unmatched as a mistress of plot. Among her novels and plays, there is just about every variant possible on the old whodunit: the butler did it, the detective did it, everybody did it, even the supposed victim did it. ROGER ACKROYD, published in 1926, may be the most extraordinary of the lot; it is certainly one of the most famous. I cannot say more here without giving away the secret, though I will go a little farther in the comments.<br /><br />Not that it matters much, as I say. For even the ultimate &#34;spoiler&#34; of knowing the murderer does not spoil one's subsequent appreciation at all. The pleasure here is seeing how meticulously Christie keeps to the rules, putting in red herrings galore but never stating anything that is untrue, and inserting just enough little clues (or &#34;clews&#34; as she spells them) to prevent the reader feeling completely cheated by the final revelation. Knowing the ending even increases one's appreciation of Christie's technique.<br /><br />This is an Hercule Poirot mystery, but not one of the usual sort. Captain Hastings, the detective's usual Watson, has gone to the Argentine, and Poirot himself has retired to the village of King's Abbot to grow marrows. But when the local squire, a wealthy industrialist, is found murdered, Poirot agrees to take on one further case. He is accompanied by James Sheppard, the local doctor, who serves as a source of local knowledge, a dispassionate eye on the case, and an accomplished chronicler. It is Sheppard's objectivity and intelligence (even though he can be as mystified as anybody else) that gives the book its special flavor.<br /><br />Agatha Christie could only work her technical marvels because, to her, plot was everything. Despite Poirot's insistence on &#34;the psychology,&#34; she seldom goes very deep. What happens is always more important in her books than why. You will not get the slow build of passion to the point where murder is inevitable, or the relentless gnawing of guilt afterwards. Motives are generally simple matters such as hidden love, secret marriages, unpayable debts, jealousy, and blackmail. The characters tend to stereotypes; the prose is flat. In terms of our modern expectations for a novel, this is only two stars, three at most. But for what it sets out to do, it is incomparable.&#34; she seldom goes very deep.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It was the best book it hard so much unpacked on the district's<br />When I first was reading it I thought it was just another hunger games but then I figured out in the end it was all really a plan.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is an interesting book. It will be very disturbing to bible believing Christians but not so difficult for \\"The Christ\\" believing Christians.  It is an historical look at the life of the physical Jesus pulled together from excerpts from the Bible and from other scriptures as well as from Roman historical documents.<br />Especially concerning the early history of Jesus, while speculative and somewhat disturbing to a bible believer, the author is generally respectful of the work and ministry of Jesus, The Son of Man.<br />Of particular interest to me as a believer in the Risen Jesus, the author makes a very clear division between the view before Jesus' death (Son of Man) and after (The Christ).  He speculates that The Christ theology started with the stoning of Stephen, who was a Hellenist (meaning that Stephen was a Jewish convert from outside Jerusalem).  The author then goes on to continue his speculation on how the Gospels progressively evolved to develop and enhance the view of Jesus as messiah and then Christ and then God at the Council of Nicaea.<br />He also portrays Paul in an unusual way.  The author sees in the scriptures a clear animosity between Saul/Paul and James, the leader of the Church at Jerusalem.  The difference from the author's point of view concerns \\"the law\\".  James (who is the brother of Jesus and known for his piety) finds his righteousness and that of the early followers of the Way in the strict observance of the Jewish religious practices and laws.  They believed in Jesus, the messiah and were waiting for his immanent return.  Paul was seen as a rebel who taught that the law was abolished and replaced by the righteousness of Jesus, The Christ, who through the work of the Holy Spirit wrote the laws within the \\"circumcised\\" heart.  The author's opinions concerning the book of James and the later epistles of Paul are quite interesting in that the author feels that they are letters to the churches established by Paul and basically condemneach other's work.<br />My personal take from this book is the fact that the Jesus I have come to love and follow went to the cross as a human being just like me.  His belief and faith in the promises of the Father are the same as mine only he was the first and by his faith he saved me and all who believe with him.  For me Jesus is the Christ who rose from the dead and will come again to reveal an earthly Kingdom of His (Father's) righteousness in Earth and Heaven.
0345529057|5.0|After seeing the show I wanted all the details and the books definitely come through!  An enchanting world so believable and characters that live and breathe so well, it doesn't take long to get engrossed.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What can I say about this book? I don't want to be unfair here because I'm a sucker for happy endings but the book is really good, well written and deserve all the five stars. It made a little blue and think about life in general but in a good way. I put myself in his shoes and I couldn't blame him, I don't know if I would be able to deal with this new life either, so the book ended exactly how it was suppose to, suckers for a happy ending like me just will have to accept this. Me Before You is a drama  the brings a message to readers to live life fearless and to the fullest cuz we never know when  it all end for good.

B008JFUREC|5.0|My daughter was anxious to see this, because since childhood, she was a big fan of anything Smurfs. This is a fun-filled, entertaining adventure for children, and anyone who loves the Smurfs. In comparison to other other Smurf movies, we found this one to be quite enjoyable. The colorful characters are funny, and the story is exciting. For those who have been huge Smurf fans over the years, you will not be disappointed. We will watch this one again as she loves anything Smurf. Enjoyable for family fun as well with the young children. Delightful, and sound effects are awesome. Highly recommended!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book is more about the persons life and what his friends and relatives are experiences at the hospital while he is in a coma.

B00BRUYQFC|2.0|too much repetition in his songs...not really enjoying this album as much as his others. Really enjoyed the single \\"Mirrors\\" but the other songs are just strange.<br /><br />##after much review of this CD is not my favorite works of JT, but as an artist he has truly evolved and put in a SERIOUS competition with other artists of this time.<br /><br />This album has some incredible dance songs but is still vocally complex and talented. He's not the young fox he once was, but he's bringing it! The repetition is something that is just part of the music now a days. He's taking what's popular now but keeping it unique and specific to what he has proven himself already in this industry. Super proud of JT for this, even though it's not something I would consider an all time top pick favorite listed album.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Nice little bag for the money, unfortunately both the first and the second replacement bag had the shoulder straps and handle sewn in about 3 inches off center.  This caused the pack to list to one side, off balance...poor qc in this batch.

0316044695|5.0|I liked this book very much. Compelling reading. I was very moved by this book. I couldn't put this book down. It was easy to read with minimal techno/military terminology and the story and writing flowed smoothly.<br /><br />Thank you to Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson for writing this book and telling the world what happened. Not recommended that readers speed-read or skip chapters to get to the end since there is alot of relevant insight and information covered throughout.

B004E547D8|5.0|excellent movie  the second  Red 2 is excellent to  I would buy number 2 it worth the money  Bruce Willis  he rocks I love Bruce Willis move are the best
B001O1O71C|5.0|The storyline will hold you through to the end. Many people say they read it in one sitting. It is that hard to put down. If you demand lots of action, this may not be for you. But if you want a story with depth and meaning, this is it. It's set in Germany during the Second World War but is not really a war story; it's the story of the family of a German officer in charge of a concentration camp told from the viewpoint of his nine-year-old son.<br /><br />Boyne's prose is lyrical. He is truly gifted as a writer. The beauty of the writing, almost like poetry, carries the story along and takes you with it effortlessly. There are multiple layers here. There is the simple story of what the boy sees, interpreted as a child would. Under that, as adults and being familiar with the history, we draw adult inferences. He knows only that a servant in his house disappears. We understand the implication in that terrible place.<br /><br />It doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending, but it will leave you thinking about it for a very long time.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|Everyone slams this, and let me start by saying, I haven't even watched the first disks. I bought these for the second disk, the 1970/80s versions of the movie.<br /><br />Yes they are a coversion from laser disk, are they the hi-quality remasted digital picture that we are accustomed too today, no. They are still better than the old VHS version, and to me that is part of the Beauity of it. You get to see Star Wars for what it was. You get to seen a nice clean film with good sound, with an emphisis on plot and story as well as on speical effects. Let Lucas keep his remaster, re-touching, and redubbing, and give me this, its what the Star Wars of my memoires are.<br /><br />To me that is part of the problem with the new thee installments, they look awsome, the plot was good, the writing was squishy. Too much reliance on state of the art sound and visual FX not enough time/money on dialogue.<br /><br />So let lucas keep his &#34;remastering&#34; I'll take my laser disk recopy and my vintage feel. I've never met a kid didn't go &#34;WOH&#34; when they see Episode IV, V, & VI the first time. Nor anyone that said that movie would be great, if they replaced all the effects with modern cgi... see where I'm going
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Interesting theme, and good effects make this one an interesting TV series. I will have to see how the plot develops, but so far the story and characters are very entertaining.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Nice book, but too much of the academic and biological aspects of the brain to suit me.  Was hoping for something a little more emotional and uplifting.  It is interesting but agonizing to read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast device is great. Works perfectly when controlling YouTube and Netflix from my phone. I tried it at my office and plugged it into the TV. Everyone in my office whether they had Android or iPhone was able to control Netflix and YouTube with it with no additional software or setup (after the initial setup I performed of course). They were blown away that that feature already existed in their iPhone and they didn't even know.<br /><br />The tab cast feature in Chrome is cool too. I was able to cast every website I tried without a problem. Keep in mind its only an image of what's in your chrome browser and your computer has to upload what's happening on your computer screen and then download to the Chromecast. People shouldn't expect that feature to work well if you are trying to watch Netflix or YouTube or some other kind of video from Chrome.<br /><br />I did get the Netflix discount but I would have bought this thing without the discount too. TOTALLY WORTH IT.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Very few movie series stand up to the sequel concepts. This is one of the few that each and every movie is great and can stand on it's own. These are just as enjoyable for adults as they are for kids. I have seven kids (mostly grown now) and they all loved these movies.

0385523394|4.0|I did something new with \\"Orange is the New Black\\".  I watched the show first before I decided to venture into reading (err, listening) to the book.  This review is for the audio version.  The woman reading the book has a soothing voice and has really good, effective accents to highlight the differences between characters.  The actual book is nothing like the show with the exception of some characters and a few circumstances of an upper middle class white female going to a woman's prison.  The show is highly dramatized (of course).  But in either respects I enjoyed both quite a bit.<br /><br />  I found this story to have value in a perspective of what it is like to enter and acclimate to a woman's prison system.  The bonds she made, the personal revelations and growth she experienced in the year she was incarcerated were somewhat refreshing because the author has enough respect for herself to make it refreshing.  I can see where some people would find her writing kind of annoying or 'lacking', however the author never claimed to be a writer.  She is simply a person telling her story in the only way she knows how and her recollection and attention to certain detail of her experience is the heart of what makes this an interesting story.  Plus I'm not a literary snob like a lot of people on Amazon seem to be.  I often wonder how many books I officially have to read for that to happen.<br /><br />  I also found that listening to the book after I watched the show really enhanced the story for me rather than the other way around.  There were definite moments where the author actually made Danburry sound pleasant, almost elementary school like for adults.  The bonds that she made with some of the inmates were sincere and there were moments I felt legitimately bad for her, like when her grandmother died and she couldn't even apply for a furlough to go to her funeral.  There were a few moments in her yearly stay that raised a few eyebrows, especially how the prison guards treated the inmates on occasion and hopefully this book exposes some of that abuse.  Just because you're in a Federal Prison it doesn't mean they should be treated like animals or without human merit.  This was one of the more rewarding things that I took from this story.  Give it a chance and experience it again with her.  Piper might not be the most sophisticated story teller in the world but she certainly isn't the worst either.  Once you understand that I think this story will be quite rewarding for you as well.reated the inmates on occasion and hopefully this book exposes some of that abuse.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|I have read some of Sanderson's other books and I really liked them, so of course I would buy the first in this new, grand series.  I found the first 1/3 of this book to be slow, and also that I did not care about the characters, and to be honest I probably would not have finished the book if it were not for my very wise friend's advice.  He said \\"This is the first book of a 10 book series, Sanderson has never disappointed you, it takes some time to set up such a grand stage, and I've already finished it and I can tell you that you will not regret finishing the book.\\"  In the end I was very satisfied with the book, after the 1/2 way point I started to care about the characters and get immersed in the story.  The last 1/3 of the book it was \\"a page turner\\" I could not put it down.<br /><br />I just want to make sure that anyone who reads this review who is as foolishly impatient as I am will know not to give up on this book.  This is going to be a great series and we are all pissed at the author for making us wait so long for the second!  But seriously Brandon, take your time we trust you!
B00BAXTYCQ|5.0|I am a fan of Star Trek! Always. The product was in great shape, like new. And it arrived as expected. A+ seller.
B000002W4V|5.0|I remember buying this when the LP first came out.  I went to the record store....back when you did that....and heard this playing.  It was my introduction into a new world of rock and roll.  Lou Reed and Bowie became my idols.  Rock and Roll turned upside-down and sideways!  Raw, Real, uncharted territory for the times.  Back then the album covers were as important as the music; they showed us this is not your parent's music.  This is my favorite Reed album.  The band is great and they let Reed shine bright as the star he was....and still is in my book!
0877180121|5.0|I used this book for my little boys. They are getting into it, but it took me a while for them to get the hint that we needed to use a book for formal practicing, as they were used to just 'playing'... now they know that they are 'letters' for writing music and 'letters' for writing stories... too cute!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this game. The graphic is great. Much better than Floors Escape.<br /><br />Can't wait for more floors to upload.
1934030198|5.0|I purchased it for my first tri, and it gave me all the information I needed to survive. Now I am re-reading it to improve performance, and it is actually helping me tremendously. It's like having a coach by my nightable ;-)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If it is written by Hosseini, it's gonna be great.  Just wish he got his &#34;next&#34; books out quicker!! Wonderful
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome little device that casts to my tv. Now I don't have to be stuck watching on smaller screens. I got great high speed internet so everything is very smooth. Can't wait for developers to increase the apps that will be able to use it. Chrome browser cast works great for viewing web pages and content on my computer also. For the price this ROCKS! I also got the netflix bonus!!!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|It is the best version out on the market for Hansel and Gretel, reminds me of the brothers grimm movie from a few years ago.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|1st one stopped working after 1 week. Replaced quickly. Love it sounds like the entire pool is stereo.  Love that it goes on jawbone and clips to goggles nothing to fall out ears. Easy to load and recharge. Put 330 songs on it in less than 20 minutes really didn't need such high gig one never use all that space.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Great introduction as a series, hope the people in charge will think about another addition to the movie after doing such a good job.
0385349947|5.0|I have given this book to my granddaughters and friends' daughters and granddaughters. The author encourages women to fulfill their potential without limitations.
B00CFA222M|3.0|It is o.k., but the writing is bad.  There is not much that the actors can do with a bad script.
0307352153|5.0|As an introvert, the title of the book caught my eye and had me curious what sort of \\"introspection\\", that \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" would have to offered.<br /><br />The reading isn't light as one obviously can see; Instead, I was treated to a very in depth look at Introverts and the contrast they bring to a world that for those who are introverted, can seem catered more to extroverts than to the introvert.<br /><br />Along with a \\"book study guide\\" that helps the reader(s) and book group, dig deeper into, \\"Quiet\\", Susan Cain brings a very comprehensive look into the world of the Introverts and what they are (and are not) in a world that is always on the go.<br /><br />With research and insight that really captures what it is to be an introvert, \\"Quiet\\" isn't, as shared light reading or something to easily offer as a, \\"this is what it means to be an introvert and what an introvert can offer\\".<br /><br />A former Wall Street lawyer and self labeled \\"introvert\\", Susan has devoted a book that seems to be geared as a \\"there isn't anything wrong with being an introvert\\" and provided readers as a way to learn how to balance being \\"quiet\\" while at the same time learning to utilized the power of being an introvert in business and just daily life.<br /><br />It was great seeing how she explain the difference between being an introvert and being shy and shows to that being an introvert wasn't a character flaw that needed to be fix, but that there is not only nothing wrong with being an introvert but also help shows what introverts have to offer and can be use to balance in a sometimes very extroverted world.<br /><br />One of the biggest mistakes, some people can make is thinking that \\"being an introvert\\" is something to be fixed without realizing that there are many famous people in history who were and are introverts and have learned to use this to not only their benefit but for others as well, so its something that doesn't need tobe changed but to be understood as Susan manages to do in her book.<br /><br />No book can completely cover everything and \\"Quiet\\" is a pretty thick book already, covering many details about being an introvert and although she uses generalizations at time, its a great foundation for helping not only people understand what being an introvert is about but also for those who are extroverts...get a better understand of their \\"quiet\\" companions.<br /><br />Susan really helps others, understand in a culture that seems to project and demand extrovertism and constant social participation why being an introvert isn't a bad thing and brings to the table, a level of understanding, but on many levels, the sometimes challenges that introverts can face.<br /><br />One quote by Susan Cain brings this to mind, \\"\\"I worry that there are people who are put in positions of authority because they're good talkers, but they don't have good ideas. It's so easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent. Someone seems like a good presenter, easy to get along with, and those traits are rewarded. Well, why is that? They're valuable traits, but we put too much of a premium on presenting and not enough on substance and critical thinking.\\"<br /><br />With her book, Susan explores and shares how introverts, though opposite can often bring more to the table than their extroverted counterparts often can and though introverts may not be as flashy or outgoing, their opposite personality may mean that they are more likely to see what others are quick to overlook.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\", is like a manual of how to deal and understand introverts and in a world of books that talk about being energetic and outgoing, a much needed balanced where, as Susan Cain puts it, \\"Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured...Spend your free the way you like, not the way you think you're supposed to.\\"<br /><br />In a sterotypical way, this is a book that an introvert would find themselves, curled up in a corner, and slowly digesting with marvel of this is how I am, while perplexed, energetic extroverts will find themselves, gaining a deeper understanding of the introvert and how its not something to be changed but a personality that, once understood, completely, helps balanced a relationship on all levels.<br /><br />I really enjoy reading, \\"Quiet\\" and besides marveling that \\"someone finally got what it means to be an introvert\\" but that someone finally wrote a book that serves as a wonderful guide into the world and mind of the introvert.<br /><br />***Thank you to Waterbrook Multnomah for the opportunity to read and review the book***
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Point and click, search, matching, mastermind all those games are part of this game.  All driven forward by a clock that is ticking down, when you make a screw up you lose minutes from your time.  So poor performance in an early puzzle could make a later one impossible.  I could understand a timer in each one but this makes no sense.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Started on the smaller one and worked to the biggest 12x12  the first 2 I couldn't get the lower right corner I tried all combinations<br />with no luck since then I try the lower right corner first then the rest so far I get the whole puzzle.  Maybe I made a mistake or the algorythym is floored
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|I assume most know what they are already getting into with this album: which is going to namely be so so vocals over a hot dance beat. If you anticipate that then you will get exactly what you are looking for. This is quite simply a fun upbeat album to dance, workout, drive to. Don't look for anything over and above that and you will not be disappointed. The album reminds me of a mixture of something Avril Lavigne (Birthday), Britney Spears (Slow Down) and Rihanna (Like A Champion) would put out. So its definitely sugar pop. And though Selena probably doesn't do it as good as those three, she makes a solid effort. And of course the dance track helps her to a great degree. There's nothing exceptional or risk taking: its on trend with much of what is current in dance-pop, dubstep and handclaps included. Still, its probably more fun and more risqué than anything Selena has done in the past. If you want something lighthearted and fun its worth giving it a chance.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great movie I would watched it again its a must see movie. You will love this movie<br />Rent or buy this movie
0756655307|4.0|Great quality encyclopedia. Has enough infor without getting too crazy. My only beef is that some people get 2-4 pages(Hulk, Wolvy, Spidey) and some characters get a paragraph(Thanos, Thing, etc). Would like to see a little more love given to small characters and not a full page for Lois Lane and Mary Jane Watson.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great app for horse lovers!!! i really like it and u can buy as many horses as u want!!!!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|This is the ultimate movie. I don't care who you are, this movie is the greatest thing to happen to cinema since technocolor and Dolby digitial surround sound. If you don't know the story...come on. Undercover cop looks for bank robbers the Ex-presidents(they rob banks wearing masks of former presidents), comes to find they are also surfers. While they are looking for surfers Keanu befriends Patrick Swayze(RIP) and learns to surf. Falls in love with some dude named Lori Petty. Learns his new friends are indeed the ex-presidents(I assure you this is NO spoiler). If this movie wasn't the inspiration for the X-Games, I don't know what was. This movie is a mindless action-fiesta with some amazing one-liners, great visuals, and Anthony Kedis(Red Hot Chili Peppers). Just sit back, turn your brain off, and enjoy.
B004CURZFC|4.0|It's a kids movie but I watched it twice.  I liked it the animation was really well done.  The Theme of the movie was for older kids.
B000000993|5.0|I love Tool. Even 10,000 days. This is hands down the best album they have made. The deep pulsating bass. The whining high-pitched guitar. The unbelievable perfect off-beat drumming. Maynard's vocals are hypnotic. This band is more talented than any other banc out there. Every track is just unbeatable. From the popular &#34;Sober&#34; to my personal favorite &#34;Swamp Song&#34;. This album doesn't have a bad moment. The hidden tracks, and yes I mean tracks, are awesome too. A little Bill Hicks, chanting, and other bizaar speeches are worth waiting for. Also, for a great little treat, remove the platic piece that holds the CD in place for a most delightful picture.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book simply took my breath away. I just reread the book and it struck me just as hard. It has a lot of controversial thoughts that I didn't know could be so well put. It may be different for other readers but I didn't feel the need to want to argue the points in the book in fact I agree with most of them. I would recommend it to anyone with the ability to read.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Far-fetched? YES. Terrible acting? You betcha! Could one man really defy death at the last possible second 50 times in real life? Hell no! But the story in interesting enough, and the visuals are pretty outstanding. It's a typical big budget end of the world flick that only really suffers from John Cusak. Did you really expect an Oscar-ridden movie?
B0030IIZ4M|2.0|I could of gotten just as good a copy at a flea market for a third the price..Not to mention the price of shipping .
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is a novel that should be required reading for everyone that has a sense of history, mystery and suspense. As usual, Dan Brown has created a novel that is read in a continuous sitting. I DEMAND MORE from this outstanding author.
B005LAII44|5.0|its action from the start to the end with a lot of good actors in it very good<br />movie i really enjoyed this one hopefully you will to if you like action this is the one for you
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great job with the authenticity of the guns. All classic WWII guns. Easy to use. Always fun to use. Wonderful graphics
B00BBGZ5ZW|5.0|We really loved the movie for many reasons:<br />-it is the first movie filmed entirely on location<br />-it is based on a true story<br />-it uses several real sites used in the real story (for example:  the Courthouse in Marquette Michigan wasn't a built set but the real courthouse.<br />-it uses a great cast of actors<br />-it is a great story that doesn't need the sensationalism today's movies used to sell the story
B003QSJDZQ|3.0|Seems like old school animation - but it looks great.  Story okay, entertaining - great for the kids.  Will teach them not to be so self centered.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|John Voit, Mickey Rourke and Danny DeVito offer nothing more than their usual performances but they are fun none-the-less.  You get your standard thoughtful Matt Damon performance, no surprise there.  Claire Danes on the other hand gives you a bit of range, not the level of Temple Grandin mind you but she’s very believable as the abused wife.  Johnny Whitworth sells this very difficult subject matter with his portrayal of a very sick young man battling leukemia and a horrible insurance company.  I’d have said I loved it except either the writing or directing at times seemed to have lines that just didn’t make sense but had to be included because they were in the book.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Good ensemble effort for the AARP crowd. Bruce Willis and John Malkovich play their usual roles (Willis: tough guy with a heart of gold, Malkovich: crazy lunatic), but some step way out of character (Helen Mirren: stone cold killer).
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like that it teaches you about the undersea life. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about life undersea.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|The best thing was the flying baboons, though the director kept having them come straight at the camera for that 3D thing that is so overdone these days.  Pretty childish and only interesting the first time.  The wizard was written as an extremely shallow part - the movie would have been much better if he had had at least a couple of molecules of character.  Nice costumes.  Interesting hair.  Okay makeup.
B001BANK32|5.0|King at his peak! I am re-reading this for a class I am teaching in the fall on American Gothic. A terrifying read in the past. This time I am struck at the skill in which King uses the family unit and the characters for the anchors for this novel.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It switched back and forth between characters and was a &#34;down book&#34;.  It was not anywhere as good as the &#34;Kite Runner&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Watch out it talks to you. Kids seem to really enjoy the game. They like that you can change the minions.
B00881VLCE|1.0|just doesn't work on my kindle...pieces get stuck more than not, wont turn on command and way to slow response.  I deleted same day.  poor app
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|The Hobbit, by Peter Jackson has been maligned because it feels slower, drags on, and isn't the same story as The Lord of the Rings. However, if you read the book, The Hobbit, you'll find that the pacing of the movie is right in line with the pacing of the book. JRR Tolkein really does take a while with the story, and Jackson and company do a marvelous job at enriching the Middle Earth world. I for one enjoyed the film. And also, I waited for the extended version. I wonder though if we get to see the 48fps on our regular TVs. I thought that was a fantastic visual feast.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|i put it in the boys room they like it my hubby like it and it looks nice and elegant
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite costume drama pieces ever to come out of England...and I guess I'm definitely not alone in that opinion.  I have watched them avidly on PBS and then went out and bought each DVD as they've come out and re-watched them again.  The intersecting stories of the nobility upstairs and the servants downstairs continues to intrique and enthrall.  I love to love some characters and I love to hate some characters, and some of them even switch in my affections over time.<br /><br />Season Three takes place in the early 1920's.  Now that WWI is behind Downton, the estate still isn't safe as they take a hit in their finances and have to come to terms with the idea of modernization.  Mary and Matthew are finally together (yeah!) and their wedding is beautifully done, but Matthew is clearly hopeful of a child (and heir) to be.  Edith loses out on her wedding dreams, but discovers her own voice.  I must say, I have gone from disliking her to liking her in this season.  The same with Ms O'Brien, as she becomes a deeper character who is sorry for her mistakes, but still has that sharp tongue.  While, Thomas...well, what can one say about Thomas.  He will emerge a bit of a dark hero by the end of this season.<br /><br />Not sure what I think about the new character of Rose, a young would-be flapper, but it looks like she will be joining the regular cast, and so far I'm liking her.  Also adored the brief bit with Shirley McLaine as Cora's mother and her sarcastic interaction with the Dowager (Maggie Smith)...what can be better with two fabulous actors like this!  Loved every moment of their conversational banter.<br /><br />The world is changing and Downton is changing with it, despite all the attempts of our favorite grumpy by the book yes M'Lord butler.  None of the characters stay static in this show and no one is safe from an untimely end, which makes the stories not only interesting but really sends you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Just when things look their best and brightest--watch out!<br /><br />Non-character stars of the show include the beautiful 1920's style clothing (bring back feathered and jeweled headbands!), the vintage cars, and Oh My! that wonderful trip to the Scottish Highlands that rounds out the season.  Perfect.  Just perfect.<br /><br />If you love Downtown, you will love this season...even if it will break your heart at times.  Can't wait until Season 4!
B008OUSFVO|5.0|A friend of mine sent me a link to preview this album and told me that it was worth every penny -- well, I have to admit, she was right on the money. Lianne La Havas is a beast on the microphone and I'm dying to see her live. Every song on this album is unique and awesome in its own way. You won't regret buying it -- trust me
0425267695|5.0|Powerful, well-written story with an unforgettable central character and a complex fantasy world.  In some ways reminds me of Song of ice & fire, or The name of the wind.  This is probably because of the level of writing and deeply enmeshed you become in the story.  Loved it!
B007XIC1GI|3.0|I learned  a lot from this book Marilyn is very intelligent and speaks so lucidly. he has introduced me to some great new ideas and concepts. It is was so fascinating to read how his perspectives came to be, where his personality derived from and how organized religion damages lives. the only thing I didnt like is that i couldnt understand his troubled side. He and strauss left out the details of his struggles at many points in the book. he would write how he was betrayed and misanthropic at times but without expressing the reasons or specifics for the feelings.the later parts became more of entertaining story telling than insightful and it made it hard to relate to his character. though it was entertaining.and the end seemed very unfinished I would have liked to hear more about how his life changed after he hit it big but it was terse.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|As usual, Gerber and Bear come through with a winner.  Very rugged design and I love the side pocket.  I would recommend this to everyone looking to buy a canteen that is BPA free.  Awesome!
0375812024|5.0|This was perfect for our recent plane trip, my 4 year old loves busytown and I knew she would be entertained with this new book on our flight!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Loved watching this with my son! He has asked to watch it everyday since her watched it the first time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|would probably play better on the tablet galaxy 3 phone works fine but a little small for all the gestures you have to make.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read these books to see what the hype is about.  I have to say I'm disappointed.  The writing is awful. I don't like the main character Ana. She is so weak and uninspiring.  The sex stuff gets boring and repetitive.  I'm finishing them because I paid for the trilogy but I really hope they both get killed off or something
B008BU75IQ|5.0|i enjoyed the series of The Clifton Chronicles. Best Kept Secret was keeps you interested. I like to see less than creditable characters fail.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|An excellent read.  Frightening and believable.<br />The Kitchen House will be compared with &#34;The Help&#34; and will come out ahead.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am loving the story, the intrigue, the characters.  I can't wait to read what's next. On to book 3!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Rescue Roby is a lot of fun that gets you thinking. I like that even when you don't win a level you can just play it over and over until you figure out the sequence to get little Roby into his box. I play on my Kindle Fire and haven't had any issues with it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Kept me on edge trying to figure out the puzzles on time. Would love for it to continue even though some parts drove me nuts
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My younger sister and I both love the movie and when we heard about the game we got it right away ans have had hours of fun with it! We love to challenge each other and our friends on facebook.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Well written.  Makes you get a picture of what life in prison is really about.  Keeps your interest<br />. .
145210655X|5.0|A cute introduction to children whose parents who are lovers of Star Wars! Not really a story pattern, but cute illustrations and some classic phrases.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What I liked most about it: (1) the overall plot, and (2) that Katniss was not some lovelorn or hormonal teenager.<br /><br />What I did not like most about the trilogy was Katniss' relationship-phobia.  Yes, she's loyal to family and friends but she was mostly afraid of emotional intimacy.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Revolver has always been a classic album, and one of the best albums ever made; This re-master of the original album is all and everything to reproduce the magic of &#34;Revolver&#34; in a rich, unique and beautiful sound.
015204907X|5.0|And, if you knew my two-year-old, you would know how amazing that really is! She never sits through a whole book. Never. At least, she never did until we checked this book out of the library a week ago. She can't get enough of it, so I had to find it on Amazon and buy it. Cheaper (and more honest) than not returning it to the library and paying them for it.<br /><br />This book has it all - colors, rhymes, opposites, and engaging pictures of absolutely adorable sheep. If you have small children in your life, you need to buy this book. You won't be disappointed. I just can't recommend it enough!
0525478817|4.0|For months I've heard from a lot of my friends that I need to read this book. The truth is that when I first saw it I wasn't interested in reading it because I didn't like the cover. Then when I read the blurb I really didn't want to read it. It sounded too depressing. But the urging of a close friend got me to cave and I finally read the book.<br />It's hard to articulate my feelings about this book. There were some things that I absolutely loved and some things I didn't love as much as I wanted to.<br />So I think the best way for me to do this is to break my review into two lists:<br />Pros: Augustus. Seriously, he was the best part of this book. The perfect swoon-worthy hero. He was witty, sarcastic, cute. I loved him. Hazel. She was hard for me to connect with at first, but as I got to know her she grew on me. Also, I saw a lot of growth in her throughout the book and I liked that. Hazel's parents. I liked them. The way they dealt with her illness seemed very real to me. I also enjoyed her conversations with her dad and how he got her to see things differently. I loved the romance between Hazel and Augustus. It was beautiful. An Imperial Affliction. Since I love reading and I'm addicted to books, I enjoyed the significance reading and books took in this novel. I felt like the book that Augustus and Hazel read had so much symbolism and I learned a lot about the characters through their conversations about the book.<br />Cons: Reading is something I do for an escape. I like books with happy endings and books that make me feel good. I know that isn't realistic and that's not life, but that's what I like about books. They are fiction. Life is ugly and messy and scary, and when I read I want to escape all of that. This book was not an escape. It brought all of the ugliness of life to the forefront. Also, this book was hard for me to read. I don't like thinking about death and this book makes you think about it.  A lot. Not only just death, but death of kids and that's even scarier.<br />With all that being said, good books make you think. They bring up emotions and raise questions. This book did that. And John Green's writing style was great. I did enjoy this story even if it made me cry ugly tears (which I hate to do).'s even scarier.<br />With all that being said, good books make you think.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love how easy it is to fall for these two characters and how detailed her descriptions of all the characters are. You can really picture them and get a good feel for everything going on! Great book!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't get enough of it!!!! Very addictive and such suspense!!! Can't wait to watch more!!! Will watch more from this site!
B005M5XCZ8|5.0|Good movie, plus it's a great deal to get a digital, DVD, and Blu-ray on 3 separate disks. Very happy.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Story? Plot? Character Development? Who needs em?  I am a big McLane fan. The last one was soooo good.  This one is just flat.  Bruce just looks tired and there is no bite in his words or actions.  Maybe my hopes were too high.
0374214913|5.0|I just loved this book.  I enjoyed how he wrote, I wish there was a Mr. Penumbra book store, I would definitely go there.  I'm looking forward to more from this author.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love a hero girl with spunk and America goes above and beyond in this book. Highly entertaining for teens and adults. Also you get more secrets into the past of the country and learn more about the caste system. Also I see hints of what is happening in our world today and how people take control with money and greed.  I cannot wait to read on. Very talented author! Thank you for your entertaining story and I hope you realize what a true talent you are.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Works well!  Just what I wanted it to do & simple to use!  Makes pictures even cuter than they were before!
B000SEI230|4.0|Started reading this book because of the author,  I could not put it down,  This is what true love really is about.  Grab tissues, a twist I never expected.  Love it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just another reason I am so glad I have amazon prime, I wait until the season is over and then watch several episodes at a time, outstanding series. Owen
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Some of the greatest syfy ever. I wish they would bring the series back!! I will purchase the five seasons. The show is destined to be classic
B003VANOFY|1.0|Reasonable headset. Sound quality is adequate for music and movies. Not the crispest sound but okay. Worked okay at first but after 2 months I can't convince the thing to charge. software reports fully charged (it's actually totally dead). I left yesterday with 9 hours remaining reported by the software - despite being off all night (and plugged in for charging).  The batter is dead this morning. I read review of other people complaining about charging and dismissed them as people being fussy or not paying attention.  Seriously - I don't recommend you buy this.<br /><br />PS - it has huge charging issues.<br /><br />Update after 6 months:<br /><br />This is essentially useless due to charging issues.  It shuts off all the time.  It says it's fully charged and then says it's out of battery. The software says the device is not connected when it is. Horrible purchase.<br /><br />(edit: my husband wrote this review)
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|There is little to explain but pure fun. Giant Robots vs Giant Monsters just like in the old days of Godzilla. My kids and I went to got see this in the theater and we had to go back a second time because we could not get enough. It is a Rock um Sock em fun movie to watch and some of the acting especially from Idris Elba was pretty good. O and you have to love Ron Perlman. A must see.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I'm still reading the book but want to point out a couple things:<br /><br />1.  Jesus said: \\"My kingdom is not of this world\\"<br />2. Jesus did not engage or fight the political systems of his day. He fought the religious system. At the beginning of his ministry, and right after the beheading of John by Herod, he said; \\"The kingdom of God suffereth violence, and the violent take it by storm\\". He was aware that violent forces were in action to stop the spreading of the Gospel. Unlike John, he did not have confrontations with Herod etc. There is not one instance recorded in the Gospels where Jesus was in confrontation with anyone political.<br />3. Anyone who has read the Gospels cannot help but be aware of Jesus' intelligence.I do not believe that he was illiterate at all. I also do not believe that Jesus' family was dirt poor. The \\"gold, frankincense and myrrh\\" that was presented to him at birth by the Magi I belive was saved and used not only for his education but for the support of his family.<br />4. When I actually did in fact read the Gospels for myself, the \\"meek and mild\\" Jesus that I grew up with as a child quickly went out the door. Obviously someone who could persuade 12 rough and tough men to follow him had to be someone as strong as they, stronger even because a mild wimpy person would never be able to do that. Through the Gospels I came to know Jesus as being very tough, compassionate yes, but very strong.<br />5. Why has \\"Jesus\\" stood the test of time when none of the other \\"wanna be\\" Messiahs that Aslan writes about did not? I think that is the true unanswered question..........perhaps there is the possibility that he was \\"unique\\".....maybe?<br /><br />The book is well written however and researched and I still have to finish it...I will review it again.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Rented it with my nephew, even though he can recite it word for word.  We totally enjoyed it watching it AGAIN!!!!  Steve Carell and cast are GREAT and funny!
1416524800|5.0|THE THOUGHT OF ALL THE HIGH TEC. IN THIS BOOK ALREADY IN EXISTENCE IS MIND BOGOLING.  AS ALWAYS THE DETAIL MAKES YOU FEEL THERE.  THE POLITICS, AGENDAS AND INTERACTIONS LEAD TO INTENSE THRILLS AND SUPRIZES, NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. YOU AND THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK ARE IN A RACE TO RESOLVE A MOST COMPELLING DELIMA FACING THE VARIOUS FRACTIONS AND INDIVIDUALSAS THEY TRY TO DESTROY, SAVE AND OR BUILD A BETTER WORLD FOR US ALL.
0743201140|5.0|Same book and updated.  I thought I would buy the whole series of books because there might have been other information in this one than the other one, however, not alot is added in Strengthfinders 2.0.  Same descriptions, similar beginnings, so if you want to save a bit of money, go ahead and just jump straight to the new Strengthsfinder books.  It is an eye opening test and a good foundation to self discovery.  This book is good too but pretty much the same as the new one.
B000KADH2S|5.0|Reading this book was an English class assignment and I did not think that this would be an interesting book since i judged the book by its cover and the cover to me seemed boring.  As we began reading this book i really got into it because not only is this book about the life Frankl had in concentration camps but it also teaches all the readers a lesson about life.  We should all appreciate like and be thankful for all the little things that happen to us through out the years.  I would recommend this great book to anyone who had some free time reading and doesn't know what book to read.  Truely this book changed my outlook on life because we never know what can happen to us every morning when we wake up.
B005JABSB6|2.0|Weird... but there is only ONE specific pair of Bluetooth glasses offered to be compatible with my 70'' 3D 857 Series Sharp Aquos. I guess that's fine, I sent these back, and although the seller was very rude and actually wrote me two insulting emails out of no where, I went back to the bluetooth version.
B006RXQASA|1.0|No matter how bad a movie will be, I usually will tolerate it and watch it to the end. For the first time ever for me, I couldn't get past the first ten minutes of this boring, uninteresting, supposed comedy that tries to float on pure toilet humor and brainless dead beats. This movie may appeal to people who like this kind of brain dead humor...it just doesn't appeal to me. I would rather watch Killer Clowns From Space five times in a row before I try to finish watching this movie. And I really, really hated Killer Clowns From Space.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|This was the funniest movie I have seen in years. Why? Because it tried so very, very hard to be serious... and went overboard off the cliff of goofy.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays a 'cleric' in a dystopian future that has chosen to forgo emotion, saying that emotion is what leads to war. This is not a wrong statement, like saying oxygen leads to forest fires. It just leaves out most of the important factors. But the problem isn't the idea, but the execution. The director and writer has chosen to try to wring as much emotion out of a scene as possible, but what he fails it is making you <i>care</i>. I do not care that this world is a dystopian future because of the massive leaps in logic it takes to create it. I do not care about the fates of any of the characters, because none of them are enjoyable. I do not care about potential harm to the protagonist because he is a boring invincible hero and the director/writer knows it. There was no tension, no stakes, because we knew that the hero would win, because the hero never got hurt in a way we cared about. The video-game-like action sequences were so over the top and ridiculous that you couldn't take them seriously.<br /><br />So I laughed. And laughed, and laughed.<br /><br />This movie is an enjoyable BAD movie. I recommend it for when you need something to mock or you need a bloody revenge fantasy. But as for useful or deep?<br /><br />No.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This was such a simple, poignant, moving story of the bond, love and loyalty between a man and his dog. I absolutely dare you to watch this and not shed a tear at the end. No need to critique this movie. Just watch it with the whole family and enjoy. It certainly will tug at all of your emotions. A splendid, well made movie. Bravo!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|If you work with documents, files or any other word processing functions, you need this... Works well and is very user friendly...
B00E193TM2|5.0|I splurged a whole $9 for the new Five Finger Death Punch album, and I'm glad I did! Heavy as hell and kicks some serious ass! I dont often look forward to albums as much as I did this one, and it does not disappoint!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game and so do I!  Knocking the competition off as you run by is one of our favorite things to do.  The game has simple controls without being too easy.  Our new favorite!
1451695195|3.0|I have read many books on this subject with much interest. This book didn't grab me nearly as much as some of the others. Yes, it's credible by virtue of the author, it's just the style. It's too medically & scientifically oriented, you can tell a physician wrote it. For the average reader, it may not be their thing even if it's their subject of interest. I am in the medical profession but a couple of times I nearly gave up. Would I recommend this book?....nah, not so much. Check out the many other books on this subject.
B000HF0J36|3.0|Enjoy this film for the special effects and a few of the performances but it is rather campy.  There are better shark movies but I enjoyed some of the actors' performances. But I would rent and not buy it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I recently received my Chromecast that I ordered directly from Google and I can already say that this is a very impressive device. It is also important to note I own a Roku 3 (verified purchase on my profile)and an Apple TV.<br /><br />This device is the perfect for those who don't need as many options as the Roku but require the Popular apps like \\"Netflix, YouTube, Hulu (this was just announced and confirmed), etc.. Not only that, you get the added bonus of \\"casting\\" a web browser.<br /><br />As many have noted most apps simply \\"cast\\" by pulling what you want to see through the cloud and not your device (iphone, tablet, etc..)<br /><br />It is important to note that the \\"casting\\" of a Chrome browser tab is a direct broadcast from your computer. Currently \\"casting\\" chrome browser only works with a computer and requires an extension called \\"Google casting\\" which you can get from the Play store. Tab casting is only in Beta and should only improve from here.<br /><br />The other apps have worked flawlessly thus far and I have no complaints.<br /><br />Highly recommend for users that only need the essentials or those who have extra TV's that need to get \\"connected\\" You simply cant go wrong at this price point, and it will only get better as new apps are added to it.
031219126X|4.0|I used this version of Frankenstein for a college-level literary criticism course. The case studies included were helpful sources for the research paper I had to write.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great game. The gopher makes a nice twist and there are many different courses. The cut sequences are  a fun treat.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Without going much into detail, this is a great book. I downloaded the sample and was instantly hooked by the first couple of pages so I bought it and it was worth it. Strongly recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Love this trilogy...seriously could not put the books down, but the ending to Entwined is way to abrupt.  I was angry when I realized it was over.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen lately. It seemed slow and boring in the beginning, but then I fell in love with that small town, actors and everything that went between them. Great movie to watch with whole family.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is cheaper because it is the European (or whatever) version.  The cases of the DVD's are ugly, but the bluray quality is great!  Movies are the same.  Save the money and buy this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is very well acted, with wonderful stories behind each and every character. Every scene is so riveting and full of drama!
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|This game sucks alot. You only get two patients and the rest you have to buy it stinks. I hate game that only give you two choices  and the rest you have to buy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is the most fun game I've played yet.  I love the graphics and the levels are mega challenging.  Hope the developers keep adding new levels.  Get this game!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Since acquiring the Kindle App for Android, I can thoroughly say that I enjoy this app. It is definitely one of the best apps I have acquire since having my android systems. The compatibility is incredible and use as well as operation is easily understood.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The concept was ok but the ending was a little quirky.  There was no explanation for the beginning of the movie and why the father was running from the mother and his intension on killing his daughter.  Another movie where the most exciting part was the previews for this movie.  Oh wait, Jessica Chastain is great to look at.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I was reading t his until 5AM I couldn't stop it was such a good novel. So read it its worth the money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the monthly updates with new characters. It keeps the game from getting boring. The graphics are great and this is a game for all ages. My two year old grandson even plays.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|These Blu-ray / DVD combo discs are expensive in the store.  I had been looking at multiple stores for a decently priced Wall-E set, as it is my son's favorite movie.  This was a great deal, arrived promptly, and in perfect condition.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|such a cute film.  my kiddos 3 and 6 love this cartoon.  they have watched over and over again!  great family film.
1416585710|2.0|Must admit I may have already been set up to be underwhelmed because I was totally put off by the name \\"Lisey\\".  But I was willing to forge ahead.<br /><br />If you are looking for a poignant love story or good ghost/horror story, this book tries to be both but really is not that interesting as either.  In fact, and I hate to say it because this story seems almost personal for King, it's boring.<br /><br />In a nutshell:  Lisey, the main character, is the grieving widow of a famous writer who is also a deeply troubled man.  In spite of his issues, Lisey and her husband have an enduring and deep bond which transcends his death. Some desperately needed horror elements come into this love story--needed to pick up the pace. One problem I had was that the husband seemed absurdly babyish and self-absorbed.  Add to that the cutesy words used by the couple throughout the story (bool? smucky?) and I never got the impression of any great love but rather that of a woman's mommy-like  dedication to a perpetual child.  Other than his writing, Lisey's husband seems quite useless on many fronts.<br /><br />Also, this story doesn't seem like Lisey's story, but rather her husband's story.  Fine by me, because I didn't really like Lisey or her sister--another character necessary for the \\"mystery\\".<br /><br />I do like Stephen King, but I suggest passing this one up.  There are better love stories and better horror stories.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i just love this series!!  it keeps me captivated with each episode!  cant wait for the new season to start!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great game if you like finding clues and solving puzzles. I would recommend this to anyone who finds this type of puzzle interesting
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game but it is VERY similar to temple run... but again it is super duper fun. You should play it
B00CC9P99E|5.0|Another brilliant album by lloyd Cole. He just seems to get better with each release. For anyone who is not across Cole's music grab this new CD and work backwards through his catalogue of brilliant albums. You'll never hear music like this on commercial radio and that's often the case. You have go looking for the best non commercial releases.<br /><br />'Standards' sees LC employing a great band and a mixture of electric and acoustic numbers. Brilliant lyrics with simple and meaningful messages has always been his strengths. I'd describe his music as avant-garde. There's not a 'dud' song on this great new album from LC and its a pity he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. Favourite tracks on this new release are- Women's Studies, Period Piece, Myrtle and Rose, No Truck and Opposites Day.<br /><br />One of the best releases in 2013. Make an effort to see Lloyd in concert too- you won't be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Never could find any directions on how to play, would get treasure chests but needed keys to open and then was asked to pay for the keys to open the chests.
B007MDB71O|4.0|As a second grader I discovered a book in the school library about a green man from Mars and it started me on a road to other worlds. Remembering back, it must have been one of the books of the Barsoom series. Later, a little older, I fell in love with Princess of Mars, and then read the rest of the series (or those of the books I could get my hands on). I remember Warlord of Mars and Chessmen of Mars in particular. Cut to the present (or immediate past) and I heard Disney was making a movie based on the book series. I was excited but also afraid that it would be more theme park than romantic pulp/science fiction. As it turns out, even though I would not have brought in features from the second book and didn't feel the extended back story for our hero was needed, John Carter turned out to be pretty awesome. I found myself falling in love again. And I ran out and read every single one of the books again. Don't hesitate to buy the DVD or rent/purchase on demand: this is a wonderful film. Lynn Collins was amazing as Dejah Thoris, a perfect heroine for young girls. And (tiny spoiler) the last moments of the film, as she and John whisper the words Barsoom, incredibly moving.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book so much. It was such a good book. I hated to put it down. I do
B008LV8TSU|4.0|This was a great companion read for people who enjoyed the movie adaptation by Studio Ghibli. Looking forward to more Howl and Sophie in the future.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Did'nt get to finish the movie. Came back to finish watching it 24 hrs later and Amazon had removed it!! Come on guys.....
0817439390|5.0|I really like this book- very easy read and it puts a very complicated topic in an easy to read format.  I've actually read it a couple of times- would recommend to a beginner!
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|I'm writing this as I'm listening to this music for the first time, and I almost want to cry.  This is what jazz and music is all about.  Salvant and her combo take you to a time and place far away and long ago from where ever you are now...  The only thing that I can add to all the remarks is that Aaron Diehl's piano is deep, rich, complex, and just so perfect to complement Salvant's incredible voice...
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I'm not quite satisfied with the songs on this album. I will say that I enjoy the songs &#34;Kingmaker&#34; and &#34;Burn!&#34; and a few others, however, it is certainly not another &#34;Endgame&#34; (amazing album).<br />I will have to say that one of my least favorite songs is the title track &#34;Super Collider&#34;, though I recognize the fact that it was written as a kind of mainstream pop song.<br />As for my title, the reason why I say that I'm not surprised is because I also recognize (as Dave M. pointed out on &#34;That Metal Show&#34;) that when you get up around that 200 song number, you have to be much more hypercritical of yourself in song writing. Though Dave may have said this, I will have to say that I don't think he was successful in being hypercritical enough.<br />All in all, I find the album to be okay.
1439152810|3.0|Having read all 3 of Kate Morton's other books and loving them. I was really looking forward to this one. I loved the first chapter and the last 4 or 5 chapters, but in between it was a strain. Too much jumping back and forth. Too much time spent in the present with the reader wanting to solve the puzzle that happened over 50 years ago.
B0002UOK04|5.0|I remember reading about how Jari was let go from Ensiferum because of his extreme focus on the at-the-time side project Wintersun. I must say that I am satisfied with that result (not saying I wouldn't want Jari to continue in Ensiferum).<br />The songs are all great. If there is any song I could criticize, it would be &#34;Sleeping Stars&#34;, however, it is still a great song.<br />You will be hard-pressed to find any songs on this album you don't like. The momentum and power of songs like &#34;Beyond the Dark Sun&#34;, &#34;Winter Madness&#34;, and &#34;Starchild&#34; even compliment some of the slower tempo songs like &#34;Sleeping Stars&#34; and &#34;Death and the Healing&#34;.<br />If I must choose my favorites (while limiting the list to 3), I would say &#34;Beyond the Dark Sun&#34;, &#34;Winter Madness&#34;, and &#34;Death and the Healing&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you're reading this to help you decide to buy it, you've unfortunately missed out on the 3 free months of Netflix promotion which really made this purchase a no brainer. Even without that, $35 for an easy to use device (very easy) with such potential is still an easy decision. At launch it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google's Play services (video and music). I already have a blu-ray player with apps like Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Instant Video so this adds nothing for me at the moment in terms of streaming video, though using your smartphone as a youtube or netflix remote is FAR superior to trudging through the horrible &#34;smart tv&#34; or &#34;smart player&#34; interfaces. The music function is something I think folks aren't considering enough. You can add songs to the cue from your smartphone, and friends can add theirs as well, making for a &#34;party play&#34; functionality like the Nexus Q was going to have. This is a huge feature for when you have people over for a party. Everyone can share their music together through the Chromecast and it will just play out like a jukebox. Awesome. Pick one up!
B00CM9JKFI|3.0|The album was fair enough for me, I have no serious complaints about the music.<br />My main qualms are with the pricing. I figured that the price was so high because of the metal bust of Loki. The bust was as metal (in the literal sense) as Blue Cheer (in the metaphorical sense). Either the base of it is the only thing made of metal or the rest of it is just a cheap thin kind of metal. The bust looks pretty cool, and the compartment in the rear for the CDs is interesting, however, it was certainly not worth $100. I would've maybe paid $50 for this edition, and that was if I was convinced.<br />Nonetheless, the album sounds pretty okay, my personal favorite on the album is the title track &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Good to pass time in the summer. Not a page turner.<br />That's all I have to say right now. Bye.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.  I learned a deep and abiding love for opera and classical music from my mother and also did volunteer work in home for the elderly for 3 years so I can totally relate to this film. This movie made my heart smile..

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have had subway surfed on my kindle for about a year now and had very few issues with it freezing up. The best thing is that just when you start to get bored with it they change it up just enough to keep you playing.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I like the way the author reflects acceptance or lack of through many of the characters.  The different perspectives were very interesting.
140006922X|1.0|More than just a muslim writing hate against Christianity.  Claims to be a historian.  He has a phD in creative writing, not history, nor theological studies.  The author teaches a course part time on revolutions in the middle east through the use of literature and media.  And, his organization has ties to tides foundation, media matters and center for american progress.  So, just another radical, that hates Israel and trying to undermine Christianity and the American way of life.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Not much upside to the game.  Multiplayer requires Bluetooth, AI is weak and campaign is only 20 matches long. Your also limited to specific deck makeups, as you can`t customize your own. As a veteran player, I was highly disappointed as I would have to play countless hours to unlock cards just to play the same dumb AI over and over. Would be worth .99, for limited enjoyment
B005HED11Y|4.0|Liked the very much. Only watched a few shows, brought back memories of when I first time many years back.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This player is by far the best idea out there.  I have tossed the apple tv out and strictly use this for Netflix.  Can't wait for the rest of the applications to jump on board and I may even cut the cable cord.
0345535413|4.0|Is anyone else bothered by the proofreading errors in this book?  Here are two examples.  On page 388 is the following sentence:  \\"He followed, angry, holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to trip him with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab as his feet, the holes where a man could twist an ankle.\\"  Shouldn't that read \\"to grab at his feet\\"?  Pages 414-415 contain this sentence:  \\"Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow's Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling laughter.\\"  Shouldn't that read \\"as she was passing\\"?  I just find it terribly distracting.<br /><br />In terms of content, I've enjoyed A Game of Thrones and this book, and plan to read the rest.  They're interesting and sometimes exciting, but they lack the depth and resonance of Tolkien, to whom I've seen Martin compared numerous times.  I am engaged with some of the characters (Arya, for example) while others are just cardboard to me (Theon, Catelyn).  I also think that some of Martin's attempts to create a fantasy world are half-hearted and silly - as if changing the name Kevin to Kevan, or the word southern to southron, or the word Sir to Ser makes them more exotic.  To me, it doesn't.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book completely obsessed with mr. Grey. The storyline is great I cannot wait until the movie comes out.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Just as good on the small screen as it was in the theater. I will sheepishly admit that I did sing along with some of the songs; the joys of private viewing!

B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is a difficult but informative book. The author writes of his struggles as a young boy to survive a war torn country. Take the time to read it, I have read it twice and never read books twice.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Keeps me busy in the wee hours of the night.  Enjoyable.  I really don't have nine more words to say.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is a great movie. Good plot line, sexy ripped Brad Pitt; and the amazing fights! This is a must see for most!

B009IF8CH6|4.0|Haha this was purchased by my 3 year old through one click while recovering from his bone marrow transplant in the hospital.  I thought he was watching kid videos on the Kindle and the next thing I know I'm getting receipts on my phone for the purchase of the season.  At least he bought something good.  I did disable one click on the kindle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes pinning on my Kindle Fire HD so Mich more fun than on the computer!!!! It works well except when I go on pinning crazes. The one thing that bugs me really is that it doesn't let me know if someone sends me something or anything like that (isn't supposed to do that???). And it won't let you set your cover for your boards, but who needs that!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I have always been a sucker for period pieces, from the 1700s, 1800 and early 1900s.  This is such a well done show, the actors are great, the location is gorgeous and the story lines are decent and mature and very much how a family- both blood and hired- makes things work.  I was sorry to hear that some of the cast were not coming back for the next season, but I will certainly enjoy whatever the writers have in store. I wish American shows had this much class instead of the crap they televise now. Reality TV is the downfall of society in America.  Give me more shows like Downton Abbey where respect and morals and expectations and love- not sex and nudity and yelling and fighting are even considered.  Keep it coming and thank you Prime for making this free for me!!!
159463176X|5.0|Great and quick service and I am a happy customer. All was as I expected it and I enjoy it.
B00000DCH9|5.0|What can I say about this album that I'm sure hasn't already been said. Tracks such as Piano Man and The Ballad Of Billy The Kid remind me constantly of the great storytelling ability that one of the greatest musicians of our time has and will continue to have. Classic as well as timeless!!
1594488886|5.0|Great and quick service and I am a happy customer. All was as I expected it and I enjoy it.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|It is such a heart warming story about hard times and good times these two girls went through  in there time frame and as the story is being told how it effect  someone in a different time.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I typically play only the classic Klondike version of solitaire. I also typically play the one card turn instead of the three card turn. I enjoy the game. The graphics are nice and the app always works. I've never had it freeze or not work. You can change the pattern on the back of the cards and also the background.
