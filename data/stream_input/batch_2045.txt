B001NHNG64|5.0|Unpredictable and well written.  I just recently started reading Lee Child and have discovered a new favorite.  Very pleasantly surprised.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|how could anyone make kinky sex this boring!!! Actually I couldn't get far enough in to get to the kinky sex because it was so boring, maybe if I read further I would have given it five stars.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Is this movie Oscar material? No. But it is just a lot, lot, lot of fun. I've watched the ending at least 10 times now, just because it makes me happy.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I love this show and the fact I got a great deal is even better. it came packaged well and was not damaged. so I'm happy!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Provocative title. An easy read. The medical part was more interesting to me than the near death experience (NDE) part.  The 'proof of heaven' is not so much in the author's NDE. The 'proof of heaven' is in his recovery from an unprecedented extremely serious disease.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|this was a gift and I bought many for friends and family at their request....they and I are Buble fans..
0307454541|5.0|I could not wait to pick up the book every time.  This was an easy read & wonderfully written.  Suspenseful & consuming.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Just loved his duets, such a variety of singers and he blends with all of them, still the old master.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is great.  I recommend this movie.  Blah blah blah blah.  This is a review.  Blah blah blah.  Blah.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this book under so many recommendations and after hearing it was one of the best books ever read. I admit that I was somewhat disappointed in the book. Is not really intellectually challenging at all. If Kinky is what you're looking for, then I guess is the book for you, but I kept skipping the sex scenes because it  just got old. I will probably be reading the second and third book, only because I hate not completing book series.
B000M341QE|5.0|I love Jack Nicholson as a dirty old criminal.  This is a great date night movie with the man in your life...  if you don't mind violence & hookers snorting coke & cussing.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Most of the songs on this albums are chill and you can expect the same sound throughout. Good if you're in the mood for one type of music.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Warhorse is a very moving movie and worth the money I spent to get it. I already had seeing it and I liked it so much I wandered to buy
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train has done it again! Almost every song on this album is great! My favorite song on this album thus far is &#34;You Already Know.&#34;
0811879542|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves this book! It's interactive and fun to read! He really believes that when he does what the book tells him to, the dots really change!
B009TZBEKW|3.0|Most of the songs on this album are okay, however the ones that are awesome I so great that it overrides the rest of the okay songs. Overall it is a good dance album and has good beats.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The writing style is easy and comfortable. The story line is believable and doesn't go off on wild tangents. No part of the story goes untold. Really enjoyed it.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Might be the most perfect LP ever, for a 1972 LP, still has a high level of sales.  Wish you were here.
B00AG4NSY0|5.0|This is the 3rd album I have downloaded from Glee and I'm sure won't be the last.  I love everything they sing...those<br />young people are sooooo talented.  I absolutely love the show as they bring forth so many issues people deal with today.
B00138F52Q|5.0|Love this album.The musicianship shines through. I know I am in the minority but I prefer this &#34;pre-Steve Perry&#34; version of Journey.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Best deal I've ever gotten on games.  Each of games is amazing, and it all cost less than half what a typical big title does.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|If you want to see a good movie,get this one!It is very much entertaining and enjoyable.I am glad I ordered it.Thanks.Thelma
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Fun with variety...and free to boot.  How can you go wrong?  Some challenge but not too much.  Good time killer
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE this website! I could spend (waste) hours just scrolling through the ideas for the home and crafts! Amazing!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has really good graphics and beautiful horses. the reason for 4 stars is because its not as interactive as i thought it would be. ):
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I liked the book for the most part, it was a little hard getting started but once I was into the book further I didn't want to stop until I finished.
B008VBYN80|4.0|gameloft makes good this one is another fun game form them. not to cartoon like. not just build and gather resource. try it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|How can you go wrong with this classic movie?  A must watch for me every holiday season. A great family movie.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Amazing animation, great OST, likeable characters, good pacing, and is all around a great anime movie! I HIGHLY recommend Red Line!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I watch this movie every holiday season.  No matter how many times I have watched this, it makes me laugh all over again.  But I don't consider this a family movie, not suitable for young children.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A great app for free. It's fun to play and I always have to run again to top my score. It's a really good twist on the first one. Careful, though. Super addictive...
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Three Nations Trilogy<br /><br />Book 1- The luck of the Weissenstein by Christoph Fischer<br /><br />This book follows a young and hopelessly romantic girl from Bratislava who falls in love with a bookseller from Berlin. Her name is Greta Weissensteiner, and she is a daughter of a Jewish weaver, in times when war in Germany starts to make some serious impact in Europe. Her big problem becomes the political climate in the multicultural Czechoslovakia, and everything around her becomes more complex. Now she is not just a girl who fell in love with a boy. It is not that simple anymore, and everything she does now seriously affects relationship between the couple and their families.<br /><br />For the whole time reading this I kept thinking to myself that every single bit of this book is written as thou the writer has actually been there, when all of this was happening. I truly admire his work and ability to research everything in such details, and this is a true work of art. This book will give you and insight of what was actually going on with Jewish families in WW2, and how intolerance was at its worst then. I am not really an avid history fiction reader, but this book has not lost my attention for one second, and I truly can tell that I can't wait for book 2.<br /><br />Prepare yourself to embark on a journey filled with love, hope, hate, betrayal, intolerance, survival and abuse. Raw reality, an inside on how life was in WW2. And like it always is in real life there are death, sorrow and loss so keep your tissues close. This is a true work of art, and I can not congratulate Mr. Fischer more on creating this amazing work. Really looking forward on reading the rest of the series!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is one of my favorite series...the other is SONS OF ANARCHY.....it will be a sad day for me when both are off the air....
B00AESN8XY|5.0|its a good time passer and its just a lots and lots of endless hours of fun finding out what goes like what
B00005JMCT|3.0|i got it and put it in, but it was skipping.  i took it out thinking that it has some dust on it from getting shipped, so i cleaned it.  come to find out, there were some scratches on the back of the disk.  i dont have a printer so i cant print out anything to have it shipped back so i could get one that doesnt have any scratches on the back of it.  i was looking forward to watching it too.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun I enjoy it yes yes I do you should get it the only thing I do not like is that I have to post to Facebook to get points.
B00005LKHW|4.0|this one is fine.  i watched it.  there were no scratches on it or anything.  i got it on a reasonable day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The variety of different types of games this app provides is both unique and a great way to pass the time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was super exiceted about temple run 2 on my kindle fire but it keeps glitching and now I can't even get it to open I hope there's an update to fix that soon cause I am on level 6 and don't want to delete it and loose my progress
B00785P2QC|5.0|I absolutely love this game BUT i dont like when it buggs u to post it on Facebook Twitter ect.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses. and I love this game. the bolts go up in time. any game that I can play without spending money gets 5 stars from me.
B0076DELIG|3.0|A worthwhile entertaining read as usual with this master of the genre. The plot is so improbable it was probably based on fact.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is amongst my few favorites, and is a great source of entertainment. This app is fun, and you can past through levels fairly quickly. Flow is a great app I haven't regret purchasing this app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|simple premise but quite fun to play.  smaller boards are easy enough for my 6 year old. larger boards are challenging enough for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very different from the original Temple Run. Anyone who loves the first original app will love Temple Run 2 because it has new places to run like sliding down rope and riding a mine cart. My kids love it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much better I feel since losing the wheat in my diet. I work in healthcare, so I get \\"it\\", but I was feeling lousy - no energy, brain fog, very unhappy belly, weight gain despite watching, depression, edema, arthritis in joints that had been repetitively injured in my youth. If this was what middle age was all about, I was pretty much done with it. By day 3 off of wheat, my energy was back to what I thought should be normal for my age, the brain fog was lifting, and the perpetual bloating and unhappy belly was going fast. Day 3 and I was no longer hobbling out of bed every morning due to the arthritic changes in my ankles. And I am a skeptic. I hear about all of the fads, I read and research, and realize most are just fads and not worth my time. This, this is truly worth the effort. I am almost a month into losing the wheat, and although difficult at times, the difference in the way I feel is worth the effort. This book, its evidence based approach, and its helpful insight has truly made a difference in my life. I feel wonderful for the first time in about 2-3 years!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|My favorite music app, period!  This app is heaven when it comes to finding stations with specific genres.  From ESPN to music, this is my primary app running when listening to music on my smartphone.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Although this book has some drawbacks, it overall, is an engaging story about a young woman who overcomes her past...step by step, in bits and pieces.  At times, I tired of her relentless &#34;pushing away&#34; of everything good that came to her, but over all I always love a story of the triumph of the human spirit
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new items and amazing graphics.its free and in my opinion better than subway surfers .just wish it didn't have evereybodys top score just facebook maybe
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Continues to be the best soap opera ever. Love it and the acting is far and away superior to most shows.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run its fun  but hard to pass I have no problems with it yet but an advertisement does pop up here and there but otherwise is addictive.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|Why pay 1.99 per episode when you can get it on PBS for free. Go to pbs.org and watch. It's that easy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like these game and i hope there will be more traveling! Also these is the only app that keeps me bissy  wen I'm board,
B006I1OB0U|1.0|I already have a copy of Downton abbey season 2. I do not need a copy of downton abbey christmas special. I am requesting a refund on the downton abbey chritmas special.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Tragically lovely. I'd read this a thousand times and never get old of this story. I've never been so enlightened by a book before.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I really love bubble shoot games (I'm not an Angry Birds fan and prefer this type). This one is okay, but it's different than most. The goal for this one is not to simply clear the screen, but to gain more bubbles as you clear the screen.<br /><br />I'm not sure I agree with its shots. *Almost* always I can get between two bubbles to shoot the ones just above them, so long as it's not important to do so. If I *need* to get between two to bring down a large number of bubbles, it won't go through. This seems obviously fixed. Additionally, if you avoid a matched set of bubbles it will continuously give you that color bubble over and over and over again, but that never happens with colors I do need.<br /><br />I am a busy person and hate timed games, this one is thankfully not timed. I never can understand why we are forced for timed games. Those are a 'delete the game' for me. Not everyone has nothing to do but play games.<br /><br />It works fine on Kindle Fire EXCEPT that it's Save and Exit doesn't work properly. You have to either bring up the bottom Kindle Menu OR the top Settings Menu, then return to it and the Save and Exit will come up. Not sure about that glitch.<br /><br />Finally, I don't like that there is no level system, but I suppose that's because the goal is gaining bubbles. Still, it feels like I'm just in an infinite loops of going back to the beginning over and over and over again.<br /><br />All in all, I'll play it, but I don't particularly care about it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome. if you have played temple run you will love this ! it is much more fun than temple run # 1
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Amusing story suitable for all ages.  This is not as cutting edge as Wall-E or Cars but is a solid entry well worth viewing if you enjoy this genre.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like the book but will  there  be another one because I am looking forward to another one that is  cool
B000002IMG|5.0|This album/ Cd is an all time metal great. I believe it to be vastly underrated. I rank it somewhere in the top 10 metal albums of all time.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Gave a great insight into the life one branch that helps protect our country by meeting the enemy on their shores
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this move and so do my grand kids, they watch it over and over. So if you have grand kids they will love this move.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The stories are what make this book. I was constantly amazed by what there is a market for out in the world (the map makers? who knew people would clamor for those). This books provides just the right amount of guidance plus engaging stories that make you feel like you can go out their and start a business. You just need a good idea that there is a market for. I also like that Chris didn't make it seem easy. Starting a business is a struggle. Many people still work a day job while getting their business up and running. While others were laid-off, and had to find a creative way to make a new start.
B007L4HFDI|5.0|Actually, I'm going to be biased purposely, because \\"Spidey\\" has provided many of us lots of Comic Book entertainment throughout the years, and Sam Raimi (aside from the goofey-ness) churned out a wonderful blend of special effects, character building, and story-telling! The only thing better, is getting to enjoy SPIDERMAN 2 on Bluray while sipping your favorite drink, and some delicious Popcorn, or whatever you like...  --GBJ
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I look Forward to each new episode. It is a very interesting look into the the world inside those mansions and how the staff perceived their roles. It has both serious and amusing portions worked into the series and definitely holds ones attention.
B008NC1LJ6|5.0|Sophisticated story-telling, encompassing several subjects, their lives, and circumstances is not an easy cinematic feat to accomplish inside of 120 minutes, though \\"360\\" manages in smooth, easy, dramatic fashion.<br /><br />Serendipity, and Irony intermixed with a bit of mystery, panache, and sex in the hands of a skilled Director, and an All-Star Cast of A-List professional Thespians produces texture woven of soft, and hard tones, controversial lifestyles, haunting issues, near misses, and casual suspense to provide a measure of meaningful entertainment, that will make you think while you're watching it...  --GBJ
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie keeps you entertained from start to finish. I was laughing non-stop. Well worth the rental price and the 48hr rental time is perfect.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It A great game woth nice features everybody love this only thing i dont like is the ad keep coming up that it
B009GIPDQS|5.0|It's the more devious, surprising story of a smart man who gets even smarter once he spends five years honing his skills as a jailhouse lawyer -- and then expertly concocts an ingenious revenge scheme. I brilliant novel by Mr Grisham.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. Awesome graphics. Very realistic. Although I do wish we could customize our character. All in all I recommend this game.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Its good but, could be up to date better! You have to hunt a little for what you might be looking for!
0131103628|5.0|I'd say this is the book to own if you want to start working with c.  It may be a bit outdated at this time but it's still useful and to the point.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok, I am not a prude and I enjoy a little spice in my romances but no one hits me but once. I don't enjoy reading about getting or recieving pain during love making but whats worse I got the feeling neither did Ana. She only did it to keep him. Not my idea of a &#34;relationship&#34;. Wont be reading the rest of the trilogy.
1593272200|5.0|Huge book that I haven't read but makes me look intelligent having it sit on my shelf.  Three more words!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It has nice graphics and you can at least ride the horse this is a great game for horse lovers
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a fun game to play but after you've gotten to level 64 it restarts you to the beginning.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Author writes beautifully. Story is amazing and heartfelt. A must read. I've recently read Sarah's Key and it too kept me turning the pages to reach the end of the story...and wanting more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! you treat and care for your horse. then you enter him/her in the compotitions. I highly reccomend this game!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Although there are certain parts of the movie that don't make sense, over all it was worth the suspension of disbelief in favor of being immersed in the world and just enjoying the ride.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Elcelente procesador y ademas con una potente grafica integrada corre juegos de manera fluida y sin ralentizaciones.<br />la unica recomendacion es comprar un disipador mejor por que el que trae no le permitira sacarle todos los beneficios del procesador y la grafica.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Because the first time I only caught the end of the movie, at first I didn't realise that I'd seen it already. That notwithstanding, it was still an enjoyable experience on second viewing. Casting of Liam Neeson in the type of role here was a little unusual given his past casted roles, but spectacular action scenes and good use of martial arts and swordwork.
B001EN71DQ|3.0|I grew up with the original 3 star wars and though these were fun to watch, I wasn't super excited like I get with the originals
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Not up to the quality of the original Bourne series and without what made the first movie unique. As a scientist, I can only tolerate so much of biology being butchered for the sake of a movie, but this one pushed it too far, even for gene-therapy applications. Action sequences were ok, but plot was very predictable and characters very 2-dimensional.
B00011CZQU|4.0|The 2nd installment of the Blade series is my favorite and I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere but here.
B00A77II0U|5.0|If you like mysteries then this is definitely the game for you. Great story line and awesome graphics. Many surprises throughout the game.
B001HN697M|4.0|Great movie and a good finish to the series.  As a big fan of the first two movies I like how this one rounded out the Lucien background story.  I am a big fan of werewolf and vampire movies and this whole series was just right up my alley.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because you get to groom; feed; give treats; compete; train and much more!! you should download it so you can experience the fun
B004S49YEM|4.0|The eye of the needle kept me riveted to my kindle, how they caught spies in the 1940's was intriguing without all our present day gadgets and methods of communication...good read
B0067R0APK|5.0|its the best weather app I have found. I have it on my computers and this is better because I cane take it with me.  wellndone. keep working and I bet it will get even better in the future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Feeling under the weather I grabbed my daughter's Kindle. I'd watched Hunger games bot didn't read the book. Halfway through it I thought I'm reading the next one. So I bought it and never put it down, though I was sick I went on an adventure of a lifetime. Suzanne Collins has the technique to make you want to care and know every character in the book. And that I did. My vision of them in thus arena is amazing it will be interesting to see it put on the big screen. No way it can do justice to her beautiful writing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its an epic game with beasts,obctales and zipppp lines and other stuff really legit other stuff and its better then the oragnal temple run
B003O86FMW|5.0|Simply amazing! First time I ever read a book in two days and didn't want to finish because I didn't want it to end.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Contrary to the description my lifeproof case charging door does not allow insertion of this charger.  I will order the cable version and see if it works.
B001P59V5Y|5.0|You must have an open mind to like this movie but if you do, its hilarious.  Life of Brian is one of my all time favorite comedies.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I liked it.  It was fun at least partly because I enjoy computer books.  It's not great literature, but I enjoyed the ride, and that's what I ask of a book.
0765325950|1.0|Very sad that I can't get this as a kindle edition; I would have gladly paid the same price for an ebook version as for the hardcover but there is no way I'm carrying around a book this big in my bag ever again. Oh well.
8866130931|5.0|I use the right page for check lists and notes. It is the bomb. I buy one every year.  I have used this all over the world.  The pages lay nicely, the paper is high quality.  I l-l-love it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I started watching it and couldn't stop I love this show! The characters are hilarious, and are guaranteed to remind you of someone you know.
0765325950|5.0|For all of the loose end that were made in this series, Sanderson does an awesome job wrapping up the story.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Can't stop playing the album and 10 tracks is too little for me i needed more bruno but each song was beautifully crafted i recommend this album for everyone becasue not only is locked out of heaven the only tune that will stick in you head
B001BKVWYG|5.0|All I can say is how did I miss this? 56 years old, and should have know about this! The music is expressive and evocative of my growing up years, but the music here is timeless, and the lyrics, really poetic, apply now more than ever. After so many years on the planet, and seeing what I have seen, I admire how beautifully and simply Rodriguez captures what he sees of humanness, and hands it to the listener without pretense. The music weds so well with the lyrics that I remain haunted by his impressions of life in his songs. I wonder how my perspective might have differed had I listened to these songs as a young adult, without the benefit of direct experience in life. Perhaps more jaded. But hearing them now was raw and heartbreaking. Some of the saddest choices in life are best articulated romantically, and Rodriguez has given these realities and consequences the high road treatment. So grateful to have his impressions in my heart and mind.
B0091LS07E|5.0|So beautiful and empowering i loved her vocals in every track and every melody there isnt a single disappointing song i loved brand new me and these tears always win, which by the way was co written by bruno mars. Alicia stricks again with another powerful album
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I watched this last night with my DH; both in our mid 50s.  This film is a real treat, and not to be missed. We found ourselves going back online to find out more about the artist and his life. This film struck me as a jolting reality of what we all live with every day. Our humility and love keeps us sane, and keeps our truth in line with timeless principles. The film touched me deeply for how Rodriguez has chosen to live his life. He makes it easier to come to terms with our own humanity, and to accept who we are with dignity and grace. I hope that with the attention that his work is getting, that he will consider penning more of his impressions to music, because I for one, would like to hear what he has to say.<br />I thought the film was cleverly adapted to tell a story, but did not insult us as viewers. The director brought us along a timeline that was wrought honestly, and left the viewer space to think out what might not have been covered. I hope this acclaim leaves Rodriquez with the privacy that he deserves, but with supportive resources from a world that is hopefully more mature and reflective than when I was a young adult. And more willing to listen to what he still might have to say.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|I simply love this movie.  I consider it a good old-fashioned love story.  It justly portrays how the beauty of a true love between two people can sustain and encourage throughout a lifetime no matter what their life challenges are. The acting was very good in the movie, too.  I will probably watch this movie many more times!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I love the way the author write, I get the feeling that it is her life. She present the gay issues exactly like we live it twenty years ago and we are still experience some of it today
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The Good : fun game play, free power ups, fun hidden levels. The game play when from easy to Difficult. You can turn off the ads. They give you extra power-ups. New outfits, New birds, and New difficult.<br /><br />The Bad : You always feel pressured to buy more power-ups. The build-in ads, lack of guild, and getting stuck in a level, without power-ups make you want to delete the game.  I found working with the gravity wells, were really hard to deal with, and bad to play in a car or bus. You will be doing the level a millions time!<br /><br />Overall : A great game, fun and difficult. I won't replay it, after getting my three stars. But it's good way to kill time.
0385535147|5.0|Another great novel by John Grisham. Very riveting. I finished it in one day. I just couldn't put it down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually don't read the YA books but I heard enough about this book to pique my interest.  It is a great read.  Although the subject matter is quite sad, the book itself is uplifting. I know, kids with cancer could so easily have been a real downer  but Green handled it by making the main characters so very likable.  You root for these kids and their parents to keep on keeping on.  There is humor everywhere in this book and enough surprises to make it interesting.  I really loved the story line, the main players as well as the minor ones. We are reading it for my book club and I although I just finished it I am looking forward to giving it another quick read.  Bravo Mr. Green!
B000062V9C|1.0|The movie did not play at all. It was total waste of money and I will return it. Don't buy this one
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|While Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job in this move Ted steals the show with his antics, humor, and sarcasm.  A must see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game in 2013 already. I'M so happy that I'm so good at this game. I'm ranked in the top 2 percent in the world<br /> #BestTempleRunEver
B00920HMNM|5.0|the new guitarist of donald fagen is excellent and the new songs are incredible.......you like donald fagen or steely dan you'll love this new cd......the lyrycs and the arrengements is excellent
B0074QGGK6|3.0|but once you start reading you realize that no matter how valuable it can be the experience that the author had there is not much content
B007712XAU|5.0|Doesn't take much explanation here.  This is a wonderful story and character driven series.  Maggie Smith is outstanding.  Don't miss
B002BVOYBW|5.0|Definately one of my favorite movies. Johnny Depp plays the role of Sam perfectly. Would recommend this as a must see movie
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book is very suspenseful yet predictable. Its lacking romance, and is dissapointing compared to Spark´s other books. I found myself craving more of the love story and less of Katies personal story. It just felt like there was a piece missing. However, the twist at the end was very cool.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I think The Big Bang Theory is just about the best half hour sit com ever. Dreading the day it ever goes off the air
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has everything you could possibly want to study God's word.I love all the many translations it has and many languages are present as well.Each day as a scripture verse to start the day and many devotions are available as well as many daily Bible studies! The You Version staff and volunteers are exceptionally helpful and encouraging to keep you on the path of being in the Word.Many thanks to all of them for this app.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Excellent movie, great sets, wonderful characters.  Do NOT compare this original movie to the abomination remake.  THIS is the movie to watch!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on my phone and my IPad.It's a lot of fun and you can play it anywhere.I would recommend it to everyone
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I havent bought an album since the 70's that didnt have some stinker songs.  Not this album!  ALL of them are well written, well sung (excellent enunciation, take lessons Adelle!) and all touch your heart or your emotions.  I cant recommend this album enough!
B000SEI230|5.0|Excellent!!!<br />A must read!  So uplifting and proof of God's love for us all!  There is no better reflection of how cruel people can be to someone of faith!
B0091LS07E|4.0|The gf liked it.  Bought for her as a present.  She loves it.  So,i would say its a good cd.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a lot more fun than temple run 1 .... more things to do and interesting... spent three hours playing yesterday
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Loved this movie and all the research that went into it.  Bring on more about<br />the man, the history etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I could spend hours on Pinterest! There is so much information offered all in one place. I can find great recipes to places I would like to visit.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author is so vivid in describing everything! From the details of each character to the landscape and scenery. Nothing is dragged on for too long, and everything is perfectly timed and placed.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I felt it was very insightful and helped me understand myself and others I work with. It's also a good read.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is fun and I enjoy playing it. This game is addicting and is a cheap price for the Kindle.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Eternity warriors has a lot of game play and action, but I would like a little more story. But the rest of the game is well made and is really worth it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love, love, love, love it! Couldn't put it down, finished in a day! Can't wait for more books from Colleen Hoover!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Great Movie!! Very, very funny!! Great Date Movie. Wouldn't recommend for kids to watch, there's a lot of adult humor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down! Love all 3 of her books and I can't wait for more from her!
0307275639|5.0|Purchased this book for my entire staff at work as a team building and motivational activity. This book has a great message and is a wonderful gift for others.
1609611543|5.0|The book is put together in a well done & educational manner and is easy to understand. Extremely well pleased with it.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|It's not what I was expecting. The graphics are pretty awful and remind me of when Android first came out.<br /><br />I guess it's fun, but it's not the same movable block game I'm used to which is what makes me not like it.
0307895475|5.0|Skyrim the game is rich in detail and playability, and this guide is a worthy companion to the game.  With the revised and expanded edition including the Dawnguard and Hearthfire DLCs any aspect of the game is at your fingerprints.<br /><br />If Prima decides to print a hard copy revision of the Skyrim guide after Dragonborn is released I will have to consider getting that as well.
B00009R86L|5.0|While the pad works very well, the white color of the pad sticks out and keeps this from looking business like.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|We loved it all three where great movies!!!!!!!!!!!!  We love having them to watch any time!!!!!!!!  The quality was great!!
B001FB55H6|5.0|This is bt far one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended and well worth the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From start to finish this book gets you. I've never laughed and cried so much reading one book in my life! I loved the sarcasm and tenacious personality of Sky and how Holder keeps up with her always. Awesome writing. Loved it and will recommend to others!
B001FB55I0|4.0|Many people bagged on this movie but I love it. I love how we get to see the early days of the war with a young John Conner struggling with the role he knows he has. I also like how we see the evolution of the terminators to the one we are familiar with from the first movie. Also there are grand scenes with a gritty feel and creepy music that all blend perfectly. McG did a great job there. I would love if they did another and brought back Bale in the role. 4.5 out of 5.
0788859544|5.0|I was so glad to find this DVD for a great price after an old VHS had broken. My little one Loves this treasured Disney movie.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|I haven't cared for Deftones since White pony but this cd is pretty good. Worth the money and time listening.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Awesome! I don't have to go to the desktop to check my Facebook.  It doesn't always show everything, but thats ok.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Is what I say concerning this series. It is amazing what is in this world and how it looks and this series really does a great job ob showing us planet earth.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|light weight and easy to use. Only Con I can see is when it is in the case is open in the propped up position the entire unit will tilt to one side if you do not allow the clasp to extend in front of the device.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This is how I envision the down fall of the Roman empire.  I loved watching it fall, along with their clothes.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Not well written, but had a good story line.  I would read more from Christina McKenna.  Good look at rural life
B00110K62U|5.0|I love collector's editions when i buy movie, etc.  It's informing to see how productions are put together. Ideas flurish, too.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This is great fun for kids of all ages.  As an adult I use it to waste time while waiting on someone.  It was quick to understand and use right out of the gate.  I think young kids would have fun also as the mouse is crazy when he gets the cheese.  Would like to see more info on how to get all three stars.  Once I got to level 6 I had problems with the two gates and getting all the starts.  It does not kill your battery by running when not in use.  Also does not text you at all hours of the day and night like &#34;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader&#34; to play.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Magnificent! I could NOT be more pleased with this purchase.  I now have a couple versions and this is probably the best for me.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Got a message while I was doing something completely different that interest had become corrupted and needed to be uninstalled immediately.  Have no idea what happened, but will not be reinstalling.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Absolutely a must, if you even liked The Phantom of the Opera.  The follow up was important to me because I wanted the story to go on and particularly, the music.  I was not disappointed.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I enjoyed the character development and relationships. It was a surprising location for the story. We enjoyed the local color and culture of India.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A very good heart warming movie.  i love it and have always enjoy seeing again.  that's why i own it.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I had seen excerpts from this album on PBS.  Hearing all the artists is wonderful. Tony brings out the best in the performances.
B001UEBHYS|4.0|This movie is about an  18 year old from the slums where we meet Jamal Malik, a chai wallah  at an Indian based call center, he's in the hot seat on the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. As his winnings pile up the show's host, Prem  Kumar , seems quite skeptical over the fact this  teen is answering so many questions correctly. He's now just one question away from winning 20 million rupees and Kumar doesn't understand how this kid from the slums is pulling it off. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Jamal's hard life in the slums with his older brother, how he lost his mother at a young age, and about the girl he's always believed he's meant to be with  the beautiful Latika. Because each question relates to a specific chapter in his past  from dealing with gangs to a run in with a ruthless gangster  Jamal's life experience prepared him to win on this game show. It's as if he's fated to be on Millionaire.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that shows that anything is possible no matter where you come from and have to deal with in life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. Makes me really wish I had my own horse even more. Fun times 10, &amp; an awesome way to kill time
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the adapation and can't wait for part 2.<br /><br />The animation stays true to the drawn style of the graphic novel doesn't get as abstract or grotesque.
B009RH973I|5.0|Love my cover and the pink is bright. stand is great when watching videos.  and the elastic closure keeps it tight and safe for travel or storage
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I have not read these books, but I have heard my 10 year old reading portions of them to my 7 year old, and now they are both reading them.  The most important thing is when they read these books all I can hear is plenty of laughter.<br /><br />These books are entertaining enough it encourages kids to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kinda hard but i like it i hope you enjoy it too it's much better than temple run one yes yes
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham does it again.  All of his books are awesome.  I can finish one of his book in a few days.  Couldn't put this one down,Story line kept me in suspense, but was slighly unrealistic at parts,  But aside from that, would highly recommend this.  Worth the price.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables Surprised me. I DID NOT expect to Like this movie because I DO NOT like musicals. I dont know why but for some reason, i find musicals to be boring and uninteresting. But After 158 minutes of the musical numbers this movie gave the audience, I was blown away completely. Hugh Jackman Portrays Jean Valjean (who is a rags to riches type of character) and he gives us a oscar worthy performance. Anne Hathaway won the 2013 Best Supporting Actress Oscar and rightfully so. My god, she was Amazing as Fantine (her character will cause you to shed a few tears). The other supporting cast which consists of: Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, and  Russell Crowe all did wonderful jobs in this movie. But I do want to point out two other details. One, there is another supporting cast member who goes by the name of Samantha Barks(she plays Eponnie in the movie) did a really great job; I honestly feel her performance was overlooked/underrated. Two, Russell Crowe's performance was heavily criticized by audiences and critics alike but personally, he was my favorite character in the movie. The Scenes he and Hugh Jackman share are really memorable. The story line is set in the 19th century of France and I will say the atmosphere, the set pieces, the grand scale, the whole nine yards of this movie are insanely terrific. You DO actually feel you are in France during these times. As for the movie itself, well, it just proved that even I now like and have a new appreciation for the musical movie genre. I will always be a fan of this movie which (does not have a lot of dialogue) but is guaranteed to leave an profound impact on anyone. Watch this movie and I promise you will not regret it. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Les Miserables is Spectacular.<br /><br />5 Stars
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I loved the music, but the<br />cd is defective.  It makes a terrible noise and skips.  I am very disappointed with this CD.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Addictive games. Great for relaxing while listening to good music. I highly recommend this app. I especially like the fact that I win most of the time.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I really like this game.  I can even get Bernese Mountain Dog cards.  The pop-ups are horrible though.  Half the time they are singles sites and very annoying.
B00969GFFU|5.0|People who fancy themselves literary auteurs seem to have it in for this book for reasons other than its actual viability as a great read, or they have a proclivity for unnecessarily overanalyzing it; perhaps toward the end of finding something wrong with it given its initial heralding.<br /><br />I loved The Corrections; I love this.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is so much fun.  You have to buy hints, five for one dollar.  I thought that was crazy, but you don't have to have them.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Being in the industry, I found this journey to reflect that of many friends. Though from the outsiders, the culinary world depicted may seem extreme, but forget the sideline action and just enjoy the food.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Took me until about half way through the first book to get literally GLUED to this great love story. Wonderfully written....only a woman could write with such wonderful description of emotion, sexual thought and response....enjoyed it immensely....hate it had to end! :) ....now, onto my search for my own Christian Grey! :oD
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun but on day 3 of playing I already forked over 10 bucks. If you're not cool with doing that you should probably find another game. This one cost money to get anywhere.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|My son recommended this movie to me when I told him I had just watched the chamber. American history was much more street level, gritty, suspenseful and entertaining.  Strong well done performances,  nice photography.
0882709194|5.0|The introductory chapter highlights how scientific discoveries in the last 150 years, especially in the last 50 years in the area of mircobiology are presenting challenges to the traditional view of how species have evolved.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I liked this season. I was skeptical at first but then I watched it. The season doesn't get really good until episode 4 so just give it a chance.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved this story, although there was more violence than I care for. It's unusual to find book this entertaining.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|It's like a 3 hour movie full of cliches you were already tired of 10 years ago, where humans are evil just for existing, and the military is especially evil, and the perfect holy pure infallible blue space cat people are perfect and pure and great at everything, and it just goes on like that for hours, and at they end they use bows and arrows to destroy insanely advanced ultra powerful military technology.  The movie is basically calling you an idiot at that point.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The case is really nice and functional. It does revolve and or spin around as stated, which is a nice feature for different viewing! The case is really well made  and quite attractive, has a soft feel to it. I would definitely recommend this case for the Kindle HD 8.9 inch....and by the way, the purple is really pretty!
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|A movie about Scottish heroin addicts running through life, screwing up.  Extremely entertaining and watchable, funny, intense, basically everything a classic movie is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new features on this app! The zip line is a cool new feature, and I really like the mine/mine cart!
0780624890|5.0|This is the reason why comic book movies are gigantic.  Well this and Iron Man of course, and Dark Knight OKAY WHATEVER, but this is really where it started, because this is a fun over the top high action movie.  It's got a black main hero, he's a vampire who kills vampires in big showy action scenes with the techno and plenty of KICKING and all that kinda stuff.  It has a ridiculous almost nonsensical ending one liner.  The hero is a great gritty kinda action hero.  Really good swearing.  Huge amounts of vampire head explosion gore, that's always fun.  I guess technically this movie was a little ripping off of The Matrix, but to be honest I think this movie is actually better than The Matrix (and especially the godawful sequels).  Just because this movie is so much less pretentious about being a violent action flick, therefore this movie has way more fun with it.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|These books are great, and I like saving some money by buying a bundle of them.  My problem is after I bought this 4-book package, I found amazon was also selling a FIVE BOOK package for about the same price.  I didn't realize there were more than four books in the series when I purchased this ... shame on me for not doing my homework.  Regardless, don't buy this ... get the five-book bundle instead.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|fun and it helps to improve visual perception skills. I love the great colors used. Challenging but you can also be successful.
030746363X|4.0|It is on the list of books to read.  I skimmed through it and can't rate it because I have no idea what it involves
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started the book and loved it and ended up buying the next two and spent my weekend cozy on the couch reading!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Now I can't wait to read the second one in this thrilling trilogy.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Chose this book based on Amazon's &#34;top pick&#34; list and loved it.  The characters and story line are complex and draw you in from the first few pages.  Some might be quick to categorize this as typical Brit chick-lit (not that there's anything wrong with that), but to do so would be a great disservice to this book.  Thought provoking, passionate, realistic...everything you look for in a great book...read it now!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I don't like a lot of match three games but I do like this one.  It has good graphics the fish are cute and you can create your own aquarium.  It is the next best thing to having your own real life version without all the hastle of cleaning the tank.  I have every version of this game for my laptop including the collector's edition.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I tried to use this on my 64GB Kindle Fire and I got nowhere.  Its a good idea, but all file folders were empty even though I have tons of items loaded.  Im not sure if its my bad kindle fire or the application is bad.  Regardless, the trouble started the day I downloaded this application.  I would advise everyone to NOT use this application.  I have found many apps that work for android phones that have trouble with the Kindle Fire HD 64GB.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun game to play, very addicting. It is a great pass time.  I only give it four stars because when I fall after Ive made it a good pace, its puts me back at the beginning! But still good game!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote is awesome especially for GTD (getting things done).  definitely download if your looking for productivity.  easy to use from any device
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I use it to balance my check book.  It stays lit up longer than my android phone! Makes it so much easier to keep on going!  I absolutely love that its free!
1587613379|5.0|No matter what you're looking to discover about yourself, this book has insights for all. I've recommended it to all my friends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I bought this book, I worried it might be too girly.<br /><br />As it turns out, it was, but not in the usual \\"twilight\\" kind of way; it's characters turned out to be incredibly realistic, each with very real and serious concerns about very real aspects of their lives<br /> and what some people in their condition go through.<br /><br />I can foresee I will be revisiting this book in the future.
B009HEMF1M|4.0|I loved all the actors in this movie and you can tell that they all had a pretty good chemistry between one another
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My friend played it and recommended it to me. I love playing it! It's like actually having a competitive horse. I've already recommended it to all my family an  friends. Keep it up! :)
B00B19DMUE|2.0|The best part of this movie is that it only ran 93 minutes.  After a reasonably good beginning the plot goes downhill, rambling all the way to a sloppily edited, predictable and eye-rolling ending.  The premise: a young girl becomes possessed by an evil spirit tucked away inside a strange wooden box that her father purchases for her at a yard sale.  Dad finally comes to the rescue, enlisting the son of a Hassidic Rabbi to exorcise the demon.  At the climax Dad pleads with the demon to leave his daughter and enter him.  Fans of 1973's The Exorcist will recall Father Karras intoning the demon to do the same thing.  That's not the only thing borrowed from The Exorcist, a film superior in every way to The Possession.<br /><br />If there is any horror to this movie, it is that you have to pay to view it.  Give it a miss.  There is much better fare out there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Greatest app I love this app and can't stop playing it at all every day of my life. Thank you .
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It does not work on my kindle. Says can't find location. Perhaps the kindle is at fault. Hate to waste time on things that don't work first time !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game, I compete with my friends all the time and its really addicting. I love this game, it's a very good game.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|My 18 year old son read this before I did and really liked it.  When the movie came out, I thought we might go see it so I decided to read the book first.  I thought it was a great book.  The story is compelling and very thought-provoking.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was an entertaining reading.  And slightly kinky...I enjoyed it and wondered about the author.  She must have quite the imagination
0307272702|5.0|this book has so much great advice and information. we just dont know what is making us sick unless we learn
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I believe this is the best ending to these 3 books.  I needed this book to explain the horrors of the first book...Ha.
B003AKLFAG|4.0|Almost all adjectives apply to some part of this vengeance film.  Brutal, unbelievable, repulsive, bloody, tender, overly dramatic, sick, humorous, disgusting, fascinating, sexual, entertaining, tasteless, repugnant et.al.  I am not very familiar with Korean culture and movies.  No doubt they influence the style of acting etc.  The acting at times seemed very hammy - somewhat like the old mustache pulling villains in a silent movie but with sound and cursing.  At other times it was moving.  I hear Spike Lee will do a remake of this story for release in America in 2013 with Josh Brolin in the lead.  I will have to see it out of irresistable curiousity if nothing else.  I can imagine that many in America will not welcome such a film after the Newtown tragedy - particularly if the bloodletting is anywhere near what it was in this film.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a story that everyone maybe should read.  I am glad that my life wasn''t like this but I am sure that some like the kinky ------.  It surely made one to keep reading to see how Mr. Grey came about this...Englightening
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the jingle always wakes me up. programming it is easy once you have done if a couple times.<br /><br />updated interface is wonderful. this program is a Must
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Keeping in mind that this was the pilot episode; I will say that I only found it to be OK.  I am hoping that as I watch two or three more episodes I will like it more.  But right now it doesn't hold a candle to &#34;Sherlock&#34; in my book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My Horse is exactly what it says. It is a horse that needs lots of care and feeding. You can also show your horse and compete with it. All the while earning points and gems so you can buy the basics for your horse.<br /><br />What I like is the graphics and the game is very addictive and relaxing.<br /><br />What I don't like is that you have to buy many of the items that are not basic items.<br /><br />Over all it is a great game and still deserve a five star.<br /><br />Update- I am beginning to really dislike this game. I can barely play because the whole screen is constantly switching t o advertisements. It is also almost impossible to earn gems and coins unless you plan on selling your life to this game. I am taking it from a five to a three.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I only wish I could down load all the videos! I keep watching for the new releases.  I think the one with Alex Boye is one of my favorites.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A very great show and it is always worth watching.  I can't wait to see the rest of the season.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I'd already seen the documentary, &#34;The September Issue&#34;, which is about Vogue Magazine and it's editor, Anna Wintour.  This gave me a richer understanding of &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; which is filled with excellent acting by all and was an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
0765325950|5.0|Can't say anything about it. It was perfect. It couldn't have ended any other way, in retrospect. I'm so glad to have had this series in my life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was really impressed with this. I've played a lot of games like this, but I think I've found my favorite. My horse's name is Cookie!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got the app on my kindle fire. I played it a few times but when I closed it then reopend it it would go back to my home page. The game itself is fine but I wouldn't get it on the kendle fire.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it wont turn on you get what you pay for right I got it for free seriously it sucks I hate it but it might work on your handheld device if it does it is a great game
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|not long enough. wish it was a lot longer. fun to play though. it had pretty good graphics for this kind of game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun (: since I can't have a real pony this will have to do. Not so fond of in app purchasing and there's a lot of it
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome game...really fun to play...recommend highly!!!  Tests thinking skills in s fun way....great if you like Perry.....must play to see...

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|great movie awesome acting , wanted a different ending ! but the ending was ok. it would really be good to see the other story line goes on thou
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really fun and is a great way to virtually care for an animal! will be playing this for hours on end
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so much fun! If you had the original than this one you shouldn't think twice about getting it!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|everything you hear about it is true. fun, addicting, good graphics, etc.  we have this game on all of our devices.
0307592731|4.0|This lady certainly has guts I could never summon.  The book is MAYBE a little too long.  After a while I got tired of reading about her package pick-ups (though the concept was interesting), the condition of her feet, and her quest for Snapple lemonade (but I'm sure it IS the little things that count when you have nothing!)  Still, the story IS compellng, no question. Really, give it a shot.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent insight to the mission and Seals. Enjoyed the descriptive training Seals go through.<br />Good for all ages and people interested in the military.
8866130915|5.0|best kind of agenda/organization tool i have found thus far. this is the third Moleskine planner i have purchased. sticking with this brand.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was an amazing book that has truly changed my ok on all of my relationship s (romantic and non romantic). I would definitely and already have recommended it to family and friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the clear graphics and the fact that you dont have to buy anything to actually play and enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it wont load when I want it too but its a really cool game with great graphics and I would regimens it
B005WUHAX8|1.0|RETURNING.....The sound quality was terrible!  Could not hear conversations, too much static and muffled voices.  Definitely not a phone case that I can encourage others to purchase.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I bought this for my Husband to read after he heard about it from a friend.  He truly enjoyed it.  It is a fast read too.  I am going to read it next.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is great for making funny and/or beautiful pictures. It is simple and does what it is supposed to do. It has many options. I recommend this app!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was hard to wade through. It did get better in the later chapters but if this had been one of the free books offered, I would never have finished it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Waiting for the next big thing. This app similar  to the mobile version. It works a little better on my computer. Would like a filter that would eliminate poems, words of advise and other tiring words of wisdom without blocking individuals.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|very addicting game! gives you hours of entertainment trying to improve your own personal aquarium. I would definitely recommended this game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I enjoy this app equally to the app on my computer. The app for my phone does not give me the ability to see or have the function of searching a particular page. When it comes to searching pages on ebay, a tablet is much better medium than a phone. Size does matter.
143350393X|5.0|Super supplement to your day to day bible. There is a lot of information and insight to God's inspired words. It is too large/heavy too carry around.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a app I use everyday. I travel with my job and need to be kept abreast of weather conditions at all times. I like the hour by hour updates along with the alerts. I have found I am warned about before local weather in most markets around the country.

B003BW0CB6|5.0|Connelly has written one of his best!  Bosch and Haller  make it a real treat!  Best of the Lincoln Lawyer series!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|An amazing story and an amazing woman. Jaycee takes us through the experience from the beginning to the present. She shows us how not to let the past determine our future. Truly inspiring.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I liked this book more than the hunger games and I loved the hunger games! And did I say like this book I meant love it. I would recommend it to any hunger games fan or anyone who like action packed on your feet books! Thank you James Dashner!!!!!!
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|great graphics, music is kinda goofy but its all fun!! Would like a choice of different music tracks or a shuffle mode might be nice.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what it could be like to experience an all out nuclear war, this is it. Although the movie is just a perspective of what &#34;could&#34; happen, it is eye opening nonetheless.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Bought this movie for my gf. She watches it like 3 times a week. She was very happy and hey, i earned some major brownie points! Fast shipping, item arrived as detailed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is another great Campus thriller !<br />Well worth it for Jack Ryan fans.<br />Don't miss this great Clancy book.

B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|We liked the movie. It's an interesting dystopian premise, and Christian Bale is good. Be sure to check the speed of your internet connection. We ordered it in HD, and about 10 minutes in, it reverted to a pixelly SD because our connection apparently isn't fast enough. Of course, we still paid the HD price, though. Too bad the price you pay doesn't revert to the SD price automatically to match the quality you end up streaming.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Wow, I don't even know where to begin with this one. There was some really good stuff here, and some really bad.<br /><br />** SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />I loved that this one seems to have more of a plot to it than the previous two. There was much more than just conversations, sex and inner dialogue.<br /><br />There were twists and turns in this one that I didn't see coming, and some really great planning on the author's part. (in particular, the cellphone at the bank)<br /><br />I was pleased to see that Christian opened up more, and showed a more human side. I was also pleased that Ana showed much more of a backbone, and held her own throughout the book.<br /><br />I also liked the \\"bonus\\" at the end, showing Christian's end of the bank conversation, and his perspective of the beginning of their relationship.<br /><br />There was one really decent BDSM scene that did make me squirm a bit and fantasize about it later. One. *sigh*<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />ENOUGH already with the \\"my beautiful husband\\", \\"oh me, oh my!\\", \\"please, Christian!\\", and \\"Mr. Grey/Mrs. Grey\\". Good grief, the length of the series could have been reduced to 2.5 books without the repetitiveness.<br /><br />The length of the series could have also been knocked down to only 2 books if some of the sex scenes had been left out, and the better ones expanded upon. I would have much rather seen a whole chapter devoted to an afternoon of BDSM, than to have the same. damn. thing. repeated over and over and over, ad nauseum. I mean, ok, some of the sex scenes in this one were left to the imagination, and I was super grateful for that. But really, the better sex scenes were so mind-numbingly boring I found myself rolling my eyes instead of being the least bit aroused by them.<br /><br />Summarizing The Series<br /><br />I will probably never read the books again because they just weren't all that great. They had their good moments, but far more bad moments than good. If I ever do decide to read them again, it will be to tear them apart and see how much could be left out or combined, and see how much better they could be. Although, I'm not sure it's an experiment I'd want to tackle unless I was extraordinarily bored.<br /><br />As a series, I'd probably give it 2 stars, but each book had just enough good stuff to bump them up to 3, individually. If you make it through all 3 books, you'll understand what I'm talking about.o decide to read them again, it will be to tear them apart and see how much could be left out or combined, and see how much better they could be.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was just lovely, taking us back to a time when lines were much more defined between groups of people. The costumes, story line and acting are just perfect. I especially enjoy the little details, as when the carpets were rolled back for a wedding, the maids came to wax the dance floor.<br /><br />The scenes in the prison are made to look realistic, with grubby, dirty walls and poor lighting. You can almost feel the cold, clammy atmosphere.<br /><br />Maggie Smith has absolutely the best lines!! She can say the most cutting things with a perfectly straight face! The scenes with Maggie and Shirley Mc Lane are classic!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next episode.
0316098515|1.0|I received my book but the package was open, and the bome was broken on the inside part, i have to be very careful when trying to see a recipe or something, also my Paul Bocuse book had some scratches on it as well as my guitar riffs book...
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like other weather info better.  I have used The Weather Channel the most, it's probably because I'm so used to it.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My little ones love this movie! They had the book already, so knew the story. I think that helped them with sections which might otherwise be scary for very little ones. It's just great animation and a cute story. Just the perfect length for small children too. Enjoy!
0446554995|4.0|If you are a Preston&Child fan you will enjoy this one. As in all their books they hook you from the beginning and it is a great ride till the end. I just wish they would write faster....I can't get enough!

B007GCY8FS|2.0|A couple of years ago my wife handed me a Lee Child, Jack Reacher novel and like that, I was hooked.  Since then I've read them all.  My guilty pleasure.  Since hearing that Cruise was to be cast as Reacher in the recently released film, I was reluctant to go out and by this book.  Well, I fell off the wagon and bought A Wanted Man...<br /><br />It wasn't the non stop page turner of past efforts.  I found it was slow and uninspiring.  It was more of a sedative than the old Lee Child &#34;high&#34; I used to feel.
B00544L9EI|5.0|awesome album I love it and listen to it all the time.  Eminem is one of my favorites of all time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's the best game yet. I love it. You can make it more 3D than it was ever. Just go to settings and you will see what to do then.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|This is a great album of all time.  I love Radio Head and listen to them a lot.  This is a good album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I was disappointed to learn that the main character was a teenager, but this book was amazing.  The ending was perfect.
0307730697|5.0|I rated this five stars because it tells the good side of the military that we just don't hear enough of in the media.  For anyone who needs inspiration and motivation to tackle the trials and tribulations we all deal with in life, then this book should do the trick.  As far as any dislikes in the book, I can't say I had any and I sympathized with the author greatly.  I too, though I knew there was a dreadful ending in advance, only hoped for a different outcome as I read about this devoted son, brother, father, friend and 100% true American partiot!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The character in this book was so well-developed that I found myself comparing him with people in my own life.  A great, quick read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love Kate Morton and she did not disappoint me! The Secret Keeper was full of suspense and kept me reading late into the night! I loved the WWII setting. Very good read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks book, and I absolutely loved it.  It was a great combination of suspense and romance.  Can't wait for the movie!
B002C6A6N6|4.0|We love this series.  We have enjoyed watching the episodes.  The whole family can enjoy wholesome and exciting shows and I don't have to wonder if it is appropriate.  The only thing that I would suggest, is adding CC to the series.  We have a hearing imparied daughter and she needs closed captions.  Other than that, excellent filiming and story lines.  We
B008XG1X18|4.0|Awesome app for sharing stuff. More than amazing, it's. more than fantastic. Believe me I'm. not the least bit sarcastic. it's. great.
B0038ZITIE|4.0|I saw this movie when it was first released. The theater's surround sound was impressive for its time. Like everyone here who reviewed the movie, I agree it's cheesy fun. Years later I bought the pan & scan VHS tape which pinched the action scenes. After countless years, tonight we watched the SOTU DVD widescreen version. It's still cheesy fun but that's the point made by its creators who spent a lot of money to copy the look of the 1930's serials, instead of going high tech, while adding some humor which more or less succeeds. Topol's Mad Doctor routine (mad as in nutty, not insane) gets to be a bit much in the humor dept. but as Vultan, the leader of the Hawkmen, Brian Blessed's comic skills make up for it to create a nice balance. Blessed was born to play that rowdy part, no doubt about that. The actors playing Flash and Dale seem to have been chosen for their looks instead of their acting ability, but they blend well into the gaudy color scheme. It would have helped their performances if they were given better dialogue, especially for Dale whose role is another attempt to add humor. In fairness these newcomers to films come off OK holding their own against the other seasoned actors. The entire cast appears to enjoy getting into their roles with the right amount of spirit needed for this kind of genre and without getting lost in the scenery since the production design is the movie's strongest point or weakest depending on your point of view.<br /><br />Speaking of scenery, the restored visuals look better than ever when upscaled to 1080P to truly appreciate the garish comic strip look & outlandish costumes and that alone is worth the DVD's price. At this point I don't need to upgrade to Blu-ray unless I find one on sale. The extras are EH and there is no commentary. Readers here mention a previous worthwhile one recorded by Blessed. Too bad it's not available on this disc. The Dolby Digital sound is bright with decent surround effects for its time.<br /><br />So after all these years, I admit the movie still has its cheesy charms left intact. Fun is the key word here if you let yourself get hooked and that's not too hard to do if you watch the film with the correct frame of mind. And with Queen's energetic music and the lovely Ornella Muti as Ming's cunning vixen of a daughter posturing seductively in various revealing outfits, hey what's not to like? In conclusion, 'Flash Gordon' is a treat for the eyes & ears.<br /><br />Postscript 11/8/14: So far my review received only an unhelpful vote. I basically praised the film so will the person who voted please explain his/her vote.years, I admit the movie still has its cheesy charms left intact.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I give this book 5 because it has a lot of action. It is also sad some of the time.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this is a good puzzle type game gives lots of hints and has mini games. people keep complaining about the price for 2.99 its a bargain I have paid alot more for DS games and you don't get a free trial. I just wish they could condense the file some.  it takes up almost a third of the KF.
B00B5Q8KYQ|5.0|Excellent show and I just want to see more and more episodes.<br />Strong acting, well written and intense. Ddi not expect much when I first<br />starting watching it, but it has blown me away. One of the BEST shows out<br />there. And I thought Castle was good!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was great to see the entire series in order and not have to wait once a week to see it.  I can't wait for the next series.  Great history.
B006TTC54A|5.0|Remembered watching this as an old movie, so had to get it on my new Blu-Ray player. It was a good value and came on time.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I was blown away by the picture quality, and the sound quality is very good too.  A truly fantastic film (but LONG).  This movie should be required viewing in all high school world history classes -- entertaining as hell and educational.  David Lean is (was) a master, and the performances he gets out of this diverse cast are remarkable.  [Well, 'diverse' except for the fact that there are hardly any women in this film at all... yes, it's basically a war movie, but one of the best ever!]
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way one can choose the type of suffle you want. I still use the random most of the time.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great book.  Bourdain is hilarious, gives great tips, and insightful.  I'll admit I don't read much, but read this book in a few days could not put it down.
B004I744AS|4.0|Great program. I will make very good usage of it in all of my writings and readings. Nice and easy to use.
0071766588|5.0|bought for my friends, quite good quality and worth to buy it . great great great great great great great
B004IPPINW|5.0|This is a powerful strikingly honest narrative bringing to life the conflict between East and West in a way that is powerful and believable. The narrator's desire to become part of the US and his antipathy for what he sees as American elitism is the sea-saw on which the novel swings. There are many ambiguities leaving the reader much to think about. Powerfully written.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An honest story about finding one's self. Whether for pleasure or assistance on your own personal journey I cannot recommend this book enough. I believe it's a gift & am honored Cheryl was willing to share it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Free data storage is great a little slow uploading but easy to use why not free is free nice to save music to
B008476HBM|5.0|Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds. I get lost in all of the beautiful words. Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This game is great for traveling. Easy fun play with a good storyline to keep your attention. Mini games are really fun with the change from one style to another. Good buy for simple fun and entertainment.
B00633W614|5.0|This book was a great read!  It kept me on my toes and was hard to predict how the different character's lives would eventually come together. The author did a good job of providing compelling character stories so you would not forget what was happening a you read through the book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you like Tina Fey's humor, you will love this book. It makes me laugh out loud. It's interesting to hear her story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Game is just as good as the 1st series.  Only glitch is that it does slide under the walls sometimes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new temple run a lot better then the first one. I love the zipline and of course the coal mineing carts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its everything a temple run 2 should be.. Great new routes and upgrades. It does not disappoint. 5 stars for temple run 2
B002W1UEW4|4.0|Its wasn't bad, as far as the action and plot go. I guess it somewhat stays true to the original cartoon. The only reason I watched it is because I saw the trailer for the new movie (G.I. Joe: Retaliation) coming out and it looked cool, so I decided to see how the first one was. Some of the acting by some actors( like Channing Tatum) wasn't so convinving at times, but the rest was good enough, at least as much as you would except for a big budget, action movie with an nearly all star cast that's suppose to be a live-action rendition of a famous kids cartoon. You know Hollywood isn't exactly good with making live-action versions of beloved child classics( an exception being Transformers of course). Anyhow, I think I might just get myself to the theater this summer to see Retaliation now that's I'm caught up on the plot and see what the title has to offer. Not the best, not the worst, just some good old action-packed fun.
0440245915|5.0|Having read a few of Grisham's novels, I can say without a doubt that this is his best. The story is not only touching, thrilling, exciting and attention grabbing, but its also an absolute page turner. The story takes place in the deep south during a time when there was still racial divide. The story makes you cringe at time with its violence but it also makes you think about the criminals, the victims and the legal system in a way that is unconventional and interesting. Grisham does a fantastic job of making you feel like you live in the community. You start to image in the dialogue in southern accents and you start to feel like you are one of the southerners in the book. You also start to undertand the small town from both perspectives, black and white. The racial element in this book is crucial to the story and enhances the story very very much.<br /><br />The main character, Jake Brigance, is a young and ambitious lawyer who gets the case of a lifetime. Grisham writes in a way that makes you feel for me Jake but also allows you to critique Jake when he missteps or has poor judgement (no pun). You also get to understand Jake's client, Care Lee Hailey and his family. There are a lot of characters along the way in this novel and each one has a unique personality that fits into the story perfectly.<br /><br />There is action along the way and there are a lot of small details that are important to notice in order to really appreciate this book. The only real critique I can make of this book is the ending. The ending of the book could have been, in my opinion, a bit more exciting and different. Grisham played it safe with the ending.<br /><br />All in all, this book is a must read for any Grisham fan. If you havent read anything by Grisham, this book will make you a fan and will lead you to his other books.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Having performed in the pit for this opera and in concert, I have had the supreme pleasure of working with some great musicians and singers. However, this performance was, by far, the best experience I have ever had and had me wanting more! Bravo to the performing cast and the orchestra!
030745455X|5.0|I really appreciated this entire trilogy. It is not an easy story to read but the layers are very intriguing and worth the time. This is a breath of fresh air compared to some other trilogy's that have been released lately. The writing is actually very good with a unique voice.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but, like Clancy's &#34;Threat Vector&#34;, the story could have been longer and the story lines are becoming too predictable. You always know how things are going to turn out.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|LOVE HER!!! Sade never disappoints. I have worn this CD out. She is the best and still at the top of her game!
B000QUEQBS|5.0|What a great movie! You really came to hate the bad guys and root for the good guys. The ending itself made the whole movie worthwhile!
0765325950|4.0|Though the end of TWOT series would never displease a fan, I felt it a bit tiring to read, as some chapters were way to long and lost in details that could have left space for some more interesting tidings.<br /><br />However, it really makes you eager to read more and more as it gets towards the end.<br /><br />Though some of the threads weren't woven together - in my opinion - it was a last book fitting of the whole series.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good story with great action. But, I think the book could have been even longer. Sometimes, Clancy is just too predictable as you know how things are going to play out in the end.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Great book. I really enjoy jodi picoult books and this one didn't disappoint.  I could relate somewhat to each character. The last couple paragraphs could've ended a little better, but this was a great read that id recommend to others.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My son made a new computer build. And it sold his old computer to a very close friend to my family. My son is so a tech geek. He said that it just works.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love this for a few reasons, the narrative, how it captures your imagination and the interesting plots..5 Stars here!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is a beautifully written, captivating story. I love how Kate Morton writes.  This will be one of the books I read and re-read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never boared when traveling, good product, no problems. I play this game three to four nights a week, try it and you will keep it.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Draws you into the plot line. Very Entertaining and keeps your attention. This is one of the few shows I paid to watch.
B009IKPOUO|2.0|The talking before  some songs was  distracting and annoying. This ruined those songs for me. Did not like song choices and arrangements as much as other albums Barbra has made. Would not recommend this album.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This is a high quality app. It works better than paid applications.  Works well on your PC, phone, and tablet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book did not expect the ending.  Just glad it had.  Happy ending.  Excellent work by the author what an imagination.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this to replace my set that was damaged and it is over all better than the original one that came out
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|Excellent!  I have it on VHS, but this is different.  Screens are split to see more of his concerts.  Improved!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Easy to install.  Unique games,  interesting story line,  not too many HOG scenes,  And the game was long enough.  Overall good value.  I'm still waiting for that it game.  The great murderer mystery<br />with no HOGs
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very interesting and it is very relatable to most teenagers. My girlfriend recommended it to me and at first I was kind of skeptical, but this was a VERY great book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is very fun to play but it could use a update also when i try to playmultiplayer my friends cant join my world.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time.  so much fun and so addictive. this one won't be deleted anytime soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's good very very very good yes good good series I am going to read mockingjay too that will be good
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A Movie the whole family enjoyed. It is a very touching Father /daughter relationship movie. WE will be renting again .
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book! Connor and megan are adorable! They have got to have cute little baby. Seriously though.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|This is simply a great movie! A real classic. I bought this copy as a gift. Without giving away too much, the movie is exactly what it says. It takes you through the planning and execution of an elaborate sting operation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love horses and I ride them all the time..Haha this game is awesome and entertaining when there's nothing to do really.. Haha I'd recommend this t to everyone and install it..
0452285186|5.0|The pure destruction and death would leave even the most hardened gore expert with a look of shock and awe left on their face. Na, just kidding it's a really funny book though.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Exceeded expectations! Very soft leather like cover that fits like a glove. Inside pocket useful. Gives the Kindle Fire a classic old book style elegance.
B003VANOFY|4.0|They work well, kind of disappointed at the range, but GREAT if you're in the same room. . . .
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a bit different from the first Jungle Run and I haven't played it much yet, but I'm giving it four stars at this time. Once I've played it more I could add or remove a star, but the game works fine, runs fine, and is reasonably fun. I'm not sure it'll be a favorite game, but it's a good little diversion. I'd recommend it.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This is a good game for anyone who knows how to play the game. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY MAHJONG.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|BEST GAME EVER. I love this game. Its tied with Brave temple run. You will not regret getting this app.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This has three different games of MahJong. For beginners, as well as very experienced players. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in MahJong.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I like this cover.  It fits snugly, doesn't add much weight, and seems sturdy enough to offer decent protection against casual bumps and bangs.<br />The only issue I have is that if you want to use the cover to prop up your Kindle in horizontal \\"landscape\\" mode, it is a delicate balance to get the flap folded and tucked into the shallow ridges.  Turns out I read my Kindle held vertically like a book about 97% of the time, so that isn't much of an issue.<br />Good product, and above average value.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Came on time or early nice item why do I have a word limit own items to rate good item
0321344758|4.0|A very good and quick read. Finished book in about 5-6 hours. All common sense really but many pages of head-slappers; like of course I should have realized that - or thought of that...  A must read for web/graphic designers.  Take your skills to the next level of UI/UX awareness.  Now reading Seductive Interaction Design by Stephen Anderson.  Looks to also be a good informative book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game for awhile. I teach and logically I can use it with my students for mind
B0090EJR1K|4.0|Was a great movie for slapstick comedy and laughs if you have that sort of sense of humor, rent it
B001CTDH76|5.0|i completely enjoyed this item but i hate writing so much to tell you so - how about reducing the amount of words
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I rented it from Amazon rental, really was a great funny movie. I laughed so hard throughout most of the movie.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|All my family enjoyed the movie. The movie itself leaves a good message for young generations, it's a must see.
B003008RWA|5.0|This movie really made me sick to think of the way the American people get treated. It truly makes me feel like we need to take our country back and rid the U.S. of lying ,theiving, scam artists. This movie is definitely worth taking some time to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when I first got it I loved it. And it was really FUN! and who ever wants to download it is really awesome.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is truly hysterical and for people with a wide range of humor. Not for those who are too snarky or stuck up to appreciate.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In my opinion, this game is way better than temple run #1. It is better and way improved.Instead of being chased by several monkeys it is one big monkey.The scenery is way better it is a different place. And to me the best part is instead of having mountains and bridges to climb over it is just plain concrete which makes it easier. And last but not least upgrades are cheaper in the upgrade store!!! Yahoo!! I recommend this for everyone! Good luck!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|it is a great story. the acting is wonderful.  I think anyone over the age of 12 would enjoy it
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Far from the dry, methodical approach I expected from the subject matter! Gwande' s thorough case for not only checklists themselves but a greater awareness of the complexity and enormity modern professions involve is both sobering and encouraging. He details the solution as clearly as the problem however, leaving no doubt in the reader's mind that with a little humility, forethought and discipline previously \\"unsolvable\\" dilemmas can become as manageable as ticks on a list.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I found this game to be user friendly and fun to play.  I am hooked on it. It downloaded really fast with no problems. Big plus :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was on the top of my book list. It was so much more than I anticipated and I can't wait to read the other two in this trilogy. It definitely gets 5 big stars from me. I wish I had my own Christian Grey.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing this game for some time now and I have to say I think I am hooked. Thanks amazon for the fun.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|It was new to me, anyway, when I found this first book of the series. I love paranormal romances - shapreshifters, magic, vampires  ... Sigh.
0345803485|1.0|This has to be the worst book ever written.  Anyone who actually likes this book has never read real literature.  The repetition and lack of vocabulary in the book is not even worthy of a fifth grader's writing.  Do not waste your time and money!  Total garbage!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just started it and I'm already addicted! very fun and the graphics are great... you can do so much including groom, train, feed, and compete with your horse press the buy button you wont regret it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|entertaining. makes you think. gets difficult enough to make you want to figure things out when you get stuck. also like the animated parts
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i love the game but when ever i use a save me it logs me off or whatever and it is awful cuz i beat my highscore and get like so many coins and i lose it all
B008HK3XKO|4.0|As others have stated you cannot charge your kindle fire hd with the case closed or in the standing position.  I have really found this to be a non-issue for me.  This case is working out very well for me and I'm glad it saved me a few bucks over some of the other cases.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|i downloaded and played it was funbut when i exited out it wouldnt load and it just stayed on the title and didnt load
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great hidden object game.  Has hints to help you when/if you need it.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Fun to play.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I think my favorite part is the booklet that comes as an addition. It really completes the entire package and completes the experience.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have been a fan of Nelson DeMille for years. I always found his stuff a cut above the rest of the spy thrillers.  But his imagination and literacy quotient suffers with this unsatisfying potboiler.  The characters are not convincing, the plot line is not convincing, and I come away wishing for the return of the old DeMille.
B0063IH60K|5.0|only game I play everyday many times a day I never get tired of it even after a year of playing
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Not worth it. At all! I can't figure out where to go and<br />wish they had just made it a strict Hidden Object game.<br />Big Fish Games usually have wonderful games but in<br />my opinion they missed the boat on this one.
1848321600|5.0|A few years ago, with no relevant training or experience whatsoever - except that of paying attention to detail, I built a scale model of  the Thermopylae followed by a much larger version of Cook's HMS Endeavour. The results compared favourably to models built by those who style themselves `advanced modellers' and show off their efforts on the internet. As a result of that experience I have reviewed a small number of books which explain rigging and planking techniques - if only because I have a modest understanding of the subject.<br /><br />This excellent work, however, is a book about the Sailing Frigate told through those historic models which are still in existence and, just as soon as I opened the book, I was unable to put it down. The underlying history of this particular genre of vessel is based on the scale models held by the National Maritime Museum - and what a collection it is too! Only now do I see the difference between the laudable efforts of the amateur and the precision provided by the various shipbuilders of the day who produced these scaled down versions of the larger size vessels they were using in a bid to sell their ships to the Royal Navy and beyond.<br /><br />May I say, as a professional shipwreck historian, I was previously unaware of Frigates which were also equipped for rowing in addition to the normal complement of sail. A truly outstanding model - showing all 36 oars deployed, appears on the front cover and is fully explained on p.99. That, however, is just one example of many different models.<br /><br />The book makes an excellent job of explaining the life of the Sailing Frigate. With Chapters entitled; Prehistory 1600-1689, Guerre de Course 1689-1713, The Establishment Era 1706-1748, The `True Frigate' 1748-1778, The Heavy Frigate 1778-1815 and The Last Generation 1815-1850, we find a complete history of the Frigate told through the only accurate representation of this genus of warship still in existence - the builders models of the time. Not even ship portraits by the most celebrated painters of the day could possibly compete with the detail found in these three-dimensional forms.<br /><br />With anything from a single image reproduced across two pages to four images on a single page, this richly illustrated work shows every type of Frigate from the first designs through to the final hybrids which were powered by both sail and steam - and deftly reports the evolution and eventual demise of the Sailing Frigate as it does so. Some of the models were deliberately finished in an incomplete state - so as to explain various `below deck' and, therefore, out of sight features in addition to assisting the shipwrights charged with building the full size vessel. Throughout the book, at one end of the scale we find models which are in various stages of incompletion, without planking and without masts and rigging. At the other end, we find the most extravagant examples of fully rigged vessels with fine moulding over the stern in models so well made that some are even shown ready for launching on their own model ramp...<br /><br />This is a book from which the reader will learn much about the Sailing Frigate because the subject is placed so expertly under the microscope, and even more about the topic of model ships because they are as equally well reproduced and, therefore, perfectly represented. Add to all that the simple fact that the entire product is packed with fascinating information and put together in the most readable of styles and it only remains for me to congratulate both author and publisher for such an excellent job of work.<br /><br />NMtime.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|If you love the Angry Birds games you won't be disappointed. Lots of options and frustrating levels to drive you looney.<br />Love it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Well, the story was short but I did enjoy it, the ending could have been better. I am a huge Stephen King fan I really loved cell. If your looking for a short story, this one will hit the spot.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I don't know what these crazy birds have to be angry about. It's the pigs that drive me nuts. I will eventually make<br />bacon out of those little scummers....
1401235166|5.0|This book do not stop surprising me! Bill Willingham is one of the best writers of our times! Great Book!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Driving you crazy, I dream of making those stupid pigs into bacon.<br />Lots of great levels and annoying near misses to keep my coming<br />back for more. Ugh. I love this game.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|If I could give this colossal waste of time NO STARS, I would.<br />My time and money was wasted on it.<br />You have to be musically stupid or have a straight up lobotomy<br />to enjoy a heaping pile as bad as this.<br />OR you have to be a fan of Glee and 12 yrs old.<br />Not for me, or people that have a sense of taste.<br />Even as a bad comedy it was junk.
B00005N6KG|5.0|No, these are not going to last forever. In fact, I think I've bought 6 or 7 pairs over the past 7 years. But I'll KEEP buying them!!! And if Sony were to make a deluxe pair with better quality housing around the earbuds and stronger wire, I'll pay good money for those. Every time mine are unavailable or broken and I have to use other earbuds, even something supposedly higher quality SkullCandy, is completely disappointing. Other brands are totally missing the BASS and stereo sound that these provide. These completely envelope you in the sound where as others feel distant. This truly feels like stereo sound in my ears, other headphones sound like I'm holding up an ear to my laptop speaker when compared to these. I can't switch to any other brand or model!
B0091THDOM|4.0|Very nice case and light. Good quality but not perfect. Its tight at first but in couple of days it become perfect.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book!  Being married 25 years to my husband I could relate to the love/hate relationship and vengeful thinking.  I was totally enthralled until Amy killed Desi....then I lost the kinship...too extreme and unbelievable.  I kept thinking, I don't get it...I'm not liking this anymore.  That is my only complaint. Overall I enjoyed the book!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this for a book club and did not enjoy it at all!  Neither of the main characters is sympathetic and it's hard to find supporting characters who are developed enough to redeem the book.  I also found it annoying that even though the story is told from two different characters' viewpoints the &#34;voice&#34; doesn't really change that much.<br />Almost everything about this book put me in a bad mood.  I recommend you read almost anything else!
B009JBZH54|5.0|A great series of movies.  Glad to have them all in BluRay.  Gave DVD versions of the first two to my son.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I got soooooo existed when this app came out, I really hope it turns out just like the PC version  I hope they add these:<br />.pumpkins<br />.golden apples<br />.armour<br />.enderman<br />Spider jockey<br />Wolves<br />And a jungle biome
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app. Its perfect to have and fun to watch for a few seconds. The bubbles make it fun.
1932100660|5.0|Life altering everyone should read. I intend to live a good long and healthy life and this book will help
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is great for a free clock and alarm. The colors are great and bright, easy to read and easy to set up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you thoght temple run was fun this game compared to temple run is WAY more fun than temple run. BUY THIS APP IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!
B00127RAJY|3.0|The fact that I can not skip or fast forward to the workouts is very annoying.  I don't want to or have time to listen to Jillian talk about the work out etc. every time I want to just do a quick work out (after hearing it the first time, I do not need to listen to it again)!  The work outs are good, but hope any future work out videos will have the option to just skip to the workout!!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|My whole family loves this game we play every day. There are 7 of us playing right now.  It's Yathzee on steroids for us as we live all over the United States. It's a way to feel close. I have about 5 games going with each of them at any given time. My grandkids play too. We love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining game it is great any horse lover young or old.. I take care of horses everyday so its fun it only take a couple of seconds to do it here.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson continues to write amazing fantasy stories and novels.  This one continues to build on his ability to create new worlds with different powers.  I am glad he is done with Wheel of Time so that he can finish the next volume of the Stormlight Archives.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|A more professional way to keep contact with people and friends, it opens up possibilities to jobs, school, and classes.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|I loved lenders games but this is just horrible there's not even battle school<br />D o n o t g e t
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|Great flick, but a real tear jerker! Has you in suspense from beginning to end. Beautiful love story that will leave you in awe!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I could not put the book down<br />L t yt? Butt g  yt? Unfunny by  y.y.yvghghgcu  h h h h
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good! I couldn't put the book down! It kept me guessing what would come next! Great!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game to learn how to care for a horse. Wish there was a faster way to earn coins
B000ID37KO|3.0|Forgot how lame 1963 special effects were. Hitchcock is good the effects turned it from suspense to comedy. Would have ok as a free PRIME
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've been catching up on Seasons 1 & 2 after hearing so many of my friends rave about it.  Season 3 did not disappoint and I'm anxiously awaiting the next episodes.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best movie 'til now, in a awesome pack that includes everything for the real fans, love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I feel that this is a fun game. I enjoy it greatly. it keeps me from getting bored, and gives me something else to do when I get tired of reading.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game  definitely worth it . I enjoy hidden object games.  Plus this had other elements to help change it up. Price was responsible.no problems on kindle fire
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Woidy Allen, but this is a delightfully quirky offering from him.<br />Paris is shown in its glorious artistic prime. The cinematography is a delight and the dialogue rich and velvety.<br />The modern day American fiancé is slightly annoying and adds a glaring contrast to the luxury of the experience.
B00319ECGK|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been already been said about The Matrix? It truly is a one of a kind film for the sci-fi and cyberpunk genre. That's why for this I am sticking to strictly the Blu-Ray and it's product quality. This disc is full of special features including intriguing features including, behind the scenes making, visual effects, Directors' commentary and many more. The film has been remaster from the original 35mm prints and has been upgraded to 1080p and 5.1 surround for the best film experience. The picture is just as clear as ever with this remaster and the sound is so crisp, I was able to hear every gunshot in crisp detail during the famous lobby shootout. All these scenes pop and it feels so good to see a classic given the proper BR treatment and for the right price. This is a must for any, sci-fi, film or just anyone who is a fan of this film.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Awesome. I grew up in an Italian neighborhood during the 50's and 60's and this gem reminded me so much of that.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Kitchen Confidential:  Too many words and statements I didn't understand the meaning of.  I love Anthony on his tv program but he loses me with his words sometimes.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Once u get past the sex...the story is really good. I tried to predict but was mostly wrong. Can't wait for the next book to see what's next for this crew.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a real page turner. After reading the first book, Bared to You, I couldn't wait to read Reflected.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|the seris is amazing and every one should read it! my favorite part is the mystery about -A best seris everr!!:) so yeah
B000THCFA2|5.0|Somebody who set the standard of what sampling could be. Music like this doesn't happen anymore. RIP Jay Dilla. You were one of the many great contributions to music history.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this  game so fun with a lot o  things to do .way better than the first temple run. No problems so far.It`s put  it's perfect
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I love Papa Roach, and honestly this is one of the best albums of any genre that I have heard in a long time. It seems very well put together. It flows well and all the songs seem like they were written to go together. Fantastic album!!!
B00005NKKV|5.0|I rated this 5 star because of the political ability of this song to pacify anger.<br />I grew up in the seventies with Nixon promising to end the war if elected.<br />And now, with the economy troubles, I bought and played this with the help of computer electronics.<br />Internet.<br />I sure can use this song to pacify all the anger I'm going through, these more modern times and I thought the 70s was modern that we were being tolerant of the huge mixture of different races I was growing up among.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|my ps3 got ylod (yellowlightofdeath) and i had to do something about it, so i decided to try and fix it on my own, i ordered this arctic silver 5 since i heard this was the better type of thermal compound to use, i dont know much about all this stuff, but i opened it and reflowed the soder on the gpu and cpu and applied the thermal compound, its been about 1 month since then and my ps3 is working like a champ, ive been watching showes all day and playing oblivion and skyrim and the ps3s fan barley even runs hard like hardley ever so this stuff is prolly pretty damn good lol over all it worked awesome for me
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I just started the first book and it is great so far. I have seen the original movie with sub titles, and the American version. Both great flicks. A friend told  me the first book ends different than the movie. I can't wait to finish the first book and read  the next two.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I was so sick of seeing the car chargers with the USB port. I have enough confusion in my car that I didn't need a charger that could detach. This one is great! I love it. I drive a Chevy and it fits nice and snug into my car. I was skeptical to purchase at first because of complaints on it not fitting in the car correctly. It is a trusted name and you can tell that it is made well. It arrived to my house in a just a few days.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Board gaming greatness finally in the amazon store. This app replicates the fun of the dice game perfectly while ramping up the difficulty and making it easy to play by yourself or with friends. Touch controls work great and the app runs smoothly. It comes with a bunch of characters and spells and a few ancient ones to fight plus more via in app &quot;expansions&quot;. Definitely worth every penny support these developers and let them know you would like to see more of these games in app form...Mansions of Madness...
B005LAIGN2|5.0|great movie, tells about the struggle black people [black pilots went through back in the day.racism still exists today, what the movie you might change your view on black people
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very believable exploring the threats of ciber warfare of the near future. The issue is not if....but when!!! Great read.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This was an exceptional follow up to the first season. Again the music is just outstanding and I plan on watching it over and over again.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Excellent show. Just loved it. The twenties and thirties music is outstanding. &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34; the complete first season met all my expectations and then some.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I love using tripadvisor when I'm planning a trip.  I spent time on the forums so I downloaded this app while I was out of the country and was able to check reviews for restaurants, hotels, etc while we were traveling.  I found it very useful.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|well this game helps you under stand how to survive in the real games<br />so it can be awsomeeeeee<br />buy it
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Cute movie that my four year old daughter loves.  This is a great story and makes you think about respecting your surroundings.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game keeps you engaged the entire time and it is a lot of fun.  The sounds are good and the visual is great.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I haven't made it the whole 30 days but I'll admit that after 2 days I was feeling a change (and some pain!)  I enjoy this and look forward to seeing big changes in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun new app that can only be described as &quot;awesomely different.&quot; I would love to see more from this developer!!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|This is a decent chess game for the kindle.  My husband is a huge chess fan and enjoys playing this game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story line...big Nicholas Sparks fan and a lot of my friends are too! Excited to read more of his books!
B004GYY714|2.0|Not what I was expecting.  I wasn't able to tune in anything on this and deleted the app.  Don't waste your time with it.
B000I186FW|5.0|This going to happen here. Subscribe to Alex Jones and Anonymous. This government seeks to control everything. Centralized government has never benefited anyone except the power hungry bastards who run them.This is supposed to be 50 separate nation states.Each state should decide its own policy.No state or local government should require someone to buy something just because they are alive.Check out the Thrive videos on YouTube.<br /> FREEDOM PREVAILS!!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love facebook and love this app on my kindle.  Everything works fine, never had any issues with items not loading properly.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Scary ...deep ...and plain<br /><br />A rainbow of emotion and truth .. with lots of coffee and some humor mixed in
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Great comedy with crude humor.  A lot of male humor in this movie, my husband was a huge fan of it.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Love this film. If you love snowboarding, you have to pick this up. DVD resolution will not do this film justice. The cinematography and editing is perfect.<br /><br />Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm going to watch it again right now.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I really liked the first series and bought the entire set.  Nice to watch the segments consecutively.  downloaded and ran easily without any problems
0345803485|1.0|This had got to be THE worst book I've ever read. I have never read anything so repeaticious in my life. It's almost as if it were written by a child with a one track mind. The main characters are so boring. Christian must be part caveman due to his one word sentences.And the constant question: \\"Did you eat?\\" And of course Anastasia and her habit of biting her lip that we're reminded of on every other page.<br />I am so glad I only borrowed this piece of trash to read from my friend instead of wasting money on it myself. Spare yourself the agony and don't waste your time reading it.
B0042KA4VO|3.0|I really liked the first series, but I guess as with other seasons the plot gets kind of old and boring.  I have not even finished this series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked this game. It was entertaining and kept me wanting to play.<br />Good mix of exploration puzzle solving. A little on the short side but well worth 1.99
B002M87W9K|5.0|As always who can forget this age old classic and musical numbers.  My toddlers enjoy watching musicals and I still know the words to the majority of the songs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game! its sooooooo! much fun! great to any one who loves horses! you should so downloaded!!!!! I get three gems for this review!!!
B000007XUQ|5.0|Provides wonderful Christmas cheer.  It is very uplifting and different and includes wonderful variety of holiday spirited music to enjoy.
0307474259|5.0|I read this book because a friend recommended it.  She had been following the eating plan Taubes suggests and was losing weight after failing at many diets.  Basically, the plan is low carb, but Taubes provides a great deal of scientific information which helps support his theory that carbs are culprits in making us fat.  I am trying his suggestions and have already lost a little weight.  I plan to continue in large part because it seems to work and is healthy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is definitely broadcast appropriately as a Masterpiece.  Wonderful actors and actresses that do a very believable and authenticate portrayal of the time period.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fight :-) h h by h g y by h highlighting y Hugo hi interfered f v err f top g
B003QTSMXE|5.0|New and intriguing idea.  Includes good life lessons for toddlers and youngsters about saving the environment and exercising being an important part of life
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I just wanted to play a Shanghai (mah jongg) style of game.  It has a ghastly intrusive soundtrack, with no way to control it.  The game choice controls are utterly incomprehensible. The tiles are hard to differentiate.
B007PYEY9M|3.0|It was a movie which I just could not get into.  It was an enjoyable movie over all but not very memorable,
B0063IH60K|3.0|Be aware that this is an extremely basic solitaire game.  The graphics (the cards) are perfectly clear.  The sound effects feel right.  Playing the game is easy.  What it does do, it does well.  It just doesn't do much.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|It has become a classic in its own time.  As new and exciting an idea as what The Lion King was when it was released.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I picked this up when it was the free app of the day.  It is supposed to let you watch your video on your TV without requiring any wiring.  As far as I can tell, it doesn't do anything at all.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I included this item in the same Christmas movie gift basket which I gave to my nephew.  It was a hit with all.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me seasons 1-3; I got addicted so quickly I ordered the series for myself! I would recommend this for those who like &#34;gritty police dramas&#34;. The character Vic Mackey...you love to hate him.  The rest of the cast supports the plot nicely...check it out. You shouldn't be sorry!!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I Gifted this item in a creative &#34;movie night&#34; theater basket for Christmas, as a family gift.  They loved it, as the father, my nephew watched this years ago every holiday with his own, now passed, mother.  He enjoyed sharing it with his own children.
B000021Y77|5.0|It was good.  It is good.  and the next I watch it, it will still be good.  It's a what if i can go back a hour or two and change events before time run out.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|We saw this n the theater when it first came out- its a good movie. So I bought it as a Christmas present. DVD works and we enjoyed the movie just as much as the first time!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Wonderful quality and I love how the movie is broken up in smaller pieces since the movie is like 5 and halh hours long.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this Game , is diferent to the other game, Temple Run , to my Dauther like  very much Thank you
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Addicting game that does kill time. No major glitches on this game. Only down fall is waiting for stuff to build which could take all day but the more you get into the game the faster it goes
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I have read this book to the tea and even have bought the Atkins Induction Recipe book to go hand and hand with each other. I've lost 8 lbs, it's been slow but I am starting to see a great deal of energy that I have and can't sit still. I even have my husband and son on this diet. They are doing good, however, they are always wanting the CARBS.. They beg for it.. But staying true to the diet...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good degree of hardness with out lots of obsucurity. keeps attention. Story line makes sense. Another Big Fish winner.  You will enjoy this one.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Marware Vibe standing case protects kindle fire.  It is well made.  No complaints.  Color choice was good.  Product does what it is designed to do.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|First: I didn't want this book to end. I wanted it to go on forever, immortal, like the circus itself. Second, I couldn't stop thinking about the story. I woke in the middle of the night turning a particular twist in the plot over in my mind. The characters and scenes followed me around the house, almost as if I were wandering the tents. It was wonderful. No novel has ever affected quite the way this one did. I literally gasped aloud and cried at the very end of the tale--it was that good and that well told and the ending was that delicious.<br /><br />Last, The Night Circus reminded me of a real experience. Throughout the book, I was brought back to my memories of the Oregon Country Fair which, like The Night Circus, seems like a place out of time--magical, surreal, and filled with unexpected delights. Like the Night Circus, the Fair has its rêveurs, who long for the Fair between its yearly appearances. I imagine that next year's Fair will bring back lovely memories of this incredible book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 was definitely not a mistake! In my opinion, the original Temple Run is the best but this game has so many sights see and new abilities. Great Game!<br /><br />9
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Sound is too loud then too soft making watching complicated and annoying. Film was pretty good but too long. Acting good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is by far the best horse game i have ever played!!! It is truely amazing! I lo e playing with the horses and competing !!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|The purple cover is very attractive. My Kindle Fire is held in it securely. And the stand part of the cover works wonderfully well so I can read at any angle. Very happy with this case cover!
030759565X|5.0|I love browsing through this cookbook.  There are two chicken recipes (spatchcocked chicken with potatoes and chicken with grapes and olives) that I've made several times.  Easy and Delicious.  I tried the brisket, but didn't have as much success.  I also have made the Red Wine Velvet cake.  Mine looked just like the picture.<br />There are lots of recipes that I am looking forward to trying.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great story! True page turner. Couldn't read it fast enough. Hated to stop because the action & suspense just kept going. True to Baldacci' s style. Highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Compared to other authors of legal novels, Scott Turow and John Grisham, this book was not nearly as well written.<br />Parts were well done and then there would be something that just didn't flow properly.<br />I read the story quickly because it was interesting and I wanted to know how it ended.<br />The ending was a surprise.  Not sure how I feel about it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Nice graphics and easy to add other cities to your favorites list.  The only thing I don't like is the cheesy &quot;sale&quot; on the icon.  If they changed that icon to one I liked, I would buy it again just to get rid of it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have installed and played every Spider app available and Mobilityware, hands down has the best I've played ... this Kindle version is only 2nd to the PAID iPhone version I play on my iPhone 4s.  The only reason iPhone version is better is because it allows user to choose &quot;Winning&quot; hand and, of course the PAID version has no ads!  Great graphics, sounds, interface and speed. I hope for the PAID version to update the Kindle Fire HD version real soon.
B00AKYRCNY|1.0|The unlock button is huge and easy for kids to press. Didn't get a chance to try before I was forced to buy.

B005LAII80|4.0|It is a good movie to see in 3D. Just different a version from the one that Silverter Stalone made before.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! I started out loving Amy and Nick as a couple, to just liking them, to only liking Nick, to hating Nick and loving and feeling sorry for Amy, then to feeling sorry for Nick and absolutely despising psychotic Amy!! The suspense in this book is teeth clenching good! Gillian Flynn is a brilliant woman to have written such an amazing book with such gripping story line. I wish I had more words to say about this book but the only thing I have left to say it....READ IT...it's brilliant!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved it!!!! lots of fun to read. I enjoyed this book very much, it made me want to hike the pct.

B005LAII80|5.0|Best Dredd movie ever. It puts the Stalone version to further shame. The critics even said this was a great movie, but I guess people were still shell shocked from the 90's version. MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game if you love animal and horses especialy horses then you should buy it great for my six year old

B0049VZ222|5.0|I was hesitant at first to watch this series. I am not a big Apocalypse/ zombie fan. However, my friend begged me to start watching the series. Now I am hooked. This show isn't just about zombies, its about life struggles we all face, and whether you are into apocalyptic shows or not, this if you give this show a chance you will not regret it.
B0058ZJYJK|5.0|I chose this rating because number 1 I LOVE Warpaint.  The lyrics are just so profound.  I have to say that I LOVE the Beetles song.  It speaks to me because I feel like that a majority of the time.  Especially when I am trying to get the kids together for school and myself for work!!
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|I didn't expect these to sound this good, these must be a good remaster, tho it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging.<br />This is the Doobie Brothers from the 70s and to get 5 of their best albums for this price is a great value.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I am a fruit ninja chopping fool.  I like this game and can't wait until we get a Xbox  so we can play this game at home together!!
B009X01ELC|5.0|The Marware Standing case for the 8.9 inch Kindle Fire is great.  It turns the Fire on and off and makes a great stand for reading and working.  It holds the Fire securely in place and is padded enough to add protection while still light enough to be functional.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love plants vs zombies.  I just can't play it at night before I go to bed.  Otherwise I think that there are zombies outside trying to get in!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love it because unlike in other games where you have to buy gems or tokens or something this one gives you them. but when I play they should really make things easier to find and let you win competitions.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Three words...Cut...The...Rope...How can you NOT like this game?  It's Cut the Rope?!?  I love this game and I sometimes let my brothers play it too.

B001JOIEZ4|5.0|Is there any other rating for this?  It's Twilight, Muse is on here, Death Cab for Cutie, and Paramore.  Can it get any better than this?
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Last year I began the Vampire Chronicles after reading Christopher Moore's vampire series. In the Christopher Moore books, which are comedy, at one point the boyfriend of a novice vampire struggles to help her by collecting all the vampire fiction he could find. His comical references to the differences are funny and made me curious. Having completed 4 Anne Rice novels, I thought I'd go back to where it all began and read the classic.<br /><br />The style is, of course, a bit funny since it is stiff, proper and full of words that are less used today. Never the less, the style of narrative via letters, diary entries and notes is clever and gives the reader the feeling of having stumbled across a secret archive. While there isn't the blood and gore of some modern horror tales, Stoker creates real ambiance in his lavish descriptions and subtle details. This was a clever writing style and quite enjoyable. Now I know why this caught on and has become so iconic. Like so many classics, characters and phrases have entered the lexicon to the extent that I recognized much of this book.<br /><br />Final Note: I had thought Carfax was a service that faxed reports of cars. In our modern age it seemed quaint that this business would make itself seem older by referencing 80s technology. However, Carfax is the name of Dracula's estate in England! Could it be that the nice car history report people are actually blood sucker?
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My mother downloaded a bunch of music for me and I love this because I can listen to all of my music and some of hers.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love it. I think its good. I love how I get kinds frustrated at it. its easy propley not for all people. but for must
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is so much fun! That is, if you can even get it open... The graphics are great, and it's much better than the original. BUT... I have downloaded and undownloaded the game so many times just to get it to open. It works the first time, but when I try to go into the app to play again, it won't open. It's made me so mad to the point where I've given up. It stinks! The game is SO MUCH FUN!!! :'(
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very Similar to Maro Brothers.  I enjoyed it although the sound effects were kind of bothersome.  I am just glad it was free.
B005HIREJK|5.0|This watch is worth the money.  The size is just right.  I have bought other watch brands, but always get a Seiko when I need something good.  This watch looks sturdy. The chronograph is great, and when the dials move, it is entertaining.  There is a tiny second hand that moves all the time, good enough for taking pulses, no need to activate the stopwatch every time.  The band is leather, and a bit tough, it needs a good month of breaking in; I even wore it to bed just to get it just right. Finally it is right for my wrist.  I think it is the decorative stitching that makes it tough.  Watch out for the older crowd like me, the dials are not high contrast at all, the lighting was just right for the Amazon picture, and the contrast is more like the customer picture, the dials are high gloss, and only look right with reflected light, sometimes it is hard to tell time, because there are so many dials, Seiko designers better get a handle on this quick, reflective dials are not very good, my Seiko premiere, moon phase, has the same problems with a white dial gold hands, they just have to work on the contrast, textures, and colors a bit, not with a magnifying glass on a lab, but out-doors in office (where we have the computer clock, and cell phone) where customers are likely to look at their watch, like in the hall way, with no computer or cell phone.  When adjusting the date, somehow my stopwatch second hand got out of zero, very easy to reset using the crown stop 2, then top button for two seconds twice, to select it, and the bottom button twice, or more, just to get it forward to zero, very nice and sophisticated, it must be some kind of  IC - Mechanical hybrid or something cool.  I really like the watch. Remember it needs a break in period.  Lights up florescence at night too. Overall, 10/10, for the price.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|Mama (an excuse to critically discuss horror)<br /><br />The horror genre has an unusual history in the cinematic world. Unlike traditional genres like comedy and drama, horror films seem aimed at a slightly more specialized market. And yet, with this specialized market, one would expect more diversity in the content, but history has revealed that this is not the case. Studios that release horror films seem to pray on popular cultural fads and then, most likely due to inexpensive production costs, let loose clone after clone after clone until these films eventually become less lucrative. Take a look at how many films follow this storyline: a mother notices some strange behavior in her child or around the house. She tells her husband, but her pleas fall on deaf ears; she must simply be imagining the pots and pans all stacking themselves all over the kitchen. Eventually, the husband witnesses something he can't explain and (hesitantly) agrees to contact an expert or specialist in strange behavior who is found on the Internet. Chaos ensues. The expert dies trying to help, one or more friends of the protagonist become victims, and it ends right where it started with a tiny difference that ties everything together. This form of formulaic market saturation as a business model may keep the genre alive, but it has also lessened its reputation. There's no doubt that horror films have the potential to affect an audience more than any other type of film since audience reaction is basically the watermark for success (consider those film trailers that do not show clips of the film, but rather show a packed, darkened theater of people wildly reacting to some outrageously scary moment).<br /><br />Now, I am actually a horror fan and will concede that some of the greatest films are horror films (The Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, Frailty - look it up-, Jaws). However, the worst film of nearly every year is also a horror film (intentionally or unintentionally). Consequently, I am always wary of cinema that resists progress to idly make money off of spent franchises that are too cheap, production-wise, to give up. They make you want to cry for your...<br /><br />Mama is the latest demented fable loosely attached to Guillermo del Toro, regardless of the relentless name dropping that advertisements display. Del Toro did produce, but his influence ends there, and thus, Mama is not Pan's Labyrinth. Mama begins with a catastrophic series of events that result in two young girls being abandoned in a strange cottage in the woods where they will live for five years before being discovered. Exposition sweeps us through a bizarrely simplified adoption process where the girls' uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is permitted to raise the girls in a state funded research house in order for the girls to be continuously observed by a psychologist. At this point, most of the stereotypical formula laid out previously proceeds.<br /><br />Mama is written and directed by Andres Muschietti who bases it off of his own short film, also called Mama. Fundamentally, the story is not incredibly strong, and leaves the viewer with some noteworthy qualms, but Muschietti clearly understands where the few strengths of his story exist and manages to create a couple good scares. Additionally, he adds some fresh complexity to the film by writing Lucas's girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain), as a bass guitarist in a punk band who is apprehensive about having children and settling into a housewife role, but suddenly finds herself doing both. Muschietti also makes another honorable choice in that he tells a ghost story where the revelation of the ghost itself is not the object of the film. He, instead, introduces the ghost early and uses it as his chief form of tension building; that and the kids. The kids are creepy.<br /><br />Mama is what it is. It raises no bars, but it holds a reasonably heavy one somewhat steadily in place. Expect the upcoming months to offer at least four more \\"clones\\" of this film as this fad works its way out. Then it should be smooth sailing... until it all starts over again in September. Core \\"clones\\" of this film as this fad works its way out.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is fun. xbox and Pc is  as fun as this.I cant wait until the update. I love minecraft. it is so adicting and fun.
B003FSTN52|2.0|Picture is blurry. Not as clear as it should be. Maybe cause its the first season?!?!<br />Love the show tho.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King since I was a kid. I've read almost every single novel he's published. With that being said, King hit a slump a few years back but has found his stride again. This book was fantastic. The book is about a person who discovers basically a way back to the certain point in the past. He's talked into going on a mission to save Kennedy from being assassinated. Without giving away any of the plot, the story is intriguing from page one and keeps you enthralled up until the very last page. It's very fascinating what could possibly happen to the future if you change the past.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I have been playing it for awhile now, have even gotten my son into playing it. The only thing I don't like about it is how hard it is to EARN gems. About the only way you can get them is pay real $ for them. I have done it once and will never do it again it's ridiculous!
B003AVPV1O|1.0|Don't buy this. it reduces video quality very significantly, to the point that text is very blurred and hard to read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I don't like this app because I can't run the amazon app store app on my Toshiba 3.1thrive tablet in order to download the app to play! Thanks Amazon!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh my gosh, do I hate this book. Everyone was raving about it so I thought I'd give it a read. I couldn't even get through it. Ana &#34;blushes&#34; every two seconds and the repetition was giving me a headache. Don't waste your money!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the only complaint I have is that I had to u install and re-install because the game kept freezing.  the tasks are pretty simple and straight forward.  The graphics look really decent.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|What a great book. I read it on my phone and had it finished in days. This was a great &#34;just for fun&#34; book to read.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Easy reading, took me away to places I dont usually go.  Imagination is such a gift<br />Read it if you would like to have a good time and marvel at writers like Sedars.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I had a very fun time playing this game my daughter wants this on her iPod. We both wish someday to have our own horse to take great care of.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I wish they gave the chance to 3.5 stars.  The book is good and entertaining.  However, he had written better books - most 4 or 5 stars. He is a victim of his own success :-)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I thought it would be nowhere near as good as the pc version but it is awesomely<br />Close to it :) it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Reading this book has made such an impact on me. I have read many good books lately, but none that have made me feel so many different emotions like this book has. I will suggest this book on and on!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series.  It's got it all:  romance, jealousy, revenge, rebellion, illness and death, and even war, without the typical R rating producers think we all want.  The people are human and for the most part, they are actually NICE!  What I love most about it is that you see people being good, patient, and forgiving with each other.  It's interesting, captivating, and still refreshing as a break from the crud that usually comes out of the TV.
1423113497|5.0|After doing the checklist Projects, Presentations, and Performances, I found that my learning style is Bodily/ Kinesthetic and Interpersonal.  The Multiple Intelligence Checklist showed that I was a Bodily, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal learner.  I believe that these results are true. I am a very active person, when doing online homework I have to get up and move around in between assignments. Also, I am a very hands-on person, I love making things and doing projects.  I believe that the Multiple Intelligence Checklist is closer to being correct because it also found me to be an intrapersonal learner.  I do love to think and reflect.  I am always wondering, questioning, and thinking about events that have occurred and how they could have been different.  However, I am also a people person.  I love being social and I gravitate to as many people as I possibly can.  If I am left alone for a very long time, I tend to get bored and will call to talk or go see someone.<br />  I believe, that these results prove that I learn better when I am up and moving.  Also, when I am working on something hands-on rather than reading the text.  I find this to be very true especially during my field studies.  I love being in the classroom and I am completely engaged and observant while I am watching a teacher.  However, I find it to be very difficult to make myself sit down and do homework.  I get lost during my thoughts and I find it very hard to concentrate.  I believe that I truly am a Bodily/ Kinesthetic, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal learner.  I think these are great qualities to have in a teacher.  I will have the students up and moving, but also, I can give them time to reflect and think about their work.  I truly love talking with the students and helping them with their problems.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is great to help conserve your battery life.  It also helped when I had an app lock up on my and couldn't get it to shut down properly.
0307742997|4.0|I have always liked the way Nesbo carefully builds a story to a critical point where all the cumulative detail suddenly makes sense. He seems to feed his readers just enough information to lead them to the next point in a protracted search for a cunning, ruthless psychopathic killer who leaves snowmen behind at each crime scene. The thrill in reading a novel like \\"The Snowman\\" comes in following the hunt through a very involved labyrinth of circumstances, personalities and settings that takes us ever closer to an unknown quarry. This murder mystery is set in Oslo in the middle of winter. Women, especially mothers, are disappearing off the streets only to be found brutally murdered by what looks like a serial killer. The fear that pervades the city is very real. In the midst of this gathering gloom comes a glimmer of unlikely hope: a dispirited Inspector Hole has suddenly become, out of a sense of duty and compassion, a heroic member of the investigative team in spite of his own lagging fortunes. We get to follow him and his sidekick Katrine around as they follow clues, conduct interviews, and eliminate suspects in this bloody rampage.The breaks that come their way only serve to deepen the plot as they inch ever closer to apprehending a very sick person. It is looking more like the killer is so brazen as to be working in their very midst, but before we get to discover his or her identity be prepared for a couple of unexpected, action-packed twists and turns. This is a novel that keeps one guessing as to who's who. I found this tale to be full of kinds of fascinating detail from the medical, forensic, and psychological worlds that needs contending with before the killer is reeled in
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Great app and a lot of fun.  Every  so often though one of the flippers gets stuck in the up position.  Other than that, I enjoy playing this.
0385535139|3.0|The Litigators is a story about lawyers. Right there I was turned off. Overall, the story was about how hard work and perseverance can overcome seemingly impossible odds. A young lawyer who worked for relatively high pay in a sweatshop quits his job, gets really drunk and falls into a small law firm of ambulance chasers. The junior partner gets involved in a pie- in- the- sky scheme to make by does of money on product liability of a large drug company. When the young lawyer's former firm represents the drug company and forces the small firm into court, both partners fail to show up, putting the small firm into jeopardy and also putting the young lawyer in the driver seat. Due to the young lawyer's hard work, he is able to keep the firm solvent even though they lose the case.<br />The book did not have any magnetism to draw me to want to keep reading along so it took me a while to finish it. I could have given the book to someone else to read and not felt any loss for not having finished the book. Someone else might really go for this story so I rated it as a three.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I had been looking for good games for my smartphone for a while.  I finally saw this game mentioned with very positive reviews.  I never played the card and dice version of this game, but most reviews said it was extremely similar with only a few adjustments.  In addition, I'm a minor Lovecraftian fan, so this was something that appealed to me.  Simply put, it has been very much worth it.  Has a great deal of variablity so the games do not feel \\"the same\\".  There are a couple of addons/extra scenarios you can buy ingame, that I will probably buy soon.  I believe this game is also on \\"Steam Greenlight\\" if you are looking for a different format(PC) to play on in the future.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This gave is awesome and I like that it has levels.Temple run2 is awesome! you should really get it I'm telling you toy fell like your in heaven.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read Will definitely let friends know about this book and author. I look forward to reading more books by this author
B006K3796E|5.0|This is a fun puzzle/game/toy whatever you call it.  Challenging fun, I saw some children playing with one and decided to give it a try.  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of being plugged into electronics and wants to have some good old fashion puzzle time.  No figuring out what buttons to push or buying batteries.  Good fun.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Quality and more quality! Will buy more Melissa and Doug products. My eight year old niece loved it and wanted more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game is great.  It gives you the option of random deals or a winning hand.  I can play 12 or more rounds on the computer and it never gives a winning hand.  I don't usually use the winning hand option, but it's nice to know it's there.
B00130UFY2|4.0|This is a go-to molvie for me.  once a year or so I want to watch it again...great chase scenes, even if a bit over the top-very touching scene at the end...perdictable but still good action movie.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this..... better than the first... Love the swinging on the vines and better obstacles than the original one my whole family loves playing this
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Amazon sold me by saying I could wtach the season I had just purchased anywhere, like my phone or Xbox. Now my xbox refuses to even open the page to download the adobe flash player required, which it won't. As usual don't trust Amazon, bait and switch.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game was boring. It is hard to figure out. At first I could not get it to download. Sorry
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A funny book that relates to some people in school.<br />One of the best books in the series.<br />Good flexible also.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Ok this was awesome! And cost me a night sleep!  But was sooo worth it! When is the next one out??? Please hurry! I am ready to play for another 24 hours!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is the best game ever. It is a very creative game. Have fun making new hybrid dragons!!!! Hope this review was helpful.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Touches on spritiruality and religion in an open and inclusive way, talks about India and far away places, funny observations on people (I embarassed myself by laughing several times uncontrollably while on a long flight and reading this on my kindle), and themes about nature, animals, and being at sea. Simply beautiful, sad, uplifting, heart wrenching, and entertaining.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|My grandson is enjoying is Dump Truck.  It is still holding up after 6 weeks of constant active play and activities.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app it is easy to read and I can share what I read on Facebook of Twitter. You can take notes and highlight what you read. I read the bible a lot more now :)
B007FJFDXS|5.0|EDGE is one of my favorite puzzle games on my tablet.  And EDGE Extended is much of the same, but with enough new stuff to make it interesting.  The addition of the Black Cube is fun, and the optical illusion-ness of some of the level are frustrating, but it gives you a feeling of satisfaction once solved.<br /><br />A great game :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is just like the first one but it has more features like ziplining and stairs but there is more. Also it is very addicting than the first one I'll play it for hours here is another fun game it's called my singing monsters it's very addicting too.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Chu Chu Rocket is a great puzzle game from the SEGA Dreamcast that has been ported to Android devices.<br /><br />The main object of the game is to get the mice to the rockets without a) getting eaten by the cats, or b) falling down holes.  You accomplish this by placing direction tiles on the screen to direct where the mice (and cats) go.  The game itself is very addicting and the puzzles can get frustratingly hard.<br /><br />My one concern is that it's pretty much a direct port of either the Dreamcast game.  I initially trying dragging and dropping the direction tiles onto the board (thinking, hey this is a touch tablet, I can do that!), but it didn't work. Tile placement is done by touching the tile on the screen and moving your finger in the direction you want to place the arrow.  Honestly, it seems like a very clunky way to place them.<br /><br />Other than that, there are hundreds of board to play, along with a Puzzle mode and Battle Mode to keep you entertained.  The only thing missing from the original is the ability to create you own levels.<br /><br />Other than that - a great game :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I've always liked temple run I first on my aunt's I pod so when I got the kindle I was going to see if it was on here and it was so as soon as I seen it I just had to get it and when I got it may I just say it's very addictive and really fun so I recommend you get it.
0307277887|5.0|This was a gift for someone who collects this series . He seemed to enjoy it very much . It shipped on time & arrived just before the holiday season .<br />Good doing business with you<br />Thank You  very much !i
B0084AZXKK|2.0|The it wasn't really my genre type though I can't blame the book for that but if you like pirates and adventures this is the book for you
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great book. Just enough twist and turns . No wasted worddy words or extra worddy pages just to make the book longer. Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im mindblown best game on my kindle .  i would totally recomend it if you really love temple run.  but
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Play all the time! I do wish that the stuff you buy didn't take so long to build. Make sure you don't waste your .money on coins or gems, though.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is a hard read but we'll worth the time. The book is Les Miserables by  Victor Hugo. I hope you enjoy it.<br /><br /> FREEBOOKS
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is amazing with graphics and quality it is overall an amazing game better than the first game i love it
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down! I am so glad that my friend told me about it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Each book gets better! Once i start i cant put the book down, only 2 days, cant wait to start the next!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story grabs and holds you while it twists, turns, and unfolds. It touched my heart in a personal way. Very well written. I would highly recommend this story.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|You think it sounds good, but not unitl you get the vinly! Makes you feel like your listening to the album for the first time and the sound it much much more crisp.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. My mom keeps saying to get off the game and do my science project.
B007885IJU|3.0|I have in love with The Lumineers for a few years now, so when I got this vinly I was really excited but the songs get old after a while. However I did love the fact that it came with a card that let you download the whole the album for your i-pod wich i have never seen before so that was awsome!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So easy. Will not use anything else after using this. Everything I need without being overly complicated. Perfect for all my Facebook uploads.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great . I have it on my kindle fire and on my mom's I Phone 4s . Great app
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book. The story is lush,the characters are fascinating and the romance is splendid. The story of a magician and a slave who fight corruption and triumph over terrible odds. I want to read another book by Grace craven. I stayed up a 'll night reasons it. It's  wicked good
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsess with the game and it is great on kindle fire . Get it !!!!!!!!!!!! I MEAN IT =)
B007SUW24W|5.0|Great CD, my daughter got it for Christmas and listens to it all the time.  He has a very distinctive sound and a very lovely accent!!
B0097NGUJG|4.0|Not an album I would rock out to, but awesome set of beats and unique sounds with some vocal harmony set in....
0380715430|4.0|We all love Bill Bryson! and this book is no exception.  Lots and lots of anecdotes and fun facts about the American English language.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Phillippa Gregory is a marvelous writer - I love all her books.  Her books based on England's history take you there....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I normally don't select games like this but I am so glad I did.  Days of fun and I have not paid anything!!
B00000IREA|3.0|If there were ever a movie that could be described as the best movie of all time while also being the worst movie of all time, this is it. The story and acting are horribly bad. Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of bad. The special effects are pretty cheesy but given when this was made, that is not all that surprising. On the other hand you have Jane Fonda at her physical peak either naked or half naked throughout the entire film. I cannot really tell you what the actual story of the movie is, because it is that forgettable, but it pretty much was just Jane Fonda going around the galaxy having sex. There are a lot of people who hate her for her war protest days, but there is no denying that in her prime she was as hot as any actress.<br /><br />The movie is very cheesy and campy. Kind of akin to the 1960s Batman TV show in that way. It is not one to get because you want to see quality acting. It is however one of those that you can be entertained by just how bad it is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love how they added the extra things. I like this temple run better than the first one so all you kindle fire users buy this game cause it is awesome!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enigmatis:The Ghosts of Maple Creek<br />Kindle Tablet Edition<br />This worked great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I enjoyed the story and the puzzles.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|The case was a little messed up and a bit dirty. but the disc was perfect. Thank you so much.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I do not like the more recent version of this film.  This version with Edmund Gwenn is the only one worth watching.  So many award-winning actors!  Such a delightful  timeless, story!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I strongly dont recomend it to buy<br />that gave me much hard time even no<br />replacment till today no reply from support<br />section.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|True comedy never gets old.  Watching these episodes has become a New Years tradition.  I'm glad I now have all the episodes.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read and enjoyed this thoroughly... get it and read it! Be sure to read the entire trilogy. You'll be glad you did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app covers anything you would like to find out about your local weather, from hour by hour to the forecast several days into the future.  Also has a nice radar Interface where your exact location is pinpointed.  Highly recommended.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I was mesmerized while playing the free version. Made it through all the games so had to purchase more. It is very relaxing and challenging.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  So emotional..hard to put down.  I think I blew through it in a couple of days.  It's told through the dog's point of view.  Brilliant!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend and she really loves it. Its both dramatic and romantic perfect for her. definite chick flick
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very flexible and I got 29 versions to choose from.One of the best bible I ever had.It's the best of the best.
0790729725|2.0|The DVD would flutter and not work right in my player, plus it was on two sides of the dvd requiring the disc to be turned over in the middle of the movie.  I wish I would have spent a few bucks more..
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Identifying our financial 'blueprint' is the key!! The questions Harv asks us in order to identify our limiting beliefs around our finances could actually be applied to most areas in our lives.  We have a 'blueprint' for everything and this book will not only get your head straight about what's holding you back in the area of your finances but what's holding you back in other areas of your life as well.<br />I have raved about this book to anyone who will listen.  And I highly recommend it.  It's the best book I've read in a very long time.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  It was very well designed.  It keeps you interested in the story and the variety of puzzles as well as putting things together to make them work was fun.  It was long enough to do in short bursts over several days.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I haven't gotten very far in the game but I'm liking what I've been thru so  far! 5 stars...now let's get back at it! What? not enuf words?  great graphics, spooky wraiths popping up here and there, under water..what more could you ask for? Now can I play???
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album ranks as one of my all time top 10 favorite albums.  Soulful, kinda dirty without being vulgar, no auto-tune, what a real artist should sound like.  Thank you Lana Del Rey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! My friends and I love it because of the great picture. It is so<br />much fun!!
B000X9NI5W|5.0|I came across Burial by accident and glad I did.  Gives me that classic house/electronic sound with awesome ambient music, ethereal, moving.  I wish Burial was still making new music.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great hand-to-hand combat game with easy, quick xp... the only flaw is the hour long update... but its totally worth it!!! =D
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was introduced to this author by my wife who had me read her book club selection, Gone Girl, and became an instant fan. While I have not found many women authors I have been fond of, Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite  authors of either gender.  After reading Gone Girl, I devoured her first two novels, Dark Places and Sharp Objects in a couple of days and have<br /> been left waiting anxiously for her next book. So far I would characterize her books as being very dark and disturbing with consistently flawed, damaged or imperfect leading characters.<br />Highly recommended and 5 stars all the way.  Gillian is a great story teller.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you buy this and the inventory editor app you're set for life it is so great I just cant get enough of it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series.  Loved all the characters and the actors who portrayed them.  Costumes are such a great addition and the house is magnificent!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I first got the game and I loved it. Unfortunately after about two days it didn't let me open it up!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have looked through so many photoshop apps and was disappointed. But, I was not disappointed with PicArt Photo Studio. Its an amazing app that you will definatly enjoy. It took a while for me to understand the verious tools, but its worth it. I hope you have a fun time with this amazing app
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Really a zero star I wasn't given that option but this is as bad as it gets. p;ease Kindle I have purchased two fires 1 7in and 1 8.9in and this is one of the worse things that I brought but again I was having a very bad week
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My 6 yr old son and I play this together on our devices. It is a great game, lots of fun to build your own dragon park and create new dragons in the breeding cave. You can choose to spend actual money to get things quicker, or you can be patient, put the game away and go play outside for a while and come back to it later. I think that is an even better lesson for my son!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a fun game. it never crashes on MY kindle fire. its really fun and easy. I play it all the time! its very additive so I play it all the time. it deserves five stars.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I love this app AND got it when it was free! Would still be worth the 4 bucks! Get it!
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I watched this only because a lot of it was filmed in my area (Rockport, MA).  Even though I like Sandra, I suspected it might be stupid -- and it certainly was.  The male stripper scene was so awful I ff'd through it -- and then the scene involving the eagle and the cellphone was so stupid, contrived and over-long that I gave up on the movie at that point.  Ryan Reynolds's acting seemed totally wooden to me, too.  The only character I liked was Malin Akerman's.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The book felt like an old time crime novel with sci fi stuff, except you are seeing events from the criminals perspective.<br />I found it to be an ok distraction.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Quite a nice book - however I got distracted by the many editing errors - homophones not picked up (spellcheckers can not do this) and also words left in from earlier drafts which are no longer required.  I like the book and where it seems to be leading, however, I like to read something that people have taken care with the fine details as well as the big picture.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is easily Quentin Tarantino's best work. By now, you've probably seen it several times and are looking forward to adding it to your movie collection. By now, you've realized that this well acted, action-packed mixture of Blaxsploitation, Spaghetti Western and love story is one of the best films you've seen in years. Even the soundtrack is well done and a nod to the brilliant film scores of yesteryear when songs enhanced scenes. Opinions vary but Django Unchained is flawless in my eyes and I'm very excited about owning a copy or two.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|A delicious session of Ritenour's genius!  People who don't know his music should start with this collection, which showcases his talents!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a quick read and very interesting. You need to buy it. There are parts in the book that will wow you.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Thought that this movie may be a little young for me but good for all ages.  Fun movie with lots of great singing.  Even my husband like it and was laughing.
B00A6L78YE|4.0|So let me get this straight? You're going to take bits of early Rolling Stones, The Kinks circa Village Green, the more melodic side of the Velvet Underground, and put it into a blender with a scoop of Belle of Sebastian, a sprinkle of girl-group motown, with a dollop of Jonathan Richman, and you're going to BLEND THIS REALLY WELL, while putting your own spin on it?<br /><br />And this record is going to be called WE ARE THE 21ST CENTURY AMBASSADORS OF PEACE & MAGIC?<br /><br />Uh, yes please.<br /><br />This might be the first indie rock album title ever that I ever agreed with. If this is the future of indie rock, we're heading in a pretty awesome direction. Biting hooks, call-and-response, 60's clap along, snarkily sharp lyrics, snap, sugar, and groove. These songs actually have melodies. And there's not a bad one in the bunch. Besides the aforementioned artists, there are echoes of Supergrass, T-Rex, The Last Shadow Puppets, Pete Doherty, The Cramps--basically, everything fine and nice. But they're not  content being copy cats--this band has cut a short and sweet record that leaves quite an impression. This band is tight, and knows what they're doing.<br /><br />Worth every penny. Thank you Foxygen!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|We love this App! Have it on the Ipad so excited it is available for my Kindle! Me and my 5 year old daughter enjoy this game./
B00340ESIS|4.0|You either love Blake and his book(s) or you don't. Disney Studios was the incubator for Save the Cat,  [[ASIN:193290736X The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, 3rd Edition]], and [[...]] - all three great books that should be on every writer's bookshelf. Blake cared passionately about his fellow writers and he loved telling a good story that entertained his audiences. And to that end his Save the Cat helps to introduce writers to the reality that all stories do have an underlying foundation. And once a writer understands that reality, the task of writing entertaining stories that readers will love becomes so much easier to accomplish.<br /><br />What those who want to dismiss Save the Cat appear not to realize is that Blake was focused on Disney family friendly stories that attracted Hollywood's \\"Golden Quadrant\\" audiences (in short they appealed to M/F, A/K) because that was Blake's world. And that is a wonderful world to exist in as a Hollywood writer. And it is a great introduction to all writers into the reality of the underlying foundational structure of stories. And adding the other two companion books to your shelf will only serve to expand on all of the wonderful advice Blake offers every writer.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I read the book. The book is probably too long to have the movie follow it but the movie gets way off track from the book. It felt like they were hurrying through the movie at each stage and so the character development was poor, the build ups to the clashes were nill and the action sequences were not very exciting.<br /><br />The acting was good.... and that is about all that was good about this movie.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|OK, let me start off by explaining why I think this deserves 2 Stars instead of just 1 Star - because John Locke taught us all a very valuable lesson. For writers it is 'how not to totally and absolutely disrespect the reader'. And for readers it is 'you deserved way, way better than what you got from this fellow'.<br /><br />At the same time we do have to tip our hat to one hell of a salesman whose sole purpose in putting out his 'books' was merely to take the money of gullible readers everywhere. John Locke is a salesman and he's rightfully proud of what he is. Note, however as a reader, I'm hard pressed to think of him as a \\"writer\\". Instead he's merely a slick salesman who used words, and the expectation of both readers and writers everywhere, as a tool to deceive them into turning over their hard-earned money to learn how he profited from their gullibility.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, what he did was extremely valuable in helping to set the current standard of banning bought/fake reviews. For that contribution to today's publishing landscape he deserves that second star because his book is a lesson on the fact that true writers, who have always known that they owe a duty to respect every single readers who seeks out their books, are responsible for helping to enforce a level of professional integrity upon their chosen industry.<br /><br />I had turned to this book in the hopes of learning something of value about the kinds of stories that would please and satisfy readers. Obviously, I didn not find that here. Instead, I turned to books like [[ASIN:1932907351 Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies: The Screenwriter's Guide to Every Story Ever Told]], [...], and [[ASIN:0330375911 Writer's Journey]] with much greater success.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved the movie and watched it with my parents who are retired. They loved it as well! Love this group of English actors...and Indian actors as well. Highly recommended...and a must see!
0765325950|1.0|I just could not get into this book.  I was not able to increase the font for easier reading, the text didn't rotate when I placed it on its side, and it was not backlit for easy bedtime reading, it's heavy and not easy to carry around.  TOR, release the friction kindle version.  We didn't keep reading on stone tablets when paper was invented. : (
B003O86FMW|3.0|I am intrigued enough to continue to the third book, but it was definitely not as good as the first.
B00280LYHS|5.0|There are plenty of revelations in this final book. I have enjoyed this series tremendously. It's been an adventure reading about Percy and I'm sad to say goodbye.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Very durable, lightweight, and makes me feel a lot better knowing my kindle fire is safe!  Orange looks good too!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I'm totally enjoying this series and I'm immediately jumping into the next book now! Never mind it's 3:30am this story is that good.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes of it. I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes of it. I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really good so far.  it has superb graphics that look real! its a ton of fun to feed care and put your horse in compititions! i love it!!! the only problem is to get new horses and better equipment you have to buy them with gems and those you have to get with your real money... thats the only problem otherwise irs great! and very cute!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Had heard about this book and just had to read it. I found it very thought provoking and a good read.
0316182060|5.0|Perfect for fans of Gail Carriger's series, Parasol Protectorate. Alexia and her friends travel to Scotland to determine the reasons why the supernatural set can not morph.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|This is a nice case.  Good padding, nice color.  Would be nice if it had a full zipper and a strap to hold the kindle in securely.

B005LAIHGI|5.0|Awsome movie! thats all i got for you but i have to get more words so yeah good movie. thanks
B009IF82SK|5.0|The additions of Amy and Bernadette are fully integrated by now and I'd have to say the show is funnier than ever!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed the game and it makes me use my brain more. Wished there were no pop ups to interpret the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think it has to be the characters that really make this show great and keeps me coming back for more.
0765325950|1.0|The lack of a Kindle edition of this work greatly detracts from my enjoyment of this final volume of the Wheel of Time saga. I purchased the hard cover but no longer enjoy packing a huge book. I read that Robert Jordan's wife wants to protect his legacy by blocking release of an ebook version. I believe the reason has more to do with money.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the game but wish i could get energy a lot quicker than I do without having to spend my money.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Only 6 episodes, but they are all good. I love prequels. We can get to know the characters and how they got to where they are.<br /><br />Amazon did a good job streaming.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I thought this movie was much better than the 90s version.  It reminded me a little of \\"Die Hard\\" but just the building part; everything else was different. Overall, you won't be disappointed.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|I really like entertainment like this. It's very 300-ish [one of my fav movies]. There is a lot of killing, blood [very stylized], sex and nudity though, so get ready.  It breaks my heart that Andy Whitfield has died at such a young age - he was just getting started.<br /><br />Amazon did a good job streaming.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I was a teenager when this show was on. It had everything a show needs, humor, drama, good stories, wonderful supporting cast and two very good looking stars. Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul had amazing chemistry together.<br />I have all The seasons. It makes for a great collection.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was much more action  packed and kept me up many nights! I can not wait  till the next book
B004D2GMR6|5.0|Awesome!  I knew a lot about Bon Jovi's philanthropic work, so I researched his music.  I am so glad I did.  Have been listening to his music and enjoy it tremendously.  Live a Madison Square Garden is fantastic.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I mean it's okay. But it crashes all the time. It's also very laggy! The original was much better. But this is just okay
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app. I like how you can choose at what percentage of power remaining you want to be notified.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Interesting story, however, I thought it was too unbelievable.  I know it was a story, however, even a story should have some links to reality.
B009R8DJ72|4.0|Funny and thrilling, the third wheel is a great book, just like all the other books of the series. I cant say i didnt like it,but i was a bit upset with how small it was.<br /><br />Overall, its a must read for all the wimpy kid fans and is worth its price. Dont think too mich about it being short and just go with the flow and you will enjoy it.
B004QMW1NM|4.0|Came across this band in a snowboard video (The Art Of Flight) which I also highly recommend, and I immediately bought this record based on the two songs in that.  The songs All Of This, Young Blood, A Wolf In Geek's Clothing, and No Way are by far the best songs on this record though the other songs grow on you pretty fast and the next thing you know you're playing this record front to back almost daily.  Alisa Xayalith's beautiful, soothing voice drew me in to this band, and the musical similarities they share with Joy Division, New Order, and The Raveonettes kept me coming back.  Seriously her voice is incredible!  Buy this record now.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I only had a few problems with this movie:<br /><br />1). You couldn't see Urban's face, but I guess that adds to the mysteriousness of his character.<br />2).  The movie was pretty graphic with the violence ... especially the three poor bastards that got SKINNED and then thrown over the penthouse balcony.  You only got to see little snippets of the actual deed (who the hell would want to see ALL of it?) but it was still enough to thoroughly creep you out.  Definitely not recommended for little eyes/ears.<br />3).  The believability of Ma-Ma's rise to power.  Ex-whore/druggie over all those guys with guns?  That's gotta be one tough broad!<br /><br />Overall, Karl Urban is totally underrated.  That man is everywhere from the old Xena shows to &#34;Chronicles of Riddick&#34; to &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy to Star Trek's &#34;Bones&#34; McCoy&#34; and dozens of others in between.  I concur with one of the previous reviewers for this movie ... Urban IS Dredd!<br /><br />Liked the movie ... make a sequel, but maybe go a little easier on the graphic violence so younger eyes can appreciate it.  Dredd is a character from waaaaaayyyy back and it would be cool for younger folks to see some of the characters from our generation besides Batman, the Green Hornet, and Superman.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Stephen King's novel ([[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]]) is not at all faithful to its source.  In fact, Kubrick tosses out much of the novel and instead focuses on main character Jack Torrance's descent into madness.  Much has been made of the fact that Jack, as played by Jack Nicholson, appears to be unbalanced from the first moment he appears on screen, unlike his literary counterpart's gradual transformation.  This is true, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  The family unit of the film can hardly be called a unit at all.  Danny, possessed of a precognitive power dubbed \\"the shining,\\" shows many signs of having experienced abuse, as does his mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall).  Witness the scene where Danny goes to retrieve his fire truck and instead finds his father sitting on the edge of the bed.  Danny goes to him when called, but there is no love there, no comfort in Daddy's arms.  Wendy basically functions as a slave - doing household chores, preparing the meals, attending to the boiler (something Jack himself was hired to do), catering to her volatile husband and caring for Danny.  Familial relations deteriorate even further as winter sets in and Jack begins feeling the influence of what might possibly be the spirits of the hotel's past.  Kubrick is more vague in this area than King was.  What the Torrances are experiencing may well be manifestations of the supernatural, or perhaps simply the demons of psyches bent beyond repair by violence and hatred, aided no doubt by the isolation of The Overlook Hotel.  The camera prowls the seemingly endless corridors of the Overlook, stalking the Torrance family like some great unseen beast just waiting to pounce.  I love how Kubrick was able to evoke such a feeling of dread and apprehension using wide-open spaces and bright lighting.  The soundtrack, a mixture of electronic music by Wendy Carlos and several pieces of classical music, is simply brilliant and one of horror cinema's truly classic scores.  This film richly deserves the moniker \\"masterpiece of modern horror.\\"  No, it's not the book.  For a more faithful adaptation, viewers have the King-approved mini-series ([[ASIN:B000077VRT Stephen King's The Shining  (Two Disc Special Edition)]]).  For those with an open mind, or those simply seeking to experience one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, The Shining will do nicely, I think.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Couldn't put the book down! Very easy read. Sweet, romantic, hopefull that turns into a thriller! Love the flashbacks too!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Did not use the product, i bought to use skype for phone calls when out of the country and afters if talking on phone to amazon and an hour chating on line i gave up sent back for refund.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great fun,I'm not very good at it. Not as quick as I should be , but the nice thing is that when it restarts after you smacked yourself  or fell it's has different paths so you can't guess ahead so it keeps you on your toes. Cross your fingers that  get better at it cause I'm not giving up.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I thought this book was a little boring, it went into so much detail about what each person wore and the surroundings it took a while to getinto the story
B007THA4FI|3.0|As noted, a bit tedious a read, so not worth the cost to buy.  Wish I had gotten it from the library instead.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Since I lost my phone, this app is going to be a lifesaver for me. Especially since I have a very hecked schedule to keep up with.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've never written a review for any app I've downloaded or bought and liked but pinterest is one of a kind. Literally one of the best things that ever happened to me! I'm a day dreamer I love imagining my fairy tale future or even possible future and pinterest helps me do that even better because everything you can dream of or think.of is there. Tutorials, how-to' s , DIY, pictures, art quotes, houses, landscapes, food, fashion, movie stars, tattoo ideas,party and wedding ideas, interior design ideas, all your obsessions, good to know tips.... the list can go on forever. Every one needs this and everyone I've shown it to have fallen in love too. The best part is that unlike instagram that if you see something and you like it and want to repost it and keep it in your photos you really can't unless you snap shot it with pinterest when you repost it it saves in your profile albums to look back to and for others who are following you to see. Even by just liking the picture it'll save. The things you find on pinterest can be very helpful and probably the type of things you've been looking for all your life!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is easily the best book I have read in a long time. The first time I read it as a borrowed copy from a friend, and then I had to go out and buy my own. Everyone I know who has read it cried while reading it. That's one of the reasons I like this book so much. It causes you to feel very strobgly about the characters, and it does have real world connectiong to it. I also really like that the part you cry it can be your own. There isn't a specific part of this book that you're supposed to cry at. You cry when you cry and you laugh when you laugh, so when you read this book you can make it your own. It's also a thinking book, once you put it down or finish it, it causes you to think afterwards. I love this book so much (present tense)!! If you are considering this book I highly reccomend you go for it! You will not be dissapointed!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show!  Each season gets better and better.  Great plot and storyline; scary, jumpy, thrilling, it's the kind of show that you can't stop watching!

B005NJU8PA|4.0|The book was good, surprisingly so, since I do not cook. The book is not just about cooking, but about taking up anything new. Must read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me reading non stop. The premise of the games has changed and its just as intriguing. I really couldn't put it down
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! It is tons of fun and way better than temple run!!! I would get this app anyday.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are amazing on this game and its so much fun taking care of my virtual horse. Some of the quests/goals you are suppose to accomplish are a little confusing though. Also, I really want to customize my players name so it is a reflection of me but I'm stuck with the ridiculous name they gave me. Every time I try to change it, the game gives me an error code that says my tag is invalid. I wish someone would fix this little glitch :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you a are bored and apps suck, get this. I am not mad. Awesome, but needs a new update.<br />('_')('_')('_')('_')/ we at Steve's.<br /><br />Peace out, XD Gamer.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have owned these for 5 years. No problems with wear. You can hear everything with absolutely no distortion, crisp, clear sound...all tracks represented distinctly. Outside noise is completely blocked. Grab these while they are available, or you have to pay another hundred or two to reproduce this experience.

B004TTHLBE|5.0|Great read. The book draws you in, Gaiman at his best. Love to see if anyone could translate this to film. Marvel stand back.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I really do like angry birds but it does get old after a while. The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of three is because I got tired of launching birds over and over. if you really like angry birds and don't get tired of it, then obviously you will love this app.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I are both fans.  We have missed several of the series when on last year so it is nice to see them again and catch up with the whole story.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Loved all the songs released at singles and loved/liked all the other songs on the cd. I can listen to it over and over and over again. So good.

B00132D808|5.0|yes, it there is a definite Beatles influence. But, it's really good. I didn't like it at first, I missed the poppy, fast paced nature of the 1st album, but after multiple listenings I really got into and love it now.
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|Great guitarist, but excsessive on this live cd. Way too much dialogue.  Very capable covers of blues classics, but the chatter is distracting.  The best part of the cd is the bonus studio tracks at the end.
B004LP601S|5.0|I didn't like it at first but after multiple listenings I get it. And love it as much as the other 2 albums. I felt the same way with Pretty. Odd. but that grew on me too. Panic makes catchy music. Each and every album. It just takes more listenings for the 2nd and 3rd cds.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Hated it! Please save your money. It truly was a waste of time. The only reason why I kept watching it is because I paid for it. I didn't want to feel, as though I wasted my money. But in reality, I really did. You really can wait until it comes on Prime or it becomes free at some point in time, okay.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|I could drone on about how Logan's Run is half a decent film, how it pales beside its contemporaries ([[ASIN:B0016I0AJG Soylent Green]] and especially [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]]), and absolutely wilts against genre heavyweights (like [[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner]] and [[ASIN:B00005ASUM 2001: A Space Odyssey]]), how stupid Farrah Fawcett is in her very small (but still too large) role, how the entire third act seems like a [[ASIN:B000HKYOK0 Classic Trek]] episode.<br /><br />But I won't. Or at least, not too much. Better to save my time (and yours). Just read this:<br /><br />Dystopian tale starts out solidly enough, but doesn't carry through<br />October 16, 2009<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R130FJZB32SRIL

B006QS07IK|5.0|Frankenstein is a classic that has made people fall in love with literature for decades. This leather bound edition is fantastic beyond words! I strongly recommend it. If you love this one, you should also check out The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong but this is the best game I found for it yet! It has so many different board layouts which helps to keep it fresh.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|This is just a soft cover.  I went to Brookstone and bought a hard cover/sleeve that can stay on the Kindle while you use the Kindle and can protect the Kindle much better.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I told my wife today that &#34;A HIGHER CALL&#34; is the best book I have ever read, I am 84 years old and served in the Army Air Force, also the United States Air Force. I flew for a little over 32 years and earned Command Pilot Wings. I think my background gives me the right to judge a story/book such as this book. Just an old Colonel DeVere D. Woods Ret.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Coulld not put the book down, once I got into it. For me it started out a little slow.<br />I did enjoy.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|First half of book is brilliant.  In simple terms explains new concepts in astronomy/ cosmology extremely well.  I found second half of book to be a bit preachy and repetitious.  Overall, book is highly recommended for those wanting to understand how universe was formed and still evolving.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Yes it was very exciting and well made. It's better than the new zero dark 40 which rehashed all we already knew. This was just action
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper is an intriguing sci-fi action thriller. Interesting plot. Good acting. It's definitely worth the time and money. If you liked 12 Monkeys, then you will like this film.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|One of the very few times I've enjoyed a movie more than the book, but this isn't even close. For example, I'm a big Jack Reacher fan and that book was a lot better than that movie.

B008K8U13K|4.0|My 4yr old loves it.  She plays it on her tablet and the details are good.  Controlling the movement left/right while jumping is still a little hard but she loves it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I do admit to seeing the movie first, but I was surprised that the book was so similar. Overall both were great
B0018QQQK8|4.0|What a fantastic story! I just can't seem to get enough Nicholas Sparks! I rented the movie and am looking forward to watching it too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have been playing this app for a couple of hours and it seems to work smoothly.  It is a large file to download but works well.  Seems like a game I will want to play for a long time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Lots of fun, great graphics!  Better than the first.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm afraid I'm going to get stuck @ level 7 forever, the goals are pretty crazy!
B004ZJZPX4|4.0|Good heist movies can be a lot of fun, and Inside Man is one of my favorites. Why is the genre interesting? I think it's because it's fascinating to see a robbery unfold, and the particular method used. In order to keep us interested in what could be a stale topic, modern heist movies have tried to invent new ways to pull off such a crime. Inside Man is one of the most inventive that I have seen.<br /><br />There are countless examples of strong entries in the genre. I'm particularly fond of The Killing, from Stanley Kubrick, which showed us how a robbery might be planned and executed. His use of a narrator was especially effective. Another favorite is Dog Day Afternoon, which is even mentioned in Inside Man. The original version of The Italian Job (1969) focuses on the getaway; Jackie Brown and Heat are more concerned with characters and the method; while more recent efforts, such as Reservoir Dogs and The Town, focus on events after the robbery has taken place.<br /><br />Inside Man falls into the same category as The Killing and Jackie Brown, and it works because the method is so unusual.<br /><br />The story opens with a shot of the gang's leader, Dalton Russell (Owen), advising us to listen closely to what he says. He hints at what is to come, but you might not appreciate the full meaning of his comments until you see the movie a second time. His team dresses as painters and seizes control of a bank, taking around 20 or 30 hostages in the process.<br /><br />The movie doesn't stick to a completely linear structure. Instead, we see some of the former hostages being interviewed by the police after the robbery is over. This choice works well, and we gradually come to understand why Russell's gang made the hostages wear painter's outfits.<br /><br />Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) is called in to negotiate with Russell in order to resolve the situation. Frazier has his own ideas about how things should be handled, and some of his decisions seem risky and unconventional. He's also an intelligent man, and quickly realizes that Russell doesn't expect his demands to be met. So why is he committing the crime?<br /><br />The two other key characters are Arthur Case (Plummer), who owns the bank, and Madeleine White (Foster), who is hired by Case for a specific purpose.<br /><br />I'm not going to reveal any more about the plot because it's best to see it unfold for yourself. Washington and Owen are both excellent choices for their respective roles, and each gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />The movie contains a few twists, and the ultimate resolution is pleasing. I find myself returning to it often, and it always feels fresh. I'm surprised that it hasn't received more critical acclaim. If you are a fan of Washington or Owen, it's worth checking out.ventional.

B002LB13SE|5.0|This is a remake of one of the most disturbing movies ever made. This version is just as disturbing as the original if not more. I got this movie for my collection but honestly, I don't even want to go to the theatre that I saw it in anymore.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Follett does a good job with historical accuracy of events outlined in his books. His characters are well built and believable.
B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|This is a low budget old school horror movie, It is extremely well done!!! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THE PREVIEW for this movie, it preempts the whole movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan's novel is a magnificent journey full of Greek and Roman gods and monsters. Many heroes are also born throughout this epic tale of comedy and intense action.<br />The story's main character, Percy Jackson, finally is able to meet his girlfriend Annabeth. But the two of them do not have time for love. Once they meet each other, seven demigods, including Percy and Annabeth, must go on a quest to Greece to save the world. However, fate changes and Annabeth is called on an emergency to help her mother Athena restore peace.<br />The book shares an important connection with me: the value of friendship. Throughout the story, Riordan teaches us that the key to saving the world is not individual strength, but the strength of friendship. He reminds us that when things look bad, true friends will always be there to for you.<br />Riordan's novel proves to be a compelling, engaging, and fun book to read. Unless you are not a fan of science fiction or Greek and Roman mythology, I would definitely recommend this book to you. It is a tale of adventure that will keep you at the edge of your seat.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! This book is pretty amazing! I honestly love Augustus. I recommend this book to each and every person who even remotely tolerates books...you won't regeneration  it.

B008MG1E4A|2.0|Please don't misunderstand.  As a military wife and mom, I so appreciate the work our service members do.  They're amazing in their ability to show up with courage and dedication in horrifying situations then come home to care for their families with love and gentle hands.  A great deal of hype surrounded this book - I expected more from someone with the author's background.  I couldn't get past the feeling I was reading about his training instead of his experience.  Read Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell and compare the two.  Lone Survivor is riveting, straight forward and no nonsense -  raw courage and candor seeps from the printed words.  I even bought the hard copy after I read the digital on my Kindle.  No disrespect intended Mr. Owen, it's all about opinion.
B000J159N8|4.0|This is my very first time writing a review for any movie. After watching this movie, it bring back some memories of my experience as a child born in Saigon, Vietnam.Even thought I have never seen any actions regarding the Vietnam war my self. I've only experienced it through my mother's story and some history books. I was less than a year old when my father die fighting for the South Vietnamese government.<br />Watching the part about the American soldier wives being notify about their husband was kill in action, bring me to tears. Now I can understand what my mother went through when she got the news that her husband was kill in action, and left with 4 children to raise on her own. Most American now think that the Vietnam War was a loss cause and we have should have no business being there. Think about it, the North Vietnamese only want to fight to win their independent from the French, not to invade any countries. Ho Chi Minh did went to the Geneva Convention and try to convince the US and the world to get support for Vietnam's independent from the French. The US was France ally, so we veto with a \\" NO \\". We now know how that decision turn out. 536,100 soldiers sent to war, 58,220 die, 303,644 wounded. From the North Vietnamese side, more than 1 million solders dies, 1.7 millions wounded, 4 millions Vietnamese civilian casualties. I think every American and politicians should watch this movie before their send our American soldiers to any war in the future.<br />Have the US learn our listen from the Vietnam War? Obviously not! The Iraq War, 4,800 soldiers die, wounded 33,184, 600,000 Iraq civilian casualties and cost 2.6 Trillions US dollars, and this does not include the NATO tropps.<br />The Afghanistan War, 2,000 soldiers die, 17,000 wounded and this does not include the NATO troops, cost 1.4 Trillion US dollars. Is all the American lives worth the cost for American's corporations that supply to the US military?<br />With the War War II, I understand why the reason we all are fighting for. W W II was a war with a very good cause...to get rid of Hitler. Now, are the US just fighting to prove that we are the all mighty and the powerful people of the planet earth? Ask yourself, are we going to fight and kill each other until the extinction of all human kinds? I'm sure the animal kingdom will love this idea...because their all know that they will all live in peace when human are all extinct. Maybe that's how Mar was before earth existed.

B008BM9L72|2.0|Very juvenile writing style, weak story line,  repetetive descriptions,overall very disappointing but I sure the author is laughing all the way to the bank
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm going to enjoy this because now both my husband and I can read the same book on different devices and won't be taking &#34;turns&#34; to read only from the Kindle.  I still prefer my Kindle because it is lighted so I can read in bed at night without distrubing my husband and since I am more familiar with it, it's easier to use the dictionary, highlight passages, and search.  Thanks, though for offering the android adaption.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I really liked the movie, as I read a lot of science fiction. The 3D was very good as compared to some.
B00170DEM8|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. Ahhh...What a classic. A must see every Holiday season. The music and dancing is fantastic.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite movies. I don't just watch it at Christmas time. When I need to have hope restored to me about the human race, I watch this movie. Plus I have a new memory attached to it. When my daughter was very little, she would go around ringing as many bells as possible, because she wanted all the angels in heaven to have wings. She is now a freshman in college & bells make me smile and think of her.
B005XN31LY|1.0|I really thought I would like this one, but its not for me. Not a good cast, and not very good acting. I think the writing was poorly done.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story was epic in my eyes, I am a space freak so was immersed in the story immediately.<br />Very believable tech was woven into a tense and dramatic tale.<br />I gave it five stars for any sci fi fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hooked the first episode. The characters are wonderful, and the plot believable ( sans the zombies). They did a great job with casting characters. There are spooky and gory parts, so would not have kids younger than 15 watching this.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|A slam dunk!<br /><br />This is the perfect accent to my Plantronics Legend bluetooth headset!!  I can charge twice with no cords
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've had this game for a couple of months and in my original review I gave it 1 star because there were too many glitches and the game would constantly freeze. The game has finally updated and it works really well. I can't say that there aren't any glitches but they are 97% gone. Other than that, graphics are awesome! I also love that while the game is quite easy to figure out it's still challenging. No two runs are alike and it gets more difficult the longer you last in a run. Beware, however, you can purchase in game content like coins, gems and a coin doubler. These items can help you upgrade your abilities, and obtain power ups and new characters faster than earning them in game. Make sure you have a purchase pin or password, though, if you have younger children playing the game. All-in-all, I have to say Temple Run 2 is loads of fun and very addicting!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It was challenging and fun with that eerie kind of scenery from a scary movie. Loved the story line. Looking forward to the second one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun and the graphics are ok. Wish you didnt have to wait so long to gain more energy but it's fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome!! its like my actual own horse!! you can have it compete you can feed it teach it how to compete give it treats!!! you should get this game!!! I'm addicted to it!!!!!
B007TK77QE|5.0|It was a realistic look at human nature and prejudices.  It makes you want to change yourself and what you may be able to do that makes a difference
1592402038|2.0|Eats, Shoots, and Leaves by Lynne Truss is often longer than necessary, occasionally insightful, and usually snarky. Although I hoped for a useful and entertaining grammar guide, I found instead two hundred pages of complaints about modern usage peppered with references to grammarians with whom the author would like to sleep. I was able to trudge through the book in its entirety only due to its brevity and simplistic style. Not worth reading again or even reading once.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It won't start up on my kindle XO!!! It's a good game but for the first day. Now it doesn't wanna start up :(
0143112724|5.0|The Elements of Style by Strunk and White is a valuable guide to the budding writer and reference for the experienced. The book is filled with insight, advice, and methods for better prose. Although it is grammar training, the book is completely readable. In this aspect, the illustrations are helpful; they break the monotony of the training.  Since I fall into the less practiced class of writers, my reading of the book is bound to be the first of many times I will peer into its pages.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|this game is really confusing and i am a very good game player so if you dont like boring games dont try it
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea. Also, there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity, though all of it is done in an explicit-yet-entirely-implied manner exclusive to Hemingway's style. This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love, morality, Communism, duty, awareness of death, and bravery in the face of death. Specifically, impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters.  A good first read but not necessarily worth a return.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was just as good as the first! On to read the last one now, can't wait to see what happens!
0307592731|1.0|What a disappointment. I did not read or hear Oprah's reviews. If I had, I probably would not have read the book.(As I am not into personal tradgedy stories or whiny, self-indulgent women claiming they need to discover themselves.) I was anticipating a narrative about the trail, the wilderness, the beauty of the mountains, from a woman's perspective. Instead we heard about how stupid she was to buy boots that were too small and never having back-packed before, brought along way too much stuff. I have done that before on my first back-pack trip of 3 days. But will not over pack again. What ever happened to the concept of a day trip to test out equipment for fit, ease of use. etc? And she never heard of hiking poles or walking sticks? I'll bet the REI folks were rolling with laughter at this story, except that she blamed them for her poor choices in equipment. And did she ever consider checking the weather? She missed most of the actual trail in the high Sierra because it was covered in record-breaking amounts of snow. Now that is just dumb!<br />She was so ill prepared that it made my head hurt and I almost put the book in the recycle bin right away.I'm sorry; being stupid and attempting such challenging activities that are dangerous in such a cavalier manner is idiotic. Why does our culture glorify this kind of risky behavior???? For the thrill of brushing death?? So many of these stunts end badly and even put rescuers in grave danger because of stupid behaviors. And no, not all young people do are idiots. Being young is not an excuse for being stupid. I'm exhausted by the accounts of overcoming \\"tragedy\\" when the writer has put him/herself in the most dangerous, risky position TOTALLY unprepared. (Think: Into the Wild.)<br />The only part of the book that touched me was the discription of the sad incident of killing her horse. Strayed has a most excellent writing style.She kept me interested enough to finish the book. Maybe fiction is more her genre. Wilderness andnature writing is surely not it!.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fantastic game play, love the graphics,looks better in 3d, can't wait for the third one to come out,AWESOMENESS,don't you agree?
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is hilarious, the plot is great. Perfect for a girl's night in. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
098478280X|5.0|Book describes approaches , examples and  solutions for different interview topics. Please read some chapters before you buy this book. It will give you  some idea about level of interview questions.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I love Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, so of course I loved this movie! Very funny and I know I will watch it over and over again.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|Like many others, I've been waiting for years for a good Halo movie. I know, I know... this really isn't a &#34;movie&#34;, but once they assembled all the parts, it is excellant, and you could have fooled me! This sets a very high bar for the &#34;professional&#34; movie makers, when (or 'if') they get around to making movie.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I have finished the whole trilogy and have really enjoyed it from beginning to  end.<br /><br />can't say much more than that
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|My husband really enjoyed Lawless.  He thought it was a movie worth watching if you like the moonshining era or just like understanding how life was back in those years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is very very fun I have not stopped playing it since I got my mom to bye.  This morning the first thing I asked was &quot;may I play on the kendle?&quot;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A glimpse into the lives of the privileged English and those who served them in the early 1900's. Maggie Smith steals the show as the family matriarch.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|There is not any instructions really don't know  what to do  cant get to screen to screen easy has captions that mean nothing just stating the obvious about the screen  no where to go to find out what your doing wrong  My  opinon  does not work so worthless and unless you want to send me a e-mail to resolve this I am deleteing this.
0765325950|5.0|First, I have to say I've been reading this series since the early 90s.  20+ years! Wow. I've really enjoyed the series, and even while it bogged down in the middle, I still looked forward to the next book in the series.  I closely watched Jordan's health on the net, and had hopes, and then the day occurred when Jordan left us.  I'm very happy that Brandon took the helm on this.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and felt it was a proper ending.  There were many surprises, and there were more than a few character deaths I didn't foresee.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was around Padan Fain. I was hoping for something more elaborate.<br /><br />Finally, I was actually quite shocked at my emotional pain at ending the series.  It really hit me. This is the end. The end of 20 years of reading these stories, ~4.4 million words, getting to know the core 6-8 main characters like reading stories about friends in a frightening, but exciting, story.  Even with the pain of waiting 2 years for the next book, we still had it to look forward to.  No more!<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan.  Thank you Brandon Sanderson.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game if you thought regular temple run this game will make it look lame!! It actually has slopes and curved paths, great animation and and sometimes you have to ride on mine cars and zip line on some ropes. You can also use gems that you collect to resurrect or buy power ups. Instead of just powering up for all characters you can pick different power ups for each character you have! Plus its free!(:
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This book did not captivate me like her other books did. I had a hard time getting into the book but liked it more as I read on.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|loved it. challenges your mind.  lots of steps to think through. one of the best puzzle games I've played.  will look for more like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a fantastic book! The mystery of what happened on their anniversary kept me reading this book until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. My favorite thing about his book (as well as her other book Dark Places) is that you read from each person's point of view, which gives you a much better perspective into their lives.
B0095D8ZAA|5.0|i have been waiting for this awesome game to be released for the kindle fire! i am a thirty-something year old momma who loves this game... it is challenging, fun, and entertaining!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book kept me intrigued to the point that I did not want to put the book down. Such a great mystery!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I just had to know what happened next! This was a great read, Flynn is a great author.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|i choose to give this app a 2-star rating because on my kindle fire, its really slow. i dont know if this has been a problem with other Fires, but it has been on mine. im a real horse-lover and i was looking foward to using this app. im quite disappointed on how it turned out.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 80's is familiar with Ferris Bueller! He's great! This movie is great. To quote Ferris &#34;Like is short, if you don't stop to smell the roses, you might miss something!&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have had this game for 1 day and I love it!I already have all of the characters. GREAT game
B006YTTVHO|5.0|very useful and practical book. short and concise, get to the point very quick. helpful to people not talk so much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so much fun. I would recommend this app and other apps made by this company to anyone. and yes I have played this app
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so wonderful. I love to see the way things were done long ago, it keeps me guessing.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is totes Awesome! Rick Riordan is a GENIOUS!! I have also read the Percy Jackson series and its my second favorite series. (The Hunger Games is the best)
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked<br />Part 1is better. The games is not much thrilling. So who won? Now the capitol is in danger. Can`t wait to read book 3.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is a little bit confusing at first but after you play it for a couple of minutes you will get the hang of it, it is lots of fun but takes up memory space.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Imagine listening to music that makes you feel cooler.  This is it for me.  Definitely not for amateurs.  This is for the true Steely Dan fan...Long live Donald Fagen. Yeah. There's gas in the car!!!
B000000XBC|4.0|I liked Creedence Clearwater and when I found this album available I hopped for it - not quite as good as Volume one, but fine.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another gem from Tom Clancy. Great story that weaves topical issues into the character's histories in typical, detailed to the hilt, Clancy style. Not the best Clancy has ever done, but a quality read that leaves you wanting more at the end.
B000000XB9|5.0|I had misplaced my copy and had to replace it - this is a great album and I wouldn't be without it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful, stunningly crafted show! I can't believe I waited to so long to watch it, and now that I've watched all the past episodes, I eagerly await the playing of the next episode on PBS. The costumes, jewelry, furnishings, castle, grounds...all are magnificent! The storylines are well written and wonderfully performed. I can't think of anything I do not particularly relish of this show at all....You MUST watch from the first episode, however, or you may become muddled in the stories, but it is well worth it to immerse yourself in it. Love, love, love Maggie Smith -- she was perfectly cast for her role! Can't say enough good about it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome Game I liked it. It was the best game I ever played I wish all hidden object games were like this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive but fun. Not sure how birds can make you want to play again and again but they do. You keep coming back for another level!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved this movie, always wondered how they all got started.  I loved this series on TV. and watched all of them.
B005LAII62|4.0|Saw the movie with my grandaughter. She was 4 and really didn't understand the scarier parts but really laughed at some parts too-where he kissed the wrong of the dog
B0010YPTGU|5.0|My friends actually went to this concert and told me all about it. I just had to buy it for myself. This is beautiful and will make your heart happy! Highly recommend.
1451627297|5.0|This book blew my mind. Brilliantly crafted and beautifully written. I went through every emotion in existence while reading it. I fell in love with the characters and didn't want my time with them to end. It wasn't just a book, it was an experience. I loved it.
0385340540|5.0|If you love John Grisham and Italy, this is a fun read! I could see the places in my memory as I read.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This starts out as a group of scientists known as the RDA(Resource Developement Association) going to the planet Pandora to study the Na'vi. Grace and her team have a genuine plan to study the Indigenous tribe, but the head of the RDA is looking for a very valuable mineral, and will stop at nothing to get it. Grace and her team are asked to take on the form of the Na'vi using Avatars to look like them. The Na'vi are very Religious and have very sacred ways. After Jake reveals what he's really there for, they feel betrayed and don't want anything else to do with him. By this time he's fallen in love with Neytiri and the Na'vi, and he doesn't want to betray them but they don't want Jake or Grace there anymore.The RDA attempt to move in but the Na'vi plan to fight to protect their land, as well as Hometree where they dwelled and the tree of souls, where they believed their dead went; To be with their Deity Eywa.Jake and Grace(Dr. Augustine)were used by the RDA to try and get the Na'vi to leave their dwelling place, and because of their greed they didn't care who they had to hurt to get the minerals they were after. The Na'vi weren't this Religious sect who were trying to force their ways or beleifs on anyone, they were simple in their everyday lives. This kind of thing often happens to the Indigenous. They are often in the possession of great wealth, be it land or minerals and there's always someone out to take advantage of them, not considering their sacred beliefs or religious beliefs. And in some instances people will come in the name of religion to get what they want from the Indigenous. Needless to say there was a great battle between the special forces of the RDA and the Na'vi. Jake won the Indigenous over and helped them fight against the special forces and they won. In most cases today the Indigenous don't win.
0345803507|5.0|While not as hot as the first book, this was a nice end to a love story. There are places (as in the other &#34;50 shades&#34; books) where you can quickly breeze over sex scenes (I mean, we got it) but I liked how this story ended.
0525953590|4.0|I took a lower division physics class in College and have been interested in physics for the last couple years, but you had better have at least a layman's passing knowledge of particle physics or you will be instantly lost and bored with this book.  Carroll does an excellent job of staying away from the math of physics and does a beautiful job of reviewing the history and building an understanding of the concepts of quantum physics in this book.  I'm still not absolutely sure what the Higgs boson or Higgs mechanism really is or does, but I can now spout names and concepts about it to anyone interested.  When the search for the &#34;Higgs&#34; was called the search for the God particle, I thought it was funny that Carroll mentioned that only the people who believe in God  and the people who didn't believe in God were offended by the sobriquet.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always been fasinated by this subject, Dr. Alexander brings you right along with him and his experiance through out. When he speaks of the function of the brain, he does it in a way we understand. Loved it
030759565X|3.0|I have followed the blog for a long time and was excited to get the cookbook, but once you take out breakfast and desserts there aren't too many dinner recipes, which is what I usually go to cookbooks for.<br /><br />The book is lovely but the format is pretty unfortunate. As other reviewers have noted, a lot of the recipes are on opposite sides of a page so you have to keep flipping back and forth. I just made a recipe this weekend where the last couple of ingredients were bumped to the second page without any type of \\"continued\\" on the first page, and I didn't notice them until it was already in the oven. Bad idea for a cookbook. Proportions do seem off here and there, as well (a cup of buttermilk plus a whole stick of butter in two pounds of potatoes makes for some kind of gross mashed potatoes).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Whats better? Temple Run 2!!! The best game I ever played. Another hit. I love you Amazon! Keep it up with these brilliant sequels! Id love a sequel to subway suffer too. ;)
1579126510|5.0|I love this set, the pages are beautifully arranged.  I bought this when I was looking to add to my personal library and wanted to find some of the classics in special edition settings.  There's just something about holding a book that has weight to it (and isn't a textbook).  If you're looking for something to add to your own collection or to give as a gift then this is definitely an excellent idea.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game stopped working after a day of use and it wouldn't let me reopen the app to play.but if you would like to play it I give it an overall c+
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I realy like this 1 and the other one they have called Atlantis by same writers! I bought the other Atlantis game and play it a lot so far. I plan on buying this 1 also next payday.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Its an awesome game except for the fact that my coins disappeared! I I had like $4000 but I played another round hoping to get $5000, but when I looked after I was done, I only had like a thousand! It's like a thousand coins just disappeared. I can't even get the second character because this keeps happening. once imangi fixes it, I'll rate it 5 stars.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Has many different derivatives to words in the dictionary. Lets you click on words related to the one you are looking at.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves it. She cant put it down. Every time I turn around she is on it. Cant get her off.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD, I was a little disappointed.  After several more times, it is one of my favs.<br />Love, Love, Love Rihanna.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun new features!  Love the mine car......occasional glitch with gems but overall fun to play for the entire family.  Also like the new character images...very realistic
B007712XAU|5.0|Very well done. I really liked it. I got my daughter-in-law hooked on it too.<br />I can't wait to get the next season.  thank you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was drfinitely a thriller.  It was written quite well with a lot of expression so that it is difficult to put down until the very end!  It certainly is not for anyone who might be suffering through infidelity and depression.
0765325950|3.0|While I think Brandon Sanderson is an excellent writer, I am much more \\"satisfied\\" with his Stormlight series than I was with the \\"end\\" of the WoT series.  I don't think for one second this is the last we will see of the WoT universe.  I don't think Brandon will do doing the writing.  He has taken too much of his time doing what he did.  I believe the problem here is with Robert Jordans widow.  I understand she would not allow the Ebook version until a year after release as it is not counted towards the NY Times best seller list.  I understand she is the editor and his wife (Robert Jordan).  But, geez, stop with the stringing this along.  Is a great story, let it end like one.<br />I am looking forward very much to stormlight 2.  And, my review is in no way a reflection on Brandon Sanderson.  He went above and beyond with this.  The ending was dictated to him and he had no option but to end it the way he did.  I am done with WoT.  The milk ran dry from this cow long ago.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was totally under the radar. We took a chance at it and loved it. Great cast, music was fresh and catchy. The comedy was on going and so random but fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game keep my niece active because she likes horses. I also be catching myself playing lol. Great app to have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are truly no words to describe how amazing this book is. I was  completely engulfed by the story. I never wanted it to end. Not just another romance novel, it's so much more than that. Spectacular story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keeps me entertained. Very hard to stop playing. Keeps your mind working. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did
1595825045|5.0|I got this as a Christmas Gift for my Girlfriend, and by far it seemed to be the gift she was the most excited about receiving and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun game for someone who loves horses. I just wish there was a way to buy gems using your coins to buy horses. I'm not playing for anything out putting my credit card info on anything. If they'd change that if five it a five. :)
B009YQJ322|5.0|This Movie is amazing, blows the 90s Stallone film out of the water and perfectly captures the Spirit of Judge Dredd and is a visual feast for the eyes.<br /><br />Also I encourage DVD sales because I really really want them to make a sequel
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great game, but after pressing &quot;save me&quot;, it crashes.  Really annoying if you just beat your high score because it doesnt save.  This makes me not even want to play anymore.
B008220B0C|5.0|Although Katy Perry did not release a full blown concert video of her great &#34;California Dreams tour&#34; much to the dismay of her adoring fans,(myself included),this movie should satisfy even the most die-hard Katycat. Though its a bit too much documentary and not enough concert, it gives a real look into one of pop musics more interesting stories. It's a great look at how Katy overcame a sheltered childhood, and through a lot of hard work and many disappointments she plugged on and through a combination of  catchy tunes and thoughtful lyrics , not to mention a chameleon persona that puts most &#34;supermodels&#34; to shame,was able to hit the top of the entertainment world, being the only other person besides Michael Jackson,and the ONLY woman to have 5 #1 songs off the same album. This should satisfy her fans and open up a new world to people who knew her tunes, but didn't know the hard working, driven woman who dreamed a dream and made it a reality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is by far the most addictive game I have ever played! I love it. It rarely freezes but when it does its not for long. Great app. I would recommend this to everyone with a kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very addictive and fun. I always like the G5 games. I look forward to the next one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game Is really really good, I enjoyed Temple Run, and I was really excited when I saw Temple Run 2. I play it a lot and enjoy it.<br /><br />One reason I like it is the new features, such as swinging ropes across pits, and the ability to bring your character back to life when you bang into something or fall.<br /><br />A lot of my friends also say they really enjoy Temple Run 1 &amp; 2. I heard about it from them. I thought &quot;Maybe it's a really good game, I guess I can try it.&quot; Then after I did, I loved it. I rate this 4 stars.<br /><br />1 Reason I don't give 5 stars is that sometimes when I swipe, it doesn't respond, maybe it's just a technical problem. I'm being honest, I recommend this game otherwise.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was very good. I can't believe I haven't seen this book for the past 6 years or so.  If you like sci fi, you will enjoy this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is LEGENDARY!!!!  There is one bad thing.....only 4 characters but you get specialties for each.  It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B007N85POS|4.0|What can I say about Angry Birds Very easy to get hooked on this game. Something great to have when you have to wait a while somewhere.
B003JBI2KM|3.0|Same informative book as in print, but table formatting not preserved.  Also formulas seem to be image files, so if you prefer to use sepia for page color, equations stand out as white, somewhat blurry rectangles.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|the price for this set was too good to pass by, as this is a collection I have wanted for a long time!  I had read a review about the packaging and took it to heart when removing each disc:  squeeze each side of the pack as you remove a disc...this way it opens the packing wide enough to remove the disc without scratching it.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|easy install<br />bypassed facebook with no problems<br />slightly awkward finding youtube searsh, but ok now<br />watched the tube i wanted to see<br />i like it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Really liked this one, very interesting. Kind of strange but good. Love and excitement in one book. Recommend to all ages
B0064T6LV8|3.0|The table looks great, but my fat fingers hovering over it to use the flippers makes this game almost unplayable.  I can only see the upper half of it and the hyper sensitive touch screen of the HD makes it go off even when I don't quite touch it.  On the bright side the sounds are good and the game play is smooth if you can see it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this series and season 8 doesn't disappoint! Can't wait to buy every season on Blu ray. Love these guys!
B005JABSB6|5.0|Works as designed. Very light weight and they fit comfortably over our glasses. The glasses appear to be sturdy and they are easy to recharge.
B0097L29KM|4.0|It is not Neil's greatest release, but it is Neil with Crazy Horse and we can never get enough of that.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very nice interface, easy to use. Downloaded  it to troubleshoot a problem with my wireless at home and worked very well.
B004HD61KE|1.0|Boring, only finished this book so I could warn others how boring and unbelievable the story is. Waste of time even a comic book would be more interesting.
B004RZGUBM|1.0|Unfortunate - I purchased the Complete Works of DH Lawrence, which I was very happy with so also went for this one - when I tried to download it it informs me that it is not compatible with Kindle for Windows 8.<br /><br />This should be made clearer in the description.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Beecham House, the setting of this film, is an English country estate, a posh historical mansion surrounded by acres of park and garden. It's autumn, the leaves are gorgeous, Golden Pond was never so scenic, and the inhabitants -- a couple dozen octogenarian \\"retired professional musicians living on charity -- are effectively in Paradise. They're a handsome crowd too, these oldsters with much of their talent and all of their ego intact. Not an oxygen tank or a movable chemo-drip in sight! Alzheimer's, senility, dementia? Acknowledged but quaintly innocuous. Crotchets and squabbles? No worse than among younger folk. A doctor in residence and a staff of sympathetic nurses? Hey, nothing but the ritz for beloved stars of yestershow! A real place? Don't we wish, we soon-to-be-aged musicians! It's fantasyland, but I'm NOT complaining. The film is too visually luscious not to be appreciated, and the acting is too artful not to be admired.<br /><br />Bill Connolly has the \\"Peter Pan\\" role as Wilfred, the irrepressible flirt and funster of Beecham House. Pauline Collins is the sparkly but memory-challenged Cecily, the perfect Tinkerbell to run errands and deliver messages in this musical Neverland. Tom Courtenay is Reginald, earnest and unimpaired though subtly challenged by his own realism in this kingdom of Children Who Decline to Grow Old. Maggie Smith is the haughty, acerbic narcissistic super-diva Jean, to whom falls the Captain Hook role of antagonist. We the audience all know that she'll be captured eventually, conquered by joie de vivre, and join the Lost Boys in their climactic gala rumpus. Great fun! Who doesn't love Peter Pan?<br /><br />\\"Getting old is what people do,\\" says Reginald somewhere in the middle of the film, and ain't that the bleary-eyed truth! I've seen three movies in real theaters this winter -- Quartet, A Separation, and Michael Haneke's devastating Amour -- all of them focusing my 71-year-old attention on aging and dying. Is this some kind of omen? Foreboding? A warning shot across the bow of my walker? I won't grow up! I won't grow up! Peter? Tinkerbell? Where are you now that I need you?<br /><br />Perhaps Dustin Hoffman is the J.M. Barrie of our generation.n? Foreboding? A warning shot across the bow of my walker? I won't grow up! I won't grow up! Peter? Tinkerbell? Where are you now that I need you?<br /><br />Perhaps Dustin Hoffman is the J.M. Barrie of our generation.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It kept my interest and I thought it was a truthful and vivid depiction of life for slaves and gentry at that time and how hypocritical slave owners were with their disgust  of slaves and at the same time, using them as mistresses.  I also liked  that the author showed how the owners could be enslaved in a way and how that changed the dynamics of their relationship with the slaves.  I enjoyed it.
0312383320|3.0|I expected more and didnt get it.  I am finshed with Evanovich books for awhile.  I really wanted this one badly and was disappointed for the first time with her books..
0765325950|5.0|It's funny to think that I was in high school when I started reading this series; and now after college, getting married,  2 teenagers, and 3 career changes WOT is finally finished. It has certainly had an impact on me throughout my life, and though it may be completed I will surely re-visit the series now & then.<br /><br />I was going to rate AMOL 4 stars because it does have its flaws and there are better written books out there. However, Amazon's rating scale defines 4 stars ad 'I liked it' and 5 stars as 'I loved it', and so I rated it 5 stars because I do love the book, despite its imperfections.<br /><br />What I would have preferred to have been written differently: First, plot threads drag on too long and then resolve abruptly. As an example, the seemingly neverending battle between Perrin & Slayer somewhat lost its excitement for me with all the repetitive hunting & chasing sequences (though I did like how they would travel between the wolf dream and the real waking world), and therefore seemed a bit anti-climatic at the end. I also felt that the conversation between Rand and Tuon was too quick and easy of a way to bring closure to that plot thread. These are just a couple examples of what felt to me like the authors' general way of bringing many plots to their end.<br /><br />What I think was well done: It was a page turner and I enjoyed the balance between all the action & fighting with the character development. Yes, it was almost constant battle but there was much humanity, emotion, and personality shining through in each major character - and I felt invested in them. I also thought the last battle itself played out nicely with all its complexities. And I thoroughly enjoyed reading the captures, turnings, and rescue attempts in the Black Tower, as well as reading Mat's POV's (mostly just because Mat is my favorite character).<br /><br />Overall a great read and among my favorites in the WOT. On a side note, Tor's strategy for holding the release of ane-version backfired on them for people like me. I bought the hardcover specifically to complete the collection on my bookshelf. I would have also bought the Kindle version to read, but will probably not now that I have read the book. I suspect there are others besides me who they lost out on getting 2 purchases. If they ever release an entire series package price in e format I might buy it. Otherwise I will just read the books sometime again, like the way I've read for most of my 39 years anyway.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am in love with this band. They have a modern sound that is rich with their roots. Their videos on lastFM are full of stunning imagery that seems derived from their myths and folklore. Nanna and Ragnar's vocals seamlessly blend and evoke strong emotions, possibly from the depths of genetic memory. I like or fully love every track on this debut album. I can't stop listening. I hope I can catch a live show soon. Halda uppi the góður vinna!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the first review I've been truly compelled to write. If you don't mind reading a book that challenges you to think a bit this one is for you. Andy Weir has done the impossible, he's written a very technical book in a truly fun, exciting, and entertaining manner. He's made engineering, chemistry, and even botany very cool.<br />My father is a retired NASA guy and I've made a lot of engineer jokes at his expense over the years but this book made me appreciate and understand him a little better. Thanks for that Andy.<br />Weir has left no stone unturned in this exciting book. I was rooting for Mark the whole way. It was a nail biter and every time I was forced to put it down I couldn't wait to get back to it.<br />Please don't let the fact I said its a \\"technical\\" book dissuade you from reading it! This is the best survival book I've read since Krakauers \\" Into Thin Air\\", and that is a huge compliment.<br />I can't wait to see what Andy Weir does next. This book was a huge accomplishment by an amazing writer. I was never taken \\"out of the moment\\" not once during this book. Everything was executed so well from the dialog to the comedy to the suspense. Amazing book.

Love the game but frustrated over disappearing coins.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this is fun &amp; you can play @ your own pace.  It has lots of levels to play &amp; provides hours of entertainment value.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book did draw me in with the characters at first.  They are developed in such a way that they remind me of real people.  They have real problems just like in real life.  However, if this was real life, this would not have had such a happy ending.  I agree with some of the other reviews that a codependent relationship like this is not healthy.  Travis has issues that he needs to work through to give Abby and others in his life some space.  He needs to become more secure in himself before he can be a \\"good\\" companion to anyone.  I can relate to his walls and his possessiveness that was caused by the loss of his mother who he loved dearly.  I think if he were to work through some of his insecure issues, he could have a healthier relationship with Abby and not be so threatened.  There is no reason for a young adult to hide in another dorm room because you are too afraid to face an angry boyfriend.  There is something wrong with that picture on both sides.<br />With that being said, Abby needs to grow up.  I got so sick of the break-ups and immature fights over nothing (in the big scheme of things).  I personally think she manipulates this guy so much she drives him crazy.  She drove me crazy!  If you are too immature to discuss, and I mean discuss rationally, your thoughts and concerns, then you are not ready for a real relationship.  She runs away from his apartment on more than one occasion, rather than just sharing her feelings with him.  The guy cannot read her mind on what she is thinking or feeling.  Communication is a two way street.  One time she completely disappears and he can't even find her or talk to her for two weeks.  She knows he loves her and she loves him, so why all of the childish behavior and tantrums.  The poor guy gets so many mixed signals that I felt like hitting something too!  She wants him, then she doesn't, then she leaves without talking to him to explain anything, so he of course is wondering what the heck did he do or not do to makeher unhappy.  She breaks up with him over and over, but then gets mad when he brings someone else home.  I mean you can't keep telling a guy no and then get mad and jealous when he moves on - make up your mind!<br />Maybe the author saw this blissful happy ending and all of the pain they go through (even while all along all they both want is to be together), is supposed to make them stronger in the end.  I am not in my twenties and I know how hard a soul mate is to find, and if you both want to be together, then work through it and make it happen.  Don't just put each other through so much pain.  Life is too short!  Pick your battles (not everything that rubs you the wrong way is cause to throw up your hands and act like a two year old).  Talk through issues and your feelings.  I get a feeling this guy could be more of what she wanted if she just talked to him more and let him know how she felt.  Trust each other, (there is a concept, and no relationship can survive without it).  Also, become secure with yourself first.  It is the only way you will be able to make another person happy.  For all those young women reading this book, take it from someone that has been married for over twenty years.  There is no other way to have a lasting, happy marriage if trust and communication are not there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Glad I've got the whole season to catch up with Downton Abby The series is worth watching very interesting and is very entertaining
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|For those who love Paris, this is a film to see.  Woody Allen ingeniously invents a plot to combine many aspects of Paris into one movie.  Owen Wilson does a good job in the movie, meeting all sorts of historical personages from Paris' past.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is the most amazing and truthful movie I have ever seen. I am a police officer and am impressed with the realism in this movie. Everyone needs to watch this.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is recommended viewing for those who would like to understand the early days of Christianity and the fall of the Roman Empire.  Rachel Weisz does a great job in portraying this outstanding historical personality, Hypatia.
1401307450|4.0|I am a RHCP fan and enjoyed reading this book. It gives quite an insight into his struggles in fame.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Bought for a Christmas gift. Very happy with my purchase.  Arrived on time with no problems at all. Would order again.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|One of the best Period movies I have ever watched.  After viewing several trailers of this movie on You Tube, I could hardly wait until my copy of it arrived. And when it did, I was not in the least disappointed.  It should become a Classic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Motion sickness factor. The one thing I discovered about this the first time I played was motion sickness.  After you get used to it, it is fine, but I will warn you. I love this version of Temple Run but I have found that(spoiler)trying to use &quot;save me&quot; twice in one run makes it glitch out on Kindle Fire and shut down. Controls and sensitivity are good, I use a stylus and it works the same. I love it!!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I enjoyed several viewings of the movie. I think the story is well portrayed in the video. The special effects of the various life forms is very well done. The dialog and humorous comments makes the movie better each time I watched it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Had a hard time getting anything done this week as I couldn't wait to read more and more of this book!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I couldn't find a instructions and couldn't control birds. Maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention. I only played a little time.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book will teach you the power of your own thoughts and help you understand how to create a life that is joyful, healthy, abundant, fearless, peaceful, and beautiful. By studying the techniques outlined, you are given the means to help you move  from a place of pain, suffering or failure to one of happiness, confidence and accomplishment.

Use it as a study guide, and your life is guaranteed to change for the better. Every library needs this book.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|&#60;3<br />Arrived fast and turned out to be one perfect gift! and would be for any South Park Fan out there
B0077PDSGE|5.0|My friend showed me a snippet on her computer streaming over a year ago and I fell in love instantly with the artful stylized symbolism and it's deep philosophical meaning. When I was gifted with a Kindle I could not wait to see it in it's entirety.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I am not well versed in types of flowers but I love the variety of colors, fragrance and are each perfect in there own right. Just by there existence they bring a sense of peace in the home.  The story was very well written but I found myself frustrated at times going from one stage of her life to another from her childhood. I wanted her to give herself permission to be happy and I was very pleased with the ending AND I want to keep the \\"dictionary\\" of flower names and meanings as a reference!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Item received as described, and I received item quickly in mail.  Item new and sealed, as stated.  Very satisfied with purchase!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|It was packed full of action as the previous ones. The story line was interesting and can't wait to see where the next one goes.
B00AG51RU6|3.0|Ok first I was in Spain when this film was being made in 2010. the hype was pretty big.plus the sailboat belongs to my brother-in -law. So I was excited to see it. It's ok the acting isn't very good. seems like a rush job to me. the location is beautiful,and the parts in Madrid is ok,but for the most part I was disappointed, the writing is average.
B0047747A6|5.0|A good read for any MJ fan. I can never enough!! This book is before all the scandal and lawsuits..very refreshing.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's nice to have this available right at your finger tips.  I would recommend this to a friend and it's free!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent writing!  A closer look and development of characters than the first Fifty Shades episode. Still kept you entranced. Exciting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the different ideas you can get from this app.  It's free and I'd definitely recommend it to a friend!
B00542USJW|5.0|Going into this one, I hoped that MJ would give us a stellar acting performance, and I have to admit I was less than satisfied.  Fortunately, moving performances from the rest of the cast (all playing themselves in an alternate reality where humans are real) carry His Royal Airness through this inspiring film.  Dennis Nedry also appears in an unforgettable role as Air Jordan's assistant.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like all of the different ways to check the weather.  It's easy and thorough.  I like the easy access.
0785163174|5.0|I am really satisfied with this book, the story is well constructed. Artwork is amazingly done by Coipel in three issues and they are the best. The first 5 are done very poorly by Romita, the artwork is a mess, but those issues are dealing with the story building, so no real harm done. The only thing I don't like is the interference of Avengers, this could only be X men story - one of the best. The creation of Phoenix Five is just briliant, the costumes and everything, too bad it had to end. Also, the end of the book shows individual battles done by some of the best artist. So, I suggest picking up this one, you do not want to miss Coipel drawings of Phoenix - amazing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this in my S.S. class often.  It is a great resource.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch never lets me down.  Another great story about something we all are curious about.  Really makes you think and feel.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome and I think that the world should have this amazing game I luv it I really do
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I could say that this book is one of the greatest ones in human history, by all means. The issue with translation is a really old one, especially when being brought up with English and/or French as our second language/s, different from our mother tongue. If one thinks French-English translation is a problem, then one may really be amazed when encountering huge cultural differences when speaking about translations into let's say Bulgarian, Greek, Chinese, Japanese etc.<br />The point I am trying to make here is that in this particular case, we definitely should seek the content of the original work and only then furnish it with the proper form. Moreover, when considering the Little Prince, we should bear in mind the state the author was in at the time of writing, his environs, his allusions. This book is undoubtedly much more than just a children's book. In other words, a simple and yet ingenious piece of writing with, among many other positive things, its logical implications, thought-provoking metaphors, social significance and aesthetic value.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a lot better than the other temple run and the graphics are the best. There are better upgrades and power ups in this one I recommend this for everyone. The only thing that I don't like is that there are demon monkeys.

XD but seriously. this song is amazing. <3<br /><br />ok, thanks for listening to my scriptetting out :D <3 the script and HIGHLY recommend this album!!!!!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen lately.  The story and the acting were great.  The unrated version just had a few quick scenes of nudity and sex that didn't add much to the movie.  Liked seeing the alternate ending but the relased ending made more sense.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game and I enjoy playing it. It would be really nice if they would add an option to sell old tack, as we won't be using the old tack once we upgrade to something new.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Honestly when I started reading this book I was just thinking to myself, why does this book have so many good reviews. It seemed like a very normal/ordinary story. But ow was I wrong about that! This book had soo many twists and turns. Just amazing. The best part was I didn't see them coming. All I can say is if you haven't read this book yet, you should.
0374533571|4.0|I really liked The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick because it was much different from any other book I have read. Part of what made it unique was that the main character was telling the story shortly after he had been released from a mental institution. Another thing I loved about this book was how upbeat Pat, the main character, was. No matter what negative things people told him, he never stopped believing in silver linings, which I found refreshing compared to other books I have read, such as Looking for Alaska by John Green. I love that book. It is amazingly written and incredibly funny, but it is awfully sad and makes it seem as though good things never happen, and if they do, they are always taken away. That is basically the opposite of what Pat believes.<br />One thing that I did not particularly like about this book was that Pat's character was very childlike and naïve. I tried to overlook that, seeing as he was mentally unstable, but it was hard to get past the fact that he called the psychiatric hospital that he was in, \\"the bad place,\\" or being separated from his wife, \\"apart time.\\" Overall though, The Silver Linings Playbook was a hilarious, sad, brilliant book and I would highly recommend it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I had been thinking about buying this book for a while now, but I wasn't really excited about it because of the plot summary.<br />I found the summary to be very vague and ordinary. But I must say I definitely do not regret buying it. After reading about 30% of the book I was getting a bit worried that I wasn't gonna like this book because of the situation the two main characters where in.<br />But as the book went on I kind of went along with it and ended up really liking the book. It was all by all a really nice love story.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a very fun and addicting game, but it glitches a lot. Just a moment ago I got over two million points, and died, then tried to use my gem, and it crashed. It does this a bit, and is quite upsetting. If you were you fix that, this would be a five star game.

0756407125|3.0|When reading a sequel, I like to re-read the previous book(s). I wasn't able to do that here, though I did brush up with the author's and other summaries of [[ASIN:B008YEA3PQ The Name Of The Wind]]. I gave that book 4 stars, and through the first third of this one, I wondered whether 5 might have been more appropriate.<br /><br />The first third of the book is great - interesting and fun, with mysteries and likeable characters. And then, for no good reason I can see, Rothfuss suddenly takes us off on a couple of long digressions that lead to little. Remember the 7th or 8th of Robert Jordan's books? Where you'd read 500 pages and realize that virtually nothing actually happened? The back half of this book is like that. It's very well written, but despite that, not terribly interesting. In part, that's because it just doesn't move fast enough to be the middle of a trilogy. At its end, Kvothe is still a teenager, and Rothfuss has set up a number of loose ends that will need tying. The book reads more like the setup for a 5-6 book series. As others note, it's hard to see how Rothfuss will satisfyingly tie this up even in a 1,000 page conclusion.<br /><br />Also, Rothfuss, whose first book I liked in large part because of realistic, engaging characters, gets a bit lazy in places here. Some of the players and actions are lightly-painted stock, and they don't fit well with what we expect from a talented writer. More troubling is a hint of Heinlein-Jordan syndrome - a proliferation of women who know everything and can do no wrong. In individual characters, that's great. As a general rule, it's no more enticing than Doc Smith's (or Heinlein's) rule of strong, silent men to whom all women submit.<br /><br />All in all, a good book, well worth reading, but not as worthy a successor as I had hoped for.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I love this movie. I like the ACTION and the music. The people in the movie are very good at what they do. I really enjoyed the plot and the musical numbers too.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|After all the hype, we thought this might be a good choice. We were wrong. Boring and predictable dialogue and plot. Several times we just looked at each other and admitted we had no idea what was going on. Flat acting added to the dullness of it all. We were glad when it was over...not even worth our $3.99.
B001N4RORE|4.0|I love this musical. It was great. I have seen musicals and this was one of the best. The cast was a a riot and they used the right people for this show.
B007V65R54|4.0|This book discusses an impressive range of predictions: baseball, politics, futures markets, weather, poker, epidemics, and earthquakes.  It treats each topic in enough depth to give some appreciation of the challenges and achievements to date.  For example, it makes a compelling case for weather forecasting as the great success story of scientific prediction.<br /><br />The work is an unapologetic sales pitch for a mathematical tool: Bayesian statistics.  It explains the mathematics behind this technique, so there are some equations.  (Well, there is one equation, repeated several times.)  This gives the discussion weight that would be sorely lacking if predictions were being made by gut feel.  In fact, the over-arching theme is that mathematical analysis will ultimately trump any squishier approach to prediction.  It is a great achievement of the book that it is able to make its case mathematically without making the writing truly dense, while also avoiding the sin of over-simplification.  I work with Bayesian statistics professionally (as an astrophysicist) but found the book's discussion to be informative and accurate.  It also opened my eyes to the many applications of this technique outside scientific analysis.
0553801473|4.0|It may have helped that I read many negative reviews, so my anticipation was low and my dread was high.  In this series, it is really hard to keep track of the multitude of characters.  It's a chore, really.  I am often confused.  Even so, I really enjoyed the book.  I don't mind the author's decision to use this book to catch up on the other leading characters that were left out of the previous one.  I look forward eagerly to the next installment.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Ah, what to say about this \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"? Obviously, any book that has spawned a series of Swedish movies and one Hollywood film you would expect a lot from, right? So, when I saw the book at a reduced price, I figured \\"why not?\\"<br /><br />The book is really two novels in one. It is a mystery novel, wrapped inside a revenge novel. The best plotline of the book is the mystery portion. The revenge portion is okay, but it also adds more girth to a book that is already too long, and it drags out the ending much further than it should. Having seen the Swedish film version, though, I found enough different in the plot here to surprise me. So that was good.<br /><br />The characters in \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" are the strength of the book.  There is so much backstory and character interaction, that the characters are fully flushed out. Very real. That said, none of them are particularly admirable. The primary protagonist, Blomkvist, is an absentee dad, a philanderer (who apparently puts his libido above all common sense) and apparently thinks practicing evangelical Christians are cultish. \\"The Girl\\" Salander is brilliant, yet so broken and abused you can't help but feel sorry for her. Still, she does little positive to help herself either. Together, they make a pretty sad pair.<br /><br />The primary failing of the book is its slowness. It takes nearly a hundred pages of setup before we get to the mystery portion of the book, and the real meat of the mystery doesn't start happening until we're over two hundred pages in. Clearly Larsson had fully flushed out the background of his characters and world, but I'm not sure he needed to give us so much of it. In fact, I wonder how this book got published in its current form. It is just that slow. Very little action in the first half, outside of a lot of walking, talking, and extra-marital (and sometimes forced) sexual activity.<br /><br />I did manage to finish the book, though, so that's something. Don't think I'll be buying the next one, but \\"Dragon Tatoo\\" does make me wonder about Swedish society, and if the people there are really as drifting and immoral as this book portrays them. Consider this: Blomkist is defined by another character as being \\"moral.\\" Kind of makes you wonder what passes for moral in Sweden, huh?e buying the next one, but \\"Dragon Tatoo\\" does make me wonder about Swedish society, and if the people there are really as drifting and immoral as this book portrays them. Consider this: Blomkist is defined by another character as being \\"moral.\\" Kind of makes you wonder what passes for moral in Sweden, huh?

B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a fantastic watch, especially for the money. But even if it were several hundred dollars it delivers a lot. It is a VERY accurate mechanical mov't. The exhibition back is awesome, if you like staring at the clockworks. Seiko 5 means 1)mainspring cannot be overwound 2)shock resistant 3)day/date 4)automatic movement 5)water resistant. If you have experience with watches you may already know that Seiko quality is superior to most other entry-level priced timepieces. It's light as a feather, weighing in at 60g with the band. Even the band isn't bad. I love military watches, and this little beauty is a steal. Very easy to read, high-contrast dial. The crown is recessed too, which is a useful design. If you need a hearty, daily beater of a watch with a clean design and very light weight, go with the SNK809. You will be amazed at what Seiko delivers at this price range.

1612930425|4.0|~3.5/5<br />[Also available on my blog.]<br /><br />I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.<br /><br />This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.<br /><br />But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.<br /><br />When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.<br /><br />My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.<br /><br />Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.<br /><br />I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.<br /><br />Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.<br /><br />I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.<br /><br />I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book.ake my word on it all.<br /><br />I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I want to give this game 5 stars because it's even more addictive and fun than the original but on my kindle fire hd it has a crashing bug. So far it has happened probably 25 percent of the time when I die and try to resurrect with a gem. The game crashes and when I restart, the gems used are gone. Gems are something you can buy with real money so there's a potential of it just going to waste.  When/if that's corrected in an update, this game is totally 5 stars!

I grant him this.  But after reading the book I felt he is not a writer- the editing/storyline skipped around and made things confusing. I felt like he spent way too much time filling pages with his family and friends reactions to what was going on, rather than about the NDE.

I'm glad they did not remake the original but did a different story.<br /><br />As in 80s Conan The Barbarian and Conan The Destroyer, the villain Khalar Zynn's (Stephen Lang) mission is similar - world domination. To do so, he must find pieces of the mask and use pure blood to activate the powers.<br /><br />Zynn engineers the demise of Conan's father Corin (Ron Pearlman) for one piece of the mask and a young Conan (Leo Howard) vows revenge.<br /><br />This Conan delivers action and gore fast and furious. I thought the most exciting segment was the battle with sandmen. The parts with the snake/octopus creature and the final fight sequence were a little too dark for me to really see what was going on.<br /><br />Ron Pearlman (Hellboy) puts on a memorable performance here as a dad who sacrifices his life. And Rose McGowan (Scream) really did look super evil with all that fingernails (Freddy Krueger!). Her sorceress Marique made Zynn look like Father Christmas. Watch her stick those nails into those poor girls! Speaking of incest, the deviant attempts to seduce her daddy. Funnily enough her make up reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter in Alice In Wonderland.<br /><br />Casting Jason Monoa as Conan was a brave choice as he was a relative unknown then. He certainly has the looks and  killer bod - check out those glutes!<br /><br />The version released in my country clocks in at 108 minutes compared to the 113 minutes version sold here. I'm sure a raunchy love scene between Conan and the pure blood heroine Tamara (Rachel Nichols) was cut. Someone kindly confirm?<br /><br />Extras include cast and crew interviews a B roll footage and a trailer. The questions were flashed so quickly that I could not read them.<br /><br />I would have given this five stars if not for the censorship. Even though this 2011 version did not break even at the box office, it's a worthy movie to add to your Conan collection. If there's a sequel, BRING BACK GRACE JONES!
