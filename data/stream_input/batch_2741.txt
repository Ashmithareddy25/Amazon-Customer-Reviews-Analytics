B0091LS07E|5.0|Awesome cd! Would highly recommend it! The songs are fabulous and of all different styles of music. Perfectly enjoyable to listen to!
B00542UMIY|5.0|My son loved watching this movie. The dogs are so cute a must see movie<br /><br />Love love love love it
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This movie was about a cataclysmic event resulted in the near destruction of planet earth. Although it was pure entertainment, it was based on what would happen on the last day of the calendar of an ancient civilization. I really enjoyed all of the action this movie contained.
1416550542|5.0|First I judged the book for it's cover that it is so beautiful in design, and then I was in the mood to read a story of this kind. But it surprised me how really outstanding it is!. The development of the characters and those jumps in time kept me hooked from start to end.  I am very interested in reading more books from Kate Morton.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Welcome back to action movies Arnold! Your absence has been missed. This movie contained lots of action and managed to be funny in places as well.
0131480057|5.0|I was chasing this book since the 3rd edition, but I was discouraged by the price and the fact that I don't work with so many flavors of Unix/Linux but, when I saw this 4th edition at so good price in amazon I just couldnt resist any more. This book is really a fantastic work and a Must Have for Sysadmins, so I recommended it to a friend that also loved it since day one. It is the most complete as reference, the writing style is very entusiastic, and, from my personal point of view  a more easy and well organized than the McGraw Hill Book that it is also a great material widely recommended. One other thing I really loved besides the content is the font really easy to read. What I didnt like so much is the material of the cover that feels very fragil and I am affraid it wont last unless I protect with a plastic cover or something,...but It would be a shame because it is a funny and nice design.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It only needs some updates that the Pc and X-box. Overall This was a great game and I think that you should buy this app.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was great. It was addictive, I sat here reading it for hours. I loved the storyline, and this one is my favorite out of the saga. I recommend you read it. Stephanie Meyer has done it again!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Get this game!
0515149489|5.0|This book was so entertaining and I never wanted to put it down! Nora Roberts writes many great books but this is my favorite so far!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Her biopic portrayed Katy as a down to earth, real person and one I wish I knew personally. Very much enjoyed the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator and can not beat the price. Does everything I need. Never have any problems with this app. You will be glad you got it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Challenging and creative at the same time. I enjoy the varied moves and outcomes, more unpredictable than most games. A great escape from daily life.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i am a full grown man who likes ponyville the facebook game. I am pretty much hooked! it is a lot of fun.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has such nice big numbers.  I only used it once but  I really love it. I give it 5 stars.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I was very pleased with it's performance,I even did a test with or without it plugged in on the SPEED TEST site,and it was up to scratch,I am keeping it now in reserve for the next time I need it,good show chaps!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Good app. Stops working from time to time for whatever reason. Overall good performance app. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an app to monitor their Kindle' s battery life and activities...
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|As a long time Aerosmith fan, I was happy to see them do a concert video.  And what better than when they went to Japan in 2011 after the earthquake and tsunami there earlier in the year.  I was extremely pleased with the documentary style used since they went out among the people there letting them know they were there for them, did sightseeing and also provided entertainment. Casey Patrick Tebo caught the essence of the band. Showed them as the great performers they are but also as people. Some of the scenes outside of the performing were funny and some were more somber (Hiroshima).  The performances were excellent.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Missed this show when it aired - Prime member much easier to view without ads. Highly recommend all seasons - thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I will not rehash what everyone else has reviewed. However, I definitely enjoyed the book far above the movie - though the movie met all my exceptions and I recommend it as well. Quite the book for the adventurist. Excellent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|An amazing app worth evert cent. Could be cheaper, although price does make sense. A great app for any tablet. Very fun and provides unlimited hours of entertainment and joy. I would reccomend it to anyone. Best app ever. If you buy it on Amazon.com you'll want to sync your accounts. You can do this by signing in on your kindle on the same account you bought Minecraft on and then opening the drop down menu from the top of the screen, where WiFi is displayed. Then tap sync and check your apps in the cloud.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This work covers the operation of killing Bin Laden from  Mark Owen's perspective, from the training/preparation through the actual endeavor. When reading this work, I felt as though I was actually there, experiencing it with him. And since this gruesome tale was obviously action packed - the detailing was absolutely tenacious.  Though the true story generating this book was a horrifying part of our history - the book was a superb work I will read again and recommend.
0316056863|4.0|They look like a man's arms! How can woman be famous on television with that ugly arms?? Pretty face is good but not the ugly arms.<br /><br />Like the book though. The self-deprecation thing comes off as a bit forced sometimes and sometimes I found it a bit boring (the baby bit, the travelling-by-car bit, the boat bit) but I suppose others might enjoy what I do not and vice versa, so there.<br /><br />I also think it's sort of a feminist book (at its core), and in being that tackles two really huge things with women: The aforementioned self-deprecation (which, I believe, in this book does not come from false modesty but is intentional in that it wants to say hello to all women in the world that it's alright to be totally messed up) and that thing about having to be beautiful. Also fathers, but who hasn't issues with fathers?<br /><br />Speaking of fathers: Her arms, man. She seriously needs to do something about it. Shave them at least or something. And maybe do a little less iron pumping, or whatever it's called in english.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I am a big star trek fan and I love the new movie and the music is great just glad that I find the music here
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Definitely, a must watch! Downton Abbey will have you in tears of  laughter or in sorrow for the characters. Great show.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Crisp clean digital quality! Arrived promptly and in excellent condition, the way service is ''supposed'' to be, unlike nowadays. All the Castle and Beckett you could want, any time you want it! Thank you!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game and most recent update has balanced the different classes well. Only complaint is the game seems to get laggy a peak hrs. Overall personal rating is a 5/5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My son kept telling me I needed to read this series and when we went on a trip we were on a bus a lot so I started reading them. I couldn't put it down. This is the first book in YEARS (other than Harry Potter) that I just loved. I powered thru all three books.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This was when the XMen were young, so you look at how these societal misfits got together and moved forward.  You understand how friendships were built, how they learned to control their powers, how the school got started, and why the school master is in a wheelchair, etc.<br /><br />If you know nothing about the Wolverine and XMen movies, let me briefly explain.  They are all societal misfits, mutants.  Their mutation is something different for everyone, but they are special powers, gifts, that allow each of them to do very special things, like cause storms, throw fire from their hands, move things with thought, read minds, bend metal, etc.  As is typical, the \\"normal\\" folks don't understand these powers and are afraid of the mutants, and many folks want to just get rid of them, causing the mutants to fight back.<br /><br />Wolverine is one mutant, a very powerful man.  He has claws that extend from his hands (kind of like a bear with extra long claws), and they are a very strong metal.  His entire skeletal structure is made of this metal and if he gets cut or shot, he regenerates and heals immediately.  BTW, Wolverine was maybe about 45 years old or so during the Civil War and is still the same age.  We don't know how old he is but he does not age and he does not die.  Wolverine spun off to make his own movies and also appears in some of the XMen movies.<br /><br />Every XMen and Wolverine flick has been wonderful, including the Wolverine (2013) that is in the theaters now.  They are all loaded with action and great roles are played by all.
B00821OW8K|4.0|This show really grabbed me. I sat down to watch an episode and next thing you know I watched about 6. This show reminded me a lot of war of the worlds, except Tom Cruise was killed off before production and humanity grew a pair to go ahead and fight back. Entertaining to say the least.<br /><br />As for criticism, this show needs to continue to reveal more about the aliens. That might be a tall order if they plan to drag the series out for 10 seasons or so.
B0090SI582|5.0|I see this movie is getting some less-than-desirable reviews, but I thought it was outstanding.  It is amazing to me that anyone would think less.  The movie is loaded with action and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, the man has the part down pat!<br />Although I never read the comic books, I have seen all the Wolverine and XMen movies and love every one of them.<br /><br />If anyone does not know, Wolverine is a very powerful warrior, a mutant with special abilities.  He does not age, is at least 200 years old, remains about 45 years old, heals instantly if he is cut or shot, and springs out metal claws if he gets angry.  His entire skeletal structure is a very strong metal.  He generally tries to help the good guys and the bad guys get busted up.  (Ha Ha--when I was in Catholic school, the nun always said \\"whoa-be-tied him/her/you\\" when someone was in trouble for doing something bad.  Well, whoa-be-tied the bad guys around Wolverine, cause he will bust them up!.(Don't know where that expression came from, but you didn't dare ask a nun in those days:(.<br /><br />In the movie promo, you see an Asian man who looks seriously ill.  He is thanking Wolverine for saving his life and offering to fix it so he can live a normal life, and age and die naturally, instead of staying around watching everyone else die.<br /><br />In the very beginning of the movie, you see Wolverine save the life of a young Japanese soldier, in Nagasaki, Japan, when the bomb goes off (1940 something?).  Now that same soldier is old and dying.  He sends a young lady to find Wolverine and bring him to Japan so he can thank him before he dies, and offer him a favor.  Reluctantly, Wolverine agrees and goes to Japan.  The rest of the movie is in Japan, and includes a great deal of action, as well as some Ninja fighting and martial arts.  Again, it is very very good and it kept me glued to my seat.<br /><br />If you see this in the theater, stay with the credits and you will see scenes from the next XMen movie, slated for 2014.ie, slated for 2014.
B00BBRR21Q|5.0|The remaster is a nice DR9 album with some spots of even more dynamic range and others with a tad less than the original. More detail, albeit small, is evident in the new master. You won't be disappointed there. The live album on here has a little more compression but not too much and sounds fine.<br /><br />One of the better albums to release in any era. People who don't get this music simply don't get the feeling and the emotions that it is trying to represent. Fair enough. But don't come in here acting like anything you say matters. Layne sails here. I'm sorry to single him out but damn this guy could represent so many emotions in one voice.<br /><br />On guitar Pearl Jam notable McCready gives his all and comes across as evocative of the period, a shining example of what the grunge talents could amount to. For good measure does anybody see how badly Godsmack ripped off Long Gone Day with their song Voodoo? It's almost disingenuous.<br /><br />Anyway, the opener, Wake Up, is stunning. If you are not taken by this song then move on. Pack it up. You don't belong here. Leave. The songs that follow including the hit River of Deceit are just a representation of the totality of the record. It's a slow burn. Best for those who are feeling something strong in their lives. Best for those who can identify with it.<br /><br />Above is a relic from a bygone era that sends us mixed messages on the fates of these sullen 'heroes'. A package that will never be repeated because it can't be much like Nirvana. The people are simply not there to do the job excusing the talents of McCready.<br /><br />I honestly just heard this in full not that long ago despite a long love affair with Pearl Jam and AiC and I envy those hearing it for the first time. Sure, not all is great but never is any album. It fades a bit towards the end but what is there is glorious. A shining example of what the grunge movement produced in the 90s away from what we call the mainstream acceptance of their glory..
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|given the serious subject matter, this book is helping me grapple with some fundamental issues in my life.  i would recommend it to any who is exploring the new options in their faith. especially one that includes atheism as an alternative.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|At the end of Reflected In You, it states &#34;Gideon and Eva's story concludes in the powerfully sensual third novel in the Crossfire Series ENTWINED WITH YOU&#34; but after reading Entwined with You, I see it wasn't the conclusion. I am disappointed that I was led to think this was going to be the end of their story and it appears to be nowhere close to the end. I don't think lying to your readers is the way to end books.
140006922X|5.0|Incredible book.  It's refreshing to look at Jesus and his story through a more historical perspective.  The fact that it is written by an extremely knowledgable scholar makes it that much better. This is a must-read!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|There are many books about near death experiences, and what makes this book unique is that the author is a neurosurgeon who didn't believe in life after death.<br /><br />I wish he had written more about all he saw and learned when he died. Maybe there are more books to come with that material. I hope so.
B000FA5STS|2.0|As a fan of David Baldacci I am amazed and disappointed in this absurd plot.  After wading through page after page of a grieving widow 's remorse, she suddenly becomes the smartest detective that ever drew a breath.  Impossible to keep up with the myriad of characters, Baldacci neatly disposes of them in a dozen pages.<br /><br />He's done a lot better in his other books
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This was an excellent thriller, much better than the movie.  It kept my interest and answered the questions it raised.
B0063B2BGG|1.0|Thought I was getting a DVD to watch.  Not on my computer.  I thought DVD HD was for my home DVD player.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This tobook was so boring just by the first page so all I did was skip to like the second to last page and came to rate this book and I was so not sleep when I stared to read this  I said forget it I'm go ing to sleep after I write this dum report about this bum book so good night and LOVE anyone who is reading this dum report and goodnight sweet dreams bye I'm Samantha Gina's sister I would of gave this book a half or no star but I had to again goodnight
0453005071|5.0|huge stephen king fan, and i needed these in my collection. 4 great stories from his time under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.
B0047SF41G|5.0|The previews looked great, but I was still a little skeptical, as there have been a number of Predator movies, and I thought the first two were the best.  However, I really liked this version.  I thought the concept was great, with the action starting immediately, and going pretty steady all the way to the end.  Adrien Brody was fantastic, as was Laurence Fishburne, although I thought his part was way too short.  The rest of the cast added their own touches of action and excitement, keeping you on the edge of your seat.  All in all, I really have nothing negative to say about this movie, and I'm glad to have added it to my collection.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I loved Pandora s Box an  this can  looked a lot like it. I thought I'd have a great puzzle game. Guess who wrong. I'll give you hint it's me. When I was  playing such game I had to click random spots and hope I found what I needed. I need a hint I give up 2 minutes of time. That's fair whoever it never said your time you have is for all 8 puzzles per chapter.<br />I love the idea. It just doesn't work... At All. I got to chapter to and quit because that's what the game was hope I tapped the right thing. That's why this game is not great at all. Do not get it for the 4 some dollars. If you get it as the app of the day give it a shot if you want.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|The whole book just discusses the events happened in three days, but it means a lot. However, it is sorta long. Not a book for pleasure but for learning
B002VISN9E|4.0|This book combines wickedly funny humour with wonder and poignancy.  I read this to my 10 and 8 year old.  Dahl definitely pushes the limits of what is appropriate for children, but manages to stay just barely on the right side of the line in my opinion, which is what makes this book so good.  Underneath all the hysterics this is actually quite a mature and moving tale dealing with child abuse/neglect, bullying, corruption (and possibly even murder), friendship and the miraculous.  I felt like the message of the book is that whatever supernatural forces there are in the world are on the side of the innocent child and against the grown-up bullies, meting out poetic justice in due time.  If you think this is a good message for kids to hear then you should read this to your kids.
1781162646|4.0|Really enjoyed Stephen Kings` newest book.  A nice change of pace from his usual stories.  Hope he writes more like this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love being able to take notes and organizing them into different folders and then being able to access them and edit them from anywhere (tablet, desktop, laptop, cell phone). Very useful for keeping track of all sorts of random notes (phone numbers, dates/appointments, to do lists, interesting websites, etc.). I'm still new to the app and playing around with it, but it's great so far and I love it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I'm able to get on with my tablet with no hassles bc apps quick and easy.  If you have more than one email address you just hit corner key and your on other email with only one touch.  Very nice feature!!!!! It's easy to navigate and able to delete emails with no issue.
034580709X|1.0|It is difficult to categorize this book, but trust me when I say I would not like Harry Hole going to bat for me.  Harry is a detective who approves of animal cruelty, sleeps with potential witnesses and is so drunk by the end of the book that he couldn't possibly think straight. This book was part travelogue, part mythology,  part mystery, and a whole bunch of hooey.  I certainly don't want to read another Harry Hole detective story....ever.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|It's a good movie in most ways (acting, writing, settings, etc), but I have no idea what the plot was.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I love these books, they have romance galore! Always leaves you wanting more. If you like romance stories you should read this series!
B000002AZX|4.0|Leonard Cohen's style has changed from his amazing first album, reaching its nadir with the mindless \\"Death of a Ladies' Man\\" (shame on you, Phil Spector).  I don't expect an artist to remain stagnant, and the previous few albums (chronologically speaking) left me cold. Not \\"Various Positions\\"! The sound is lush but Cohen's voice and lyrics manage to remain front and center. The lyrics are clever, emotional, and smart. The arrangements are varied.  And though stylistically unlike his earliest albums, it is immediately likeable and consistently engaging. Now it's time for my ears to adjust, and to accept the fact that it's not 1968 anymore.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you like good music AND something a little different; this is your CD.  The selections vary greatly. and will most always surprise you in their performances.  Clue: Imagine Star Wars done on piano and cello but with a good amount of percussion.  Another favorite is subtitled Paradise.  It has a great Afro-Hispanic? beat and is partly sung in Swahili, very surprising!!<br /><br />&#34;Try it!&#34;  I think &#34;you'll like it!
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|This movie features and excellent cast and great CG effects.  The plot is a bit thin but generally follows the accepted OZ storyline.  It is worthwhile watch.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|This six album box set is the best of the Eagles from their start, to their break up in 1980.  It provides me with all of their early hits.  I wish that they had an identical box set for their second go round from 1980 on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From good to bad to worse to unthinkable is what happens to one relationship that seems to be, truly, from hell. Very witty premise and sparkling writing.  Try to put it down - won't happen.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is a great look into the making of and the trials and tribulations of a rock band.  I love the storytelling from rock greats Glen Frey and Don Henley.  They recount the entire history of the Eagles, including the sex, drugs, infighting & the eventual break up of the band.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I've always been in the camp that thinks Richie Kotzen should be a rock & roll superstar being the true triple threat he is, not only as a great guitarist, but also as a vocalist and songwriter - he's been releasing quality solo albums for years all the while showing his broad range of influences from classic rock, soul, R&B, funk, and touches of fusion to create music with the just the right amount of hard rock drive and catchy pop sensibilities.<br /><br />When you combine his natural talent with two equally talented musicians in Billy Sheehan and Mike Portnoy you end up with pure hard rock gold.  I know all the musicians in The Winery Dogs have made some great music in their respective other bands, but whenever the term super-group is tossed around in relation to a new band/project I tend to have lowered expectations that the results will equal or surpass the music we know the individuals involved for. There certainly have been exceptions to this, but as a general rule it tends to hold true.<br /><br />Thankfully this debut release from The Winery Dogs falls in the category of an exception to the rule - a release that finds the three members gelling together to create not only memorable music, but also an immensely enjoyable collection of songs that reflect the musical talent found in it's three members.  With Kotzen and Sheehan reuniting the energy displayed on their Mr. Big releases and Mike Portnoy laying down some great hard rock groove (Mike has always known how to play just what's needed in both a technical capacity but also how not to overplay when the style and song requires a greater level of groove and feel), the results are stellar.<br /><br />I won't do a song by song as I'm sure all listeners will have their highlights depending on personal tastes, but needless to say it's well worth the purchase and one that I suspect will be a regular listen to a long time to come.
1932100660|5.0|Im almost ready to be a vegetarian. Already I'm eliminating milk, bread etc from my diet. I always felt their was something evil with our food supply. I've traveled to many countries (25 plus western and third world), and you never see the obesity, unhealthy walruses we create. I remember when americans were much more healthy. Makes me want to leave the country (USA), because I know my country doesnt care if Im being poisoned, or whether I can afford their bloaded non effective health care. Im grateful for this knowledge this is a great book. It really opened my eyes.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I have returned this DVD as it was not playable in our zone.  All other websites that I have visited make it very clear which zone a DVD is playable in, yours does not.  I have returned it at postage cost of 25 for delivery and 15 for return.  I would not use your site again!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great for all ages.  Very addictive and easy to play.  Play this game with our children.  There are other version of game online which are also fun.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Sylvia Day is one of my new favorite authors.  If you like this one, you may also like Rosemary Roger books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate and take notes. There are several features I have not used but you can easily copy/paste, highlight, send passages and make notes in the app. I use with Evernote every Sunday at church.
B00846REIS|5.0|I had trouble putting my kindle down.  I read every chance I got.  When I was in the car with my husband I had the kindle out and reading.  I bought the triology.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|A fast read for the beach! Typical for Sparks and enjoyable summer read for the romantic. Good detail and characters are likeable.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I didn't like the ending, but I guess if there is another book coming it leads right into it.  I like the story line.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I used to carry multiple composition books around for all different things but this allows me to keep all my journals in one place. It is universal for Mac, PC, and Android. You can look up your stuff anywhere.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book is easily my favorite of the series.  IT not only focuses on all of the most interesting characters, but you finally get out of Wersteros and get to focus on things across the sea (and up by the wall).  An excellent addition to the series.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|When Eureka first came out I thought it was going to be like most of the other specialty channel series. I was most pleasantly surprised when it had some very good qualities. Good characters and development along with the sci fy twist. Good production value and to wrap it up had some very interesting plot lines. That's the way it was for 3 of its 5 seasons. First three seasons a really good watch.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pretty good headset.  I have owned 3 copies of this headset and the first copy lasted almost 2 years.  Second copy a refurb lasted only about 5 months then the plastic broke.  Now I just got my third set that was marked by seller as &#34;used&#34; however it looked like a refurbished unit to me which was a nice surprise.  Listen if you get a set refurbished they don't pair up the headphones with the usb transceiver.  To make they headset work find the small pin hole on the USB stick...  press it in with a small paperclip and release....  then the green light will blink fast...  Turn on the power switch on your headset and hold it down firmly until the green lights go solid.  I am using this headset under Ubuntu Linux and everything seems good with it so far.  My first pair of these had a cool &#34;voice morphing&#34; software for Windows...  unfortunately I suppose under government pressure that has been removed. :(  Also I have noticed on the last two sets of refurbished units the sound volume level appears to have been reduced.  That is a real bummer.
0307454541|5.0|Good book!  Very unusual and fun to read.  I love mysteries and detective books and this one met my expectations and more.  The names and various other things are definitely Swedish and difficult to pronounce, but it really doesn't matter unless you are reading it aloud!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I saw it in the theater then had to own it and have watched many times to remind myself that there is good in the world and we can all help even if only in a little way.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|I was hooked on the series at the first episode. Love the character development. Re-watching the series is a yearly event during the boredom of winter nights.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love the game and love the addition of the aqua and the ice age parks. I would recommend it to any fan of Jurassic Park.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Very uplifting and fun movie. Worth watching more than once. We usually watch when the family all gets together. I recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son LOVES this game. I love that it is free, but hate that in order to get him the upgrades he wants I would have to pay a fortune! It is kind of limited....

B004SIIBGU|3.0|It is okay. Hard to find what I am looking for with the little drop downs. I wouldn't use it to list an item, but I would probably use it to buy and check listings.
0770437400|1.0|\\"There was this one guy on rollerblades.  He had a hockey stick in his hand, a big 'ole meat cleaver bolted to the blade.  He was doing an easy thirty, at that speed he might have taken a neck or two.  The camera saw the whole thing, the rotted arm that shot out of the sewer drain right in front of him, the guy back flipping into the air, coming down hard on the his face, then being dragged, screaming, by his ponytail into the drain\\"<br /><br />If anyone can read that short passage and not shake their head at how stupid and impossible that scene is....buy the book; you'll probably give it five stars. I highly recommend this book to 13 year olds.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed playing...liked the challenge and creativity.  Hope more levels are added soon! Quite the challenge if you are a beginner
B0052RDHTM|5.0|My husband's family is from Wales so this book captured my attention early on.  A lot of world history.  Good book.

B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Was a good Brain tease but I bought it yesterday and I'm finished in less than 24 hours. good thing I spend amazon coins and not actual cash
B005LAII4E|2.0|A slow repetitive mash up that is just a waste of talent and time.  We had to wait a an extra year for this, plus Duke's exit was poorly handled.  NO JOE!!!!
0307472590|3.0|Me gustó, pero no me cautivó. Se hace lento a medio camino, vuelve a ritmo en la tercera y ultima parte.
B008220BLG|5.0|This was a surprisingly unique movie that I enjoyed very much.  It had \\"heart\\"! I found it to be romantic and was very cute and humorous. I loved it!  The actors were great!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is a must read. Great from beginning to the end. Only problem being it made me so mad at the treatment of the blacks.
0812973992|5.0|Through masterful storytelling, the author of Let the Great World Spin (he's Irish of course) demonstrates how people's lives can be transformed by a singular event, which can then be a catalyst for deeper connections and life changing attitudes towards oneself and others. The event is a tightrope walk between the twin towers, a feat that captures the imagination of the entire city and hovers above the stories of the disparate people brought together by what becomes a symbolic event, foreshadowing 9/11. The book was written after that event, but pre-Anthony Weiner, and takes place mainly before it in  the turbulent times of Nixon's sinking presidency.<br /><br />The author skips from main character to main character, each of whom recounts his or her story in an individual voice. The threads created are wrapped up at the end in an insightful manner, consistent with each character's persona and the inevitability of life.<br /><br />Could this be nominated as the definitive 9/11 book? Certainly it could be argued that 9/11 is a theme. Without the portent of the twin towers attack the tightrope walking event would not have the same impact. One senses the significance of the walk as a metaphor or perhaps a potential agent of change in the way people interconnect or are drawn together for good or bad by an external event. The literary quality of this novel would be diminished without the walk and its inherent present day associations,<br /><br />My take: people drift in and out of your life, affecting you  and others in different ways, some profoundly and others fleetingly. You won't notice the interconnectedness until the end, and ever the  world spins as we step on and off.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Great movie! This movie is funny and entertaining for the whole family. I love when he hands out his cards to people and invite them to dinner or for a drink... It doesn't matter who he meets he considers everyone a friend and want to spend more time with them. He is such a gentle and kind person, but his sister and niece thinks he is crazy. James Stewart does an excellent job and  was a great actor and this is one of my favorites besides, &#34;The Shop Around the Corner and It's a Wonderful Life.&#34; Oh not to mention his Alfred Hitchcock classics, such as &#34;Rear Window.&#34;
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was so descriptive,I loved the writing style, I could not put my kindle down until I had finished.
B008J05EL8|5.0|I actually did not know I had this. I know that I purchased Notepad Pro but THIS? i am wondering how this happened.
B0090SI582|1.0|This movie was horrible. I was so bored thru the entire thing. It has 3 mutants in them. Wolverine is losing his powers, and the other two are weak and boring. I could only stand to watch this movie once when I went to the theater.<br />Thankfully it is not important to the larger X-Men movie storylines. This movie has now become the first X-Men movie to not be included in my collection of superhero movies.<br />If you haven't seen it, and are concidering it, save yourself the money and wasted time. Most of the movie consists of bickering between the non-mutant families and overly long train fights and shooting Wolvering with about 2 dozen over sized arrows.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book took a while to get in to, but once you're about half way done you won't be able to put it down!
031250926X|5.0|I recommend this book to every child. A must for parents and teachers to read to young children ... from 0 on up.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|This song makes me want to dance in the car. Even though it is played on every music station in Seattle 2-4x per hour, I still don't find myself switching stations when it comes on since it is so catchy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was turned on to this series by a friend.  Great drama if you like quality stories.  Storyline is very interesting. Quality sets and interesting characters
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Husband and I are impressed that this is a product of AMC! We have loved Zombie shows, movies, manga, stuff for YEARS and like that this show has more of a plot than many others we have watched. Blu-ray is in good quality and makes the show better to watch.
0439023513|5.0|A great book and the perfect ending . All of the Hunger Games books are wonderful.  You pick them up and basically don't put them down till the last page.  Suzanne Collins weaves a tale that takes you along with it.  Such a gifted writer.  Only regret is wishing she would write about twenty more.
0525478817|5.0|I think this is John Green's best book.  The characters are real and quirky and intelligent.  While Green might write for a Young Adult audience, this books appeals to people of all ages, because of the layers of meaning and cultural/literary allusions littered throughout.  An excellent read.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Wow!  Video effects like none other.  Good story line and we really enjoyed it.  I had not seen it and had forgotten it until a friend mentioned it.  Had to have it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Heard great things about Tangled and it is on my TBR list so  from other comments i  am going to love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just received mine today, been playing around with it for a few hours. Setup was easy only took a few minutes. I have been easily able to use youtube, netflix, and google music from my android phone. Very little input lag when hitting pause or play.<br /><br />Casting a chrome tab from desktop has been a good experience so far, definitely more delay, but perfect for streaming movies.<br /><br />Overall I think it is a great device, can't wait to have a group over to try  making youtube playlists with multiple people and devices.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It's kinda slow and kinda irritating.  Yahoo mail seems to have to refresh (or it hesitates or whatever it does) every time you open an item.  I don't like the way it delays when you move things to other folders (however, setting up the folders themselves is fairly easy).  It's just not a great set-up for an email system (don't like  how you have to unclick 'keep me signed in', either).
B000KX0HVY|4.0|I like this cd. I am not big on Elvis but this is good collection of music. It is better price then other places.
1878424319|5.0|This book has changed the way I see the world and the way I relate to others.  I love the way the book flap has a synopsis of the four agreements.  My husband and I read the flap as a reminder each morning before we start our day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like those app I am a horse. person and I donlpaded this to see it and I just loved it. If u r a horse person get this app.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Great book to read! Certainly recommend To everyone who is looking for a good book to read! Make sure you read this one
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Just love these old movies. This one is a classic and one of Peter O'Tooles best. you can't go wrong with him.
140006922X|5.0|I loved this book for a number of reasons.  First it was easy to read - especially for a scholarly book.  Secondly, In addition to writing about the historical Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" dives into the world of early Christian history, the time period right after the crucifixion of Jesus until the death of Peter and Paul in Rome and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.<br /><br />What do I mean by Churchill's quote?  It's what immediately came to my mind when I read a sentence on page 170:  \\"Those who did know Jesus - those who followed him into Jerusalem as its king and helped him cleanse the Temple in God's name, who were there when he was arrested and who watched him die a lonely death - played a surprisingly small role in defining the movement Jesus left behind.\\"<br /><br />In summary, Aslan's book compares the Jesus of those who succeeded in explaining His ministry and message with those who didn't.<br /><br />Among the many interesting aspects of the life of Jesus and his early movement addressed by Aslan, \\"Zealot\\" explains how Jesus of Nazareth became Jesus the Christ; why Christianity is divorced from its Jewish roots; insights into the friction between the \\"Hebrew\\" followers of Christ (led by \\"James the Just\\" and based in Jerusalem) and the \\"Hellenist\\" followers of Christ, led by Paul and based in the Jewish diaspora.<br /><br />For those looking for foot-notes within the text, you will have to refer to the 52 pages of citations and Aslan's scholoary discussions found in the back of the book.  I found it very easy to read a chapter, then skip to the academic notes and more scholarly discussions pertaining to issues addressed within the pages I just read.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My husband started this game and I quickly put it on my kindle. It is a great free game that helps you learn budgeting- have to save coin and gold to \\"buy\\" habitats and breed dragons. It also is exciting to breed dragons and anticipate which egg you might get. I love the no pop-up ads and that you can play without logging onto facebook or anything. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it stops working frequently when visiting neighbors or other community habitats.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|After my wife and I read this book we have got a new way to talk about needs, wants and contributions in a relationship, that have helped us in many way. We have also found that just telling other people about the five love languages opens up for new and important conversations.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|The cd is so good. I heard the single on Sirius Hits one and I was drawn in. As the other reviewers have stated, the music and lyrics are so good. The rap songs are great as well as the others. This is a breath of fresh air. Buy this cd for sure.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I've only been playing for a few days but find this a great game for sitting down for just a few minutes. Tower defense games are well suited to the tablet, and this one is particularly fun.  I hadn't had to put down any money as yet to play the game, though I could see how it would be helpful, and possibly necessary as the game progresses. I recommend this greatly for a cheap tablet game.<br /><br />edit: Also of note, the game has not had any crashes or other hiccups.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|My wife really likes this series. She has watched this from the beginning of the series and always enjoys it.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game is one of the biggest rip offs I have ever known of. It has horrible graphics, and the controls are way the heck off. When attempting to swing on a web, you often might go in the opposite direction. Some of the later missions are so difficult because of glitches and mess-ups, that one might not be able to complete them. If you do buy this abomination of a game, for whatever misleading reason, you will see for yourself that it is a total waste of seven dollars.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|like playing this game. pyramid solitaire with a golf twist. wasn't sure until i downloaded...now I am hooked. good to pass time.
B007V4530A|3.0|Much of the content is common sense, but there are a lot of references to good TED talks, that themselves are really valuable af inspirational examples.
1905492073|5.0|This is the best, most thoughtful and most comprehensive explanation of decompression theory ever.  It clears up all the confusion and misinformation that permeates discussions of deco theory in the dive community.  Buy this book and read it.  Raphael
B00CFO7PK2|3.0|Not quite what I expected.<br />I am not enjoying this as much asBuik's previous albums. A departure in material style....
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I streamed this show as a gift to my wife who can't decide who she loves more... Yanni or David Copperfield.  As soon as we settled down to watch I was struck by the colors and lighting.  I had not realized so much effort would be put into the background of this production.  My amazement did not stop with production efforts though.  It was apparent from the opening number that this would be a great experience.  It was very clear as the program developed that Yanni was surrounded by wonderful musical talent.  From the Kazoo type of instrument from down under to the rhythm dance performed with large poles, we were able to see specialty performances of great quality.  A male singer who also performed harp solos, unforgettable violin pieces by a group of performers, bongo and trumpet solos, beautiful melodic background voices and solos on a couple of instruments I can not name all combined to make this a special event for my wife and I.<br /><br />The performances of the entire crew were outstanding.  Camera work was excellent, and it was obvious to me that cast, crew and audience were all enjoying themselves immensely.  Yanni has gained a new fan in me, and I don't care if my wife can never decide between him and David.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Clever puzzles and rich graphics make this an enjoyable game for the Kindle Fire HD! Revealing each page is a treat and leaves you wanting more!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging game. Not too hard that I want to give up but still a fun challenge. Even my 5 year old can do the first few levels. Wish there were more than 10 levels.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Read it and be humbled by understanding how little we actually are in control and conscious about our own thoughts and thinking process.<br />One of the best non-fiction books I have read for years.<br />Recommended for everyone to makes important decisions from time to time... and who doesn't?
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great easy read book!<br />I would highly recommend this book for its easy read... Good captivating from beginning to the end
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Love this movie.. I've probably seen it 7-8 times and still enjoy this suspenseful thriller that interweaves mistaken identity, cold war villains, secret agents and a dash of romance plus a sprinkle of humor here and there.  Gary Grant is at his dashing best. Eva Marie Saint is delicious to watch as her glamorous charmer character takes a few twists along the way. And James Mason is of course appropriately sinister. A great chase across the country with an exciting but a bit overdone climatic ending at mount Rushmore.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|Awesome movie!<br /><br />&#34;No such thing as bad student, only bad teacher. &#34;<br /><br />&#34;Sweep the leg. No mercy? No mercy!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Either you karate do yes, or karate do no. You karate do guess so, you get the squish just like grip.&#34;
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is absolutely hilarious! I never get tired of watching it. I had to buy a copy for my son
B0054R6BFM|3.0|This book was well written, the plot was interesting, but I felt it could have been much better. Honestly the character of Hannah got to be more and more annoying. There was so many times I wanted to be like why didn't you do this instead?? Of course at first I felt really sorry for her. There were many horrible things that happened to her that she was blameless for. She has a lot of people do illegal things to her which she never reports to police, teachers, parents, or anyone who could help. This could be a handbook of what not to do in life. Instead of seeking help she internalizes her feelings again and again. Then when people try specifically to help her and get her to talk about her issues she lashes out at them and refuses to talk to anyone. Finally she just goes seeking out horrible things to happen to her. Then she kills herself and blames everyone else for not helping her.<br />I thought this book was going to be more about how the choices we make affect others with or without realizing it. In a way I felt like it started out that way but then spiralled into something else as if the author had a really great story line and wanted thirteen stories but could only come up with out five good ones and then a bunch about how she wants people to go to hell for not reading her mind or something.<br />Although the characters annoyed me in some ways it was a very well written story with well thought out believable characters. It was interesting enough to keep my attention. I'm sure a lot of teenagers who like to blame other people for their problems will relate and absolutely love to read this. I just hope that they don't take it as a how to book and more as a cautionary tale.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|Deep down somewhere there is a plot in a plot twist; but you have to search hard to find it.<br /><br />Masking this plot and its little twisty ending is an endless stream of potty mouth mixed with hokey blood and guts.  All they do is keep running around killing the same old Witches it look like they have taken their face with plaster Paris and wiggled it to make it cracky.<br /><br />They do a fair job of keeping you off balance as to who are the good guys and the bad guys but in the end it is just an action movie and that is all it is.<br /><br />You might want to look at the extras first in this particular movie as they tell you what they are trying to create and why.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Game deletes all of your child's progress if you don't have internet hooked up to it. Also Game loft will not give you back all the animals and houses and other things you've purchased or or earned. Game doesn't inform you until they 've deleted all of the child's accomplishments. How do you tell a special needs child it's all gone? Her therapy coach loved this game for hand eye coordination but now said she too will tell all her patients about this. They also only communicate with customers over the internet which is not a luxury all customers can afford. SO BE AWARE if you are not fortunate enough your child will be crying too. It's not amazon s fault it's GAME LOFT.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book was one of those that you can't put down once you start reading. I was feeling the pain and joy of these people.  I think it would make a great movie......
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|First things first, I LOVE these films, all three, and especially The Dark Knight. The thing is this boxset doesn't give much incentive to buy if you already own the Blu Rays, which I do. The only way I would have got this version if it came with extended cuts of the three films, which it doesn't for any of the three. There are no addition special features, just some cool items the box comes with, but nowhere near enough to get me to re buy the films.<br /><br />Again Love these films, and I would recommend them to any super hero fan or a fan of good cinema, because they're all great, but this \\"ultimate collectors edition\\" won't get this die hard fan to bite.
B002361MLA|5.0|Having been deep in the spiritual world for sometime this is probably one of the best books I have read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|During the first few chapters I wasn't sure I would read this book through. I kept getting annoyed at the anti-female comments especially made by female characters. I'm so glad I continued reading though because this book got a lot better as it went on. There were times I wanted to punch the characters in the face and other times I wanted to scream to them. This book was great at getting you and hooking you. I could not put it down. There are so many twists and turns. Most mysteries seem a little predictable to me, but this one kept me guessing what was coming next. Definitely a thriller. It will have you on the edge of your seat. (and wondering about the lives of your neighbors and the secrets people keep) The characters were well thought out and the plot absolutely believable. Which only adds to the suspense and terror. If you want a book that makes you think and keeps you guessing this is it.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|The movie starts off with a series of events that seem to span past future in history.  There is a slight relationship.  As the movie progresses the relationship becomes more obvious in the stories become soundbites.<br /><br />This may be a fun experiment in storytelling and the book may be exceptional.  However I have not read the book and do not have time for this gobbledygook.  If you persist in watching it, it becomes easier but never as clear as each story could have been by itself, so all this trickery is a waste of time.  Looking closely you will see that they borrowed from many other movies including Soylent green.<br /><br />One positive item is the ending credits where we see the cameos of the actors next to their names instead of an endless scroll of names of which we might know some and might not know others.<br /><br />In the end the film is full of positive clich&eacute;s such as \\"Love can outlive death\\" whatever that is supposed to mean.  However I think you will find this film to be weary stale flat and unprofitable.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|High fidelity audio, excellent build quality, and cheap enough to replace if they break. Sony is known for great stuff
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I love love this movie!!! There's nothing like British humor!! I could watch this movie a 1,000 times and still love it!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|That was very helpful thank you you that mite have even helped my dad thank you for all that and I rally worked
B000OLROWC|5.0|To me, this is best movie that shows how we can learn by example. Pat Morita shines in this movie without taking anything away from Ralph Macchio. In fact, he helped make Ralph Macchio much better. That's what I liked about him, he made those around him better by just being there.
B0052REUW0|4.0|This was a dense and long book, true long-form disection of a topic. For those who are frequent non-fiction readers and comfortable with such a style it will be a meaningful book. For me, the book uncovered a previously unseen but critical trend in the human experience over our history and even pre-history.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Personally I wasn't a big fan of the ending but I enjoyed it nonetheless
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. I couldn't stop playing. Need more rooms right away! Very addicting. Very fun thinking game.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Even if you aren't a classical music fan, you must give these guys a listen. You will be pleasantly surprised!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an excellent book with respect to the style of writing, the content, and the relevance to understanding the success of politicians past and present.  I highly recommend this book.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is an exciting history of an exciting scientist. It clearly outlines his pivotal contributions to the then emerging fields of Electromagnetic field theory, telegraphy and radio and at the same time it describes the back-door political and business schemes hatched to establish control of the generation and distribution of electricity to the masses between Edison (DC power) and Westinghouse (AC power). A great read for the intellectually inquisitive.
B001Q2RXJ2|5.0|I love this reissue series because of all the live and unreleased tracks added to them. A must for diehard Saxon fans
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Written about a man with an indomitable spirit;  Hero, yes, but real as well, with weakness like anyone else.  One of the best personal reconciliations of war and faith I've read.  Five stars!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've only played one time so far.. This is all new to me, will get back to all in a while when I get the hang of the Kindle and the games and books.
B005WM6RUS|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I had to see what happened &#34;with the key.&#34;  Excellent book...I recommended it to my book club plus to many of my friends not in book club.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app is amazing. The graphics are not as good as it said in the description, but are still good. It really shows the Kindle Fire HD's capabilities in this area. The multiplayer is great. I haven't played on local WiFi mode, but worldwide is awesome. It has most of the characteristics of console first person shooters, including custom closeouts and rankings. Definitely worth the money
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good app. Runs smooth &amp; easy just like the other card game apps from this company. My wife likes it, too. I play it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B001Y8WAJQ|5.0|As I diehard Saxon fan I love all of the extra tracks added to these reissued albums. Long live NWOBHM.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I'm sad to see the end of the Sookie books, however I was pleased to learn that there is another book coming out in September, which will hopefully wrap things up a bit more tightly.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|A wonderfully told story of what true freedom is. Great characters, an amazing twist in the middle, fantastic themes, and great example of abounding strength in the worst of conditions. Well worth your time.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, as I was glued to the pages. However there were a lot of twists in this book, which made the overall read feel inauthentic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got it for my grandkids to play--they all seem to enjoy it--some are much better at playing it than others..
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Nice charger. It is compact and works as advertised and expected. Looks good too and goes with my wife's iphone. Highly recommend this item.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Need a little more info.. and better angles for lining things up and more level .... but in all I love this game .. and 12 years old and I did the whole game. Would like to know when the next series of unlocking the future will begin. The feeling of more than just a puzzle or find this and that stuff......you are so much of the action getting objects to work. \\"THE LOCK\\".....no body wants to be locked out!!!!!! Let's play...show me \\"THE ROOM\\".
B009R659L8|5.0|very very interresting could not put the book down. cant wait to read the next one hope it is just as good or better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another &#34;page-turner&#34;.  The Brits do this soooo well.  Enthralling.  Captivating.  Fabulous.  I've run out of superlatives.  Worth every penny of the cost.
B003JIM9G8|5.0|I would recommend this movie to friends. Now we know what happened to.....not gonna ruin it. Rent it, buy it or check it out at friends house if they own it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|the weather channel app as well as the website is a commercial graveyard, forcing lots of ads, stupid flashy bits and not a whole lot of useful weather info without lots of clicks and page hunting.  oh, and its slow also.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Can't miss with Audry Hepburn, Helen Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss.  Really fun and quirky movie.  Very romantic but manly enough for a guy to watch!
B00659N39K|5.0|My child loves bent items. She was so excited for theze items to come in and to use her lunch ox
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun.  cant wait for more rooms to open up.  I was really challenged by a couple of the rooms
B007PTJOV0|4.0|My four year old Son wanted to play the, &#34;Mario&#34; game that he played while we were visiting with his cousins. Since the game he wanted is for the Nintendo DS and costs more money than I can afford, right now, I looked for free/low cost alternatives. I found this game and my Son loves it but, it's a little challenging for him, he ends up &#34;dying&#34; a lot while playing and asks me to &#34;help&#34; him. I, &#34;help&#34; by playing while my Son watches but, I don't mind because it's pretty fun.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Enjoy this product. Great for kids too. Easy to learn and stopping starting later is no problem. Try it you will enjoy it too.
0399226907|5.0|Great book---a good classic book that every child's collection should include! This one is a fair price-- for an exciting read. It holds up well to little ones not being so careful with it. My child is 17 months now and has been flipping the pages of this board book since she was about 5 months old.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was truly, a cool game. Fun for the family and challenging, the only thing is that their no more levels after ten, but they are coming out with new levels and I can't wait!
B0081336FO|5.0|Engaging, thoughtful, and funny show.  I don't watch much TV, but when I do, it's for shows like this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game would love more scenes but it's still great all the same love it love it love it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|For such a simple game concept, this is really fun, engaging and somewhat challenging. I think this is a really great game to play while you're waiting for something because it's quick, simple and you can put it down easily if your attention is needed elsewhere.
B0089XH38M|4.0|Like it and have recommended it to others. Loaded well and scanned right away. It also gave me security advice that is useful.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I own a kindle and this app permits me to read my purchased/saved books on my phone. Excellent app and easy to use.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Beautifully crafted, wonderfully acted film treating a very delicate subject (subjectS would be a more apt word).  Helen Hunt delivers a perfect performance, as does the John Hawkes.  Even more meaningful when the viewer realizes it is based on a true story.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000HF6XV8|4.0|I've loved this version if the movie since I was a little kid. The only complaint is, it was filmed in very dark settings.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|All the other complaints about this problem on the Kindle are valid.  I tried to download it, instead it just ate up all the space on my hard drive so there was no room left, but then the kindle wouldn't call up the program so there was no way to delete it.<br /><br />To all the folks who are saying this has destroyed your kindle, just reset to factory defaults (hit icon in top right corner next to the battery icon on the old Kindle, then hit \\"more\\", scroll down, hit \\"device\\", scroll down, then you will see \\"reset to factory defaults\\").  Then you can reload all your apps, videos, etc. from the cloud or your computer as the case may be.  You won't get to play Magic but your kindle will be restored to its former functionality.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For a free puzzle game, this is really fun! I'm actually stuck on the last level, level 10, since the game creator hasn't published any more levels. The puzzles aren't terribly difficult and they're really fun to solve.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I didn't think I would like this but when Weather Channel \\"improved\\" their ap I had to get something else.  The weather map alone makes Accuweather an excellent choice.  In this part of the world I can't look at a Weather Channel ap that says updated 2 hours ago.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This movie was just an extreme gorefest with no tension, build-up, or suspense and poor writing, this movie is a prime example of quantity over quality, stick to the original. The special effects weren't bad but that's all you'll get.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Everything is great except for the screen protector.  There should have been a section open for the i9100's toggle/menu button at the bottom middle of the screen. Because the plastic covers this button, you unfortunately can't remove all of the air bubbles.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really really like this game. It is an amazing time waster. It makes night go by so much faster. Awesome
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is great series of books. It has elements, plot lines and story lines that will grab nearly every audience.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I read a review about this game and the reviewer said that it's like, &#34;Temple Run&#34;. I love Temple Run, I love Zombies, seems like a perfect marriage and, it Is but....<br /><br />It's kind of scary. I mean, it gets my heart racing and I'm Zombie fan.  I personally have not made it far past the corn fields...THE CORN FIELDS YOU GUYS!<br /><br />However, if you're a zombie fan, don't let this deter you. For some reason, this game makes me feel like i'm six and sneaking out, past bedtime, to watch a, &#34;Freddie&#34; movie and then having nightmares the rest of the night. That's just me, you probably won't feel like a little girl while playing this but, if you do? You're not alone.<br /><br />Aside from the scare factor, this game is a little more difficult to play compared to, &#34;Temple Run&#34;. Like, &#34;Temple Run&#34; it's fast paced, challenging, addictive and doesn't require you to spend a butt-load of money on junk in order to have an excellent game experience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics and sound.  Who doesn't love the Minions.  I keep killing mine, but I&#34;ll get better!  Love this game.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The biggest problem at this moment is the inability to add friends when they are required to finish tasks. Makes it impossible to continue the game. I can be patient and save up my free gems but how do I get something that requires hearts when I can't add people? I am not the only one with this problem either. This is such a problem to me I knocked it down two stars... fix it an I'll gladly change my rating to 5 stars!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Once I started reading, it was challenging for me to put this book down!  I look forward to the sequel!
B008VO3PA4|3.0|This book was adorable and I gave it as a gift to a friend. However I was expecting laugh out loud - and it wasn't quite there.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such an addictive and enjoyable game and am really enjoying it hurry and create more rooms for us to enjoy
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game for the heck of it, not realizing how addictive it is! The concept is simple, fast paced and challenging. I've been playing this game without purchasing any extras and I've enjoyed my gameplay. I wonder if you ever get to your destination? ;)
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Need to try this one again.  It did not fully download and I need to re-do before I can review.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I fly real fixed wing aircraft and got to say that this is as close as it comes. Superb  control response and handling. The only  small difference is during an air stall the aircraft is a lot easier to recover than a real aircraft which is a good thing for less experienced pilots thus making the game less frustrating.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Laugh out loud funny in several spots. And the minions......who doesn't love minions? Amazon was very easy to use, download and view on my ipad. Very impressed, I will be buying more movies from them
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Starts out fast and goes from there!!! Better then ever enjoy every minute!!! Can't wait for the next chapter to start!!!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|When you're n the mood for something to watch that will give you some laughs and some good old &#34;good vs. bad&#34; battles with love conquers all that requires no thought to follow the plot this is for you.
1936891026|5.0|Follow this up with &#34;Turning Pro&#34;. At first I was unsure about the format, but as I read, I was convinced this guy was on to something.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I called amazon Kindle technical support when my Kindle Fire stopped charging for no apparent reason.  I have only owned the devise for two and a half years, so I was very disappointed when it all of a sudden, quit charging.  Amazon's solution was to send me a new charger, free of cost, (thank you) but it did not work.  I called back, they said there was nothing they could do but sell me a new Kindle Fire.  I am very upset that there is no solution to this known problem with the Kindle Fire.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is easy to use and a fantastic way to bring Radio back into my daily life. With the alarm feature it is a great way to wake up in the morning.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|The author shared her experience and observation on woman in workplace.  Many advice is not just applicable to women but to men as well.
0385335997|3.0|This book has a very high rating, so please don't throw eggs when I say that this was my least favorite of the three books so far. It was interesting to read about what happened to Jamie and Claire in the 20+ years they were apart, and what happened when they found each other again. But I'm starting to tire of there being some major catastrophe around every corner. There were some interesting revelations about them and lots of intrigue, but I'm done with the series for a while.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved the plot and the writing was done well.I appreciate the humor thrown in with the outcome. I would recommend it
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is very fun. I love it. I cant stop playing this game it is so fun. this is truly amazing. you have to try it
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Unlike the execrable Stallone version, this film does a fine job of capturing the brutal urban world that is Mega-City One. The story is well-paced, and Urban plays Dredd with great realism, never straying into the tough guy caricature of a Dirty Harry. The special effects and fight scenes are bloody, but not needlessly gruesome. Thoroughly enjoyable, and it's a shame it didn't do well enough at the box office to merit the well-deserved sequel.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Really addictive at 1st, but slows down later to encourage using real money. Lots ov fun, great for killing time!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Fantastic plot, read it in 2 days, slightly disappointed with the ending felt it was a bit rushed, but still a great read.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This is the handiest thing I have ever bought! All those negatives and the old slides are now on my external harddrive!
B001NLL93W|4.0|Loved the plot and the writing was done well.I appreciate the humor thrown in with the outcome. I would recommend it
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love fairy tales and never get too old to enjoy a flight of fancy.  Thanks for a great read.
1616550414|5.0|My favert part was seeing the prossesies the charters when through to become the one we all know. The cronolagy allows you to fallow the whole story. The book however was larger then I expected .
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book based on the relationship between a teen aged girl and an elderly woman was so interesting I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. I absolutely loved the way Christina Baker Kline wove the story together. She went back and forth between the two main characters so smoothly. I didn't want the story to end. I was wanting it to go on. I hope she writes a sequel to it so I can see how everyone went on with their lives. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Thanks for the movie I added it to my collection of Bourne movies.  I enjoyed it as well as the other Bourne movies
B004LROUNG|4.0|Kept me interested to see how the story lines would intersect and how it would turn out. Not his best work but worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Even my kids can play it and they are pretty young. They love that you can take pictures and stirring the food.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I just loved planet earth as a regular joe it lets me go to places in the world that I will never really be able to go and the quality is just like being there just loved it!
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|From the moment I turn on the app my phone stays acting like it's having a seizure.  even when I exit out of the app the vibrating continues and it doesn't stop until I restart my phone.  The app might be AMAZING but there's no way I'm going to play it on constant vibrate mode. I checked the options to turn off vibrate but you can only adjust sound effects and music. Uninstalled!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good book I've read the series twice. I would recommend this book to everyone it has a little of everything for everyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|When you begin this book, you may think it is one to be skimmed. Resist the urge. There is very little said or done that will not turn out to be important later, and GRRM often uses name-dropping of members of this or that house and the loyalties of said house, etc., as a clue to later action. I started this book three separate times before I figured out that I needed to slow down and make sure I actually understood what was going on at a level beyond the action in the forefront of the scene.<br /><br />The world itself, while based upon the framework of a generic medieval fantasy, comes alive with his richly drawn cultures and geographies. You will be irritated by this at first, and then suddenly you will be sucked into GRRM's world, and you will love it.<br /><br />The best part, though, are the realistically drawn characters. Even the most detestable villains have surprisingly reasonable motivations, although you may not discover these motivations until later on. Conversely, even likeable characters have flaws they must overcome.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any adult lover of fantasy OR of well-developed characters and richly designed worlds. Keep in mind, though, that there are explicit scenes of sex and violence, so it might not be appropriate for younger readers.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I waited to buy this book because I had a very long flight.  I had heard so much about it could not wait to purchase it.  And then the question was why?  I thought the book was written by someone in their teens.  It sucked.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The best game ever. Download this app it's the best game ever. I just hate that you have to log in to Facebook to have less boundaries
B009XIXVU6|1.0|This book does not live up to any of the authors previous books<br />It was slow, hard to keep up with and so many tangents that I just lost my way and got frustrated with these diversions.<br />I gave up 60% pf the way through....it was poor
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I ordered this for my 4 yr old grandson, who loves ANYTHING to do with trains! He ABSOLUTELY loves this movie!! It's a movie for ALL ages! In purchasing this, we were also given a FREE 24 hr viewing on Prime Instant Videos. So my grandson didn't have to wait for it to come in to see it! I can't tell you how many times he's watched this over and over again! Thanks for the quick service and delivery, too!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I thought this was the absolute best btd game ever! It has so many upgrades and new towers! It's a total must have ninjas kiwi app.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Nice story  I enjoyed reading the words that were included with the CD.  I enjoyed the music very  very much.
0765365278|4.0|4 and 1/2 stars really.  I am eagerly awaiting the next book, so that pretty much says it all right there.  Sanderson does linger perhaps too long / often on two of the main character's struggles, but this reiteration is common in the fantasy genre.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series. I was not prepared for the ending. Can't wait to the rest of the story to come out.
1401937268|4.0|I have only recently begun to work with tarot cards. I have three different sets of cards that I use just about every morning with myself in order to become more familiar with the process and figure out the best method for future use. --- Overall I really loved how beautiful this entire deck was. I like that Virtue explained about clearing the deck at the beginning. I used the same process for all my decks. I was also intrigued by not just the spectacular artwork on the cards themselves but also by the edged silver color that really adds a timeless yet historic look to the cards. This deck is by far my most hefty given that you have the 4 suits and then the archangels. I have seen that some people mix the archangels into the entire deck but I keep them separate so that i can know what the \\"spiritual weather\\" is for myself and more importantly to also pick a separate card to know which archangel I should call upon for my day. These cards coupled with my other decks all are always on point. My only qualm is that the descriptions offered in the guidebook for each card are very short (often 3 sentences). I am still confused on the difference between \\"circumstance\\" and \\"person\\" and this is where the additional meanings with keywords and phrases are useful. Despite this small criticism, definitely a great deck, especially for beginners.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know what is so compelling about zombies, but they are.<br />I recommend this series to those who love good survival stories, examining the humanity or lack there of in us all in light of an ever present threat.<br /><br />My complaint, is that at times the zombies become window dressing and background noise to the storyline and less of an active threat. I want more zombie fighting in my zombie movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|We greatly enjoyed the hunger games books, all of the series. We look forward to other, mostly clean, novels appropriate for our teens.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This book is epic!!!! But I don't want to give anything a way. So you will have to read and find out!<br /><br />P.s This book is really funny.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great series that my son got me hooked on and had to have the second season to catch up.  Totally unique
B00CATSONE|5.0|I've always been interested in Nikola Tesla.  While surfing through Amazon.com and looking of bios on the Tesla, I happened on this book. The price was right, FREE!:)<br /><br />I expected less from a free book. The book delivered more than promised.:)  It turned out to be a quite enjoyable read.<br /><br />The author writes in a very light, engaging manner and knows how to tell a story.  Plus, this book serves as a very good introduction to the man, his life, and his inventions.  You could then purchase another book on Tesla that goes into a bit more detail on his life. Having thankfully read this book, you'd already have a roadmap of the man's life.<br /><br />As some others have pointed out, there is an underlying self-help aspect to the biography.  But I found it to be quite complimentary to the subject and instructive.<br /><br />In short, it was a terrific read for a cool, overcast Sunday afternoon.  After having read an 1100 page book followed by a 400 page novel, this was a welcome find.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have really enjoyed having the White Noise App. I am a nature lover but, not always able to get out into it as often as I'd like. So, it's nice to have something that sounds so natural put me to sleep. Or relax me on my break at work.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|Every detail I'm this movie is stylish. Even if the plot is not interesting to you (like if you have no emotions or if you're homophobic), you would still be captivated by Tom Fords impeccable taste and the killer 60's fashions.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is by far the best alarm clock ever--hence the love/hate relationship. The snooze can be set for any time interval. You can choose the number of snoozes before it turns off. I set mine so that I have to solve a certain number of Math problems before snoozing or dismissing in order to wake up my brain.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This movie was very moving.  I can see it again and again.  The impact and message that it relays to the audiance is strong.  Robert De Niro did a fantastic job with is he character.  Also, Jeremy Irons as the priest had the most powerful part.  This movie brought out the injustice that industralism had on people of the rainforest, but had an even deeper message about injustice and conflict against the right for good.
B006M4RN3U|2.0|I had no idea what the lyrics were like when I purchased this CD. Would not have purchased it otherwise.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game amazing graphics one of the best gameloft games out yet I would really recommend this game for people who liked league of leagends good system you can play solo/pvp/co-op and in all I would say best game I have played in a long time
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was very interesting in that Grisham deftly combined humor and intrigue.  Unlike the other books I actually laughed during this reading which in my case is rare.  I find some books cute but I do not often laugh out loud.  This was definitely a good read!
0375842209|5.0|This book is one of the most different, most brilliant pieces of writing I have ever read. At first I wasn't sure where it was going, and its story-telling different than anything I've read. By the second half I couldn't put it down.  Powerful.  Memorable. Still absorbing it. To say anymore would spoil the experience of discovering it page by different page.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|As freecell goes, this is a good app. No ads as promised. Down side, can only play while connected to Amazon app store so you waste minutes or data when not on WIFI. As soon as I find another add free version that is stored on the device or SD card I will be deleting this app. I don't need Amazon knowing my skills at playing freecell.
B000000WFZ|5.0|After seeing The Mission movie, I was wanting the soundtrack.  This is a great soundtrack as was the movie.  The will listen to this quite often.
1616550414|5.0|This is a fantastic book and well worth the wait to get. It is very high quality and is packed with information that just isn't available to most people. Definitely an amazing value for something that is such a good quality and easily one of the best books Nintendo has ever Produced.<br /><br />Also LMS Group are astounding and managed to fix some issue that stemmed from a glitch on Amazon's side. Very good customer Service and blazingly fast response time and genuinely cares for their customers.
B0027MJU00|4.0|It took me a while to totally grasp the whole image of what was taking place as I read about the horrible massacre that hit the Day farmstead that killed three family members and left Libby Day the lone survivor.  Told from three different points of view this story crosses time barriers that allow you to glimpse inside the Day's family life before the tragic event, during the event and the aftereffect.  Twenty-five years later, Libby's life is hopeless and bleak, playing the part of a victim she has allowed herself to be a ghost and disappear from life.  Finally running out of money, she has to find a means for survival so he comes across a club that will provide her with funds if she reconnects with her past.  Search for work or find out what really happened twenty-five years ago?  The idea of having to work at a job has Libby opening her past and searching for the truth of what really happened at her house that took that lives of her family members.  Did she really see her older brother Ben kill her family or was that a suggestion brought on by the doctors to the seven-year Libby?  As her past haunts her, she finds out the truth about her family and the demons from her childhood surface making this book one of my hair-dryer books (one I cannot put down even to blow dry my hair). Just when you think Libby has uncovered a secret from her past that puts a suspect on her list another secret is unleashed that draws another suspect into the limelight.  Little Libby will never be the same.<br />I really enjoyed crossing the time barriers and reading the story from 1985 when the murders take place and now when Libby is uncovering all the details.  I was having these ah-ha moments and waiting for Libby to discover the facts as I discovered tiny details between the two time periods.  The language was rich and raw at moments and you felt so much energy in them.  They just screamed from the pages.  Ben, Libby's brother who she thought she saw murder her family is taking the rap for the murders and is in prison and he is content with being behind bars even though he knows what went down that day. As Libby visits him she knows he is hiding something and she has to dig deeper than she even thought possible to uncover the mystery behind the events of that tragic day.  Oh, I love a great mystery and the events leading up to this incident were so secret that it's no wonder they lied buried for so long.ap for the murders and is in prison and he is content with being behind bars even though he knows what went down that day.

B001HC8516|5.0|I found this book to be extremely interesting. Some of the chapters I took to heart and some others not so much. It's good information for whoever is looking for answers!
B00DU74U74|4.0|My expectations were pretty low going into this movie, having read so many bad reviews from the critics. But, I thought the movie was a lot better than the critics gave it credit for. It was  entertaining, and I really love the twist of seeing the story through the eyes of the alien. I also liked how it taught about our own humanity, the positive and the negative. Overall it was a good science-fiction movie and also, I thought, a good love story. Definitely worth seeing.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|Movie was great.  I really enjoyed it.  British zombies and an unlikely here.  But the thing is, Amazon forces you to buy the movie if you want to watch it.  I HATE that.  It's on cable and tv, watch it there until they decided to rent it cheap.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|I was looking for something recent and a good mix of all Swedish House Mafia since they have now separated the group.  This mix was it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I never read. I don't laugh a lot. I bought this book on a whim for a flight from Chicago to Pittsburgh. I actually had to apologize to the lady sitting next to me because I could not stop laughing out loud. This was an awesome read.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A coming of age story, and a love story with a message of being useful even in unorthodox roles. Things haven't changed so much since Victorian times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book my favorite character was Katniss because of her bravery! Overall it was my favorite book
B0030IG0C6|4.0|Made a very nice gift for my granddaughter who really loves Unicorns.  Nice size, pretty colors  goes well on her bedroom furniture.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Nothing like the original movie.  Has great CGI.  But I was a bit disappointed overall.  I rented it, and watched it all in two sittings.  Would never buy it or watch it again.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is boombasticly, awesomely, amazing. Graphics are great, gameplay is really fun. If you like wave based battle RPGs  then this game is for you my friend. As usual (at least for me anyway) the touchscreen joystick is a little tricky to get used to. But beyond that this game has (spoiler alert) knocked my socks off! (I say spoiler alert because once ones socks have been knocked off it tough to get them re-knocked off) I'm only a level six and have run through the first stage a couple times but I gotta say, I'm impressed! 5of 5 stars!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I felt like applauding at the end of it but realized that would be odd. I can't wait to start the next book, but sad it's over after the 3rd! Aaaahh! I love this book!
B004SIPAJG|4.0|Had seen the film before ordering it. For the year it was made it is a fun movie about the evolution of ballroom competition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I are walking dead fans! This season was a nail biter and we can't wait until Season 4!
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|it took so long too download that I never was able to get the entire movie and watch it.<br />Bummer
B007W8S2MG|5.0|You see all theses perfect scores?  That's not a good sign.  It's a warning.  Once you start this game, you basically belong to it anytime you have a few minutes to spare. So if you want to flush time away on a long flight, there really isn't any other option than this.<br /><br />Fire Emblem: Awakening on the 3DS is a pretty solid travel game.  Deep too.  But it's a kiddy pool in comparison to Persona 4; Golden.  This game is what the term \\"time sink\\" refers to.  For the first four hours the only thing you do is just scroll dialog prompts.  That's it.  Then you get to Yukiko's Castle and find out you're not leveled high enough to make it three floors.  So you grind it out for another two or three hours up and down the floors to collect personas and get somewhere around level 14 or 15 to get through.  Congratualtions, you have about 7 hours under your belt and that's pretty much the tutorial.  You're not even started.  You have to choose band or drama.  Basketball or Soccer.  You have to read books and fold envelopes.  You have to buy weapons and sell metal to craft new ones.  Don't forget to juggle Yukiko, Rise and Yumi.  If you're not laughing after the first nurse connection, you're better off with checkers.<br /><br />This game is freaking crazy and crazy massive but excellent entertainment in the exact same way chipping away at a huge book is.  Make no mistake, the difficulty spikes are brutal in the middle of the journey and a lot of the overall play time is grinding out levels, but that does not take away from the unbelieveable size and depth of Persona 4. Later in the game grinding becomes less necessary than fusing tough Personas.  If you never got around to touching the original PS2 game and you really want something to play on the go that borders on endless, this is worth buying a Vita for.  You can pick one up for less than $200 on eBay.  If you want something besides a book to read on the go, the game is totally worth it.  After three full play throughsin more than 100 hours over the past few months, I can say Persona 4 is pure monster collecting, level grinding, J-Pop booming simulation Nippon Mythology Scooby Doo weirdness, but it will melt away static hours like nothing you've ever seen.  Here it is:  I've been playing video games since Star Raiders (look it up) and it's easy to say Persona 4 is one of the best games you will ever play.<br /><br />Advice.  Stick it out.  Grind it out.  Keep multiple save files all the way down the list and go for the full ending with a minimal of spoiling yourself.  It's a slog, but the final payoff is pretty fantastic.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Please save money do not rent this....by far the absolute worst movie I have seen in years. Pure hell to the last moment. The thing bounces back and forth so much you can't care less what happens an beg for the ending.<br /> Apparently we get so stupid in the future we all speak like the kids in under the thunder dome?<br />Look away<br /> look away<br /> just hope I can forget the experience totally.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I'm hoping Julian Fellowes was part of this, too! It seems very familiar. Only 3 episodes, or am I missing something?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A few words of caution:  don't read this sitting alone in public.  People will stare as you laugh out loud.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|fantastic writer , love his descriptive style. Good story line overall a great read. Hope to read more of this author
B0042JTAI8|4.0|Well written, placed in the time of the Second World War . A mystery story involving the life of one of the children who were evacuated from London. It gives a good understanding of life during that period.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a well written book and at times kept me on edge. The first bit I though, oh, I can't read this, then I read on. I fell in love. I would read this book again. Also I wish more people would read books like this, realize how some churches really are. How recently even, and probably still are treating people and children when they can get away with it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|What a creepy story. Couldn't put it down. A great read. An amazing love story with a real twist. Great ending.
B00B81B0HC|4.0|Imagine Dragons  have put together a very solid album.  I had heard Radioactive so many times I just had to check out the rest of their work.  This is the type of album you just push play and let it go.  Their are a few songs that do stand out, but the majority is just good music.  Yes Radioactive is a great starting song, but it is the framework for an overall good album.  The songs were fresh, nothing that has been done over and over.  You will have a smile on your face and you won't know why.  For me this album makes wonder what is next or is this just a flash in the pan.  Either way sit back and push play.  Overall, this is an album that you tend to like certain aspects of the songs the more you listen.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Not sure? about some of the language written matching the era of this novel, but I still can not wait for book two!
B005544TRQ|4.0|I like it,I is cool, I think it is likeable, and I am just writing things because I have to add so many words. Can't I just say I like it?
1608871819|3.0|This book is beautifully bound, but that's literally about it. The book has a bunch of  very crude concept art in a matte finish with the dingiest colors. There is not much new unwritten or unknown info in the book either. I wouldn't recommend it to most people unless you have plenty of money to waste on something that has nice binding, the superman logo on it but nothing between the covers!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|If this ends up being an epitaph album for Black Sabbath, then they could scarcely have done better! This is vintage-sounding Sabbath sounding like late '60s or early '70s Sabbath. Iommi's licks shimmer with precision and craftsmanship; Geezer's bass lines thunder and crackle like the hammer of Thor, Mjolnir. Ozzy's vocals are in fine form, and his voice hasn't sounded this good since the '80s I think. They've thrown a well done piece of red meat to metal fans everywhere!! 13 adds an excellent melodic addition to the band's canon, and interweaving Christian themes within the lyrics hits an ironic and yet plausible note as well. \\"Live Forever\\" rings true with autobiographical honesty. \\"Dear Father\\" comes from the front pages and yet is not accusatory as much as it is truthful and a bit melancholy too. There's not one bad song here, and as a fan I salute the boys and all involved because the professionalism and desire to produce a great album paid off. Metal goes full circle as the band from Birmingham revisits their past to solidify their present. Rock 'n Roll baby!!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I am a puzzle freak and love mysteries.. With this game you get a little of both. Be prepared though, because once you begin, you can not put it down !!!  Very addicting!  Move over Candy Crush !!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC1K66|5.0|I waited too long to read this book. Don't make the same mistake. Read it now. It's a deep story about trying to undestand what drives people to do hateful things.
B00009R6H2|5.0|Easy install on my tripod. Very secure with the gear head I'm using. Fits and installs as described. A very stable platform for my large lenses.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|its pretty good.  Not as good as the first movie, but still a lot of laughs  worth seeing.  thank you
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an excellent app to have for any age group.  You'll enjoy playing the game.  Actually, it's very addictive & you'll have to force yourself from playing it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|First book was the best. Found it was a little bit of more the same thing over and over. Easy to read, but didn't set me on fire like it obviously did many others!
0525478817|5.0|I was rather skeptical of reading this book when I arrived at a bookstore to take a look at it. The customer service worker told me I could find it in the &#34;Teen Section&#34; of the store. That put me off and I left without buying it. I eventually kept hearing great things about this book and decided to purchase it.<br /><br />This book was GREAT! Easy read and tear-jerker. (DAMN YOU JOHN GREEN!)<br />Luckily, I read most of this book in the comfort of my own home, so I didn't have any embarrassing moments being that random person crying in the park reading teenage-some book.<br /><br />Overall, this book is written in a relatable way, suspending your willingness of disbelief.<br />The characters can easily be someone you can imagine being friends with...<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this book.<br />No seriously, buy it.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|After hours of research and reading reviews we finally decided to get a Jumperoo instead of a stationary exersaucer. We bought this for our 3 month old daughter because she was no longer satisfied laying and playing with the toys on the activity gym; she wanted to be able to sit up. She is very active and needed something more stimulating now that she has mastered rolling over in both directions.<br /><br />We have had this for about 2 weeks and she has really enjoyed it. The only drawback is that it is made for a taller child. She is 24&#34; and her feet dangle about 2 inches off the ground even on the lowest height setting. We solved the problem by sliding a small box under her feet and now she can bounce herself while she plays. She has tons of fun and can usually play for 20-30 minutes at a time without getting bored. However, she is not yet able to turn herself to get to any of the other toys. Maybe when her feet can actually touch the floor.<br /><br />Like other reviews have mentioned, the butterfly toy is basically just a limp noodle. She can't even play with it because it dangles over the far side of the toy ring and she can't reach it. I am planning on calling Fisher Price to see if they will send a replacement. Also, the reason we picked this particular theme over others were the reviews that talked about how wonderful and stimulating all the toys were. She loves the toy in the front that makes music, even though it drives my husband crazy. But this is the only toy she will play with for a long period of time, the others just don't seem to hold her interest.<br /><br />Update 7/2/15: This is maybe one of the best baby items that I have ever spent money on. My 2nd child is 6 months old and she has been using it for the last 3 months and loves it. She is very fussy and and was colicy until she hit 6 months and this was the only way we could keep her from crying for hours on end. It has made it through almost a year's worth of use between my 2 kids and lookslike it is virtually brand new. I even bought a 2nd one to keep at my in-laws so that my daughter has something familiar when she stays with them. She is just now learning to bounce herself but she figured out how to turn herself and play with the toys right away. She is 27&#34; tall at 6 months and can easily touch the floor on the 2nd height setting. If anyone is debating between this and the evenflo jumper system, I would buy this one a million times over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun. A lot like temple run. My son and I both play. The minions are so cute. Love it.
B00333NCTM|5.0|This was a wonderful story of a crazy life, lived by a rock n roll legend. Very heartfelt and humorous. Ozzy rocks!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it over vacation. This book makes you feel like you are really there with the characters.  Amazing.
B004V9MU86|4.0|A different book to what I would usually choose. Sometimes I really enjoyed it, sometimes I found it a little harder to get into. I would recommend others read it. I thought due to the text that I may have found it better to read the book version rather than on my kindle.<br />Sad story, but worth it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The experience was nice and a family fun game for children to have fun<br />And hours of fun that comes with challenges.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I confess, as a writer, that I am not a reader of horror, therefore, Stephen King's novels barely registered on my radar screen. I further confess, having never read a King novel, that I had assumed his prose would be simplistic, overtly stylized (due to the genre), and overly dramatic. I could not have been more wrong. King is a master writer in the sense that Beethoven was a master composer, and da Vinci was a master painter.<br /><br />This book (On Writing) should be on the must-read list of all aspiring authors, regardless of their choice of genres. Thank you, Stephen. You've opened my eyes. Now I'm closing my door.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. It's.  Great app. Not the same on my kindle as on my laptop but it's almost all I use my kindle for.<br />Great site great app
B00003CWTI|5.0|I wonder what it's like for a person like p.t. anderson to make a movie so complex, intriguing & interesting that it inspires people to write really long paragraphs about it... I wonder what that feels like to not only inspire people, but to make them literally gush their infatuations with YOUR work. Everyone doesn't just say 'good movie, go see it', they in fact write a really detailed fully paragraphed review that's actually more than just a review; they're confessionals that they understand & breathe the same breath. To understand & to be understood is to be free. This is a truly beautiful movie & I'm completely amazed at it's quality. It must be a very free feeling to know not just that you're understood, but deeply understood & on your level too. Nothing short of amazing. Amazon should make a sixth star to be used ever so sparingly in their ratings for movies like this, it deserves the sixth star by being a movie greater than the rest. Boogie Nights (especially being written at the age of 19), Punch Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, The Master & this movie are all masterpieces, this is a what happens when a truly bright intellectualist makes it in the movie business. Stanley Kubrick, P.T. Anderson & Wes Anderson make truly amazing movies that touch the hearts of the intellectual beings.
B000E5KJHA|1.0|A note to anyone who still purchases HD DVDs....this movie does not work. Sadly, like most Warner Brothers HD DVDs it suffers with whats known as \\"disc rot\\".
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is an awesome puzzle game and so far fun and challenging. Thank you for creating this game since it is not all a hide and seek game
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I purchased the blue ray version at Kmart before realizing that I could get the Blue Ray + 3D from Amazon for less, even after shipping. From now on I will wait the extra day or two and get all my movies this way. Signed, Pleasantly supprised

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I finished it. Hallelujah. It was hard to get into just because it was so unrealistic. No woman on Earth orgasms with one touch of one finger as does the main character. Lol It's just eye rolling. And no college age girl says the silly words and phrases she says, either. Like \\"Double crap!\\" Lmao. And when someone's lips press into a hard line as much as theirs do, I'd expect them to get lip cramps.

B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Love this game! I use to play it on FB as well. Only issue I have is connecting to FB. It keeps telling me I can't connect. If it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.
B009R659L8|4.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK! I have read every book that Mary Higgins Clark has written and I have never been disappointed. This one keeps you guessing until the end. Read and enjoy!  I did!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered this the hour it went on sale on Amazon, and I'm glad I did, because not only did I make it under the cutoff to get the Netflix promotion (which really makes this a steal at $11) but I got it before it sold out and was at my door Friday. After having a few days to play with it, I can safely say this is one amazing device and really a smart move by Google.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little package with an HDMI extender (for those tight ports on your TV), Micro-USB cord, and wall adapter, as well as a little instruction booklet I didn't really look through. To set it up, you just plug it into your HDTV or A/V Receiver (I plugged it right into the front HDMI port of my Denon AVR-1613) then plug in the usb cord for power into your TV's, Receivers, or any other USB port close by (my A/V receiver has a USB port right next to the front HDMI port, you can also plug into the wall if need be). It immediately lights up and, provided your HDTV/ Receiver is setup with CEC (Consumer Electronics Control, allows HDMI to control the device) it'll change the input automatically and even turn on some TVs!<br /><br />Once it's on, you're greeted to nice looking setup screen, it tells you to go to a URL on your Mac/PC to download the small Chromecast application for setup. Once you start setup it actually connects your computer's wifi to connect direly to the Chromecast, this allows you to see what networks are available for the Chromecast to connect to. You can change the name of the Chromecast to whatever you want and select your local 2.4ghz wifi network (hopefully the next revision has 5ghz abilities). It takes a little bit to connect, but once it's on the network, YOU'RE DONE! Here comes the fun.<br /><br />So, the idea of this product is you can send Youtube and Netflix links to the Chromecast and it plays those videos on your TV in up to 1080p with 5.1 surround (surround only for Netflix right now), then your phone, tablet, computer acts as the remote control. However, this is just the beginning of what it can do. First off, you need to have Chrome installed on your computer (preferably the Beta or Dev version, I'll get to why in a minute), then install this extension to have the ability to mirror your chrome internet tabs to your TV: [...]<br /><br />With this extension installed, a button appears in the top right corner of your browser which gives you the ability to stream content on your browser to your TV in 720p max with a click of the mouse. There is a slight half second lag, but no worse than something like WiDi. You have options as well, streaming quality, zooming to fit, and browser re-sizing allow you to change the look depending on your preference and TV/Computer. When you click on the name of your chromecast, it immediately starts streaming and changes the input on your TV/Reciever, you see the tab you started streaming from and you can browse any site and have it mirrored, allowing you to watch Hulu, Vimeo, go to Facebook, anywhere you want on the web. With this, it only casts that one tab, so you can actually browse other tabs or windows on you computer and it won't change what's showing up on your TV, this can be great for watching Hulu in one tab on your TV, and checking facebook on your computer in another tab.<br /><br />Now, getting back to why you should have the Beta or Dev channels of Chrome installed on your computer, this gives you access to the extra Chromecast feature of FULL SCREEN MIRRORING, that's right, Chrome will stream your entire computer's screen. You can see your desktop, folders, and other applications in 720p right on your TV. To do this, you have to click on the little down-arrow in the right hand corner of the Chromecast extension, here you will see \\"Cast current tab\\", \\"Cast entire screen (experimental)\\" and the ability to toggle \\"Audio mode\\"* to stream the audio as well as video from your computer. Selecting entire screen does exactly that, this is obviously something google is still perfecting and testing, but it has worked very well for me so far. It does take a bit more performance from your computer and local videos do not play that smoothly just yet, but it's still a nice feature. You can also drag local videos into your browser and stream that tab, but that has its hiccups as well. This type of screen mirroring is in it's beta stages though, so I'm sure it will be improved upon, streaming videos from the movies app on your phone works much better. The fact that a $35 device like this has this capability is just amazing anyway, I'm very excited to see how it evolves from here.<br /><br />Streaming Netflix is a breeze, using either your phone, tablet, or computer, you can select a movie/show, and select to play on your chromecast. The beauty of this is that the video doesn't stream from your device, so it's not using resources or battery on your phone or computer, the Chromecast plays Netflix natively and your other device just acts as a remote control and you can even exit the app all together and it'll still keep playing on your TV. The chromecast button even shows up in the web browser version of Netflix, making it super easy to find and watch anything. If your family all uses the Netflix app it will stay synced with whatever is playing on the Chromecast and all devices can be used together as remotes, it won't kick anyone off. Netflix looks wonderful on the Chromecast, and if more developers take advantage of the Chromecast like Netflix did, we're in for something really special here (I'm looking at you Amazon Prime!!). Google didn't leave anyone out either, iOS devices have access to the same Netflix app control as Android users.<br /><br />Finally you can play your local music from your phone using the wonderful Google Play Music app, it streams directly to the Chromecast and can even pull songs from your Google Cloud. The album art shows up on screen and you can browse all your music and control it from your phone while it plays on the Chromecast. This is much better and easier than using bluetooth or just plugging your phone into your receiver. Pandora is supposed to add support very soon, so I'll update when that hits, I'm very excited about that and hopefully developers like Spotify will follow suit. Unfortunately, the music app does not allow multiple devices to queue music into a Chromecast playlist, the Youtube app does allow this for videos, and the Nexus-Q did allow this for music, so I'm hoping Google will add that ability very soon, but it's still good for playing a playlist on one device right now.<br /><br />One last note, the Chromecast does get VERY hot to the touch, supposedly this is normal and Google has acknowledged as such. There is a huge heat sink inside that goes right up against the plastic shell, be careful when handling after heavy usage. I think it is designed to handle extreme heat, so you shouldn't worry about the device, but just thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />So, to wrap up, this is one hell of a device for $35, and really should be a part of every living room, it just has so many capabilities and even more potential. Do yourself a favor, and pick one up, you won't be sorry, should make a great gift too!<br /><br />*UPDATE: The \\"audio mode\\" I referred to earlier is actually a feature that lowers video bandwidth in favor of increasing audio bandwidth when streaming for better quality and consistency when playing music from your browser. It DOES make your video extremely choppy, so if you want to watch video, un-check the \\"audio-mode\\" and and your stream will still play audio, but the video will be of a much better frame-rate. You can turn Audio on and off with the little speaker button that shows up when casting.fecting and testing, but it has worked very well for me so far.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Reads like a novel. Beautifully written, the author's account of her experiences resonated with me at so many levels. It is a book that I will read again savoring the images and the wisdom of its metaphors.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This is a movie that caught me by surprise!! I had no idea it was as good as it it. It is a must see for sure.
B006Q2LTRO|5.0|I had my own copy. But decided to give it to newly wed couples. This book really speaks to the heart. Have enjoyed reading it and sharing it with friends!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love waking up to soft sounds instead of the radio blaring me awake. There could be more sound choices, but other than that its great.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have been wanting to read this for so long and I was loving it!  I was enjoying guessing whodunit, then I reached the halfway mark and it was all down hill from there.  It became less and less captivating.  I still don't understand what happened. It was like Flynn was too tired to write anymore.  It just ended.  Very anticlimactic and super disappointing. I can't believe I never heard anyone say this before I bought it.  It's not even about the money, it's about waiting for the grand finale that never comes.  I keep wanting to pick it back up and read the REAL end. Oh well, lesson learned :(
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|the only thing i didn't like about this movie is that there was no wrap up at the end. Even with that though, still a great film.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Awesome..another great read. I think this book was one of the best I've ever read. The characters are easy to relate to
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie but I really wasn't wowed at all.  Bourne Legacy was really missing Matt Damon.  This is an OK to Buy item if you want the collection of the BOurne series but that is about it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show. It's a lot to pay for a season, but it's worth it for HIMYM. Wish I could download the episodes
B009X01FJS|4.0|I have had this cover since the day I bought my kindle (close to 6 months ago.)  It's great and it still is as good as the day I started using it!  It's nice protection for my kindle and easy to use.  I took away 1 star just because of the fact that you have to keep the cover open to charge. (Like others have said)  Other than that, this is a sturdy cover that won't disappoint.
B008D30K7E|3.0|In many ways this book reminded me of the Monty Python movies as the situations Allan ends up in are so extreme and his reaction to them are hilarious. He is the type of character who manages to get himself into and out of the most dangerous situations because of things he says. At times this book is definitely laugh out loud funny and Allan is a very entertaining and endearing character. The story is split between the present ie the chain of events that happen after Allan climbs out of the window and his incredible back story. I found the parts detailing the present tense really entertaining but after about five chapters detailing his back story I became a little bored. The back story is tied to major political events from the USA, to China to North Korea. As I am not that well up on my history and politics I had to concentrate on these chapters and eventually just started to skip them as it was possible to read the present tense chapters independently.
B0058ZZDVS|3.0|I enjoy watching this show, the characters are smart, fun, and compelling. But honestly, not nearly as good as I expected. It sort of feels like the boy's version of Damages - a lot more flash and dirty talk with a lot less substance. The acting is pretty good but I wouldn't expect this show to be winning any awards anytime soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun. It took me awhile to figure out how to play. Needs better directions. But once I figured it out, I was hooked!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|A collection of Fleetwood Mac No one hits.  Doesn't get any better than this.  A must buy for all Fleetwood Mac Fans.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|For me this was an exciting story, easy to watch and  a wonderful visual experience.And it is not R rated.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|Daughter is exactly the kind of music I was looking for at the time. I can't stop listening to this album.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I wanted to read this book after really enjoying the film. I am happy to say the book was even better. Pat's character is much more developed and we hear his internal monologue throughout most of the book. He has an almost childlike innocence in the way he describes people and situations which makes the book quite funny in parts. This gives the reader a bit of a break from the darker side of the book.<br />Tiffany isn't as well developed in the book so I can see why Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar. She did an incredible job of bringing Tiffany to life.<br />Overall a brilliantly written book that deals with a subject matter that is hugely underrepresented in literature
B007IXWKUK|5.0|NOW I NEED TO FIND MY CHRISTIAN GREY. THIS SERIES MADE ME BLUSH SO MUCH. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS WHO NEEDED A ......... WHOO HOO
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very addictive. I am a big fan of the old series of Myst and this is the closest game I have ever found. I started by playing Can you Escape. Love these type of games. Then moved on to similar games.  Suddenly found The Room and I was elated. I am begging you to make a sequel. The graphics are amazing.  Such detail. Again, Myst comes to mind when playing this game. Also the option for hints is a great feature if you get stuck, although I try not to use them to make it more of a challenge. The tutorial in the beginning is helpful too. I only wish that it lasted longer. Again, sequel?
B008EKMB82|4.0|This is my first book review on Amazon. I'm an avid reader, but haven't felt the need to write a review before this.<br />I finished this book today and can't stop thinking about it. I won't bother describing the story, since many others have done that for me.<br />First of all, Ozeki's writing is beautiful. I was so moved by every part of Nao's story, even at times to tears.<br />What bothered me throughout the novel, was Ruth's story. I wasn't at all disturbed by the mystical connection of Ruth to Nao. The problem I had, was that I found Ruth's part of the story to be boring. I couldn't wait to get through those parts of the story and back to Japan. The best part of Ruth's portion was that it was an opportunity to learn quite a bit about Eastern philosophy.<br />I agree with another reviewer who said it would be better to read this novel in book form. I did find it difficult to use the footnotes in the electronic version.<br />Despite my criticisms, I really loved this book. I do think it requires a reader who's willing to do a little work to read it, but well worth the effort.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first book with the Jack Reacher character.  I bought this  book because I would like to continue to read this series and needed to start with the first one.  I do like the character very much.  This is a super read.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Excellent game....best card game I've playd on the kindle hands down. Keep up the good work cannot say enough about the quality
B007Z8ZKS2|3.0|This was one of the most quoted books on Goodreads last year and reading some of them prompted me to buy the book as I was impressed by the beauty of the language Green uses. There are several memorable quotes throughout this book that really make you sit up and listen and have the power to change your perspective on topics as big as the meaning of life. Green certainly is a talented writer. However I found myself skimming through a lot of sections where the focus was not on the characters and their emotions and I found the sections around Peter Van Houten a bit boring.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The threads of this book have woven a colourful  tale of hope, love, denial, and reward. I didn't want it to end... would love to wrap myself in its warmth again. Will put it on a shelf to read again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It started as an ad on my kindle.  Then I went to Floors. Then I discovered The Room.  There is no going back.  I love these type of games.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I love the twists and turns of the series. Patty (Close) is almost terrifying in her role as a high poweredNY attorney.She is always thinking five steps ahead of everyone else...except for Ellen (Byrne). Exceptional writing and casting. I'm just in season three and I look forward sitting down with a glass of wine after work to watch the next episode.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Emmy is terrific - what a talent - I hope she does many more - I will likely buy everything she does.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I very much like the format of this game - it's a clean, straightforward presentation of the classic game. The newest update messes up the name of the game icon. Please fix!
B0031R5K8G|4.0|Really interesting story about how it is to be someone or have a family member who is not neuro typical. By getting inside the mind of Christopher the author manages to educate the reader as to the challenges and daily fears someone who is not neuro typical faces. Despite the seriousness of the subject matter the book is also funny in parts. Well worth a read
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game. I made a mansion on creative and a town on survival. Keep up the awesome updates Mojang! (I am Skye_Line off of computer so friend me!)
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This movie, based on facts, should be shown to your children, and Grandchildren. despite the adult nature of the situations and characters. In this World, where there are actually people who deny that the Holocaust happened, every effort should be taken to inform the younger Generations, of the True Horror, that is still alive in the hearts of mankind, when greed and hatred dictate the morality, and where one race feels above another, to the point of a \\"solution\\" being found, and people become less than animals.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great insight as to that time period.  Each of the characters have his or her own specially quality, especially the Dowager--great comments.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|In my opinion of this game I would have to say that I enjoy it quite a bit.  Each level is in 3-D and in bright vivid color.  It is easy to control.  I purchased it through my Kindle Fire and I am happy that I did.  I don't really have any complaints about it except that I think it is a little too easy and that it could be more challenging.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, it is fun in seeing how each level is different.  All in all I would recommend this app to anybody looking for a twist on the original game of Breakout.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you want to spend your entire time screaming at the main character to shut up, this is a perfect read.
B00BBA6FOI|3.0|Sandberg's book is a very important book for women today and I think its fantastic that a woman of her influence and status has tackled this subject. However as someone who had a senior position in a large corporation and who leaned in to the extent that I fell over I feel that Sandberg does not leave room for the women who for leaning in is not always possible.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Super comfortable.  I forget these are on, as opposed to my Sony MDR-7506's.  I can wear them all day before I feel any ear fatigue.  Very wide stereo image.  On a good mix you can really hear the blend of frequencies, even the low's (kick) will jump out at you and the high are not overpowering, just pleasant.  If you mix in these, you will notice that some things are hard to eq or compress, but other than that they are great and really help you space out your mix.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The addition of a booster draft is great. This years decks are just not as good as the previous versions
B002ZG99CC|4.0|This is a wonderful story of overcoming common childhood fears. My kids love this movie. Only one profane word used a few times in one scene that I wish was missing, resulting in 4 stars instead of 5.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I ordered this bag for use with a Nikon D5100/battery grip and a Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED IF AF-S VR lens. The Camera bag product description states height as 10.2\\". My camera/lens combo measures exactly 9\\" and this bag is way to small for it to fit. Usable height space in the bag is more like 6.5\\" so I have returned it.  I had looked through all the customer revues before purchasing and found conflicts in what was said to fit in this bag. I also posed the question to the reviewers (a nice feature I have used before) however receiving no response I ordered the bag as it was the only way I would know for sure. This seems like a well made product and is certainly reasonably priced. It will fit a camera /battery grip combo nicely, just be advised the attached lens has to be under 3.5\\".
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|truly great game, just wish that most of the goals didn't require the full game. probably going to buy since it's so fun and only $.99.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was great and very well written. The only thing is, Collins is picking of a lot of the mane characters like flies. I think it takes the concept of the first one a little too far... But other than that its a great read and i love it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Illustrating the paradox of Afghanistan, Hosseini once again gives a story which promotes better understanding of the Afghan people and their experiences as they live through and survive their wars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was apprehisive at first but now that I have started playing it, it's very addictive. It's always a battle for first place for my family and friends.
159315724X|4.0|The Compound Effect is a must read for anyone ready to make some changes in thier life whether it be lifestyle or income.
B00C5XBAOA|4.0|My daughter was thrilled to get this. It was a really affordable way for her to get the whole set.
B000A1SZ2Y|2.0|I could not get it to focus, but maybe I just don't know what I am doing. It is easy to attach to lens.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I would love this game if it would give me the gold bars after passing a few levels. I am not connected to Facebook, maybe that is the reason why...
B003W5C0VW|5.0|what's not to like about any Stones album.  Just have to buy them all Great stuff, just gets better and better
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is an interesting game. I keep coming back to it and play as long as I can.  I love the competition games and caring for the horse.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book was recommended by Porter Stansberry and his staff at Stansberry Research.  I really agree with James' philosophy and will read this book again.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Love love love the show. Had trouble with the streaming on my laptop, called your tech support and they fixed it quickly. Tech support was very quick and helpful. Unfortunate to need tech support thru no fault of my own but at least they answered & fixed immediately! Love love love that I (customer) can get immediate reply from amazon by phone, email and whatever the 3rd option is. Amazon rocks.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|'Watchmen' reads like the screenplay for an amazing movie (as in better than the one they actually made for it). Moore creates a variety of fascinating characters who he uses to explore everything from the usefullness of capes to morality to the meaning of life itself.<br /><br />Buy this book. Do it now.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book so much. I hope everyone decides to read this book and feels the channel of love and emotions
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I'm not usually hyper aware of diversity issues but found myself at the end of the movie wondering why the world of Despicable Me is so danged white.  A Mexican wrestler villan, a crazy little Asian wig guy and a rendition of the Village People's YMCA does not a diverse universe make.  Cute? Yes. Formulaic? Yes. Representatve of the wider world?  No.  Sort of a 50's-60's Disney world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OK I know I might sound crazy saying this but this game is way better than temple run  I love the minions and now they have there own game  also in this game there are a bunch of mini games too so I would recommend this game to anyone!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I read it in just a few days! It keeps youhooked at all time... Got a little trouble with allllll those names...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. It's a really great game for kids. They could learn more of the responsibility side of things.
B004FOA84A|3.0|'The Secret of Grisly Manor' is one of those room-escape style games where instead of breaking out, you're breaking in and exploring. The puzzles and item usage is pretty standard for a game like this.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the game is too short like some of the other reviews here, but I would say that once you've beaten it the first time, there's no point in replaying it because there aren't any puzzles that will take you long to beat again or any game mechanics you'll forget and have fun relearning.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|John Corey is overplayed.  It is a slow, linear path to an ok ending.  90% smart aleck remarks and 10% content.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't get enough of this game so much fun!!!! Love the minions in the movie.. so what better game to play. Lots of challenges too
1401937268|5.0|A beautiful selection of Angel Messages that allow the angels to connect.  It does not allow a negative direction but instead positive redirection.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Very interesting reading.  Inspired me to read more Vonnegut. Very glad for the opportunity to read any of this author's work.
6303444202|5.0|The video &#34;Music Man&#34; was delivered promptly. It arrived in better than new condition. The wrapping was tight, box new, and the VHS played clearly with no flaws. This famous musical will enthuse anyone, regardless of age. We have thoroughly enjoyed this Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family), Robert Preston (Victor/Victoria), and Hermione Gingold (award winning British actress)production. Even Ronnie Howard (Opie on the Andy Griffith Show), delighted everyone. I especially loved this VHS  because of the superior sound and color quality, not usual for a vintage video product. I also loved the low cost and high quality.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|I've played Doodle God and Doodle Devil online. After playing this game, I realized that what made this style of game fun wasn't the logic challenges or the occasional silly creation, but the artwork and style. Doodle God/Devil had better artwork and had a special transition when you fused elements that was fun to watch, where as in Alchemy, everything just kind of happens, so you don't feel successful when you make something new. Plus, Doodle God/Devil organized all the different elements into groups that made navigation and experimentation easy. Alchemy went with a selecting menu that means you have to keep grabbing elements to fuse, which gets frustrating.<br /><br />You can still have some fun with it, but I'd definitely recomment you spend the money on Doodle God/Devil over this.
1608862801|4.0|My 9 year old daughter is an Adventure Time fan.  She read the whole book in a very short amount of time and said there wasn't anything great about it.  She did, however, get lots of looks from other kids whenever she took it out of the house to read.  Not too many parents knew about these volumes.  Would make a good stocking stuffer or reward for good behavior/report card.
B005IH0MM6|4.0|A lethal version of Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The micro world combined with smatterings of Biology and a race for survival makes for a great read.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|I listened when they debuted and I liked it!!... Then I started to listened more and more and more, and now decided to buy it because in my country the album doesn't sell.<br /><br />I think the music is incredible! A perfect combination betwen heavy metal and pop, that make you feel full of energy. Apart of that, I admire the work of Olaf, the guitarist.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|The only reason it isn't five stars is because the subject matter is soooo dark.  There are shocking twists, and moments of both beauty and terror.  The main crime in the story isn't the most disturbing thing about the book.  The relationship between the mother and son is desperately disturbing.  It was a complete page turner, even though you were afraid of what might come next.  I tell everyone about this book, but tell them to wear their seatbelt, because it is a wild ride.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun, but also feels like brain workout. Think sudoku after it ate a rainbow. I'm glad I purchased it!
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I first read this book in high school and loved it, so I bought it for my Kindle to reread, and while it's still a good book, it doesn't hold up as well the second time through.<br /><br />'I am the Messenger' tells the story of Ed Kennedy, a man chosen to help the residents of his ghetto-ish town, and the people he meets along the way. Most of the characters and lessons learned are fun and inspiring.<br /><br />The only problems I have with this book are:<br /><br />1. Zusak uses a lot of one sentence jokes and descriptions that get annoying after a few chapters, and<br />2. The ending reveal of who's manipulating Ed is pretty dumb.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty good game.  Makes you think and use problem solving skills to achieve each level.  I recommend it.
B00APAS1MY|5.0|Great book, insightful, note taking worthy, use your highlighter or post it tabs throughout the book for passages to remember, light-bulb or aha moments in every chapter, another great book from Paulo Coelho
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am being totally honest. This game is amazing. I play it all the time and it even updates! Stocked!
140006922X|5.0|A very well written book. The author is definitely a great scholar, with in depth knowledge of the subject. Wood recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Text is so small you damn near need a magnifying glass to read. I uninstalled since I get a headache from struggling to read.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Don't know where to start. Everything about this 3D movie was phenomenal. The picture, the amazing colors and depths, the characters, the 3D - which was always present and added so much to the joy of watching - the lovable cast.<br />Just a movie to turn to over and over and over and ...
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It all starts to come together.  Full of  surprises  that could be predicted.  The characters  begin developing and growing beyond their initial introduction.  The story becomes richer and more compelling.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|THIS IS THE GAME FOR U it's FREE and its almost as if call of duty and battlefield were mixed together and its easy to play. only complaint is the diamonds. It's so tempting to use one for a redrawn faster but u only can buy them.
B0084IRI9G|5.0|This a fabulous book, so easy to read, so satisfying, so enthralling and entertaining, thought-provoking.  Just loved it- read it twice!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|this app works excellent its very nice people too access computer from anywhere I was recommended apps anywhere I have all my computer at home on top
B007THA4FI|3.0|If the mystery written under her pseudonym is like this one, it's draggy and slow. Rowling hardly adheres to the precepts taught in writing classes. Harry Potter is her genre. She should stick to it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's a great game but the fact that you have to use your bits to play the games the the ponies is ridiculous in my opinion you should be able to just play them without using your bits
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd 2 is needed cos this film was great and the best film of 2012 by a country mile and then some
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Incredible special effects, great story telling, and the best part is the fresh crisp feel you get while enjoying this movie. When you want to be living in that surreal world I think that's when the director delivered a great piece of science fiction. Its that world that we can't currently live in but would like to.<br /><br />BTW - I saw a review about poor character development. Lets compare this to the recent Prometheus that probably achieves the same level of special effects and feel but spends a lot of time developing a bunch of characters i wasn't crazy about. Here in Oblivion you get all your answers at the end and all the characters are well... congruent. I always find it annoying when there's too much character development and you get something like a Dr. Jekyll Mr Hyde feel with a bunch of characters you don't care very much for. I'd rather just see a few characters fully explored than a bunch of GI Joe's where you know a ton of facts about but don't end up relating to them and seeing them die off doesn't really bother you at all.<br /><br />I think a big part of good science fiction is that future world you want to show to the audience and spending too much time on multiple plots and character development takes away from it. Oblivion has the perfect balance.<br /><br />Anyways, loved it want to see more movies like this. Certainly raises the bar for modern science fiction.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Great game, but it's impossible to fully upgrade/unlock all the towers/agents/abilities without in app purchases. If it were a free game it wouldn't be a big deal, but considering the fact that this game was $2.99, it's a bit shady. Knowing what I know now, I would not have paid more than a dollar or so, but I guess there are worse things to blow 3 bucks on. If you like tower defense games, with seemingly never ending waves of balloons, then this is great (assuming you have out played Kingdom Rush and want something similar).
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Excellent short stories of experience, knowledge and wisdom.  Expand your horizon and your awareness.  It's like taking a daily suppliment for the mind.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|it passes the and its fairly interesting but it is far to short<br />also this game needs to be a little harder
B003DNN0L2|4.0|This was a great movie. Very funny! I I watched it for date night at home and we found it pretty funny and lighthearted.
140006922X|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet, but it's fantastically amazing as of yet. Very well researched and presented. I bought it instantly after seeing this author handle a very upsetting interview on Fox News extremely well. Definitely recommend.
1419705644|5.0|Been waiting for this for a long time and its soooooooo cool. I wish other shows would do this. It's super funny and if your a hardcore fan you'll LOVE it. Not an art book or story board book, but a weird encyclopedia with stuff for the fans. For the price its great.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Nice game!!!!!!!! I enjoy this game but it has a few problem. It needs to give out more credits!!!! I am on level 104!!!!!
B009MZQRHE|5.0|I am in my 30s and still think of this as of of the best films I have seen in my lifetime. I love a young Tim Curry as a sweet transvestite.
B004ADF7RO|3.0|The Goonies was a fun type fantasy film the first time around. The fact that it was one of Spielberg's first films made it a classic. My family and I have seen it at least 3-4 times and we always feel good afterwards. Especially the wife and I......!!! Great light entertainment......!!!
B00BS7HNTK|5.0|Nearly a dozen musicians collaborating in the most organic and heartfelt way. There is nothing artificial or gimmicky about this music. The cynics may want to dismiss this music as some anachronistic attempt to speak to something long lost, but all I heard was love, beauty, and a desire for community.
B001993Y2C|5.0|Got this as a birthday gift for my husband, and he geeked out so hard. I had never watched the show, but my husband loves it. The fact that the box was cool and it came with a cylon action figure. Overall this was a great gift, I set the bar to high.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good game except money income is low. It would be better if receiving money didn't take so long. But besides that, great game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is fun at the beginning but then it gets kind of boring. after u play it a while<br /><br />  THE END
B0063M22QO|3.0|I enjoy playing the game a way to relax.  I prefer more of a challenge when I'm in competitor mode.
B00633W614|4.0|Meant to read this on vacation - but once I started I couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to more in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! The kids and I laugh and laugh while playing. Great game for free!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This Is an fantastic book. I was spellbound. I was left completely speechless by the end of it. This is probably the best book I will ever read. Collins is an amazing writer.
B008OOYALE|3.0|The game itself is good but loads too slow!  I also don't like paying real money for gems. The dragons are cute.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved that book.<br />Seriously interesting. I am in 6th grade and it took me a matter of days to read catching fire<br />I cant wait to read the 3rd book. But i have 1 problem.

0525423273|5.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br /> What I Know about France: Eiffel Tower.Louvre.Paris.Croissants.Crepes.Je voudrais un coca sil'vous plait. I went to Europe when I was 17 (Italy,France and Spain) Unfortunately we didn't visit Paris. I went to Southern France-Provence, Cannes, Nice, Nimes, Carcassonne-all absolutely GORGEOUS, like out of a movie. The food was amazing, there were incredible gardens, old castles, the Mediterranean...so I instantly liked the setting of this book.<br /><br /> I had no trouble getting through this sweet, romantic, cute, funny story. First of all it's set at a boarding school in France..um AWESOME. I easily connected with the main character, Anna, and her feelings of insecurity. I personally hated high school with a fiery passion. I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of a mean girl (or in my case mean boys).  And then there's St.Clair-oh I mean Etienne. Where can I get one??  I now have another literary crush.<br /><br /> The supporting characters really didn't do much for me, but I warmed up to them towards the end of the book. The writing style was easy to follow and I liked that the author didn't cute-sify the writing. There are some young adult books where some of the things the characters say make me cringe. Oh and then there are the descriptions of Paris-I felt like I could close my eyes and picture myself standing on Point Zero making a wish or standing atop Notre Dame looking down on the city.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This book came highly recommended and it did NOT disappoint. I'm ready to go to Paris!  4.5/5 \\"Stars\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy the challenge and I was surprised to discover my 6 year loves playing it with me.  However, don't take to mean it us a simple video game.  It is challenging and fun to me, and I am a pretty smart guy.
B001MSMULG|4.0|This is my first Daniel Silva novel, and it is clear that I will be reading more of them. He is clearly a talented writer and plotter.<br /><br />The last hundred pages or so (from the meeting with Arafat to the end) are remarkable and as good as anything I have read in the genre.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Only down side is it takes two gold towns to play a game. Games should be unlimited.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is awesome and way better than gangstars rio but can any one tell me where the racecar is i cant find it
0525423281|4.0|My Thoughts:<br /> After reading Anna and the French Kiss, I knew I would be reading the next book written by Stephanie Perkins.<br /><br /> Lola is an off-beat, quirky 17 year old girl who is crazy about fashion and her older musician boyfriend Max.  Her 2 dads of course don't approve of him, but she is happy.  That is until twins Calliope and Cricket Bell move back in to the house next door.  Lola hasn't seen Cricket in 2 years, since he moved away and left her confused.  She doesn't like him, she doesn't want to see him, she wishes he would just stay away....or does she?  She loves Max. She wants to be with Max. Right?<br /><br /> So I totally loved the fact that Anna and Etienne from Stephanie's first book show up in this one, Anna as Lola's co-worker, and Etienne as Cricket's dorm mate at Berkley. I still love me some Etienne.<br /> The writing style flows and is easy to follow.  I like that Lola wears weird outfits and has gay dads. I wish I lived next door to a Cricket (boy, not insect), though it is a tad bit difficult to fantasize about a boy who has a name that reminds me of my nemesis: bugs.Overall, I like the characters, I like the story, and I like Lola. But not as much as I loved Anna.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /> \\"Perfect is overrated. Perfect is boring\\"<br /><br /> \\"It's easy to talk about things we hate, but sometimes it's hard to explain exactly why we like something.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Need. What a powerful, frightening word.\\"<br /><br /> \\"That's the thing about depression. When I feel it deeply, I don't want to let it go. It becomes a comfort. I want to cloak myself under its heavy weight and breathe it into my lungs. I want to nurture it, grow it, cultivate it. It's mine. I want to check out with it, drift asleep wrapped in its arms, and not wake up for a long, long time.\\"<br /><br />Final Thought:  Although predictable at times, Lola and the Boy Next Door is a sweet, cute read that made me smile. 4/5
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Although it took a few mintues to take off, once it got going the film is well directed and the acting is superb. John Malkovich steals the movie!
B004HYDM0A|4.0|If you are any part of the internet consumer and social media, you never know who you are chatting with.  Very interesting movie.  I personally would never wait so long to meet someone and if they wouldn't meet I would know there was something up.  Felt so sorry for Neve ... but LOVE him in Catfish, the tv show.
B00077F948|3.0|I have listened to John Williams for decades and generally find his playing appealing - but not on this particular CD.  It's obvious he likes Barrios but I didn't find the sound and/or interpretation compelling enough.
1442419814|4.0|My Thoughts:<br />Uglies is the first book in this series, followed by Pretties, Specials, and Extras.<br /><br /> The world presented in this book is completely unique and was highly fascinating to me. It's a word where when you hit puberty, you're considered to be an UGLY. You live in Uglyville, wear ugly clothes, are don't have any fun. When you turn 16, you are sent to have a surgery to become a PRETTY. You then get to go live in New Pretty Town, where you wear fabulous clothes and attend amazing parties, and leave all your ugly worries behind. Pretties are happy.  EVERYONE wants to be pretty and be with the pretty people.<br /><br /> Sounds simple and easy right? Well NOT everything is as it seems.<br /><br /> This book was entirely story/world-driven for me. The writing was good, but the world was GREAT. The author did a good job of building and introducing a new world, and most of my questions were answered by the end of the book.  The descriptions were detailed and helped me paint a picture in my mind. This book isn't just a good read, it really makes you think about society and the definitions of pretty vs ugly. I'm not gonna lie. If I lived in this world and had the option to have this surgery, I would have it in a heartbeat...even if it meant sacrificing a few things..<br /><br /> WHICH IT DOES. Pretty does NOT come free people. There's something about the Pretties that's a bit....off. They're too happy, too agreeable...too...something. WHY?<br /><br /> Fortunately for me I connected with the story. It made up for the lack of connection I had with any of the characters.  The main character is Tally, her best friend Peris has just become Pretty and she's feeling pretty alone. She's the last of her friends to have her birthday. She can't wait to rid herself of her squinty eyes and frizzy hair and go live with all the beautiful people. Then she meets Shay. Shay has the same birthday as Tally, but her thoughts on becoming Pretty are quite unorthodox. Shay doesn't think there's anything wrong with how she, or anyone else looks, and plans to run away to The Smoke. A place where other uglies have run to avoid the surgery. Basically there's betrayal, a boy, enlightening information, and more betrayal.  I am not going to go into the details because you just have to read it for yourself.<br /><br /> Why didn't I connect with the characters? Tally did not have a unique voice. She wasn't anything special. I don't feel like I know who she is. I can't picture her in my mind. The romance in this book was sudden and unrealistic and felt cold. It didn't warm my heart and I felt it took away from the story.<br /><br /> Usually if I don't connect with at least one character, well, that's all she wrote folks. I'm done. But this story was just sooo good and unexpected I couldn't stop reading. I'm hoping that in the next books the characters will be flushed out more and I will develop that connection I'm still looking for. AND I can't wait to read more about this world.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Uglies showed me a unique world that kept my interest until the very end. 4/5sn't think there's anything wrong with how she, or anyone else looks, and plans to run away to The Smoke. A place where other uglies have run to avoid the surgery. Basically there's betrayal, a boy, enlightening information, and more betrayal.  I am not going to go into the details because you just have to read it for yourself.<br /><br /> Why didn't I connect with the characters? Tally did not have a unique voice. She wasn't anything special. I don't feel like I know who she is. I can't picture her in my mind. The romance in this book was sudden and unrealistic and felt cold. It didn't warm my heart and I felt it took away from the story.<br /><br /> Usually if I don't connect with at least one character, well, that's all she wrote folks. I'm done. But this story was just sooo good and unexpected I couldn't stop reading. I'm hoping that in the next books the characters will be flushed out more and I will develop that connection I'm still looking for. AND I can't wait to read more about this world.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Uglies showed me a unique world that kept my interest until the very end. 4/5

B0087EVHVW|5.0|Fantastic processor. Best of what you can get for your money. My PC is now very snappy, and refuses to freeze on any program. Windows open in milliseconds, and games load at least 30% faster. I purchased the CPU because I realized I was bottle-necking my PC with my GPU being more powerful than the CPU, making my PC slower than it should have been. After, I got it, I immediately installed it and was surprisingly pleased. This CPU is currently running at 3.78GHz stable with a corsair H60 Water cooler.

B00471JSR4|3.0|G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Bowling for Movies Score: 165.938 of 300  (What's this bowling score business... check out the last paragraph or read my earlier reviews)<br /><br />Ok movie fans, let me start this one by telling your that I reviewed Snow White and the Huntsman a couple of days ago and the Amazon-Spam-Finding-Bot (pronounced amazon-spam-finding-bought in the US and amazon-spam-finding-butt in Canada) bounced it back to me as REJECTED because I assume my reviews have to this time all been made from the same template and a robot(robutt) apparently isn't into quasi/pseudo-scientific movie reviews, so I guess I have to mix them all up.  I haven't felt that blue over a rejection since my sophomore year in high school when I walked up to the gal who lived two doors down from my house's locker and said, \\"Hey - me, you, my car... what do you say?\\" only in a moment of adolescent panic it sounded more like, \\"So, have you read any good books lately?\\" (to which the answer was no).  Any way around it, I guess I will just have to be more creative in the future (or amazon spam robutts will have to get more intelligent and then they have the real chance of taking over the world and wage war on humankind (no more boxes in the mail with smiles on them).  What does this have to do with G.I. Joe you might ask - um, nothing.<br /><br />Movie in the Quick:<br />Beefy military dude with a boo-boo under his eye (convenient reminder of a bad day) and his too intelligent to tell such bad jokes side-kid get their butts kicked by super villains but it's all ok because it gets them in a super elite multi-national fighting force - G.I. Joes.  Pretty standard 3 parts action 1 part bad joke ensues until SUPRIZE twist (which I won't tell you) which actually surprised me (which I will tell you, it did, it did) and a mediocre movie gets suddenly way better right towards the end.<br /><br />Overall:<br />This movie did pretty good (not great, not bad) at the box office and critics did what critics will do (mainly not like good movies, and praise bad ones).  By-in-large the first 2/3 of this movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  Loads of action.  Action all over the place.  The CGI is what you'd expect for a movie which ran $175m aaaand the story wasn't half bad.  I personally enjoyed the backstories of most the main characters.  Hey now, if you're a `true blue' G.I. Joe fan I get it... really I get it - they tweaked with the mythos, they twisted the storylines, the twanged on the universe - but (fortunately) I really wasn't all that into G.I. Joe as a youngster and wouldn't have known if y'all didn't make such a fuss.  It does give one pause that people come out of the woodwork to complain about things such as that and then pay out the nose to see what the latest Batman reboot has done (Batman Reboot 17 - this time he's 33% more dark than before).  So, I digress :]  The story was fine, I liked the visuals, I didn't mind the actors... (what's wrong movie dude, why such a middle of the road score?)  Well, I'll tell you - the acting is bad.  No, let me clear that up and make it a paragraph all its own:<br /><br />The acting is really very very bad... Buffy The Vampire Slayer bad... Gilligan's Island bad... and it's across the board (not just Dennis Quaid this time)<br /><br />So I have to ask the question, how could it be that Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (to name a few) delivered such a plastic action figure like performance?  Channing isn't a favorite but I've seen him do better - Marlon's portrayal of Ripcord was nearly offensive as the funny sidekick (I kept waiting for him to say \\"Now that's Whack!), and Adewale is downright TERRIFYING in Strike Back... these aren't bad actors... what happen?  I can only assume it's how the director, Stephen Sommers wanted it.  You'd think in this day and age somebody would have told him (hey, spt... ya, Stephen... duuuude, I watched the daily and um, it's kind of bad - like Buffythe Vampire Slayer bad...).  I guess the jokes on me though, he laughed all the way to the bank - and there is hope that Jon Chu will do a better job in the much anticipated sequel... well much anticipated here because it's supposed to show up next week in 3D (check back for a bowling score for it!)<br /><br />The good:<br />Great pace and full of action - my glutes got an excellent work out - although there may be some post-movie clenching/cramping<br />Out of no-where (but it should have been obvious) twist 2/3 of the way thru... good golly I did a Scooby Doo double take (and then got a Scooby Snack for my efforts).<br /><br />The bad:<br />The acting... cardboard is more enthusiastic<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />Anything Ripcord said that was supposed to be funny<br /><br />The Movie Bowling Scoring System:<br />Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]  I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.<br /><br />Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.the Vampire Slayer bad...).

I recommend it!<br />The only thing I had a problem with was the last round. The last object to find, the clue was ridiculous. I mean 3 number slots but no 3 numbers to be found. I ended up just clicking randomly until I got it.

Just a fantastic collection of excellently performed and mixed live music from a guy who will someday go down as a legend.

B003VIWO8Y|4.0|In Megadeth, Dave Mustaine created one of America's most successful metal bands of all time. Anyone else would consider him a success. But Dave will always compare his work to that of Metallica, the band he got kicked out of in 1982 just before they got big. And because Metallica got a little bigger than Megadeth, part of Dave will always consider himself a failure.<br /><br />To his credit, Dave's memoir doesn't come off as whiny, petty, or privileged. He's pretty honest about his abilities and his obstacles - and he had to overcome a lot of them, even though many were self-imposed. And he's eager to assign blame where blame is due, be it to himself or others.<br /><br />I think this book is better suited toward people, like myself, who are not die-hard metal fans. It gives us a glimpse into the life of a metal band, the ordeals of being on the road, the temptations and excesses, the struggle to make it big, then the struggle to make it BIGGER than your rival bands, and the ever changing lineup that comes with so many volatile personalities. It's much like a book version of a VH1 \\"Behind the Music\\" special.

B009GI8J1O|4.0|Cloud Atlas is an anthology of several stories, each of which is read or viewed by a character in the next chronological story. It's also strongly suggested that some characters across stories are different reincarnations of the same person. (The movie version probably makes this more obvious by casting the same actors in multiple roles across stories.)<br /><br />The stories themselves are a bit of a mixed bag. A few are difficult to read because of their literary style and voice, including the first story, a diary from around 1850 with lots of antiquated spelling and shorthand. You may be tempted to bail, but stick with it. Each story, I think, is better than the last, and makes you consider the previous story in an entirely new light. Overall themes and takeaways are largely up to personal interpretation. The author doesn't hit you over the head with a message.

0062255657|4.0|As a huge Gaiman fan, I love reading his work and eagerly look forward to the next.  This book is good, but lacking the same attention to detail and character development as Neverwhere, Anansi Boys, Good Omens or the Graveyard Book. The dark humor is short, sometimes too short and the overall sense of mystical fun I get as I read his other works is not altogether here.  Good book, but I highly suggest any of his other works before this one.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|A deep and complex thriller this one and at 700 pages not a quick read either.  Old fashioned in a way that comparison with Day of the Jackal are easy to make but this is written with intelligence and detail.<br /><br />It's a number of things, at a top level it is about tracking down a terrorist for a spectacular, it also has a murder mystery that is quite pivotal and strong characterisations to support different viewpoints.<br /><br />An intelligence operative (Pilgrim) tracks down a terrorist and their back stories unravel as we move through the plot along with what motivates them.  The terrorist plot is somewhat scary in its premise, I only hope that much of the description was fiction because if not, we are in trouble.<br /><br />Although slightly uneven in terms of pace this felt like a proper and intelligent thriller and is recommended for those who want more than basic shoot-outs and non-stop action.

B00275EHJG|4.0|This review is for the Single Disc DVDs content, not the plot of movie (which gets a gajillion stars from me)<br /><br />Disney has been frustrating me of late with it's recently reissued DVDs and newer releases, releasing the (overpriced) Blu-ray combo packs and Diamond editions first and single disc DVDs a month later. I usually wait for the DVD since I don't have a Blu-ray player and have no need for two versions of the same movie. Sadly, Disney no longer releases two disc versions on DVD only and the single disc DVDs seem to be very bare bones (like Wreck It Ralph).  This was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The disc itself has artwork on it, unlike the more recent releases that have a plain gray disc with the title stamped on it. This has a nice colorful feel to it. It also has a decent amount of special features, including some behind the scenes interviews with the cast and crew.  I still wish I could buy a two disc DVD version like I did with Toy Story 1 and 2, which had LOADS of extras, but I'll settle for this one. I'm satisfied with this.  If you're a Pixar or Toy Story lover who likes special features but doesn't need an entire disc of them, then this is the right choice. It had just the right amount of extras to make me happy and not feel like I'm completely missing out on the experience by not having a Blu-ray.<br /><br />If you purchase it new, it comes with the Disney Rewards code for 100 points too!

B00A83075M|3.0|This review is for the content of the single disc DVD and not the plot of the movie (which is awesome).<br /><br />Disney seems to not care about consumers who want only the DVD and don't have Blu-Ray players or wish to avoid overpaying for combo packs or diamond editions. They also release single DVDs about a month after Blu-Ray to trick you into paying more.  In years past, Disney issued two disc dvds with loads of extras and wonderful artwork on the actual discs. Now you just get a bare bones, generic gray disc with the title in unimpressive font. As a lover of physical discs, it's quite disappointing that this seems to be a generic throw away disc.<br /><br />There is not a single extra on this DVD.  It contains the movie and the animated short \\"Paper Man\\" but not one single solitary behind the scenes look.  The movie itself is awesome but you are robbed of the pleasure of seeing behind the scenes interviews with the creators or ant interesting presentations of them unless you want to pay double for a combo pack (Blu Ray DVD and Digital copy), which is three versions of the same movie.<br /><br />This is the most disappointing new release DVD from Disney yet.  I dislike being fed DVD scraps because I don't want to overpay for a combo pack.  Give us SOMETHING Disney!<br /><br />You do get your Disney Magic Code if you buy it new, but you only get 100 pts.

B0042RJWTM|5.0|A huge and surprisingly expensive box-office flop in 1970 and largely forgotten ever since, cinematographer William A. Fraker's adaptation of Jack Schaeffer's Monte Walsh is a strikingly affecting elegy not just for the cowboy way of life but the Western itself, both endangered species nearing the end of their time. The Western genre had been in decline since TV oversaturated the market in the 50s and, after a brief glorious last stand in the late Sixties that sawThe Wild Bunch, True Grit, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Once Upon a Time in the West, was headed towards the last roundup as the herd would be continually thinned in the 70s, which is very much in tune with the Shane novelist's melancholy mood piece.<br /><br />Monte Walsh and Chet Rollins (Lee Marvin and Jack Palance) are cowboys in a shrinking world where the range is closing, corporations are buying up all the ranches and shutting them down, once prosperous cattle towns are turning into ghost towns, jobs are scarce and nobody needs cowboys anymore. Some commit suicide, others turn to crime as hard times turn good men bad, things go wrong for no good reason and nothing is gained but another day. Chet settles down with a hardware store widow (Calamity Jane's Allyn Ann McLerie) but Monte, despite notions of settling down with Jeanne Moreau's past her prime whore, just tries to ignore the bad times and hold on to the belief that the good times will come back if he just waits long enough. He knows that's just not true but tries to avoid facing the facts for as long as he can with an almost heroic stubbornness born of pride in a way of life no-one values any more in a world where soon the only cowboys left will be pretend ones in show business. Walsh's pride won't let him go down that route even when made a lucrative offer because \\"I ain't gonna spit on my whole life.\\" But life doesn't have too many qualms about spitting on him and his kind...<br /><br />It's an achingly sad film about loss and outliving your time, and even genre staples like facing down rustlers and a final gunfight are touched with melancholy and understated emotional pain. There's a feeling throughout the film that all these western staples - rounding up the herd, the obligatory barroom brawl, the blockhouse joking, the bronco busting - are being done for the last time, not just in the story but in the genre itself. It's a quietly sad farewell to the nameless men who helped build a country that no longer needs them and has already forgotten them, and it's that melancholy tone that probably helped kill it at the box-office but it's what makes it hold up so very well today. It's beautifully acted too, with Marvin a beautifully restrained centre to a film he dominates without ever overshadowing the supporting players, including familiar faces like Matt Clark, Jim Davis, Bo Hopkins, Michael Conrad, Richard Farnsworth and an impressive Mitchell Ryan, while a gentle and softly spoken Jack Palance damn near steals the film: his porch scene shows that when he dialled it down he could be one of America's very best actors (the scene isn't best served by the editing, though a deleted section of it does appear in the film's trailer on the DVD).<br /><br />A one-time Robert Aldrich project, Fraker probably ended up with the job of director because he had survived the nightmarish shoot of Paint Your Wagon with the often difficult Marvin the previous year and had previously been a camera operator on The Professionals with the star, so there was clearly a working relationship on what turned out to be a much more lavish and complicated production than it appears. Marvin was paid a then huge $1m while you could still make a movie for what the scene where he demolishes half a town busting one particularly ornery bronco cost back in 1970. Shipping the right kind of livestock across the country and building a town for the film only added to the budget, and the distinctly mixed reviews, which tended more to the negative than the middling, didn't help the film make much of that money back. Sadly, Fraker's directorial career never really recovered from the film's box-office failure: his only other Western was the weak The Legend of the Lone Ranger and his last directing credit was an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. It's a shame, because in another time it's the kind of movie that could have found more favour with critics and audiences alike and it's hard not to feel that its failure cheated us out of more great movies from Fraker the director, who would return to cinematography for most of his subsequent work.<br /><br />John Barry provides a particularly fine score with a hauntingly ironic title song, The Good Times Are Comin', sung by Mama Cass (the soundtrack CD wouldn't be released until three decades after the film came out and then only as a limited edition), while the production design and David M. Walsh's cinematography give it a look at once both authentic and romantic - at times the characters could have stepped right out of a Frederic Remington painting. Thankfully Paramount's Region 1 DVD release preserves the film's original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio in a fine transfer, though it's a shame that the only extra is the aforementioned trailer.

B006LSZECO|5.0|First, I would like to let the person who is reading this review know I'm not a &#34;reader&#34; or a book worm,<br /> Secondly I would like to lie to you and tell you not to read this book, especially if you're the thrill seeking, page turning kind of type.<br /><br />Gone Girl is easily one of the best books I've read in recent memory... whether its my real memory... or my made up one ;)<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting and well directed.  We enjoyed the suspense.  We liked the fact it was based on a true story about a significant event in US history.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This is a very strange movie, but kinda of fun.  It made the plane trip seem a lot shorter.  It is not going to stimulate any intellectual conversation but keeps your attention.
1401201911|4.0|I really didn't care for the ending. I thought it was ill-conceived, unnecessary and it stretched the suspension of my disbelief to the point of breaking.<br /><br />Having said that, the rest of the story attained to such heights of awesomeness as to more than compensate for the last few pages.<br /><br />Not only does the story explore what would happen if Superman landed twelve hours earlier or later than he did and end up being raised a Soviet Russian, it explores other, more familiar Superman themes, such as the dangers and responsibilities of ultimate power, in a way other Superman stories could not.<br /><br />It also features awesome alternate versions of some of my favourite DC heroes.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A book about the afterlife is very intriguing .  I read other books about the same subject and have enjoyed all of them.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a typical Disney movie--and its not!!  You have evil, a beautiful princess, a dashing hero (is he??) and some great animal friends (Maximus the horse is AWESOME, as is Pascal, the chameleon).  Beautiful scenery, awesome music, some scary guys, and a frying pan . . .what more could you ask for????<br /><br />This is a GREAT movie for Disney and non-Disney fans.  We have watched it over and over.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy set up.  Gets concerningly hot very quick. I'm using the mains power source.<br />Used with Netlix and YouTube from ipad and iPhone.  Not found a web browser that works yet or other video.  Expect other will add features in days ahead. Hope HBO GO is on quick.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Movie is very well done; both by the director and Daniel Day Lewis is amazing.  He becomes these people in film and I find myself looking for the actor.  The historical aspect is excellent.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Although I found that I cannot agree with many of the conclusions Aslan reaches and was, at times, a little bit frustrated with his conclusory statements, he has written a book that strips away much of the mysticism and still found what must be seen as the most challenging and thought provoking character in history.  At it's heart though, it challenges the current, simplistic view of Christianity that is propounded by too many Americans.  Simply put, Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ would be rejected and denounced by those who seem to use his name the most - a hypocrisy that this book puts in a stark light.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|One of the best initial best selling points for the Chromecast was the 3 months of Netflix.  I ordered mine the very first day July 24, the Netfix promo was clearly being offered.  In fact it wasn't until 13 or more hours later (the next day) that Amazon decided to retroactively cancel the promo for those that ordered after 5:31pm, which meant the promotion lasted all of about 4 hours.<br /><br />I've written Amazon, and their usual good customer service is not coming through, they continue to say that orders only in the first 4 hours or so (before 5:31pm) will get the Netflix promo.  (A four hour promo??)<br /><br />Interestingly, if I had ordered from Google, I would not have this problem, Google is giving buyers a full 20 hours longer than Amazon is to receive the Netflix promo.<br /><br />EDIT:  Amazon changed their minds.  Six days after Chromecast release, they added 24 hours to the order time (now 5:30 pm on July 25)in order to get the Netflix promo. This more closely matches Amazon's advertising of the promo on Amazon's website, on both the first and second day of the Chromecast release.
1781162646|5.0|This is an amazing story with a surprise ending. He was speaking of retiring a few years back, but I am so very happy he didn't. His characters are usually very well fleshed out and the suspense is great, but this guy is a master at what he does, writing great stories where you actually care about the main characters. I'll leave it at that. You're going to love this book.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|A couple of the covers are done very well, a couple are excellent. It is just good rhythm and blues music, what you would expect from Tedeschi and Trucks.
B000V4NX04|5.0|Good film in every respect. Centered around surveillance of artistic community in 1980's East German Federal Democratic Republic (FDR) Statsi state.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Love it Love it Love it! I have a  great time playing. It is like It's challenging but not.  I would rate this five Definately.(which is why I did).
B0032W2QUU|1.0|I can't believe I use to watch this.  For it's era it was great and these are great, but I guess I've outgrown looking at oldies Syfys.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Insidious is brilliant. I have watched numerous horror films and I have to say that it is the best and scariest horror film I have ever seen. It is truly a classic. As a young adult, I guess I do not get scared anymore when watching horror films, but it wasn't until I saw Insidious that I had nightmares and kept pondering about it.<br /><br />The things that make this film sincerely scary are the cinematography, sound effects, and storyline. The suspense was killing me throughout the entire film and the twists were unexpected. The story is pretty sad too. Many horror films now-a-days have too much CGI, soft porn, and are just plain predictable, but this one had none of that. Insidious focuses heavily on the \\"what ifs\\" of a subject that really does exists and there are scenes where I was thinking \\"What is that?\\" All films now-a-days are not very original, but this one stands out from many horror movies.<br /><br />I am in the minority when it comes to thinking that The Exorcist, known as the scariest film in Hollywood, was not scary at all. I found it quite boring. It was disturbing and the acting was excellent, but I was not scared one bit.<br /><br />It is funny because the trailer does not do Insidious justice. It is enough to interest one in watching the film, but I did not expect it to be this scary and I believe the trailer was meant to do that. It is unfortunate when a trailer is better than the actual film or has basically shown all of what happens in the movie.
140006922X|5.0|If people were only allowed to write about religions they were a part of, the field if religious studies would not exist. How many Christian scholars, after all, have written books on Islam and other religions?<br /><br />But faux controversy aside, Aslan has written an interesting, well-researched, and entertainingly written book. While there's nothing in here that's actually that radical and this is certainly not a work intended for other academics, it is an excellent read for laypeople of all faiths.
0312360266|1.0|Basically, I love vampire books, and since I myself am from Oklahoma, I decided to read this...    1st of all, all of the characters piss me off. Every single one of them. They are so immature, and stuck up, and just... Stupid. Zoey is a stuck up bitch who thinks her s*** smells like roses, Stevie Rae is a steriotypical (spell check?) Hick, the \\"twins\\" are so shallow its unreal, and Damian... For someone who is suppose to be smart, there sure are a lot of mistakes he makes with his oh so amazing vocabulary... They are horrible.    2nd, they don't even sound like teenagers!!! Wasn't Kristin suppose to help with that!? I felt like I was reading about elementary students!!!    3rd, am I the only one wondering why they even bothered calling them \\"vampires\\"??? They really are more like witches...    Basically... I just don't recommend these books at all
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|EASY to complex puzzless, great as an escape to beat the heat or rain. Great graphics.<br />Not so challenging that you get frustrated.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is one that will take me some time to finish. I feel like I'm making progress, but I'm no where near ready to move out of my current level. It's been a long time since I've had a game push me like this. It's great!
B00AKO93JK|3.0|generally okay.  Nothing special but has given men more ideas and will help me to focus on specific exercises and workouts.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love the way he intertwines religious history, science and action with that perfect element of imagination; just love this series!
B0068LYEHA|1.0|The reading sample doesn't expose the incredible and gratuitous use of every vulgar term available in both British and American English for male and female body parts.  It certainly shows that the author is &#34;edgy.&#34;  On the rare occasions that I found insightful comments about feminism in the book, I felt heartened that Moran did indeed have something worthwhile to say.  But frankly, her method of delivering the message completely undermined it.  I am sixty years old and likely not her intended audience.  Nevertheless, a thinking woman of any age would wonder at her need to throw at us the words we least welcome in an effort to flaunt her personal militant feminism.  I am a feminist and I found the book repugnant.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how the minions in the game have their own personality. It really adds to the game.<br />This is basically a temple run type game, but so much better because it's with Minions! There are challenges to complete and weekly competitions. You can also challenge friends to things as well!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|in love with this game and it helps.me. learn about horses even more and shows me the responsibility innoeninh one
B00AREIAI8|4.0|unlike the app it keeps me something to do when I am bord. my fried and I play it together its realty fun.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I am so happy to have this DVD Being a Christmas Addict I now have another to add to my collection,<br />It was in great shape and came very quickly. Great Seller
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Novel of standard Gaiman quality. That is - well written with great imagination, great monsters and urban fantasy elements. But quality lies in tender contemplation about childhood and adulthood. About &#34;real&#34; family. Not writer's best but  recommend it.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie is very funny. Not only does Maggie Smith do a great job, so does the rest of the cast too!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A wonderful, rich reframing of the world.  Cain brings acceptance and normalization to the third of us who don't enjoy loud in all it's myriad forms. Dense and thoughtful, a contemplative read not meant to gulp down but to savor.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this book! Just thought it was another twist on a fairytale. I was so pleasantly surprised by the originality of the story. I could not put it down.  LOVE it!! Meet cyborg Cinderella!  You have Prince charming, evil stepmother and stepsisters. An evil queen too but what a twist and fantastic new setting. A must read.
0385349947|1.0|Horrible book, but brilliant marketing idea spoon feeding a ridiculous manifesto to women looking for a way to be CEO. Sandberg will make even more money, yay! Some say you need not read this book, you need only to be entitled. My problem with the book is that there is nothing new here. Sandberg's pedigree is what lends her legitimacy to be in a position to \\"give advice\\". I have been in corporate America for 20 years and I know total crap when I read it. I know what it's like to work for women like Sandberg. All empowering and team player in speech; barracuda in practice. Lean In? Go Away.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|After 5 minutes into this movie I stopped watching it. My wife watched it all the way to the end, but thought it wasn't that good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super super fun!<br />if you like the minons you will love this game! like a lot for real. no foolin
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean thanks for the great book. It is truly intriguing. I was amazed by this mans accomplishments. You tied everything together and made me want to let inner genius out. Thanks again.
B00CZAYLS0|4.0|I pre-ordered this on vinyl. Its great. Electric is far from my favorite Cult album, but its good and the Peace portion is pretty great. I highly recommend this to any Cult fan.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars and not 5 as there was no download card in it. I LOVE vinyl, but you know, my iPhone doesnt play vinyl and it'd be nice to have the files on my phone so I can enjoy while driving/working. I was admittedly bummed by this. Choice of Weapon had one....... Secondly, and in far lower regard, I would have liked to see any photos or notes about the Peace sessions or history or backstory about the process and the decisions to scrap everything done with Steve Brown. Not a huge deal but it would have been nice to have an Ian Asbury recount of the things going on and such.<br /><br />I highly recommend this. Just know theres no download card and Amazon doesnt offer a download for it (I don't think one is available anywhere - even iTunes).
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What the heck have you done. This used to be one of the best weather apps now with the new update it is crap. Way to go. I hope someone gets fired over this.
B004HD61KE|3.0|A little more boring than his other books.  It wasn't as fast paced as his other books, but Rollins still remains one of my favorite writers.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Absolutely awesome lead in to the meat and potatoes RVN flick for those of us who weren't actually there.  Great entertainment.
B009AMAK54|5.0|I love baseball, so the subject matter of this movie is right in my wheel-house.  The acting was very good.  The  quality was great.
B000HKYN74|5.0|This was well developed series but have to be a bit of star trek fan.  It would have been good to see the series continue.
006178480X|1.0|I have enjoyed James's books in the past but now the stories seem to get more and more unrealistic. I even bought this one in advance in America and had it posted before the British release the sad thing is I only read about forty pages or so and unfortunately I gave up. I much prefer his writing under the name of James Rollins - The Banned and the Banished series is one of my favourite book collections though of course a completely different genre. Those fans of sigma will no doubt love it but this one was not for me.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|&#34;The Magic&#34; is written in natural language, not in esoteric style, creating a path that feels easy and effortless. The summaries and assignments at the end of each chapter bring the particular lesson together and gently encourage action to practice. It's a book that is a pleasure to read and to follow.<br /><br />Practicing the daily exercises completely shifted my outlook on life and the energy I emit as I walk through each day. Even if I catch myself in a ripple of my old way of thinking, I refer to my practices from &#34;The Magic&#34; and move into that space of positiveness and light.<br /><br />I  would suggest this book to anyone who wants to shift their old patterns of thought and relating to fresh, positive ways of being.
0399226907|5.0|This is such a great book, and I love having it in board book form for my daughter, who is not yet very gentle with books.  She loves the holes on the pages....stays mesmerized with those for quite awhile!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Tough topics, great lyrics, catchy tunes. There really isn't more to say except they're independent and that's worth the money.
0307887960|3.0|My mom and I both tried this Diet. I did ok. I did loose weight. My mom on the other hand lost weight initially but then quick began to have stomach pains during the 1st phase. Everyone's body is different. Some can process the heavy load of protein of the beginning phase and other's can't. This isn't at all a knock against the product. I'm sure it works wonders for others. It just didn't work well for my mom so I was a little apprehensive about continuing it.
0380729407|5.0|Flowery language but I liked that for a change . Sort of dark and scary, interesting characters.I ordered the movie and am looking forward to seeing it.
630463949X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite concert DVD's (and I have a bunch of concerts on DVD!). Everyone in the band is playing and singing at a very high level. There is some obvious old tension between Stevie and Lindsey while they're singing together, which in my opinion makes the songs that much stronger...nothing fabricated just pure emotion.  Lindsey's acoustic versions of Big Love and Go Insane are worth the price of the DVD alone!! Buy this...you will love it!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|What if you could know why someone killed themselves. Not only why but your contribution to it? That's the premise of the story.<br /><br />I think it was a great book due to the fact that it shows that you affect others, either by your actions or inactions. I really believe that it's a story for any age appropriate young adult. It's a great example to show that actions have affects. And it all matters.<br /><br />I also think that it's a good book for parents and age appropriate kids to read since a ton of discussions could come from it. What would you do? How would something like this affect you? etc.<br /><br />I bought it on a whim and I'm glad I did. I keep thinking about it after I have read it. And, that's a change because normally I forget a book, even those enjoyed, about 1 day after reading it. But I recall details of this one.<br /><br />Act as if what you do matters, because it does.<br />b
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter thinks the horses are very pretty and it is a fun game to play.  She really likes taking care of her horse.  This keeps her occupied for quite a while and she never seems to get bored with it.  It's a keeper!
B004KBSQOW|4.0|I bought this because I heard Over the Rainbow on Aerial America. Love this version of that song. The rest are good too, but Rainbow is my favorite. What a voice.
B004U7JYXS|3.0|The picture shows a box of five film cartridges, but it really comes with two boxes of two and a single cartridge (not boxed). When mine arrived the single cartridge was cracked :( I contacted the seller and will update in the future. Yeah.. kinda bummed.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a beautiful love story...without being sappy. I thought it was going to be a cheesey love story because I bought it on special so cheap! Boy was I wrong.  It was great, I loved it!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary. It will make you think twice when you go grocery shopping. Truly lets you see the reality of the food industry.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had my kindle for quite a while now.  So convenient for reading on the go, and lighter than holding large books.
B000MR1V22|4.0|This movie was really funny. The quirky characters are great. Brilliant directing. I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|Our toddler really digs the characters Wall-E and Eve. Wall-E is cute and funny. We will just say Eve is the tough girl heroine who has a soft spot for Wall-E too. Cute, some action and cool robot characters. Good for young ones. Our 2 and a half year old request it often.
1451695195|4.0|Confirmed many of my beliefs.  Had more credibility coming from this autrhor. that is all I have to say about it.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I am typing this on my iPad, the first such attempt and I am discovering that most of my neurons are being engaged in the act of typing instead of reviewing the book. Lets just say that Krauss is worthy dish
B002MGGM9I|4.0|Do you like creepy movies? Do you like 80's movies? If so, you will absolutely adore this movie. It is definitely something you will be thinking about for days because it isn't super straightforward plot-wise(you are going to have to be an intelligent audience member.. they don't spoon feed you) and thematically there is kind of a lot going on. However, Frank the rabbit is definitely worth all that thinking. SO recommend
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Eye-opening book about how far we've come, and how much farther we, women and men, need to go. Overall, a very positive and inspiring read.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Its so different, funny exciting to me is the best show in tv right now at least the most enjoyable
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The characters names are confusing at the beginning, but...once one gets them down and the two time periods clear in your mind...it is a good read. The plot was complex yet easy to follow the events that effected and/or clued one into the mystery of the plot.  Definitely would suggest it to a friend.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Only thing I do not like. Higher level harder to complete. Because you tun out of chips to fast<br /> But I love this game
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Wanted to see it before the sequel was released...loved it....and the sequel. Can't go wrong with such a star-studded combo.
0887431453|5.0|This book is great for my 4 year old daughter.  She loves all the colors and the variety of activities.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi picoult has a gift in making a reader question their own morals and belief. Her characters always face a choice and the answer is never as simple as black or white. The love between Chris and Emily was palatable as well as Emily's pain. The book was beautifully written.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I just love Joe ! There is nothing he has put out that I haven't liked ! I 'm really glad that I purchased this CD on Amazon , I received two CD's for the price of one , very impressed !  I got something for you !  I rather have a love !  Easy ! Fantastic CD!  It takes me back to I'm looking for a girl...Joe sings about love , he's a crooner... I just love to hear his voice... you go Joe!  Another awesome CD ! He definitely put in the work .
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This movie immediately plunges the viewer into a world filled with action and adventure, reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  With Spielberg at the helm and John Williams scoring the movie the parallels cannot be missed, even the signature punch sound is used.  This movie is the Indiana Jones movie fans deserve, so instead of angrily destroying another tv while watching the installment with aliens, no nazis, and worst of all Shia LeBouf, just put in this flick and enjoy a master at play with no limits of live action cinematography.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell has an inviting style of writing. It's as though he's chatting with the reader, alone, over coffee. His unpretentious,natural manner is the antithesis of his extraordinary observations and insights.  A great read .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is really cool and you should get it it really fun and cool to play so you haven't seen nothing yet it gets better
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The story is really many stories; all are about interesting characters but there are too many people and life-story threads to follow. The result is a sense that some characters are left too superficial, things are a bit confusing, and the loose ends don't really ever wrap together that well. I read through the whole thing but was left a little disappointed or unsatisfied.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Loved this movie it showed just how cruel people can be but was also hilarious revenge. If you need a good laugh watch this
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|It starts as what would seem a very typical day of a corporate executive as he leaves his family and enters his limousine. As our protagonist (Denis Lavant) hears the list of the day's appointments, for which he must dress for each, you enter a surreal ride through various worlds of the grotesque, with mayhem and murder for companions. If you have the stamina for such things this is a truly fabulous adventure directed by Leos Carax with a wonderful twist.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie delivered on every aspect that I was hoping it would.<br /><br />1. Violent action packed sequences that spare no bloody detail. CHECK<br />2. A dystopian city fallen into ruin. CHECK<br />3. A Dredd who feels menacing, ruthless, and absolutely just. CHECK<br />4. Oddly, the best use of 3D in a movie I've seen to date. CHECK<br /><br />Worth your money and time.
0061122416|3.0|I bought this because of the celebrities that have said it made them more positive. I am into the whole mind over matter ideas. I read about half and it was just too slow and the lessons were not all that enlightening to have been drawn out in a simplistic story. But i am into and have been exposed to deep thinkers and reads by OSHO, and eastern philosophers which are more intellectual reads . This would probably be good for kids or someone just scratching the surface of these topics.  Was easy to resale on ebay!!  so was not a complete loss
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Even has Joni Mitchell and Patsy Cline in here!!!!!!!!! Luv it! And, as always, keep calm and keep ur kool!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a quick summer time read. It was heartbreaking and heart warming all at the same time. Would definitely recommend to the romantic s at heart.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I liked how the author kept you guessing about who &#34;did it&#34; even when you thought you knew!  Great book!
B0087IT8FK|1.0|The movie comes in French and you have to read the subtitles.  Otherwise I probably would have enjoyed the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and so does my little sister. It is fun an innovative. I have recommended it to several friends and they to find it very addictive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome awesome game me and my friends play It all if the time I recamed this for people that love games
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was anxiously awaiting this thing. It was supposed to be easy to set up, and it should have been. But for some reason, it would NOT connect to my wireless network. I spend 24 minutes on the phone with Google and they were no help at all. So I tried a few more times resetting the Chromecast, resetting my router, laptop, etc. and then it just decided to work. It connected like it was supposed to. I didn't change any settings... nada. Just worked. Netflix worked okay, but the resolution was lacking. I went to my favorite tv streaming site, project-free tv and the cast/stream quality was totally unwatchable. This was the main reason I bought it. I thought there'd be no more long HDMI cable connected from my laptop to my TV. But I was wrong. I *really* wanted this to work. I've tried everything, and while the audio is good the video is so jumpy, you just can't watch it. Sadly, sadly disappointed.<br /><br />*edit added 7/28/13* And furthermore, the Chromecast App for my Droid Bionic can't find the Chromecast on the network when my laptop has no issue finding it.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This is my favorite go-to movie when I'm feeling down.  Excellent actors and storyline.  I recommend it.  Even my 87 year old Uncle enjoyed it!
B001O1O71C|1.0|I give this four stars.I would recommend this to my family.I love how Bruno was always telling the truth.I would love
B005N1E84K|5.0|The greatest show on stage I'd ever seen ! Kylie at her best !!! I just love her and everything she does is magic.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Do you like competent Watsons? How about a Holmes that cares about justice? Is character development your favorite part of your favorite shows? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Elementary is the show for you!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Never wanted it to end.  Hope there is more coming soon. Enjoyed reading every minute of it, Excellent narrative and storyline
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Absolutely! You guys were over the top! I couldn't have made it without your experts assistance. Thank you for your knowledgable guidance. Today my kindle fire is up and running well. You're the BEST!
B0095P31L6|3.0|Watched the whole thing but I have no desire to ever see it again. Even my 9 year old niece wasn't that impressed with it.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Becoming a little competitive and the show has run it's course, but still enjoyable. This was a good season and better than the last one.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey<br />I just finished my first playthrough last night, and it was truly on of the most beautiful experiences I've ever enjoyed, not just in video games but in any artistic medium. Trying to sum up Journey in a few words feels both easy and difficult. It is so simple yet so incredibly rich and stunning at almost every moment. The game design in particular is simple enough for anyone to pick up and thoroughly enjoy whether they have never played a video game or are a veteran, yet it never loses that element of wonder and rapture as it draws you further along in completing your journey. The graphics are phenomenal, and I do not mean in terms of realism but just raw artistic beauty. From the way the sands glimmer in the sun to the flow of your scarf and cape with the winds, you cannot help but get drawn in to the sprawling world laid before you.<br /><br />One of the best gameplay elements is integration with other lone wanderers along the path. With nothing more than a musical note to communicate, there is a wonderful bond that forms with a complete stranger in this beautiful yet connected world. This is the first time I've found myself waiting for a complete stranger to catch up, have someone help me across a difficult jump, and the first time I've found myself searching for my partner and them for me when we get separated. Whenever I needed help or they did, we immediately rushed to each others aid. This is the first time on any game where I have enjoyed forming this brief but powerful relationship, and it always felt natural. I knew that we didn't have to help each other, and we could have gone our separate ways but we didn't. My partner became the first playstation 3 player that I've added as a friend in years.<br /><br />What deserves particular note for helping this game truly connect with me was the soundtrack. It is truly on another level, and is well-deserving of the accolade in being the first video game soundtrack nominated for a Grammy award. I am listening to the soundtrack in fact as I write this review, and has a way of teasing out and evoking such strong emotions as you lay back and enjoy it. This is probably the second video game soundtrack I plan to purchase for myself - the first being that of Flower. Overall, I cannot recommend playing Journey enough, it is absolutely one you will never forget and certainly one you will recall very fondly in the years to come.<br /><br />Flower<br />The previous title by thatgamestudio before Journey, and it does not disappoint either. Flower tells the story of a flower petal as you help guide it along its way to connect with other petals in the land. I know that at face value it seems incredibly simple with no real story to tell, but there is so much more to it if you give it a chance. The gameplay is built around fully utilizing the six-axis aspect of the playstation 3 controller, and it is the first true implementation I've seen of that feature. It makes guiding your flower petal feel both natural yet engrossing, and without knowing it you'll find yourself being drawn further in as you try to keep building your trail of flower petals.<br /><br />I was trying to figure out what key element really brought Flower together, and that is the soundtrack. I first played Flower after a tough day at work when I was feeling frustrated, and within the first few minutes I could feel all of the tension melt away and felt like I was in a blissful state. The soundtrack goes a long way to help you transition to this state, and is exactly why I purchased the soundtrack for this game - the first time I have ever done so for a video game. I never expected a game about a flower petal could be this involving, but it was and it made me more optimistic about where video games can still yet go. That this work led to Journey is very evident, but Flower is a wonderful game in its own right that you should absolutely play and enjoy on its own merits aside from its relationship with Journey.<br/><br />Flow<br />Have yet to play Flow, so I won't comment on it until after I do.
1582701709|4.0|a fantastic book. Great practical advice that teaches that what you put into life you get out of it. If you expect life to hand you the world, then you are not ready to read this book.
B006LXQID8|4.0|Enjoyed the observations made of each character; their likes and dislikes. Amelie's characters is interesting and unlike the others. Gave it a twist.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|One of my favorites authors right now - have all of his books and they're all great. Even check out the movie, The Headhunters - awesome.
B0046UGSNS|5.0|This was such a good movie.  Different story line kept the movie interesting.  Great chemistry between the main characters and unexpected turns.  Good message about the power of family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so on my old kindle I had minecraft and I Loved it I totally recommend this game but now with my new kindle minecraft JUST WON'T DOWLOAD AND ITS MAKING  me mad
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Read a lot review and tried mine this weekend.<br /><br />First of all, it works. Of course at this stage, it only works on very limited apps, such as Netflix and Youtube. So far so good.<br /><br />My problem is the wireless setup. It connected to my main router, Linksys/Cisco, but doesn't work with my Amped Wireless Extender. I have a big house and my Linksys router signal is very weak for this Chromecast. everytime I try to connect to Amped wireless extender, screen shows: &#34;Chromecastxxxx connected to Amped_Wireless, but can't access the internet&#34;. But my computer, iphone work with this extender very will. I will try to find a way to solve this issue otherwise I have to return
B0076HNMU0|5.0|I missed the show when it first aired.  I enjoyed the first season immensely.  Great characters, interesting story lines intricately woven to make it a great who dunnit with almost a soap opera feel..and a hint that supernatural forces are also at play here....
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie started out pretty stressful.  We were hoping for something good to relax to at the end of the evening.  I wasn't sure I was going to continue watching after the first 10 min.  Not relaxing.  I'm glad I stuck with it.  It lightened up and sucked us in.  Ends up as a feel good movie with a positive message about living and loving with our own imperfections.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|These games sick..a game is fun unroll they make sure you spend to play.you can only buy a charecter with bannanas and you will never come close with coins..you cant earn enough and that's wrong.not only with this game bug this idea is greed..bad greed.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great cd, great quality fast shipping, this lady is very talented, love to listen to her music. thanks recommend this to others
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game has some great ideas. It's kinds like temple run but I like the way it adds stuff like the freeze ray just like the movie. It sometimes glitches on my kindle fire and makes me mess up. It also requires a lot of patience which I sometimes don't have.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This is a very good show with lots of interesting characters! I only Wish more shows like this would come out.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Badly written, trite and not even all that erotic.  I decided to read it just to se what all the fuss was about and can't even get through it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|great quality great music, these guys are very talented. Would definately recommend to any one. fast shipping at a great price, Thanks.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book was great. The third person was interesting and not boring; it really kept you focused. The book was good.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a very good show with lots of interesting characters! I only Wish more shows like this would come out.
1452115567|5.0|The intro to this book brought me to tears. It's a delightful read and fun to introduce this project to others.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Love it  great cd, great listening music, great quality, fast shipping would recommend this album to anyone, great price thanks
B003FFEX8C|5.0|The movie was even better watching it a second time with the technology of electronic equipment we have. Great movie!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|A bit gory in places, but I suppose that's necessary due to the subject matter.  Very well done. Can't wait for Season 2.
0061733199|4.0|The only problem is that some of the content is outdated and not updated. Overall an excellent read for anyone who wishes to learn about survival tactics in any situation you can think of.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|love the concept and ending, Tom Cruise always does thought provoking sci fi's. Not predictable or just another hero movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You can always count on a twisted twist accompanied by tragedy and topped with joy!<br />Never could have guessed the closing of this season...brilliant once again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After all the earlier botched attempts (Google TV, Nexus Q) in capturing the last frontier of the most ubiquitous, beloved!? and notorious household item.. Google has finally arrived... with the right device<br />- by providing the right price (impulse region)<br />- by providing cracker features<br />- and by making it a future proof (by not tying to the hardware like Roku/ Apple TV)<br /><br />Google has a winner here.. whatever the whiners say about app compatibility and usb power required not indicated etc etc.. for 35$ this IS the BEST streaming device on the market.  I can't explain how simple and liberating it is to just select any video on youtube and then watching it on TV.. its an amazing experience...<br /><br />Even with the limited app selection (youtube, netflix, google play) available currently, the options are still limitless..  youtube itself has tons of videos, not to mention quality of netflix...  that said, Google released an SDK for this.. and probably the android/iOS market is going to be flooded with compatible apps pretty soon..<br /><br />Also, if you don't have Google chrome browser (esp. beta version).. go ahead do yourself a favor and install it immediately.. install the 'Google cast' extension and you can share anything on your computer... not just tab, your entire computer screen.. there's an experimental feature called 'Cast entire screen (experimental)' option, (there's a small dropdown triangle on the right side)..<br /><br />all in all a best purchase..  future proof...
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I was introduced to this show and purchased it based upon a recommendation.  I'm glad I did.  This is truly an amazing adventure.  It is a bit like the Manchurian Candidate, but I think the acting is much better.  The show draws you in and captures your attention then an episode ends and you can't wait to watch another.  It gets all the stars.  I would warn you that it is not for kids.  There is nudity and adult language. You'll be asking yourself, &#34;What would Cary Do?&#34;
B00AKO93JK|2.0|This will work for someone who is a newbie to exercising, but if you're an experienced exerciser it's probably not worth your time.  Thankfully, I didn't pay for it since it was a free app of the day.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has you use your brain. It is truly fun, and keeps you focused and wanting more. I like the puzzles, I haven't played a game like this in a long time.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|What a great movie. Jamie Foxx was fantastic, its a long movie but its goes by fast. its also like a spaghetti western.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I downloaded it so I had a movie to watch on my kindle on the airplane, loved every minute of this action packed movie!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|&#34;Despicable Me&#34; is funny and cut for both kids and adults.  I can't stop laughing.  One of the best kid's movies for 2012 and 2013.
1594746036|5.0|I saw Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children at the store. I read the back of it and it sounded like a good read. I could havwas soe purchased it then but I knew I could get a better deal at amazon. I got a great price and made the purchase. I was so delighted when I recievied my purchase. Once again it was in excellent condition. Another GREAT purchase from amazon....and Ransom Riggs.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|You are only given a few plays, each level is a life. You go through them in 5 minutes. If looking to pass the time slowly this is not the game. Plus you have to be connected to the Internet.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  It has great actors, in this twisting yard turning psychological thriller.  It is a must see.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Great band! I enjoy their other two CDs, but this one is my favorite!  Can't wait for another album to come out.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The changes to this app are awful. I have enjoyed  using the weather channel for a long time and I have rolled with all of the changes. The new version sucks my battery power. It is confusing and choppy. The information has no flow. I am not sure I will even keep the app now even though it's free. I am actively looking at new weather apps to replace it. PLEASE fix it now!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  Great for all ages.  Can't wait for the next installment.  I hope DC can do something similar with the Justice League.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I considered the next model down, but for only a few bucks more I got two ports for charging, more cable/adapters, and of course, more power!<br /><br />I originally bought a cheap no-name brand battery and while it worked, it was wonky and had a weird proprietary charge cable.  My cheap-o-brand unit also randomly stopped charging my phone which was annoying.  I've heard that pretty much all of these types of batteries have a flaw and I'm not testing it on this great device, but never let the battery drain all the way down.  I've had other brands refuse to recharge when completely depleted.<br /><br />So far I'm extremely happy with my Anker and had a few friends that got the lower end ones and were happy and those units are smaller and a bit lighter.  I play a lot of Ingress (Android/Google/Niantic game) and this battery keeps my S4 fully charged while playing and I haven't had a single issue even playing for hours on end.  I don't know how many charges or hours this would last, but I would guess at least 4 full charges and at least 8 hours of use.  Maybe more.  The game is the most draining thing you can do on a phone.  Screen is on full the whole time with data in use and GPS.<br /><br />Great overall product and would purchase anything the company makes based not only on my experience, but others I know.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|So far this game is great. Intriguing, fun, spooky. You feel like a detective trying to figure out the clues. While doing that you play other little games that get you New clues. This is so different and free. Can't wait to see if I can get to figure out the ending. The graphics and sounds r great too. Kudos to the makers of this.
0307352153|2.0|First, let me preface this review by saying I consider myself an introvert.  This 200 some-odd page piece of garbage, however, takes a one sided stance an never bothers to present both sides of the story.  If I were an extrovert reading this book, I would be furious at the author.  Time and time again, Susan Cain repetitively tells us that introverts are better than extroverts in every way, shape, and form.  This complete one-sidedness is completely unfair and had me laughing half the time as I read this book.  Cain insists that introversion is better for all things in life, including politics, sports, working, ect. Not only that, but this book takes almost 300 boring, repetitive pages that could be summed up into a paragraph.  I'll give it a try:<br /><br />Introverts are better than extroverts.  People work better when their alone.  Introverts have better working brains.  Introverts are smart.<br /><br />There.  The entire book in 4 sentences.  You can thank me later for saving you from wasting $15 and all that time.  In this book, EVERY CHAPTER IS THE EXACT SAME, just with different situations and settings.  Do not recommend.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Game of thrones has everything! Drama, thriller, Politic strategics, Leadership lessons, unexpected turns in the story. Excellent! Even though it has Dragons, black magic, and sobrenatural situations, the story keep the realism of human relation in the seek of power.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. So very cute!! Thanks amazon for having it available picture and audio were great no difficulties
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is fun for all ages. my little siblings like it, my older cousins like, my aunt is obsessed with it. the thing I don't like about this kindle tablet edition is that it is a little &quot;glitchy&quot;. the character cant move from side to side as well as in other versions. please fix this problem
B004UID2LC|4.0|It is a good app but it can get annoying sometimes but it shouldn't bother you much the update did not do anything to me so I really recomend this app for you guys . It is awsome .
B0000696I0|5.0|My brother was trying to look for this movie n when i got it from him he was surprised that even though it wasnt packaged, the movie is in very gd condition.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Decent Movie with a cast of reliable characters...we rented it because we saw the previews for Reds2 :)<br />Not a bad Saturday night flick with some popcorn :)
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Now i can have my thoughts organized keeping them in ur head is hard  because its all jumbled up. I suggest this app to everyone.
B005J9ZDYK|3.0|The outside package was already damaged even though it was plastic wrapped.<br /><br />The DVDs seem to trail, skip, and freeze up quite often.<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game was a little boring at the beginning but, as I played it more often  it was one of the best games I have ever played:) .
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|There is a huge twist at the end (I wont spoil it) you just don't expect.  I loved it, great sci-fi movie!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I wish you had more keys so you could do something with because just three keys at the beginning is not enough
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a really good app, and I have it on all the time! It is great because it tells you what percentage of battery life you have left, instead of you having to guess how much you have left. I would recommend this if you constantly monitor your battery life, like me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. I wish the energy timer would go by faster. Overall I think this game works great to pass the time.I can take good care of my horsey
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Of course the books are better, but the directors have done a remarkable job and their &#34;vision&#34; honors Mr. Martin.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Kept me glued to the book from beginning to end. I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action/intrigue novels of this genre.
B00406TRU4|5.0|I remember watching this show for the first time, and I fell in love with it the moment I started watching it. It may be cheesy at times, but it is a very fun show to watch and I love everything about it! I would highly recommend this series to anyone!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Game is very fun to play! Plenty of New cards to unlock and enjoy. Hours of fun! Hope you enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't usually write a review unless I am compelled to by the product itself. And this is one of those devices!<br /><br />People don't realize it but this device is much more than &#34;another streaming option&#34;. I won't go into how this device plugs into HDMI, disappears from view, doesn't need a remote and is powered directly by the HDMI 1.4 port (or a USB port on the TV itself or a separate power adapter).<br /><br />The real beauty of this thing is it streams everything from the 'cloud', not from your device. You only use the phone, tablet or laptop to communicate with the dongle (which is on the same wifi) and tell it which youtube video or pandora song to pick from the cloud and then to pause, rewind and move forward (like a remote controller). And herein lies the true capability of this device. Suddenly, not only do I not need a separate TV box and remote, my streaming device is no longer a slave to the dongle (unlike Airplay). So, if I am watching a netflix movie and I get a call, my wife can use her phone to pause the movie. Any phone, tablet or laptop is a controller and a content streamer as long as it's on my wifi. And the handoff between devices is seamless and spans across Android, Chrome and iOS platforms. Imagine the possibilities when friends visit, parties are hosted, etc.<br /><br />It's this magic that people don't seem to realize is going to change the way we stream content forever. And of course, with the Googlecast SDK being made available to developers widely, I won't be surprised that everything from HBOGo to TED Talks to Hulu+ will integrate the 'Cast' button into their apps. Who needs a separate TV box and remote now?
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Actually this deserves a 3 and a half. Close to a 4. Amazing basic story concept and an author who is not afraid to take risks. Can't wait to read more of Hugh Howey's works. My son thinks it should be made into a movie and renamed Silo.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|I purchased this as the app of the day, and it is a great, yet different shooter game. It is very fast paced and no level progression. If you are defeated, you start back at level 1.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is extremely helpful. It contains step by step instructions on exactly what to do next. But I have two questions. Do these instructions go with Libre Office and Open Office? And are there any other programs you can write your manuscript on?
B0074VTHKM|5.0|very good suggested from my daugthers teacher as a 8th grader she also loved and we read a lot anyways
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Have watched this many times over the years and still brings back the my youth and dreams of that age.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is one of the most well-written tv shows to come along in a LONG time. The acting, especially by Jonny Lee Miller, is especially fantastic.  The chemistry between Miller and Lucy Liu, who plays Watson, is incredible.  The writers have sworn there will be no romance between the two and so far they've kept their promise.  I watch about five tv shows; This is my favorite by far and the only one I will not miss each week.  I've watched episodes several times.  While I enjoy the plots, the main reason I tune in each week is for the Holmes/Watson relationship and Miller and Liu's portrayals.  How Miller wasn't nominated for an Emmy is beyond me.<br /><br />I've read all the Sherlock Holmes books and I've seen all the different incarnations and this one, by far, is my favorite and, to me, rings truest to the Holmes character.  The show's handling of Holmes' drug use is especially well-written.  And Liu's Watson is not a shrinking violet; she takes no crap from Holmes and can hold her down - usually with a lot of sass thrown in.  This show will definitely give you moments of humor.<br /><br />This is one of the very few shows I will definitely buy on DVD when it comes out and I cannot wait for Season 2!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|First mind testing game I have played in a long while!! It has a great concept on making you work mentally while sitting and playing a 'videogame'
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I couldn't see how it would have a cup you could use to cook with until I received it. The Canteen is good sized has a good cover and the cup you use to cook with fits in the case snugly with the canteen inside the cup. The handles fold out for use and back in for storage. Very nice design.
B00422LESO|2.0|I really like Shannon Hale, so I was excited to read this book.  I really don't understand why it has such great reviews.  I thought it was pretty boring, and poorly written.  Not much happens plot-wise, and is terribly predictable.  The main character is hard to relate to, and keeps flip flopping between being really into Austenland and trying to stand outside it; I get that this is the main conflict of the book, but it feels a bit like she just has multiple personality disorder.
B005898DDO|5.0|Documentary footage, interspersed with Dylan's relaxed and retrospective interviews with Martin Scorsese, create a fascinating portrait of the evolution of a complex genius.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love this app, it runs smoothly, but I can never get into a multiplayer match it always says that there isn't any servers I don't know if this is needed for an update or if it is just because I'm on a Kindle Fire HD. And also it always signs me out. But other than that the game is great, but I hope the problems are resolved soon =)
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I absolutely love the characters and storyline in this book and others Rollins has written. It is so easy to step into his stories. Can't wait for the next book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was a slow start for me, but once I started watching, I could not stop. Great historical series with amazing twists and turns.
1444763512|5.0|I have purchased each volume as it has come out. Grandson is an avid reader at age 11, and can't wait for each &#34;next one&#34;!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The story sows great insight, but Jack's voice doesn't ring true. Enjoyed the story because it made me consider what it's like for someone who is truly 'other' to enter a completely new social environment,
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Good story. Poor editing. Many grammatical errors. Will not purchase others in series because errors interfere with my reading enj.oyment
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Ennio Morricone and Yo-Yo Ma go hand in glove.  I often go back to listen again.<br /><br />Morricone's music is a natural for the cello, and Yo-Yo Ma brings it all together.
1593082037|3.0|again it is a book only a book and nothing but a book you either like it or you don't
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome. I can't seem to stop playing. Graphics are clear, game is super responsive. I might like it more then my kid does. Good thing we each have our own fire.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|i luv it yea, always keep me wondering whats next i like hat i can see all the shows when i want
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A well-written story that keeps the reader guessing to the end. The vacation incident comes a little too quickly on the heels of the main story and I would have liked a bit more elaboration of the final event.
B000V6BE6M|3.0|Never listened to it. bought it for someone else. Like most CDs I think they are all grossly over priced
B000VMFDW2|5.0|One of the least known and worst places the United States sent the Marines and Army to fight in. A must read for anybody who wants to know what war in the Pacific was really like; told by a PFC who was on the front lines and latter in life became a college professor.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Tall, blonde, Scandinavian Harry. Complex and damaged but nevertheless a brilliant detective. A man after my own heart. Yes, I like damaged men, even fictional ones. It's my cross to bear. Anyway, back to the point...<br /><br />A good mystery with solid characters The Bat is a first rate mystery/thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Most of the time. It meandered in places, but for the most part the book kept my attention and left me guessing on who the killer was. Like The Leopard, I think the author could have cut a few pages and it still would have been a good read.<br /><br />* I received an arc from the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great app lots of fun and easy in the beginning. Fun for everyone.  Just need more pearls and more rare fish for fun.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I watched this movie with my grandson. We both enjoyed it. Its not that easy these days for me to find a movie I really like.
B007KWD7BK|5.0|It's a long ride.  I've got 52 minutes to listen to one of my favorite bands and this cd was worth every cent.  I love it.  It gets better and better every time I crank it up.  I saw Sleep for the first time at a Metal festival in May 2013 and am now hooked. It's a long trip across that desert...turn it on, Crank it up and enjoy the trip.
1936608898|5.0|I love the book and I love the diet.  Our whole family (of 3) is on it and although it's only been one week, we are eating like kings and have all lost 5 pounds each. There have been other benefits as well.  My 87 year old mother-in-law no longer has to take water pills, my skin has become clear and smooth,  my knees no longer have arthritic pain, and I no longer need afternoon naps to keep up my energy level. My husband is slowly losing his gut and has lost his sugar cravings.<br />The book is fun to read and very thorough in its explanations.  The recipes are helpful and the &#34;steak rub&#34; that included cocoa and coffee (!) was the best we have ever experienced.  Just to make sure we stay on the diet, I did throw out or give away any items in the kitchen that weren't recommended, as it is so easy to cheat if they are there. It is exciting to be learning new ways to cook and new recipes.  I highly recommend this way of eating, not just to cure a disease, but to feel REALLY GREAT!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I play quite a few video games, mostly MMO's, Shooters, and MOBAs. This mouse works great across all of those ranges. Whether its the accuracy and feel of the high DPI, to the multibutton and macro capability for MMO style games. I'd highly recommend this product to all of my friends, for the cost you really cannot find anything that compares.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|What a thing for parents to have to go through and there are many in our world who have to do just that.  The love for their child is tested and each parent handles it differently but they stick together through it all.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Although only recently translated into English, this is the first of Jo Nesbo's novels about Norwegian police detective Harry Hole.  It doesn't really qualify as Scandinavian crime fiction because it is set in Australia and deals little with anything Norwegian or Scandinavian.  Instead, in terms of locale, the reader learns about Sydney and locations drivable from there.  In terms of culture, the reader learns about Aboriginal myths and past mistreatment of Aboriginal people, including several important characters.  As other reviewers have noted, Harry gradually emerges as an interesting character as the novel develops.  Revelations about his past in this novel do shed light on Harry's demons that are evident in the later novels; that is reason enough for Harry Hole fans to read the first installment.  Nonetheless, I found this plot less credible than the later novels, as might be understandable for the first.  In about one week in Sydney, Harry falls in love, becomes close to the Aboriginal detective with whom he is partnered, and somehow becomes so familiar with the locale and suspects that he can out-think all the detectives of the Sydney police force.  He also continues to move the case forward during an alcoholic lapse.  No one can disappoint the reader like Harry; he seems to be doing well and then can't resist drinking again.  Yet he always figures out the crime, even though there is quite a bit of additional carnage between the crime and the solution.  This mystery is definitely worth reading, just not as impressive as the later books in the series.
098357670X|5.0|I have always had an admiration for Mad Magazine art! And I'm a girl! LOL. Thank you for publishing. FANTASTIC!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I use it daily for work.  Have used many other Bluetooth headsets and none compare in quality of conversation (both hearing and being heard), as well as advanced features.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was a good guy/bad guy all in one who lived an isolated life due to the work he did.  When he gets thrown together with a young girl due to circumstances beyond their control, the need to protect her gives him the human involvement he had been missing. Lots of action.

0743297334|3.0|I have read this novel twice and, in all honesty, I did not enjoy it all that much either time. After reading it the second time I decided to read some criticism on the work to see what I was missing. I found two helpful collections of critical essays: [[ASIN:1555460453 The Sun Also Rises]] edited by Harold Bloom and [[ASIN:0737701951 The Sun Also Rises]] edited by Kelly Wand, and a short, book-length treatment of the novel: [[ASIN:0805779620 The Sun Also Rises: A Novel of the Twenties]] by Michael S. Reynolds. I would recommend all three to anyone wanting to dive a bit deeper into Hemingway's novel. I have also spent a great deal of time thinking and reflecting on the novel. I have been trying to figure out what I liked about the novel and why I did not like it more than I did. I have reached some tentative conclusions. I will try to share some of those conclusions in my review. I definitely think this novel is worth reading even if you do not enjoy it.<br /><br />SUMMARY OF THE BOOK AND SOME OF THE THEMES<br /><br />The novel follows a group of American and British expatriates in Paris. Jake is the war wounded narrator, Brett is the woman that pretty much all the men are in love with, Mike is Brett's fiance, Robert Cohn is the Jewish boxer who tends to be the punching bag of the group, and Bill is an American writer. Jake takes a trip every year to the San Fermin festival in Pamplona to see the bullfights and he invites the rest of the gang to go along. The novel is really about the changing relationships between the characters. Anyone expecting a really dramatic story is going to be disappointed. Traditionally the novel has been viewed as a portrait of the so-called \\"lost generation\\". Virtually all the characters in the novel, with the possible exception of Cohn, have been wounded in some way by the war, and there is no doubt that the characters in the novel are all suffering from a lack of sustaining values. However, Hemingway himself, apparently, did not like the term \\"lost generation\\" even though he used Gertrude Stein's quote as one of the epigraphs for the book.<br /><br />There are really two central conflicts in the novel. The first is obvious and revolves around Robert Cohn's love for Brett. Robert Cohn is the only character who did not fight in the war and he is the only character who still believes wholeheartedly in Romantic love. He is the least cynical character in the book. He is, perhaps, a bit of a Don Quixote figure, still defending an outmoded value system. This gets him into trouble with Brett with whom he has a short affair. The relationship between Cohn and Brett highlights the dangers inherent in all relationships. If the two parties have different ideas about what the relationship is about, and different value systems in general, there is likely to be miscommunication, misunderstanding, and heart-break.<br /><br />Cohn's conflict is the obvious conflict but, as Michael S. Reynolds points out in his book, the central conflict really revolves around Jake. It is difficult for the reader to pick up on the central conflict (I missed its importance until I read Reynolds' book) because Jake tends to make himself invisible in his narration. Jake is also in love with Brett but because of an unfortunate war wound is incapable of physical love. Brett seems to love Jake as well but cannot settle for a non-physical relationship so Jake has to watch her sleep around with other men. Jake has a real love for bullfighting. He goes to the bullfights every year and he is the only American that the Spanish respect as possessing aficion, or passion, about the bullfights. Bullfighting gives Jake some sustaining values: courage, honor and artistry, among them. However, Jake is unable to say no to Brett, and winds up pimping her out (Cohn's words) to the bullfighter Pedro Romero. A Spanish hotel owner with whom Jake has had a relationship for a number of years sees this and by the end of the novel the two are no longer on speaking terms. This is, as Reynolds argues, the central tragedy of the book. Jake was given a moral test and he failed, and his trips to Pamplona, if he continues them, will never be the same.<br /><br />There are lots of interesting themes in the novel. There is, of course, the theme of emasculation. Jake is emasculated in the war and is further emasculated in his relationship to Brett. Despite Hemingway's reservations about the term \\"lost generation\\" the destruction of traditional values after the war is clearly another theme of the novel. Jake and his group do not really have a sustaining philosophy of life. At one point Jake claims that \\"Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth\\" but claims that in five years that philosophy will \\"seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had\\" (148). Jake also claims \\"I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it\\" (148). Technically Jake is Catholic but we learn throughout the book that he does not have much religious feeling. That is, perhaps, another casualty of the war. So, throughout the novel, we see a group of people trying to figure out how to live, and not doing all that great a job at it.<br /><br />Another theme that I found very interesting is the return to more primitive, one might say pagan, value systems as a replacement for Christianity. This shows up in a number of places in the book. Jake and Bill go on a fishing trip in Burguete and meet a British man named Harris and they all go to visit a monastery. They all agree it is a remarkable place but, Bill asks, \\"It isn't the same as fishing though, is it?\\" The others agree that it is not. Clearly, there is an attempt to return to nature here, and nature is viewed as more reinvigorating than traditional religion. The only time the reader gets any sense of health reading this novel is in the descriptions of nature and in the characters' contact with nature. There is also an interesting mix between the Christian and the pagan in the San Fermin festival. It is, in name at least, a Christian festival in honor of a Christian saint, but the practice of bullfighting (sacrificing the bull) is a much more primitive religious practice, and it is clear that all of the characters, especially Jake, are much more moved by the bullfighting than they are by the Christian aspects of the festival. There is, it seems to me, an attempt in the novel to move back to a more primitive form of religion to find some sustaining values after the collapse of Christianity. There is a similarity here between Hemingway's novel and T.S. Eliot's poem [[ASIN:0393974995 The Waste Land (Norton Critical Editions)]].<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK OR WHAT HEMINGWAY DID WELL<br /><br />Now, before I try to explain what I did not like about the novel I want to highlight a few things I liked about the novel. First, Hemingway does a great job portraying powerful emotions. There is an interesting exchange between William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway that I think is relevant. William Faulkner criticized Hemingway by saying \\"He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary\\". Hemingway replied by saying \\"Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words?\\" Personally, I much prefer Faulkner to Hemingway, but Hemingway definitely has a point here. Sometimes simple and direct is more powerful. There is a scene where Mike and Robert Cohn get into a fight. Mike calls Robert Cohn a steer because he is always \\"hanging about so\\". Hemingway (or Jake) simply writes \\"We were embarrassed\\". That is all that is necessary to convey the discomfort and the powerful emotions broiling beneath the surface of the scene. It is a very painful scene to read.<br /><br />There is another scene where Brett says \\"Oh darling...I'm so miserable\\" and Jake replies \\"You were happy a minute ago\\" and Brett replies again \\"It's all gone\\". To me, that is much more powerful than if Brett hadtried to write an impromptu poem expressing her misery or provide some literary metaphor for her depression (\\"it is as wide and deep as the ocean\\" or something like that). Just saying \\"I'm so miserable\\" is more powerful than any literary trope which will tend to sound contrived. There is really an emotional hell just beneath all the quiet stoicism and ironic detachment of this novel and Hemingway does a great job conveying that in very few words. It is part of the reason reading the novel is not always all that pleasant of an experience. We can feel the misery and despair that is just beneath all the supposed gaiety. Hemingway also used to say that writers should portray how people actually feel rather than how they think they are supposed to feel. He definitely lives up to that. We have, I think, a lot of misconceptions about love. Love is a very complex emotion that is mixed up with a lot of other emotions and not all of them are positive. Pride and jealousy, for example, both play a huge role in the emotion we call love. Hemingway portrays the complexity of love, and the destructive ingredients of love, quite well.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciated about the novel was Hemingway's sparse style in his descriptions of nature. I have been reading Henry David Thoreau recently, and as much as I love Thoreau, and as great a naturalist as he was, Thoreau still gets caught up in some of the standard literary tropes when describing nature. It does not feel direct. It is mediated by literature. Hemingway describes nature directly. There is actually a place in the book where he writes \\"The trees were green\\" (94) and that is his entire description of the trees. There are no descriptions of Apollo driving his winged chariot across the sky, etc.. Hemingway cuts all that away. If I am honest with myself I really prefer a slightly more ornate style. I prefer Faulkner to Hemingway. However, I do think that Hemingway's sparse style was necessary. It was like a cleansing forest fire. It removed a bunch of sick and dead foliage and allowed new shoots to bloom in literature. For that I am very grateful to Hemingway.<br /><br />REASONS I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK MORE THAN I DID<br /><br />The first thing to be said is: I am a philosophy student. I love ideas and I enjoy metaphysical speculation. Hemingway was not really a philosopher. He was clearly more interested in character and emotion. There is big emotion in this book but there are not really any big ideas in it (none that I have found anyways). I have a feeling that Hemingway would have considered metaphysical speculation unhealthy. While I can appreciate that standpoint to life it does not change the fact that I tend to prefer novels that have big ideas in them or helpful insights into life. There are not that many helpful insights into life in the novel. There is not a lot of wisdom to be found. The characters are all lost, trying to figure out how to live in the world, and while they are certain that the old ways of living in the world are no longer possible, they do not yet have much to offer in their place. The lack of big ideas and insights into life is one reason I did not like the novel more than I did.<br /><br />There is also a lack of sincerity in the novel. A number of critics really loved the fishing scene with Jake and Bill. They seemed to think it highlighted Bill's humor. To me, it highlighted Bill's incessant sarcasm and lack of sincerity. When they eat lunch they have kind of a mock saying of grace. I find this inability to be sincere to be a rather annoying trait. The characters are all very cynical and they clearly despise (at least at times) the one character who does not entirely share in their cynicism: Robert Cohn. To me, Robert Cohn and Brett Ashley were the most sympathetic characters in the book. Robert Cohn may be delusional but at least he believes in something and is willing to look foolish in defending what he believes. Brett Ashley may make emotional mincemeat out of most of the men in her life but she does not seem cruel to me. She is just wounded and desperate. From the criticism I read on the novel, however, it does not seem like most readers share my views. Most readers think that Cohn and Brett are very unsympathetic characters. If that is how Hemingway intended them it goes a long way towards explaining why I did not like the book more than I did. I think novelists should always try to understand their characters and genuine understanding always breeds sympathy. If a character is portrayed as extremely unsympathetic chances are they are a cardboard cutout character, with no real depth, enlightened by a merely superficial gaze.<br /><br />The novel is also quite depressing. It is, in my opinion, much more depressing than more openly nihilistic novels (Celine and Beckett, for example). The characters are all caught up in what the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard called the aesthetic existential sphere. There is despair beneath the surface of the aesthetic sphere but it is unconscious. Openly nihilistic novels are expressions of conscious despair. In [[ASIN:0691020280 The Sickness Unto Death]] Kierkegaard argues that unconscious despair is worse than conscious despair. At least the person who experiences conscious despair is aware that they are sick and searching for a cure. The characters in this novel are attempting to drown their despair in alcohol and sex rather than facing it directly. It gives the novel a very unhealthy feeling that made it difficult for me to read at times. Perhaps that is what Hemingway intended. If so, he definitely succeeded. It is definitely powerful. Still, it reduced my enjoyment of the novel somewhat. The despair in the novel is slightly contagious and I found myself getting sucked into it at times.<br /><br />One final observation and then I will bring this overly long review to a close. Part of my problem with the novel may be my own fault. It is possible I am reading the novel as if it were a nineteenth-century novel. I assume that Hemingway is trying to say something, that he wants the reader to adopt a particular position in relation to his characters, and that might not be the case. I may be assuming too much about the judgments that I think Hemingway wants me to make about his characters, and I tend to disagree with the judgments I think Hemingway wants me to make. For example, I assume that Hemingway approves of Jake's stoicism and disapproves of Cohn's lack of stoicism. Jake suffers silently while Cohn's primary sin seems to be that he is unwilling to suffer silently, to suck it up, so to speak. I do not agree with the values behind that judgment, so if that is the judgment that Hemingway wants the reader to make, it is another reason I did not enjoy the novel more than I did. However, it is possible that Hemingway is not expecting any particular judgments from the reader. Modern novels do not tell the reader what to think in the same way that older novels do. The reader is allowed to make up their own mind. Things happen, and those events effect different characters in particular ways, but there is no God's eye view from which to decide which reactions are \\"good\\" and which are \\"bad\\". So, if I could convince myself that Hemingway is simply holding a mirror up to a particular time and place, and leaving it up to the reader to form their own judgments, I would, I think, enjoy the novel much more than I did.tried to write an impromptu poem expressing her misery or provide some literary metaphor for her depression (\\"it is as wide and deep as the ocean\\" or something like that).

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome!  I am completely addicted to this game.  It's the most fun I've had with any game app I've downloaded.
B008JFURII|4.0|Start with the star power: Dame Mirren, Bruce Willis, Zeta-Jones, Malkovich, Anthony Hopkins, and a bunch that also deserve mention - I suppose, in theory, that crowd could make a bad movie, but I have trouble imagining that.<br /><br />Hopkins deserves special mention. I mean, [[ASIN:B00125FBTM Malcolm McDowell]] plays the sane psychopath as well as any, and has a four-decade-+ career doing so. But really, with the possible exception of Jack Nicholson, who really makes you believe it? On the other hand, Mirren dominates any stage she walks onto. And Willis has his smart-alecky presence. And Malkovich has this bizarre role that he lives in an utterly convincing way, and being convinced it what makes it so scary.<br /><br />Despite any unbelievability your might find, and there's a bunch, this comes together in a wholly satisfying spy/adventure/slapstick combination that defies easy description except that it works. Good chases, good fights, good effects, but it's really these huge presences that let the movie come to life.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had a [[ASIN:B0040QE98O Logitech Revue Companion Box with Google TV and Keyboard Controller]] since it first came out.  Watching movies on it using Netflix or Amazon Instant Video is almost impossible because of the number of Shockwave crashes.  But I like being able to browse the web on my TV with it.  I was so excited to see an alternative to Google TV, the Chromecast.  While it doesn't have as many features as Google TV does, it sure is a lot more reliable!<br /><br />The Chromecast was easy to set up.  I opted to plug it in to my A/V receiver rather than my TV, so I don't get the automatic input switching like some people are when they plug the Chromecast in to their TV.  No biggie.  The Chromecast connected to my WiFi network okay, but the signal was a bit low.  So I installed the HDMI extender that comes in the package (the bag it was in said it improves the WiFi reception as well).  I got an extra bar on the WiFi signal after using the HDMI extender, so if you have a problem with your WiFi signal, give it a try.<br /><br />I love being able to play [[ASIN:B005ZXWMUS Netflix]] movies and music from Google Play Music.  I don't browse YouTube all that much, but it works just as well.  You just hit the new \\"cast\\" icon in these apps to send the video or audio to your Chromecast.  There is also a Chrome extension that allows you to cast any Chrome tab from your PC to your TV.  You can then open additional Chrome tabs without disturbing the tab that is currently being cast.  For example, you can start a YouTube video or have another website up on your TV and if you open another Chrome tab on your PC, it does not automatically get shown on your TV until you press the \\"cast\\" button... the old tab remains on the screen undisturbed.<br /><br />I haven't had any crashes or disconnects yet, which is more than I can say for Google TV.  Funny how Google TV boxes can run upwards of 200 hundred dollars or more and it can crash constantly, but this little $35 box does not.  Sure, the app support is limited for now, but this won't last too long.  With the popularity of this thing, I'm sure new apps will be jumping on board left and right!  The only thing that could have made the Chromecast even better would have been an HDMI pass-through like Google TV has so you can keep your TV signal in the corner while you view your Chrome tab or apps on the screen.<br /><br />At the intro price, this device can't be beat.  I can't wait to see what new apps and other updates come in the future.  Hopefully Amazon will release a Chromecast-compatible app for Prime Instant Video someday!.

B0014NDXGA|4.0|I think Bushnell makes the best laser rangefinder on the market but if you can't see the flag you cannot use this product and as a result, I like the Garmin S2 watch better for two reasons: 1) It calculates your driving distance, so if you hit a ball in the rough or behind trees in a tight fairway, once you start walking the Garmin watch will tell you how far you are from the tee, so if you think your ball travelled 270 yards, when you get to the 270 yard range from the tee you can start looking at your ball. I have found that to be an amazing feature that you just cannot utilize with a rangefinder. 2) On a dog leg or when you are in trouble in the rough, if you cannot see the flag you cannot use this rangefinder. With the Garmin watch, you always know how far you are from the green. So in conclusion, this is the best rangefinder on the market but I would take the Garmin S2 watch over this.
0385341008|5.0|Not being previously aware of Guernsey, (it is one of the Channel Islands off of Britian) and not knowing it was occupied by the Nazis during the war, this book was a delightful surprise.  Cleverly crafted as letters to reveal the story, it was a perfect light summer read.  It was easy to put down and pick up as each letter is a stand-alone part of the story as a whole.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to love it.  I would check my different locations everyday.  Now, I am about to delete it from my carousel.  Please return to the previous version which was very user friendly.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and this was one of my very favorite. Awesome character development, a fascinating setting and intriguing conflict made it a book I couldn't put down!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is awesome. I have been playing non-stop since I got the app......  I like how you can play with friends or just by yourself, and the fact that you could visit several peoples island. I just love it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's easy to use and, has different sounds which I like and it serves its purpose of a nice alarm
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever I can't what till the next up date when u get the game please rate it 5 stares
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|I love this album. My favorite piece is No.9.<br />She is a great singer, and the arrangement is excellent too.
B000000OSG|5.0|Used to have on cassette and probably still do ! Just trying to complete my G n R collection I used to have back in the day !
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|It doesn't take long to grasp the concepts and it doesn't take much reading as most of the books is Kaufman explaining how he implemented the process. That's not a bad thing - it's good to see indepth explanations across several disciplines to get a feel for the process in real life.<br /><br />What I love about the book is that it gives hope. I love learning and I love developing new skills. This book helps me to explore new skills rapidly and to a sufficient depth to determine what I want to do with that skill. I appreciate his example of Go - after developing the skill he stopped spending time on it. That's refreshing. It's good to see an example where the skill didn't offer sufficient return to continue with. That opens up for me a host of new skills I would like to try but feel the investment may not be worth it. 20 hours is a not a huge investment to determine that more is not needed - I like that, the permission to stop.<br /><br />I have begun applying this process to my delight I can say that it works.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cool kids love this game. I wonder if parents play this. beacuase that wood of been weird.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a very good book that has explained the future of ender and the hundred worlds. I love that there is a new alien race included in this book and makes the book that much better. The at it shows how many different races can work together as ramen makes the book meaningful and teaches a valuable lesson.
B000000OSE|5.0|Used to have on cassette and probably still do. Just trying to replace my G n R collection from back in the day !
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was amazing.  My second time reading it.  Thank you for writing it. A true enjoyment! Keep up the great work.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I found this movie to have both a sense of humor and sweetness that I would not have believed was possible with a zombie movie. I found myself both moved and touched by the cast of dead and undead that populate this movie. It also has a spook factor that can make you jump and sit on the edge of your seat. I would suggest this movie to any one looking for a fun, spooky, movie with heart. Not to be missed.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app is literally bipolar. One minute/day it runs beautifully and then it shuts off my Kindle and doesn't let me go home. It is so frustrating! I don't know if I should recommend it or not. Sorry.
B000000OQY|5.0|Used to have on cassette and probably still do somewhere ! These MF'ers can sure rock and sounds awesome !!!
B003QSLW0K|5.0|11 years after it came out, it still makes us tear up, get angry at the screen and cheer out loud at all the right moments, super original story, art and music, even the characters were an extremely refreshing change from the normal Disney &#34;princess&#34; story 5 stars all the way!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think I'm the only person who just scrolls through the entire comments looking for the people who put one star to see what the problems are with this game. I heard there are many glitches but never did find and one stars. I hope I will enjoy this game though :)
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Very far fetched, but entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2  books, but  found the 3rd  just  too much violence. It was great to have a happy ending after all!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|i love  hit girl and big daddy and kick ass and red mist. this is the most vulgar movie ive ever seen and i love it
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Best trilogy Eva.  This book keeps you entertained from start to finish.  I started to wonder when the story is gong to take a dip, but It Really Never do!  I felt the chills going down my spine more than a few times.  Well worth the price tag,
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very well executed and I enjoy watching the deal!  Except for the ads, it's perfect. Not sure why it has to have ads as I can't believe anyone pays any attention to them.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think this game is awesome and I love sharks lol ;)<br />and there's so many more I have them allllllll
B004EPYZU8|3.0|I've seen 2011's \\"Sucker Punch\\" twice now and it struck me the same both times. Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.<br /><br />Browning plays \\"Baby Doll\\" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the \\"brothel\\" she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.<br /><br />There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.<br /><br />The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B- (but the women are a definite A+)
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Looking forward to number 2 and 3?  Very compelling, interesting twists and turns in the plot.  I've become a Larsson fan
B0012GTZC0|3.0|A fair read, somewhat contrived and predictable at time and made longer packing in unnecessary events. It this now long enough?
B00CWR4YCE|2.0|Much more basic than expected...maybe worthwhile if you are a beginner. If you have done embroidery before its of little use, of course you cannot see that from the preview.
B0045HCJQW|4.0|This is from the day of the big budget, big story movies when actors could act and pull you right into the story line.  Love the actors in this too.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love  this show. The characters are so so funny and witty!!! Love it!!!!  No episodes disappoint! Watched the entire season in less than a week! Couldn't stop watching it!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Matt Damon and the entire cast made this movie a classic.  The seasoned attorney being taught a lesson on human civility by a fresh out of law school and just Sworn in attorney.  Perfect!!!
B004G6009U|4.0|My son is at that age where he wants to rewatch the same four movies over and over and over again. And when he wants to watch \\"Lady and the Horsey\\" (his description for \\"Tangled\\"), it's a good day for me. Because of all the Disney/Pixar films, I think \\"Tangled\\" is one of the more interesting stories. And it certainly has one of my favorite villains.<br /><br />Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) is complex and funny and a delight. The music in this film is enjoyable and Murphy's song in particular are a joy. Note how, whenever she is affectionate to Rapunzel, she's actually addressing her hair.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" and \\"Cars 2\\" are fine. \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Up\\" are good fun. But \\"Tangled\\" really is a joy for every member of my family, even the 100th time I've seen it.
B007712XAU|5.0|Who doesn't just love this series?  Really has captured a continent and you cannot wait until the next one.  When is the next one???
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game and very addictive.  I like the fact you can keep on building your vehicle.  Keep up the good work!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|WOW! - All I can say is WOW! - Zimmer has outdone himself this time! Seriously... He really has connected with the 'Man of Steel'/Superman universe!<br /><br />There is no filler here at all! - Every note is very important in creating an incredibly cohesive whole! This 'whole' being a very intense, plaintive, hopeful, awe-inspiring body of music & sound! - Talking about sound... The sound quality of this recording is fantastic!!<br /><br />Bottom line, Hans Zimmer has 'transcended' John Williams' music in every way - the essence and embodiment of Kal El, Clark Kent, Superman, Jor El, Krypton and Smallville is incredibly realized!<br /><br />ENJOY! :] - Lastly I recommend playing this album on a great, powerful sound system - I am actually upgrading my current system as it can't handle the bass (especially from track 8) - the upgrade will definitely be worth it!
B004IQ78HA|3.0|As a Disney movie, it is okay - nothing special.  The video quality is not that great.  All right for kids older than four.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It's so annoying, I tried to find the caption button to watch a video with subtitles but couldn't find it. Please fix this Amazon
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|playing Nemo's Reef is entertaining for all ages. Playing the  game can keep you busy. I even got my husband addicted to playing.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This nifty little thing upgrades your Mag-Lite the standard bulb to a much brighter LED. The light also tends to look closer to &#34;white&#34; than &#34;yellow ish&#34; that you get in a normal flashlight bulb. It's supposed to last longer as well, and so far so good.
B005HSL626|5.0|Bought the wife a Samsung tablet for her birthday.  She became addicted to playing Fruit Ninja on our daughter's mp3 player and smart phone.  She wants her own copy.  So, Dad to the rescue.  Mom can play anytime she wants.  I'm a hero.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has humor and smart writing. I really enjoy watching it, and there isn't any unnecessarily sex or love story for the sake of a love story. This is the show my husband watch when the kids go to bed. We love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's Solitaire, it's addictive, it's free...no complaints. Nice options for appearance and gameplay. Just like with any app, if you can't handle clicking away the ads (or \\"on\\" them, if you're interested in the product) between games, upgrade to the paid version. But if, like me, you don't mind the extra clicks, the free version's the way to go. It works great. :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|100% what I expected and ordered! great product for the price and am really hopeful for further advancements in the future. I would abolutely recomend this product to anyone with children, just streemed netflix to our tv at home watching what rhymes with \\"the snorelax\\" and it was ABSOLUTELY HD i mean it looked bluray quality and absolutely no lag whatsoever! really great product,, and you can't beat the price point of $35! thanks!
6304936362|5.0|Another old favorite added to our collection.  Realistic, shocking at times,  full of camaraderie and soul searching.  If someone you know served in B-17s over Europe during World War II, this will help you understand the experience.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Planning a special event, buying or selling a home, considering a vacation destination,  looking for beauty or fashion advice, looking for a perfect gift, recipe, or craft project? You can create virtual pinboards for endless subjects or interests. View gorgeous graphics  and start pinning! I am so glad I found this app and use it daily.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. FUN. KEEPS MY INTEREST!!!  Encourage others to get this game. More interesting than the other 3-in-a-row games!  Challenges your senses.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Full of twists and turns that left me guessing up to the end! I recommend all of the Jack Reacher novels!
B003KIMOIK|5.0|The only on screen collaboration of Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood.  Story and action hold up very well for modern viewers.  Must have for fans of Clint or Burt.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Nice tempo!  Maysa deliver such a smooth buttery sound that put you in the right mood at the right time!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Took me a while to adjust to it.  The pieces all sounded very similar but after a couple times I began to appreciate it more
0738212415|5.0|This is a very nice book for the price, yes I would recommend it to my friends, very good price and quality.You can learn a lot from it.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|I have been purchasing and devouring the Bible of fashion magazines since I was 16. I love Every pound of these Fall monstrosities and I I I woud save them and continue to re-read them all year. This documentary is an incredibly mind blowing experience to view all of the components that make these issues the phenomenon that they are. It is now July, and I salivating That THE SEPTEMBER ISSUES of Vogue,, Bazaar etc. will be here in a matter of weeks!!!! And now after having viewed this, I am picturing what is going on behind the scenes. right now, just as they're going to print. LOVED THIS DVD!!!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game. I have a hard time putting it down. There are different levels and it isn't too hard for me.
1612183956|5.0|Wow, I just read a James Lee Burke book and this one blew it out of the water in so far as storyline and narration, I could not stop listening. Fantastic story about a man and his relentless need for freedom and answers, all the while fighting several personal inner daemons. The content and non stop action was at times, a real nail biter.  The mystery is not revealed until the very end, and boy what an ending, so very imaginative.  I could not come up with any viable guesses as to what in the heck could bring this story all together but Blake Crouch brought it home with a real bang.  The characters were real and I found myself rooting for the fiercely, resilient main character.  Paul Garcia's narration was outstanding. 
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, I was hooked from season 1 to the finale of this season. It will have you longing until January!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and provides just enough challenge, but not so challenging that you get frustrated. Reminds me of the game, The Crimson Room, but with more rooms.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Did not make any sense.  Watched it with another person and turned it off. Worst movie i have ever seen
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I read the book, and two others. They were OK. Some of the author's technical descriptions are inaccurate and I have found this to be the case in the others I have read as well. With that said, I have read the next two in the series so they aren't bad by any means. I have not seen the movie but Tom Cruse? Really?
B006Y5EDRG|3.0|Your usual soap opera with music and sex on the side and hollywood drama.  Just when you really like the blonde she has to sleep w/ the director and how long is the 2nd choice woman for Marilyn going to hold out from sex w/ the director.  We all know what's going to happen!
B0057567P0|4.0|I have a huge backup to a portable drive that is slow under USB 2.0 speeds, but quickly finishes with 3.0 speeds.
0345803485|1.0|If you feel like wasting your time go ahead and read this book. There's no plot to it! It's all about kinky sex, that's it. NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS! Seriously considering not reading the other 2 books!
B00DURGZHW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this engrossing, excellently acted drama:  any fan of Matthew McConaughey's will be mesmerized throughout... don't miss it!  ;D
B005544TRQ|5.0|the acting is very good and even though it seems a little outlandish that a person is impersonating a lawyer without ever have spent time in college, it makes the story just that much for fun and a little bit of fantasy.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|good app to make it easier to buy and bid on items right from my kindle fire, works pretty good.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|If you are a Follett fan, you won't be disappointed.  Nice story line and makes you think about the importance of Israel having nuclear weapons.  Action filled story similar to other Follet books (different from his books like the &#34;pillars of the earth&#34; though).
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I enjoyed watching the 1st season.  The plot line was interesting and it was nice to see the singing and dancing scenes.  The show has a little bit of everything, sex, drama, singing and dancing.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I quite enjoyed season one. It reminded me of a low rent &#34;Easy A&#34;. I say that as a positive. The situations are funny and ridiculous, and every teen emphasizes with the awkward moments. It also does a fair job of handling sex and teenagers, rather than pretending it doesn't exist, dives right into the problems of emotionally immature kids dealing with the problems that teen-sex can have. Much different than anything else on the air, and didn't feel like a sitcom.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading the book, I do not understand the negative reviews.  I enjoyed everything about the book.  I really like finding out some missed pieces of puzzles and am more than excited for the story to continue.  I love how the new material was introduced and has me spell bound.  I can NOT wait for the next book...please hurry Sylvia Day.  We need more Gideon and Eva.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids and I love this game! The only problem is stopping. We could play it all day long! Can't wait to play more levels!
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I've been a fan of David's for several years and even flew half-way across the country to see him in concert, so I've been anxiously awaiting this latest CD.  It is amazing and I enjoyed it so much I even ordered a copy for my sister-in-law, who also loves it!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Coming from the Xbox I hate the PS3 controller. This thing is great and feels very similar and feels right. My only complaint is that if you don't give it a line of sight to the USB sensor it doesn't work right.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Doing what is right, because it is right, regardless of what others around you think.  This one of the main themes in THE WAY OF KINGS.  Each time I read this book I learn something new about leadership, friendship and honor.  Brandon has a way of teaching that is moving.  Aside from that, this book is just plain fun to read.  Looking forward to many years anticipating and enjoying the STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE.
B0099116AY|5.0|This is a marriage in trouble movie, very funny and the right actors to pull it off its about your life.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I read a lot of clive cusslers and lee childs and nelson demille novels. This book is excellent, every page has suspense or action
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|S***zzz got me hooked I've been playing it for three days straight now, it's a must download!!! Check it or else!!!
B000001EHS|5.0|This is a great cd. All their chart topping hits are on here. Even today their music still holds up. It doesn't sound cheesy or dated at all. They had a knack for crafting songs that really rocked but were also melodic. Not too many rock bands can do that. If you are a big Def Leppard fan you will also want to have their other cd's. Tons of great music on them, just not necessarily mainstream radio friendly songs. What a great band and what a great cd.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Five stars is what I consider the last book in this trilogy to be worth. I would recommend the entire series to my friends for a fun and easy read. I cannot wait to check out more of Ms. Stiefvater's books.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a beautiful storyline and it helped that I saw the movie.  I could see the characters playing their roles on screen.
7119005901|4.0|THE SET:<br />  This is a good set if you simply want a copy of the book. Paperback, and four easy-to-manage volumes.<br />  This is the Moss Roberts translation. So, you'll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with - like \\"Cao Cao\\" instead of \\"Tsao Tsao\\".<br />  It's also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" or \\"Journey to the West\\" because they all have uniform editions.<br />  The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes, the actual pages seem a little thin. I worry from time to time about ripping them.<br />  There are also a number of typos. But in all honesty, I don't really notice them. With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of already-foreign words and names, a typo now and then won't make you stumble in the least.<br /><br />THE BOOK:<br />  \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is a really great (albeit long) story. This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell. The names, places, and major events were all real. The heroic actions, dialog, and minor events however are mostly imbelished or improvised.<br />  But despite the length and complexity of the story (there are literally hundreds of characters), this book is a GREAT read. Because it has so much content to cover, the book moves at an incredible pace. Characters are literally fighting and/or dying every other page. Although you may get confused by the names, you will not be bored by anything. I often get bored by books, but everytime I pick this one up I am sucked in instantly.<br />  And if you have played any of the Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the Three Kingdoms video games, you should most definitely read the original tale. Plus, you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the characters/events already.<br />  If you're at all interested in ancient warfare, drama, or literature, you need to read this book.
0062255657|4.0|I can't deny that this book is well-written.  It is haunting and dark.  A true fairy tale with all the monsters and gothic overtones.  I wish it had tied in his present life and the funeral (whose funeral was it? His?) with the remembering part of his childhood terrors.
1447231171|5.0|Can't wait to see if a fourth installment is written regarding the families involved-can't wait for the mystery to be solved
6304400551|5.0|The tape was in good condition and I enjoyed the movie. Definitely recommend it for family viewing. Very happy with my purchase.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I find awolnation to bd the perfrct blend for today ....it has a message too....if your listening...and the style of music is very unique but has hints of early nineties blended...sweet music is all I can say ....ready for ...gonna wear this out
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's extremely long, fits all my USB adapters, and charges both my kindle fire and my phone. I'm a happy camper!
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I could not stop laughing at how cheesy and preposterous this movie was. There were a couple of truly funny scenes (thanks to Rob Corddry), but it was really just ridiculous. Was this a condescending attempt to make zombies appealing to women? Newsflash: there should never be anything romantic about Zombies.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|If you like the game of un you will enjoy this app. I gave it 3 stars though due to slow pace and limited play time.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Besides the typical driver BSOD issues that one can have, this is an actual beast, all games on ultra and it doesn't give a sweat :)
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Just like Daft punk did it, Skrillex rocked the new electro wave! Danceable, intense, powerful. It's a must in you electro library.

B007704HO6|5.0|This is a wonderful story, of course because Bob is awesome, but mostly because it might open peoples eyes to the people behind the guitar on the street, the street artists and the magazine sellers. Hope more people will respect what they do. Thank you James.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Great way to kill some time while waiting for an appointment or your kids lesson to end.  Fun for all ages.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|This movie is wonderful and uplifting! If you're getting to feel down and out then watch it and a lot of your woes will disappear.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just finished and loved from the beginning. I was not exactly happy with the end and not knowing if or when the next will be released. The story line along bringing love, lust and a bit of mystery was amazing. Let's hope soon...
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A great mind at work, creating a new world. It is well written and compiled. Found I had to keep reading every minute I could afford.

B00499QUK2|5.0|I am a long time lover of the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson so I was happy to find, thanks to a friend, that this series existed. The cast is fantastic, the directing is fantastic and the writing is fantastic! I recommend this series so hard that it's not even funny.
B00821OUT6|3.0|Watched Episode 1, Part 1 and it had Closed Captions.  Part 2 did not, there was no icon to select CC. Why not?  As far as the show itself, it is fair, mediocre scripting, stereotypes abound, typical Spielberg.  Mildly entertaining, glad it's free with my Prime membership, because I wouldn't pay extra to see it.
B001Q5395Q|5.0|I love this movie especially the part when the motorcycle guy was bullying the young clown.... great movie to watch
B008BU75IQ|1.0|Terrible ending. I will no longer waste me time reading Archer.  No more wasted time reading his books.  No More
B002VWZWPI|5.0|This is definitely and Indy lovers dream! Words cannot explain the joy that this book has brought me. Absolutely love!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I held out until July 2013.  I finally caved, watched the 1st episode of season 1, and didn't leave the house for several days.  Now, I just can't wait for season 4.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its a good game on the go. able to have fun with friends story line quest are more detailed then most app games out there fore smart phones &amp; other devices. you cannot go wrong with this games
B003SQVI54|3.0|Funny show! Amazon provided good quality video and audio. I was hooked in right away. I totally recommend it, only to mature audiences though.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|How can you not love a good ol' fashioned Sherlock Holmes mystery? You can't that's how! Read these books and short stories, I mean you get a great deal for them so you mind-as-well do it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome game, really makes you use your head. Which is seldom done in games these days. I couldn't stop playing. Thanks G5<br /><br />.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a wonderful read!  The characters are so real and the story just grabbed me.  I can recommend it to all who love to read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an amazing game! It Keeps you guessing. Some are really hard but it keeps your brain working :)
B008133MDK|5.0|I am a long time lover of the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson so I was happy to find, thanks to a friend, that this series existed. The cast is fantastic, the directing is fantastic and the writing is fantastic! I recommend this series so hard that it's not even funny.
B005IDXIL2|3.0|It was overall a good game but in my opinion way to easy you notice that after the first game. But I like the multiplayer mode.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|If you think of the story of The Wizard of Oz as a children's tale, do not expect the same from this story.  My daughter and I both enjoyed the film for its spectacular graphics and exciting action.  However we do not think that small children should see the film as it is very frightening at times and would elicit nightmares.  The story of personal conflict and the ways it can influence one's path in life is a good moral discussion point with older children.  Overall, I liked the film and would recommend it for the right audience.
B00AAIHAGO|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, it's an Al Pacino classic performance.  A must see for fans of this great actor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use the calculator each and every time I need to do some calculations. The memory lets you remember what you first put in for the calculations.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game it is one of the most amazing and awesome games I have ever got to play
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Classic Metal returns with this latest offering from Black Sabbath.  It's nice that some things never change.  These guys sound as good today as they did in the beginning - but better recorded in 2013.  Great album!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Below expectations good to protect and cover your device not sturdy for standing alone playing movies or videos thank you
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game for the most part. As others have said, the ads are pretty often.  Which can get annoying, Then it they have to pay their bills too :) I just skip over them.<br /><br />The graphics are fabulous ... which is probably why I wish it didn't have lives that you had to wait for, because I want to keep playing.  It doesn't take that long for them to refill, but still ... it is so fun that I am disappointed when my 5 minutes worth of lives is up and have to wait almost an hour for them to refill.  Not sure it that is bad because it has lives or good because I am anxious to play another round.<br /><br />It does become a game of beating your high score, unless you link to Facebook - then it is competing against others high scores. I chose to not do that ... and now that I have gotten as high as I think I can go, it is just a cute game to play really quick.<br /><br />It would be nice if there were real quests to beat along the way on top of just a high score.<br /><br />It did restore my love of the match three type games and for free is  overall, fun. Enjoy!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|For fans of Michael Jackson, this is an absolute MUST.  Some of his finest work - especially Smooth Criminal - is on this video.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is pretty fun, except that it's timed.  It's just a little bit harder for people like me who need to concentrate.  Sometimes, games like these frustrate me.  Overall, it's a really fun and puzzling game, and I recommend it for every one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like this game a lot. my daughter  loves it and it keeps occupied when im on short errands. i love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app allows you to get guns like freeze Ray, much like subway Surfer's. This app is very amazing.I love this app you should get it. And it is free!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun game, just have to be patient and wait for scratch tickets to earn coins to play so you don't have to pay for coins. And the ad's are a little excessive but that's what makes it free.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|great game as always from g5 games. good grafics. just beware if you got it for free you will have to pay about 4.99 for the full version.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|loved the 'old' format. this new design is not up-to-date as it says it is.<br />We were getting monsoon rains and it stated 'our dry conditions will continue'.<br />I never gave a review about how much I liked the old app. But I need to say, this<br />new version is terrible. I want the old weather channel app back!<br />The only reason i gave 2 stars, there is actually live radar.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The show is well cast and the interesting way of life for small town people during that time period is shown well with realistic themes and problems.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm only halfway through but I am loving this book!  It's so well written and full of emotions you can't help to feel!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It  parallels  the life of two orphans and will touch your heart. I never knew about the orphan trains and the suffering those children endured. It's a bitter  sweet story and one you absolutely must read. I loved every page!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I have paid for extra lives twice and they've never given me the lives<br />I like the game but not getting ripped off
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp is not as much a character in this novel as a stereotype.,  hoping the Survivor redeems him and
1452126577|5.0|I absolutely love this book. When I am having a down day and need a laugh, I go straight to this book. It was soo cute and funny and I totally love it or sorry as Grumpy Cat would say &#34;I HATE IT&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this game after installing it I have found myself quite hooked. it's a lot of fun and easy to pick up and play.
1452126607|5.0|Grumpy Cat through the year. The quotes are too funny. I bought it for my calendar frame I have and can not wait to put it up. I am a totally Grumpy Cat Fan!! I look forward to seeing your frowning face!!
B006XOBFB0|5.0|For those already familiar with the Mozart canon, no introduction to Murray Perahia or the English Chamber Orchestra is necessary: they are both old friends.<br /><br />To those discovering the wonders and boundless satisfactions of Mozart, every now and again a very special set comes along at a very special price. This is one of those times. There is not space enough here to list the many qualities of these recordings and all the reasons you should buy them. After buying them, however, you will realize them for yourself.<br /><br />True, there is no documentation in the box, but 10 minutes on the Internet will tell you everything you need to know. Your ears and your heart will tell you the rest. Happy listening!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was the best book my English teacher assigned for the summer! It was great!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|really? do we need a review for kindle for android? i mean they are all pretty much the same, it functions, now if only i could get it to transfer the information straight to my brain.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can usually see a plot twist ciming from a mile away, but this book kept me on the efge of my seat  and i didnt see those twist and turns coming.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is a superbly made movie and the acting is simply first rate-I believe Cate was nominated for an 'Oscar' for her talents. I would most highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes history and period movies. Great stuff !!!!!!!!!!!1
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I did not find this movie enduring or funny.  Some parts were amusing.  Same overdone story with a lot of stereotypical characters.  I don't find the overbearing, constantly nagging mom funny.  The acting is good but the characters are so annoying, couldn't even finish the movie.  Maybe if I watch it in two parts I'll get to the end?
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What a great story! I felt at times as if I was there with Cheryl on the trail. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the spirit of adventure!
B003L20IHO|5.0|You laugh, you cry, you hope, you wonder!  A gamut of emotions run through this beautifully filmed movie as a young man loses everything with the loss of his younger brother but finds his way back to the world of the living through a &#34;divine&#34; intervention.  Mystery, love and romance all in one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game((: it's absolutely amazing, so fun!! You can actually feed and treat the horse.. also able to enter in competitions that you control your horse in(: 5 stars all the way
1451695195|5.0|I expected this book to be a little more about the experience not his life story, it starts to loose me, then says a little.
B00AHHODH2|2.0|This book was not funny in any way. It is the story of three elderly widows who meet in a nearby park every afternoon at four to walk their dogs and drink cocktails from red paper cups. The character descriptions are very tedious and long. The plot does not thicken, it hardens into a complicated mess. I cannot recommend this book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the G5 games and this is no exception.  I would like to see more ho and mini puzzles but thats really about all I have to gripe about.  I usually finish these in a couple of days.  It would really be awesome to have a COMPLETE game that lasts longer. Overall though, these are great games that I will continue to play as long as they're cranking out new ones.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Half naked, gorgeous men, dirty dancing. That says it all in my opinion. It was enough for me to pay to see it - twice.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The premise of the book is a series of interviews with survivors of a great Zombie war.<br /><br />The world was quickly overrun with zombies. They bite living humans; those humans eventually die and become zombies themselves. The only way to kill them is to separate their brains from their bodies. Nothing else can kill them<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing is so unimaginative and cliched that all interviews roughly sound the same.<br /><br />Each short story has a dramatic arc and builds up to end in some cool twist. But, you see them coming a mile ahead.<br /><br />Also, the author plays to just about every racial and stereotype there has been. So, all Japanese people are hierarchical and nerds, the Indian characters have to bring up the caste system, the Americans are too busy to notice what's going on and all their kids are overmedicated, etc....<br /><br />The overall feel is that of a bad hollywood action movie, not a book.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Lots of laughs and emotions. Adam Sandler, as always, was hilarious. Great movie for parents to watch with their kids. Blah blah blah!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|a must watch<br />can't wait for the next season,<br />please hurry and get this one and doc Martin<br />thank you
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It's part of The Lord of the Rings. I am kinda biased because I love this franchise so much. Would definitely pay to see it again.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|A great who-dunnit with a stellar cast, beautiful staging and photography.  If you like Downtown Abbey, this will become one of your favorites.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I was glued to the screen. This movie is chock full of emotion and drama. It's worth your time to sit and view it.
B000001FK3|5.0|Crazy Mama, where you been so long......damn, I had my black friends diggin' this in 1972. Good music doesn't have boundaries. J.J. was a musical GIANT.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love,love this game.it's additive,fun and keeps me busy.the only thing is that my kindle fire battery dies quickly other then that no complaints.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Good quality edition of this amazing American classic.  Arrived quickly and in good condition. DVD quality did not change from computer to DVD player.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. It is amazing . I play it almost every day . I think every body should have it.
B000TGJ80S|1.0|This movie bears very little similarity to Stoker's fine novel.  A typical Hollywood treatment.  Nothing about this overblown monstrosity works.  Quite simply a piece of garbage trying to find a wide adolescent audience.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We took our kids to see this cool movie when it came out July 9, 2010 in theaters, we all loved it so when it went to video we immediately purchased the DVD! Unfortunately discs do scratch eventually so after so much use it would skip, making it frustrating to view. My son has an iPad and wanted to watch this movie on it while on a roadtrip, so I rented it first from iTunes and after rental expired I found it here $5 cheaper than iTunes! Worth EVERY penny!
1781162646|5.0|King has a great way of painting the picture with incredible detail so the story is fully illustrated in one's mind ... The simplicity becomes complex in an instant and you get to the stage where you don't want it to end. Great job by the master, lets hope CBS don't get their poxy hands on it.
034580709X|3.0|I was absolutely ecstatic when I found out earlier this year that Jo Nesbo's The Bat would finally be available in the U.S.  It saved me from ordering it from the U.K. or Canada or even Australia.  But I was even more ecstatic when I received a galley copy of the book from the publisher (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group) before its actual U.S. release date.<br /><br />The Bat is the first book in the Inspector Harry Hole series and the latest to be released in the U.S.  Inspector Harry Hole from the Oslo Crime Squad is sent to Syndey, Australia to assist in the murder investigation of a young Norwegian woman, who is minor television celebrity in his homeland.  However Harry soon finds out that he is to be a mere observer and to look at his time in Australia as a vacation.  However as the investigation progresses Harry finds himself more and more involved in solving the murder or as he discovers murders.<br /><br />It took some time to get into The Bat as there wasn't much mind blowing action going on.  I started to get into the novel around chapter 20, then it started t wane again.  The novel gives a tremendous amount of background on Harry.  His youth.  His problem with drink.  Previous relationships.  Family, etc.  It's also heavy on cultural anthropology -- the legends and myths of the Aborigines.  It was great information and a lot of it.  Unfortunately all of this background did not really help to move the plot forward.  If anything it slowed it down.<br /><br />The title The Bat is taken from an aboriginal belief that \\"the bat is the Aboriginal symbol of death\\" (TB 50), which is quite apropos since the police are not only investigating one murder as originally thought but several murders across Australia.<br /><br />Suspects are plentiful as well as racial tension between the aborigines and whites and some there is some homosexuality.  There's sex, drugs, drink, a bar fight and other stuff; which all make for a great murder mystery, but for some reason it never really all comes together to make that great murder mystery.<br /><br />This was my first introduction to reading Nesbo and I can tell that he is a strong writer and I look forward to reading the other Inspector Harry Hole novels.  If you're a serial purist like I am and have to start with the first book, then I definitely say start with this as it gives great Harry Hole background.  If you're not than you might want to skip it.<br /><br />And for all you serial purists it looks like The Cockroaches, the second Inspector Harry Hole  novel will be out later this year.r really all comes together to make that great murder mystery.<br /><br />This was my first introduction to reading Nesbo and I can tell that he is a strong writer and I look forward to reading the other Inspector Harry Hole novels.

B003NX75B8|5.0|I wish that we knew what happened to the gay Will Grayson! Very enjoyable book besides that fact. Loved it.
B00A3K2PZA|3.0|Very adult film not for children. This is a Very dark comedy.Police detective,hitman for hire. Seemly white trash like disfunctional family. One scene is very hard to watch. Favorite character Dottie she is excellent in her simplicity.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The variety and depth of the characters, descriptions of their surroundings and background are wonderful.  I look forward to the next book!
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book was a quick and easy read. I actually liked the story but it is kind of cliche where the boy falls madly in love with the girl over a weekend of sex. I wished that the character's interactions was more than sleeping together and arguing. I am not convinced that a healthy relationship is based on arguments and crazy sex. Sorry but call me old fashioned.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Had a good cast of characters and good story, except it seemed to drag on a bit. Once it got going it was pretty good. Good special effects and plenty of action.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A most excellent series! As a Sherlock Holmes Buff, I have enjoyed the new direction the writers and staff have taken this unlikely duo. I hope this series is around for a long time. The chemistry between the actors combined with refreshing new plots makes this a must-see show.

B008P9M614|5.0|Just what I wanted and is as described. Now whenever I can't find anything worth watching or I have had a stressful day, I just watch an episode or two to escape the daily hum-drum of life. I just wish that House would have gone on for years and years more. I love the House series so much that watching repeats I can pick up on something I didn't notice before and am never bored. House fans will cherish this set.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|In a few words, this app simply does what it promises...And does that in a PERFECT way.<br /><br />UNMISSABLE!<br /><br />P.S. What about an interface upgrade, more in line with Android 4.x? Please!!!

B0090SI582|5.0|The Wolverine review<br /><br />I think I can honestly say I have never seen a comic book movie quite like The Wolverine. This is a new kind of animal.<br /><br />Following the disaster that was Origins to fans even if financially it did well, even star Hugh Jackman has eluded to this it seems  fox decided to go in a VERY different direction to bring the adimantium one back to the big screen and went for something nobody was  quite expecting or quite prepared for, critics or fans, which is probably the reason why opinion on it is so very split at this current time and will continue to be so no doubt, but it makes for something far more interesting and engaging in the comic book movie world.<br /><br />It is a far more cerebral, adult and intreverted comcic book film than any other Xmen, Marvel or hell even any comic book movie to date, actually delving into the hero's psyche unlike any we have seen with maybe the exception of Batman Begins, seeing what is actually going on inside his head,  motivating him (or at the start of the movie de-motivating him!) to do and say what he does. This is a risky and bold direction for a summer blockbuster to go in forgoing, mostly, the usual big bang for your buck ideas that put bums on seats, this is<br />one for fans of the character more than most comic book movies, but for most of this unusual ride James Mangold steers the ship on a an exhilirating, beautiful and down write brutal ride only once or twice coming close to the rocks.<br /><br />It is true, like many other Marvel films (Magneto aside) there is no great villain unearthed here, the main antagonists are well done, have suitable motivation to do what they do and serve the story well but again not on the level that the DC movie universe can boast to date, but this  is becuase Logans greatest battle is with his own demons, or within his own head to be more precise. This is another pointer to the conclusion that this is not a typical CBM, it is not a battle of good v evil with millions of lives at stake but just one, his own.<br />As the film starts, Logan has the claws but he does not know in which direction to point them, a stray animal with no master.<br /><br />But for the lack of an outstanding enemy there are two outstanding allies, enter Yukio, and later Mariko, one a whirling dervish of an assassin, flame  haired and a great foil to Logans rough and brooding nature and the other the heir apparent and a breath of fresh air to the CBM world, a new beauty to tame the beast. Both are expertly played by Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto. Both are first timers. Both have a greater impact than some established actors in other comic book movies. Both must surely return.<br /><br />Ah yes the difficult third act, a sticking point for many a film, how to go out with a flourish, to leave everyone wanting more or closure to<br />the proceedings before it, in truth, as well documented the Wolverine does end on familiar territory but no worse than what he<br />have seen before from the likes of Ironman or The Avengers, its just a reminder that we were watching a comic book movie all along<br />even though it felt like something else before, something evolved, a different kind of animal.<br /><br />There are other drawbacks and misteps however, but they are few, Viper hisses and spits but never really bites, Harada is the dark mystery<br />potential that remains that way, never evolving from it, potential lost. Thankfully they do not eat up much screen time or hurt the bigger<br />picture.<br /><br />So overall to the score or rating of the wolverine and it was not an easy one, it has taken two viewings to fully explore everything in this film, as the first was such a shock to the system so unexpected, so very different to what came before to take it all in in one sitting was immpossible.<br /><br />There are new things tried here, risks taken and cliches avoided and for the most part they work together unlike<br />any other before it, of course this means that there is greater chance for things to go wrong but they are few and far between and worth paying the price for to finally have the wolverine film fans have always craved since his first appearance all the way back in x1.<br /><br />This isnt you normal comic book movie<br /><br />But then this isnt your normal comic book hero<br /><br />This is THE WOLVERINE!<br /><br />9/10
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Can't wait for the next levels. I do recommend this app for any enjoying hidden object games and puzzles.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup: Chromecast on front (AUX) HDMI port of Onkyo AV Receiver TX-NR515 to Panasonic Viera TC-L47ET5 (everything purchased from Amazon)<br /><br />Pros: Excellent TV picture and sound with Netflix and YouTube<br />  Convenient program/movie selection via iPad<br />  $35 price tag cheap even without Netflix Promotion<br />  Free shipping with Amazon Prime<br /><br />Cons: Cannot set up Chromecast (yet?) from iOS device<br />  Cannot cast tabs from Chrome on iOS devices<br />  Chromecast doesn't pick up my WiFi from rear HDMI port of the Onkyo AV Receiver<br />  Amazon delays 5-7 days to email the Netflix Promotion Code (for earliest purchasers)<br />  Apps on iOS so far limited to Netflix and YouTube<br />  Google-supplied HDMI extender cable only inches long and too short to relocate Chromecast device from rear of AV Receiver to  front In order to pick up WiFi signal.<br /><br />Experience: I managed to set up my Chromecast, but not without a few time consuming issues.  First came the unwelcome surprise that I could not set it up from the Chrome browser on my iPad.  I had to use a Mac or Windows computer.  But, my iMacs are upstairs, and my entertainment system is downstairs...TILT!  Ah, but we do happen to have an older MacBook running OS X 6.8.  So, I hauled it downstairs and installed Chrome on it for the setup.  OOPS! The setup requires OS X 7 (Lion) or later.  So, I tried, anyway, and despite the on-screen warnings, it worked...well, sort of at first.  Next, one must read the step-by-step directions carefully, especially the one to switch the WiFi network on the computer to the one running on the virgin Chromecast device.  OK, check! My Chromecast at that point was plugged into HDMI slot #5 in back of the Onkyo AV Receiver, and I had swiveled the receiver around 90° so that the Chromecast device was visible to me and to the WiFi source, apparently.  So, eventually the setup worked, that is until I turned the Onkyo AV Receiver back to its normal position such that the Chromecast dongle (even using the short extender that is supplied) was behind the receiver.  It was no longer able to pick up my WiFi signal in that position.  No real worry: I just relocated it to the sole front HDMI port of the receiver, and it picked up the WiFi signal easily.  By the way, the HDMI port on the receiver does not supply power to the Chromecast device, so the USB power is required with my setup.  I was able to use one of the two USB ports on my Onkyo receiver for the power source (the other one is used by a WiFi adapter).  Well, everything works now, and with my Logitech Link setup, I can select Chromecast operation by selecting the corresponding programmed icon on the Harmony app.  It should be noted that the extra HDMI and USB ports on the Onkyo TX-NR515 AV Receiver really facilitated the setup as an alternative to plugging the Chromecast directly into the Panasonic TV.  Now I await Google's promise to come up with more apps and to offer an iOS compatible version of Chrome so that I can cast tabs to the TV via the Chromecast device.  At this point, the Chromecast is a toy gadget in progress to becoming a really useful adjunct to my entertainment system, especially since I already have four other ways for playing Netflix and three other ways for YouTube on my TV (Apple TV, Roku, Vizio BluRay Disk Player, and the Viera TV apps themselves).that the Chromecast dongle (even using the short extender that is supplied) was behind the receiver.  It was no longer able to pick up my WiFi signal in that position.  No real worry: I just relocated it to the sole front HDMI port of the receiver, and it picked up the WiFi signal easily.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Can't wait for Avengers 2. Great cast. Creat chemistry. Great everything. Bringing in Joss W. is the best thing Marvel could have done.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|This show is fun and addicting. Yet it's over stereotyped. The awkward girl is not so awkward with the popular click which makes this more of an unpopular but cute show. Still it's addicting in the fun and feel good column. Have fun but don't be serious.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Forget about all the heavy pop and auto tune that you've been listening to lately. Bruno Mars has the voice and the beats go very well with his voice. From &#34;Treasure&#34; to &#34;Money Makes Her Smile&#34;, the album is enjoyable and fun. His lyrics still need a bit of work, but this is definitely a must buy.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Not going to push any spoilers but expect great special effects, plots and twists. Tom Cruise while many look for a way to deflect his success, I find to be a committed actor (we cannot hold the Mission Impossible movies against him).

B007REV4T8|5.0|The Aston Martin is not the only thing back in SKYFALL;  Bond is back.  The last two Bonds were oh hum, but SKYFALL brings back the better script, hotter girls, and a Bond that almost equals Sean Connery.  This Bond can wear a tux without looking like a hick, can pin a girl with his eyes unlike before and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe in scene where he gets his martini at a bar... woman is HOT ! ... and she can actually act.  Watch her face communicate her controlled fear under sexy allure.<br /><br />SKYFALL is for we guys who saw them all in first run theaters because this one has the same result for real fans as the newer STAR TREK movies do for real Trek fans... little touches from the best of the past, and THE CAR too!  This movie is not killed with too much CGI, and the tension is prolonged and motivated.  Of course, in today's world of fear of sexuality, very little feminine skin is on view, a real downer considering the gals available, and it lacks levels of irony and \\"insider\\" wit not seen much today except in Tarantino.  Also, it avoids any political commentary on world tensions (except govt officials who do not believe in intelligence actions) today, and instead has the crazed revenge-seeking lone villain that would be cardboard except for the actor playing it (almost a reprise of his villain in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN).  The real admiration between Bond and M is also a treat in SKYFALL.<br /><br />This is a keeper !
0316056898|3.0|I love Tina fey, and I enjoyed the book-at first.  It was funny- even laugh-out-loud funny At times.  The problem is, I felt like I was talking to someone who turns everything into a joke; someone who uses humor as a coping mechanism.  It gets annoying after a while.  She talked about some deep issues- sexism, racism, homophobia, motherhood- but she turns everything into a joke so it was hard to know when she was being honest.  I know she is a comedienne and is supposed to be funny, but I have read other memoirs by comedians in which they are able to get serious once in awhile.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I found this to be an incredible book for many reason. At times I got tired of the long side stories regarding the history of wars and government, but the writing is amazingly beautiful. I had seen the show and movie already, and could follow it clearly in the book. Although it tllk forever to finish, I'm glad I did and will long remember all of it.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|The interview style of this book put me off before I started reading it. Once I started reading it I didn't want to stop. Many nights yawning and not wanting to put it down at 2 AM, I finished it while on vacation and truly felt the emotions the characters portrayed in the story.
B0033QC0WE|3.0|Prior to buying this, I had the 5th and 9th Symphonies (unfortunately they were both cd's I ripped onto my computer years ago andI don't know which orchestras played either). I'd listened to those about a hundred times each before deciding I needed everything Beethoven had ever written. So I bought this. I don't really like the 5th or the 9th on here (so I won't even try to rate the others). I found that they were played too fast. The recordings are good quality and everything, I just didn't like the way these were played.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I can relate to instances in Lean In in multiple ways and I am glad I now know how to be a better working woman!

B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom is a master storyteller. I love reading his work and when I saw this was out, I couldn't wait to read it! I really didn't know too much about it, but knew it would be great. This book teaches readers so many lessons about the importance of living in the moment and not worrying about what time it is, or what will happen next. One of my favorite parts of the book is this quote:<br /><br />  \\"There is a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />  \\"Why?\\"<br />  \\"To make each one precious.\\"<br /><br />I think this is a perfect summary of the book. I'm not a religious person, but I still think this quote is amazing. We need to remember that each day is a gift, and we aren't guaranteed tomorrow. We should concentrate on today and being with those we love. I highly recommend this book to everyone (:<br /><br />Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is a story of revenge.  You have to know what you are getting into with a Tarantino movie.  Lots of over-the-top violence and gore, off-color humor and bad language.  If any of those are immediate turn offs for you when choosing a movie, don't even think about this one.  You will hate it.  If you can accept those things, and you like his other films, you will very likely love this one.<br /><br />As the title reveals the story is split into two parts.  You only get bits and pieces of it in volume 1.  Uma Thurman's character (just called \\"The Bride\\") is beaten and shot during her wedding rehearsal by members of the assassin squad she used to be a member of, lead by the titular Bill.  She awakens from a coma 4 years after and goes after them.  In this volume you are introduced to all the characters (somewhat) although Bill is never shown.  You just hear his voice.  The story kind of jumps around a little (somewhat to the way it did in Pulp Fiction) but it is really not that hard to follow if you pay attention.<br /><br />Volume 1 is actually the more violent and gory of the two films, although there is a lot in both.  The gore however is so extreme it is more tongue in cheek than it is real.  Like chopping off arms and gallons of blood spewing out like a geyser.  It is meant to be more humorous than scary, and is far less believable than what you would get in a horror movie.  Like the title of the review says it is kind of a combination of a western, with the 1970s martial arts films.  Right down to The Bride having to go through tons of subordinates to get to her main target in the climactic fight scene.<br /><br />Whether you like this or not is totally subjective.  If you are a fan of Tarantino's other movies, this is very much in a similar vein. It definitely deserves its R rating, and will not appeal to everyone.  For everyone else though, it is a great story, well acted, funny in parts (although very dark humor) and had lots of action.  If those are the kinds of things that appeal to you, it is definitely worth adding to your collection.e kinds of things that appeal to you, it is definitely worth adding to your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it this is the best game Cuz I'm addicted to the minions in this movie the lair is the best idea ever invented
B0090SI56Y|5.0|I didn't move during this entire film. Right from the start I was pulled in by the depth of the depiction of Wolverine. I've been a fan of Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character from X-Men (2000) onward, but what I wasn't expecting was for him to actually make me an even bigger fan by pushing himself to find new things to say and add nuances to a performance I already enjoy over multiple films. The setting, moving Wolverine to Japan, and the threat Wolverine faces combine to give the film an opportunity to strip the character down to his core elements and see what they can find there. The result is a character pushed farther than he's been pushed so far in this film series. The examination of Wolverine's immortality and his desperation to end the pain that immortality has brought him are beautifully drawn, making this a thinking and feeling action film that has a lot to say about the character and where he finds himself at this point in his life. I also enjoyed the supporting cast of characters. Unlike the other films, for the most part Wolverine is the only mutant around in much of this film and that's an interesting change of pace because it allows the focus to remain on the title character. We are not distracted by other mutants using flashy powers or competing for screen time. Lastly, make sure you keep watching after the credits roll, you'll get a fun treat that definitely shouldn't be missed.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One of the few writers I don't use as filler waiting for new books to come out. Well done. Word.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Just finished watching Oblivion, and wow what a visual master piece. I'm confused on why I did not catch this at the movies. Not sure how they promoted this movie and whether maybe it was just the timing of it's release. So with that said, I wished I could have seen it on the big screen and not on my 42 inches LCD. Tom Cruse did a great job as always, I know some folks may not be Tom Cruse fans, but he makes you believe in the movie. If you have always enjoyed science fiction movies then this is a must see and an add to your personal collection. I can't imagine why any one would give this movie less than 5 stars. I guess there are just people out there that can never be happy. Don't let any of those negative reviewers swayed you from watching this movie. AND don't read any reviews that are spoiler alerts! The story line also adds to the beauty of this movie. Enjoy.

B00D28TNT6|5.0|F. Buttons' third album Slow Focus sounds like music from the future - in a future where SkyNet has won control of an irradiated, uninhabitable Earth, Slow Focus serves as the menacing war anthem of the victors.  The electronic-noise duo have always veered toward the dark underbelly of electronica, and if past albums had their feet dangling in its water, this one finds them diving headfirst into it.  As cold and emotionless as this music can be, it's characterized by a remarkable accessibility: there's not a trace of \\"the human element\\" here, but it's near impossible not to let this music completely consume the space between your ears.<br /><br />Many of the songs on Slow Focus follow a formula, but it's an extremely effective one: songs begin with a motif (such as a drum beat or a synthesizer rhythm) that continues through the duration of the track, and melodies, rhythms, and other noises are heaped on top.  This technique creates music that is both static and quite dynamic.  With most tracks running longer than 6.5 minutes, F. Buttons give their songs enough room to breathe and grow.  The album opener, \\"Brainfreeze\\" might be the most representative of the album as a whole.  The song begins with a propulsive drum loop that gives way to layers of distorted synthesizers, but a dramatic chord shift in the second half of the \\"Brainfreeze\\" forgets everything that came before it.  These abrupt changes are particularly unsettling because they contradict the previously mechanical (and seemingly automated) rhythms that make up the bulk of Slow Focus.  It's as if F. Buttons wants you to get comfortable in their sound-space but not too comfortable.<br /><br />Slow Focus is the darkest and most cohesive record F. Buttons have ever released.  With only 7 tracks lasting under an hour, Slow Focus never outwears its welcome.  Although there are no ever-changing melodies or vocals, this album commands the attention and imagination of its listeners.  Listeners who find themselves more at ease in the company of technology than puny humans will enjoy this trip down dystopian alleyways.  Slow Focus isn't bound by its genre trappings either: anyone who enjoys a nice musical atmosphere (from Sigur R&oacute;s to Liars to Swans) ought to find something here to love.  Because this record is so densely layered, this music is best served through a set of headphones rather than a car stereo or laptop speakers.  If Slow Focus is any indication of the direction F. Buttons (or humanity) is going, I, for one, welcome our robot overlords.re at ease in the company of technology than puny humans will enjoy this trip down dystopian alleyways.

B005UKK4Y2|3.0|Watched it for the first time last night, and thought that I would like it a lot more than I did, probably because of the cast.  They were all great, and they did have good chemistry.  I just didn't think that it was that funny, there were a couple of laughs, but it could have been SO much better.  Trust me, I'm not a prude, but a lot of the coarse language that they used, just wasn't necessary.  Bridesmaids was way better, and we recently watched Admission, which was also very good.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|Isn't that what we want from Woody?  Yeah, it's his best work in some years.  One of those films where he manages to withdraw his own personality to a distance, where there's no character obviously speaking the \\"Woody\\" part.  That part's been done over the years with varying results by Kenneth Branagh, Will Ferrell, Larry David, and others.  But when he vanishes all together, when there's just his characters, speaking in all their poignant screwed-up humanity, who needs the nebbish wise-cracking about how meaningless life is?<br /><br />Some of the critics seem to see this movie as a scathing indictment of capitalism in general, Wall St in particular, an unbridgeable gap separating its tony, well-to-do characters and its scruffy middle class ones.  What it actually is about is the perils of living a life based on pretense and deception, where the only ones who claim happiness in the end are those comfortable in their own skin, no matter how modest their means.  Cate Blanchett is by turns, heart-breaking and appalling in her narcissistic ravings. Equally memorable in a very different part is Sally Hawkins, the sister whose world Jasmine descends into, bringing the sort of moral and comedic chaos we've come to expect from the master.  (Woody previously used her to great effect in a small part in [[ASIN:B0013D8LC2 Cassandra's Dream]]).<br /><br />I feared going in, having read that this was among Woody's darker visions, that there would be little to like in its characters, that their own self-absorption would keep the audience at arm's length.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is in his darker works .[[ASIN:B0013D8LC2 Cassandra's Dream]],[[ASIN:1417082658 Match Point]],[[ASIN:B00005KIT3 Crimes and Misdemeanors]]) that he crafts his most endearing and enduring characters.  Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|4.0|Having read this book before, I found the story intriguing, drawing me into identifying with the characters and the troubles they were living.  My wife had not read the book and went into our viewing with a simple knowledge that it was about the killing of a bunch of kids, so was skeptical about it.  She did not enjoy it.  Bottom line - it will appeal to some, not to others.

B00004XPPC|5.0|A movie I have seen a number of times over the years. It was on cable TV around Memorial Day and got DVR'd and we watched it last night.<br /><br />The movie itself is well made. It manages to convey the horrors of a Japanese POW camp well, including the desirability of escape into the jungle, even if that is likely a choice that leads to death.<br /><br />Sir Alec Guiness plays a British colonel who is the senior officer in a POW camp. He is more than a little unbalanced, and does not mesh well with the Japanese POW camp commander.  Their battle of wills is the focus of the story.<br /><br />William Holden plays an American POW who eventually escapes and then is coerced into returning to blow up the bridge the British colonel has his men build for the Japanese.<br /><br />It seems unlikely to me that a senior British officer during WWII would actively collaborate with the enemy in the way this movie depicts, nor would his officers have gone along with it willingly, but it would not be much of a movie if they didn't.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game will challenge your patience if you like to start a game off slow so that you can get used to it. However, if you like a game that will challenge you right from the beginning, you will enjoy this game immensely. The minions are adorable and it is hard not to love them from the beginning.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game blows every other wannabe indie jrpg out of the water. More content, more funny, more badass.  I mean you seriously go from fighting ninja Santa Claus to pillaging the Seven Dwarves' hideout to having Gandalf yell You Shall Not Pass! at you all in the course of about ten minutes and that's less than a tenth of a percent of the awesome.  Easily worth three times the price.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|As usual, another great read from Khaled Hosseini. Sad, at times but always very insightful.  He brings to words the complex family dynamic; the boundless love between parent and child, brother and sister, brother to brother; the constant struggle between what is right for the individual versus what is right for the family. Very moving.

I had a busy day Thursday. But early evening I read online that the Netflix promo had ended.<br />I've never had Netflix and always wanted to try it since my friends are always talking about Arrested Delvelopment and Netflix content. I went to Amazon, Google Play and then Best Buy. I saw on Best Buy you could still purchase online if a store had it in stock and the free 3 months of Netflix was also still on the page. I checked the store near my house and it said it was unavailalbe. I looked at other stores and they were really far away. So the rest of the night I didnt think or feel bad that I couldn't buy a chromecast. After midnight I took a shower and went back to Best Buy's web site and brought up the list of stores that come up with my zip code. I saw a store in a part of town where I had to go on Sat to a birthday party at night. I got out my credit card and the purchase went through. One Friday I was hopeful that I would still be able to pick up the Chormecast since I got an email that my order was ready to pick up! FInally Sat came and I left 2 hours early for the birthday party and took my tablet with me. When I went to the pick up counter they had my Chromecast in a sealed box and the woman said they had been out of them since Weds. I told here how I bought mine after midnight Fri morning when I guess they added inventory to that Best Buy. I have the Samsung Galaxy tab2 7\\" that I purchased last Sept 2012. I went to the Samsung Store inside Best Buy and was given some help on how to conserve my battery.<br />Everyone at Best Buy was wonderful.<br /><br />Now I came home from the birthday party at midnight and plugged in the Chromecast into the HDMI port and power supply to my usb port next to my HDMI port on my Samsung TV I bought last year at Best Buy. I then went to the web site theTV screen told me to go to on my tablet and it downloaded Chromecast.i also had my notebook ready since I knew from reading reviews that I was going to need to enter my passcode for my reuter. And that was easy.  I went to my youtube app and the video didnt play. After 10 mins I decide to go back to look at what info was in the Chromecast app.<br />It listed Netflix, Youtube and Google Play. I clicked on youtube and it asked if I wanted to open it or install. I clicked on install and magic happen. All I needed was the lastest version of Youtube and I was able to stream perfectly 1080 HD video to my TV!<br /><br />After watching a few videos on my TV I decicde to see how you can go to any web site while streaming. I went to my email and found 2 emails from Best Buy. One confirming my order was picked up and a 2nd with info on my free code for 3 months of Netflix. I went to the Netflix app and installed the lastest version. Then I created a user name and passcode and  needed no credit card to start up Netflix. WIthin a few minutes I looked at all the content and then decicded to stream the pilot of Arrested Development. It was my 1st time seeing the show and I'm hooked on the show and to my Chromecast.<br /><br />I got really lucky not just getting the Chromecast from Best Buy but still getting for free 3 months of Netflix! I'm over the moon since my Samsung Tablet 2 7\\" had no way to stream and now I can watch endless youtube and Netflix at least for the next 3 months. I hope this doesnt cut into my time working out at the gym and all my other sports I play. Lol.<br /><br />Try Best Buys web site before they take down the Netflix promo. Hope this review helps someone. Get back to me with questions or comments if you'd like. Thanks for reading!
B00C0W08XK|5.0|This is  very delightful sudoku game with four difficulties you can play a game no mater how tired your brain is at the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|.this  game is just simply fun. Was hard to get started but once we got the gang of it, it became fun.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|This is a good rss reader replacement for Google Reader, but I do have 1 major problem with it. It does not have podcast download support. Other than that, I like it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I am having a blast playing Uno on this app. Just wish it had unlimited playtime, other than uno gets a five super star!
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|The interface takes some getting used to but, otherwise I am enjoying it. The search database is a little bit limited, but it has found nearly every show I asked for. I would recommend it to others.
B009KHCT94|4.0|There's not a lot of there here, but you don't really want a lot of plot and substance messeng up a good schlock piece like this do you?  It's got moon Natzis!  What ELSE do you want?
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|It's a very good album. The CD has a lot of great catchy beats and great dance tunes. The songs have great messages. Successes and failures in love that make and break people down. \\"Come and Get It\\" is really catchy and has a lot of replay value.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Mr. King's book is mostly about Mr. King, which is cool because it confirmed a lot of things I had guessed about him from reading his books over the years.  I've probably read everything he's ever written, except for Salem's lot, which I'm reading now.  Anyway, the part that's actually about writing is not all that groundbreaking, but it's honest, and that's what I've always loved about Stephen.  Even when he lies he's honest.  He actually managed to inspire me to dust off one of the twenty or so manuscripts I have sitting around. It's not that he convinced me that I can do it, he just convinced me that it doesn't matter.  It's time to put some rejection slips on the nail.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a fun game very addictive and small altho it has some flaws the game is awsome download this game
1607066017|5.0|If you're not reading this series, you clearly don't like yourself very much.  Do yourself a favor and pick up Saga.  I'm not really into graphic novels.  I've made an exception.<br /><br />Volume 2 is in the mail.  Can't wait!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is for anyone who is a fan of the movie and looking for a fun and addictive game
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Best game ever u won't regret getting it  case it is awesome I love it but there is one problem the game has levels so u can't play forever
1401201911|4.0|I'm really not a fan of Superman at all, but the Red Son was very good. This has to be my favorite alternate realty of a Superman series... since this the only one I've read/heard about. The art is great, the characterization is fantastic. I have to say overall I loved everything about this. I am giving it 4 stars though because it was a bit predictable at times, there were parts in there where they could have done something just to throw you off guard, but didn't. That is my only gripe really. Again overall I loved this.
B0013K1ALE|4.0|Writing this while watching the DVD. Sound is nice. I'm more of a purist for concert videos. I want to see the band perform. Some of the \\"extra\\" clips while the band is performing is interesting-but it turns the concert video into a movie. Just show the band-Jimmy Page is the genius behind this band so let's see the guitar player play!! Love Zep-Saw them in \\"75.  The music is wonderful. At least they didn't do the cut-cut-cut-cut every 10 seconds that you see in a lot of concert videos that have been shot recently.
B002V092M4|5.0|This book and Smiley's People are in my opinion the best espionage stories written. I read them again and again because there are so many little nuances which are easy to skip over.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I like it,  4 stars, a much better holster than others I have used. I recommend this holster to any one.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Best app. I love this app and it's very easy to use!! And i highly recommend this for people who love to do scrap books and who want to do something fun!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app to put my two year old to sleep.  I love att the.customize options.  it usually puts me to sleep also, so relaxing!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  Fun game.  Interesting, but not so hard you get bored.  Kept my interest with its fairly quick pace.
B0018QPPXW|3.0|Not extremely impressed. But a good cheap buy to see how Tom Cruise got his start in the movie industry.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Tired lackluster attempt, some flashy special effects but joy much else.  BW appears to be just going through the motions this time
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Sometimes i buy games that are interesting, and after a while they're too hard for me too figure out, or even too easy to make. Halfway thru you have to pay 2.99 to finish the rest of the game, but trust me, it is TOTALLY worth it!! It was so fun and entertaining that i wanted to finish it in one day, and i did. Usually with the others i stop, but with this game i really wanted to figure why everything happened and stuff. DEFINITE recommendation!
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Pretty strong first couple songs.  Then unfortunately, it kind of slows down for the remaining five or six songs.  Definitely worth the purchase price though.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00E6D4HHO X-Men: The Adamantium Collection (Limited Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br />The Adamantium Collection<br /><br />Own the ultimate limited-edition gift set created for the ultimate X-Men fan! The Limited Edition Adamantium Collection Gift Set features an exclusive tribute to Wolverine's adamantium claws -- reflecting Logan's e...xtraordinary strength and power -- along with all 6 X-Men movies -- including The Wolverine available for the first time -- PLUS an all-new bonus documentary.<br /><br />I know what you're thinkin', bub. Question is, can I get Wolverine before he turns me into shishkabob with those claws? Well, bub, seein' as how these claws are adamantium, the strongest metal known, and can slice through vanadium steel like a hot knife through butter, buddy, you gotta ask yourself. Do I feel lucky? My name is Wolverine. I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice. *SNIKT*
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great twists and turns.  Ne er know who to trust, what is true.  Couldn't put it down till I finished it.
0553805371|5.0|A brilliant mind discusses the important events of  history and an insight into why the universe is the way it is, and why there is something instead of nothing.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Add me to the thrilled list. It works with CTIA headset without or with an adapter, which was unexpected but cool. Nice to have the boost for the car, and for high impedence IEC earphones (like HeadDirect RE0). Don't know that I'll velcro it to the Galaxy, but it _is_ a thought. Works great with the Sansa Clip Plus that it _is_ velcro'd to. No complaints at all, only praise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app on my kindle lets me have more  fun than any other game on it! It is totally awesome!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Overall, it's pretty good. I love that they've already fixed some of the things people commented on, like allowing pencil marks and fitting on the screen. Two things I think are still missing:<br />1) it would be great to be able to easily pull up the standard min-max sum chart.  Most paper versions I've seen include that chart, and without having it in the app, I'm just going to write it out myself anyway, so saving me the trouble would be awesome.<br />2) it would be great to be able to turn on an option to show a running total, eg when I select a square the current sum would pop up next to the goal sum in row and column.<br /><br />Finally, I don't know how other people solve these, but I prefer to line up my pencil marks rather than have then in a set location, so when I mark, eg, 3,5/4,2 I know that the three goes with the four and the two goes with the five.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game was awesome and it has a great storyline and even after you finish the game it's still fun so get this game
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I would have given this app a perfect 5 were it not for requirement imposed by gameloft to spend real money in order to full level up the upgrades
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting and has a numerous amount of levels for hours of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's a great game for when you bored, tired, sick. And it secretly exercises your mind in a way that's fun for everyone.
