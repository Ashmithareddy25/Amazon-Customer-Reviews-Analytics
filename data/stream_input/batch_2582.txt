B00DBSZEH2|5.0|When I first saw the trailer I was like... Jeremy renner has sold out... I've been a fan of his since ... Daumer... Which is a very good flick about Jeffrey daumer, any way I really thought that this movie was going to be lame ?? I was soooo wrong . If you go into this flick without the intentions of thinking of a fairy tale movie then don't watch !! This is a fun action pact with some actually some good gore effects and the witches are really cool to watch , not a bad story and the acting is good , so if u are looking for a fun movie this is a sleeper gem .
B003S898SG|5.0|Another German metal band BUT with aggressive Metal  tendencies from the progressive side of life. And yes, you can understand the lyrics.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really liked this book. Am now looking for more on this subject / more by this author. Had heard the phrase &#34;Orphan Train&#34; before but never knew what it meant until I read this book. Very Good...
B006MGC3VK|5.0|As with their past CD's, this band has its own unique sound. bluesy with a touch of jazz into a molten metal groove.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and I was hooked from page one. The story was captivating and I could not put it down. Will definitely read more of her stories!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I am hoping Connelly keeps writing about Harry Bosch. He has his weaknesses, but don't we all? Very enjoyable read.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|There is much more action, suspense and intelligence packed into these three movies than is necessary for me to totally be a fan of the series.  Hope they do some more.  This is Damon's forte, for sure.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't help myself, I have to know how it ends. The writing is ok, the story is fine, but I'm in it now.
B002O2THVA|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, and will probably see it several more times over the years.  What was appealing to me was the time lapse.  From the beginning, when the young lawyer comes to town to the very end where the older and successful lawyer returns for the funeral of a good friend.<br /><br />There is a lot of meaning in this film and I highly recommend it, especially to those who may have seen it when they were younger and may need to see it again now that they are older.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|This was one of the better seasons in my opinion, great cast, good plots, I hope we will have more seasons following.
B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie, totally up to date with what is going on today.  Based on a comic book yes, appropriate? Yes, and very well acted.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|I can't say whether or not the life in the Corps is portrayed accurately but overall it's a good story.
B000286RJI|5.0|I need kill Bill 2 because I already had volume number 1. I like the kill Bill movies. I think there awesome movies. Thanks.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|Great tunes, this a good buy for all Florence/The Machine fans. The entire CD is a bargain and gets quite a bit of play time at my house. My son is a new fan now because of this CD and half the time I have to get it from him as he seems to have taken possession since it's arrival.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've been reading James Altucher's blog \\"The Altucher Confidential\\" at http://www.jamesaltucher.com for a while now and like it enough that, as soon as I found out that James had published \\"Choose Yourself\\" I clicked over here and grabbed and read it right away.<br /><br />I already knew it would be smart and funny in a humble way and, above all, really useful.<br /><br />\\"Choose Yourself\\" is written in a way that is easy and fun and smart. Another thing I love about it is that James shares that he has figured out how personally to extricate himself from enough difficult personal experiences that he has personally acquired and can impart some of the kind of wisdom that I formerly associated mostly just with folks like the Lubavitcher Rebbe and Viktor Frankl.<br /><br />What I liked most about reading the book \\"Choose Yourself,\\" apart from the engaging style, is that all of the ideas in it are fully compatible with the (admittedly wholly made up, but treasured nevertheless) religious beliefs that are at the core of my life. A key element in being Jewish is understanding that a motivated individual can make real, positive changes both in his or her life and in the world. One of my favorite Hasidic teachings says that every person should carry two pieces of paper, one in your right hand pocket and the other in your left. On one of the pieces, you write the verse \\"I am but dust and ashes.\\" On the other piece, you write a very different verse \\"Bishvili nivra haolam / For my sake the world was created.\\"<br /><br />I believe that to be guided by both of those statements and keep those two opposing truths in balance is the challenge, that, when met, can lead me to success in my life. I believe that on one hand, our lives and our troubles and accomplishments are part of a much larger whole happening in the world, but each time I get flooded with pride over my own success, then it's time to pull out that slip of paper that says, \\"you are but dust and ashes\\" and put some of that hubris in perspective. We're human. The goal is not to do everything perfectly right, it's to continue to be in the game, to keep figuring out how to put my precious time into things that really matter. I've been grappling with how to do this and James' Daily Practice presents a doable means of accomplishing it for me.<br /><br />Plus, more generally, the ideas in \\"Choose Yourself\\", in the most direct way I can imagine, support the truth of the popular saying that \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" - which, each time it comes to mind, invariably conjures up an image for me of God in the guise of some adoring Jewish grandmother, heaping extra slices of smoked sturgeon onto the plate of a person at an abundantly spread buffet table, who is ALREADY helping himself to as much as he likes of whatever he likes.<br /><br />THIS book spells out the exact, many quite simple though not always so easy, things that probably pretty much anyone, anywhere, can do to ensure he or she will have more \\"smoked sturgeon on their plate\\" than they could possibly imagine even wanting and floods a reader like me with long-awaited hope.<br /><br />I also watched a video of a promotional talk that James Altucher did for this book and I also found that helpful, so I posted links to the book and the video on Facebook because I can't think of anyone I know who could NOT get hope and benefit from exposure to James' thinking. And here's what I personally liked most about James Altucher's video presentation: his explanation of what it means to \\"get to yes\\" - as I understood James, getting to yes means simply to stimulate the other party to make any offer at all, then immediately to say an unqualified \\"yes\\" to that offer (almost regardless of its nature).<br /><br />Why did that stand out for me so much? Because, in my own life, I experience as profoundly frustrating the fact that I often find myself hemmed in with \\"no.\\" This \\"just say yes\\" idea has really got me thinking about whether I oughtto alter at least a part of my core belief system in order to gain more freedom in my life. And any shift in perspective can be considered a miracle. So I'm confident that the ideas I've just read will work miracles in my life now. You might like reading the book, too - even if what you get out of it is entirely different from what it said to me!<br /><br />And if you want the book for free, just prove to James that you've read it and he'll refund your cash or donate it to \\"Women For Women International\\" for you. Can't say fairer than that, can you? I call that generous.to alter at least a part of my core belief system in order to gain more freedom in my life.

B002KKCVT6|5.0|I normaly wear 9,5. After reading reviews ordered half size up (10) and they fitted well. Look durable and the price is great.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Very cute love story.  Wish there was more of a storyline concerning their interaction prior to the end of her time in the house with him.  Just seemed like there could have been more there.  Also, why do they delete scenes?  Those deleted scenes are exactly what I said was missing.  Good movie over all.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, but I still think the original was better. It inspired me to re-watch the original, which I have on DVD, as well! The music and dancing was great in both of the movies, but the dancing is more  provocative in this newer version as are the &#34;kids.&#34; I don't think it needed that to carry the story, but maybe it does need it to attract today's audiences. I dunno.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|good price<br />good quality<br />excellent time for delivery<br /><br />it is exactly as described, a great deal for your money, i would buy again from this brand.

1419387243|4.0|Dear Reader,<br />The book is written as a group of letters. It is a personal look at the mind and like of a young man named Charlie. I liked it and I hope you like it too.<br />Sincerely,<br />Me<br />PS. Some very adult themes so not for little ones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just couldn't stop reading it - so much better than the movie!  A complete emotional experience from start to end.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season was full of shockers!!!  I really hated to see the season end.  The last episode was really a total surprise.  I'm so looking forward to the next season.
B001MM28JG|5.0|What fun!  Tim Allen and the rest will enlighten you, delight you, and take you away into the nether regions of the universe with adventure, laughs and a real sense of being a apart of this movie. It is an engrossing and entertaining way to spent a couple of hours.  Buy it and enjoy:-)
B005MLOKXA|5.0|What can you say about this drama, but kudos for wonderful entertainment, enough diversity of story line, inclusive of the upfront and back drop drama that endures.
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|I just got stuck in the airport and found this delightful movie to take me away.  It is a must for all romantacists.  The scenery is magnificent and the actors top notch with Hitchcock mixed in you just can't lose; Buy it and enjoy...
B007C8MK2Y|5.0|The music on this cd is beautiful.  If you get this music cd then you must get the dvd (Yanni-Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico) which is absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />If you love Yanni's music, you'll love this cd!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its so cool. I've tried so many creatures.latest I tried was the Jersey devil. the one I'm trying to find out is so hard so I have to keep putting portals. it looks like an  old moth-like rotten green dragon and it has buck teeth and its lower body looks like a kangaroo. if anyone knows please please please tell me! I really want to know. thanks!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I want to add my name as one of those upset by the way Disney handled this release.  The one disk version of OZ 3D is a total rip off.  First, we do not know how long 3D Blu Rays will be around. I heard new 3D tvs were in development that did not require 3D glasses. We also do not always want to watch a movie in 3D. And watching it in 3D requires everyone in the room to have glasses.<br /><br />The other thing that ticks me off is that when Blu Rays were first introduced they tried to encourage us to by them not only because of the superior picture but also because Blu Rays will contain more extra features.  THIS 3D BLU RAY HAS ZERO EXTRA FEATURES - ZERO!  Why is it the 2D version or DVD that have all the extra features?<br /><br />I am giving this a 1 star to discourage Disney or any other disc manufacturer from going this route.  Lots of angry people Disney - stop it with the greed! Regular price $45 for one disc with no special features?
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I'm not much of a writer so let me just say that this series was all I was seeking in a tv show. DOesent hurt that the lead character is a knockout, either.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|I absoloutely LOVE the Original Star Trek series! My Dad actually got me into it when I was a young teenager. We used to watch Star Trek every week late night while they ran it in repeats. Eventually they stopped showing it altogether and soon, as life changed as I got older, I began to forget all about it. But then, one day I decided to look it up on Amazon just to see if it was available. To my delightful surprise, it was. And so, being the fan we both are, I ordered it. I'm still watching it. It sure feels good to see Kirk, Spock and the whole gang once again. Thank you so much. Robert Cockerham
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is one of the worst I have tried, it took forever to download only 38% of a video that was 2 minutes and 30 seconds long. Then, it asked me to sign in and submit control of my account to an address I didn't recognize. Don't buy this app.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love this movie for the music, the fast movement, the actors and the relationships between them feel real.  The story line is fun fun fun.  Robert Downey Jr. is perfect and having a great time.  It moves. (and the music is great)
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I am so glad I downloaded this classic book. A great read, that I could not wait to get back to.<br />A classic tale, with adventure, classic quotes and pirates a'plenty!<br />Loved it!
B00CL50KDY|5.0|I love the movie . we have seen it about 5 or 7 time we all get a kick out of it
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I gave this 5 stars due to the visual story telling. The movie starts out in black and white as does the old Wizard of Oz but it has a sense of charm even though it is a small box screen at first. As the story progresses, the screen widens and the colors become so vibrant and beautiful! Loved the story behind the wizard! This was great as we rented this online and streamed it through the PC to the large flat-screen with use of HDMI and the quality was excellent! Very pleased with the Amazon movie streaming! This is the second movie we have streamed and we plan on many more!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I LOVE this show., its one of my very favorites and Im happy that I had the option to catch up on missed episodes with this option.
1781162646|4.0|Although this is much shorter than a typical Stephen King novel it is still a very enjoyable story.  It's a fast read - I finished it in two sessions.  This is Stephen King through and through.  If you like his work then you will probably like this one.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|If you like romance, action, and plagues, this is the book for you. Reading this, I noticed it was a little bit like the book Reached, by Alley Condie. Do not listen to the one star people because even if some of it is true, it is still totally worth reading.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I didn't think this movie was really worth any Oscars, kind of cheesie, more for those who enjoy the N word and decent bloody shootings.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|i like it a lot was looking for more action from Foxx, but all in all it was a very good movie and it is alwys nice to see actors out of their nomal roles. ( well some of them i should say).
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I enjoyed the books, but the movie was cheesy. The storyline was completely changed, many characters were missing, and characters were poorly developed.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fun game. Need to let you make more aquariums! Really enjoying it!  Hope they will update to include more aquariums!  They did provide lots of puzzles!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very User friendly. Challenging as levels progress. A must have addition for any tablet games collection. Extremely addictive in nature.
B000000JO3|5.0|No need to be a stupid angry kid to enjoy this.<br />I still get a kick out of this collection as a stupid angry adult.<br />But those truly were the salad days...<br /><br />And if you've never heard of Minor Threat, your in for a real old school treat...enjoy.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Typical Hollywood B-Grade (did you see the wires the witch was suspended from while riding her broom?) plonk for teens, tweens, and twenty-somethings. Shallow, predictable (who didn't know the red-head was a witch 10 minutes in?), and confused. I'm not sure if the director was trying to make a Kung-Fu movie, a Fairy-tale, or a revenge movie. In any event, he failed on all three counts. Wait for it to come out on Netflix so you can watch it for free.
B000002GYI|5.0|I'm the operator with my pocket calculator...and all that...<br />Just fun euro tech nonsense from way back in the day...<br />Also check out &#34;8-bit operator&#34; album...great tribute album to Kraftwerk done in 8bit...but done very well.

B007EE4XKI|3.0|It was too complex for me!<br /><br />Those with degrees in science and an interest in so much detailed explanation might enjoy it more than I did,which is why I gave it 3 stars.<br />It was also just a bit contrived with all the changing of bodies.
B009PLKCEE|4.0|I basically wanted to try and read video files that ES Player or the other one couldn't - it seems like the K-HD-FIRE plays .mp4 files no probs. throw another format at it, and it seems to not be able to cope. This probably requires codecs to be installed. I think the Kindle could be improved if it thought a lot more like a PC. I know it's not a PC. &#34;You should have bought a....&#34; Yeh I know.

B009VIZDLI|4.0|A thoroughly warm and entertaining book. I enjoyed the characters developing as the book went and had a lot of jolly laughs along the way.
0439023513|4.0|This was a fun read, but yellow beams that melt your flesh off and purple lights that send blood spurting out of every orifice?!  It's not the violence that offends me, it's the fact that I'd expect those sort of plot lines out of Calvin & Hobbes or my fifth grade journal, right next to the entry where my vegetables jumped off the lunch tray and held the principal hostage until we sent in the meatloaf crisis response team.  Collin's skill to keep the reader interested in the story despite wanting to punch Katniss in the face is unparalleled.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009LRNH7G The Priest's Graveyard]] [[ASIN:B006DS0KI0 Nonsense]]  [[ASIN:0836218620 Weirdos from Another Planet!]]
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed my time immersed in this book. A Swedish Forrest Gump, but it remained refreshing despite this. I'll be looking for more from this author.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is a book for a quiet and peaceful winter evening, reading it in a comfortable bed surrounded by one's favorite works.  I am a writer, of sorts, published here and there, so I look for style and phrases as well as a very good story.  In places, the writing here is as good as one can find anywhere.<br /><br />Read this one if you have time to relish it, to immerse yourself into it, to live and be lost in its world.  If you are a skimmer who thrives on haste and multitasking, you won't like it.  There is much more to this book than merely a plot;  Diane has woven a small masterpiece.
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Great actors playing great roles! Its a must see for any serious movie lover and I only wish I could have seen on the stage.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|When it comes to adapting classic novels, many pitfalls abound. Fans naturally have their favorite parts and their own impressions of characters. The story is probably too big to be covered comprehensively. Related, films tell stories in different ways from written words so some alterations and abridgements are necessary.<br /><br />This movie version of Jane Eyre is faithful to the book. It follows events mostly in the same order, though the movie begins with her flight from Thornfield Hall. The story before that is inter-cut with her arrival and life with the Rivers family. The settings are quite realistic, with the bleak moors and the dark buildings matching the novel's descriptions. The world of Jane Eyre is well-realized and atmospheric.<br /><br />The plot is a mixture of too much being left in and too much being left out. All the major movements are in this movie: living as a child with her aunt, going to Lowood School, working as a governess at Thornfield Hall, interacting with Rochester, separating from Thornfield and Rochester under fantastic circumstances, living with the Rivers, etc. With only two hours of screen time, a lot of the details are left out of each of these. For instance, Blanche Ingram makes her appearance as a romantic rival for Rochester's affections. He seems to have genuine affection for her in the film but his ultimate choice of Jane has no inciting incident as it does in the book. The gypsy fortune-teller scene is not in the movie and nothing substitutes for the revelations of Blanche's superficiality and Jane's perceptivity. If the film makers had, for example, relegated the Lowood part of the story to a two-minute conversational recap at Thornfield they would have had more time to fully develop this part of the story. As a movie, I don't think it held the story together well enough.<br /><br />The performances are generally good, though I thought Mia Wasikowska was a little too understated as Jane. Jane in the novel has a lot more passion and wit, though perhaps readers have more access to that since the narrative is told by her. In the movie, we are in a third-person narrative without access to her thoughts and feelings except for what the actress shows us. I thought the performance was a bit too reserved. The performance is serviceable but not great. Michael Fassbender is good as Rochester and Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.<br /><br />The movie ultimately feels like a Cliff's Notes version of the book with a couple of pages missing. The deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some of the holes but not all of them. The highlights of the book are in the film but what makes Jane Eyre a great story and her a great character doesn't come across. People who haven't read the book won't see what all the fuss is about; people who have (like me) will make a fuss about what isn't there.

0385344228|1.0|This book was pretty awful - I saw another reviewer describe it as \\"tedious\\" and that's the perfect description.  I bought it thinking it would be an intelligent, dramatic legal novel, but it wasn't.  I brought this on my honeymoon and finished it because there weren't many other books around, but I left it in our hotel library in Vietnam because it really wasn't worth the suitcase space to bring it back.  I'd never recommend this book to anyone.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This is a good movie with a lot of action.  It is typical Die Hard Stuff with some good humor thrown in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate horror movies, yet I LOVE this show.  It is not a horror/zombie show, but rather a show about survivor against zombies.  I have watched each episode 3 or 4 times and I could still watch it again.  Addicting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this whole series. But this book was fantastic. During all three books you become so attached to the characters. During this book you get to see them together happy and you you get to see them have their fights. Their characters stay true  they react perfectly to each situation. It's easy to read which makes it more enjoyable. At the end of this book you get that feeling like well what am I going to do with my life now? I found myself somewhat heartbroken that this was the last book. Everything wraps up wonderfully and you are content except for wanting more...
B00BY8DC2A|3.0|I will take what I can get at this point from The Brand New Heavies. N'Dea Davenport is only on three of the tracks. She rocks on \\"Sunlight\\" and \\"Addicted\\" like she used to do back in the day. Alone they make the CD. BNH with N'Dea 4ever! Some other chick is singing lead vocals on many of the other tracks. What is her name? Who is she? I DON'T CARE. Her voice is not N'Dea's. I suspect the ageing Miss Davenport is making yet another solo attempt beyond BNH. Ugh, I think the sista needs to face the fact that she has fared best with BNH.<br />This CD overall seems a tad bit stuck in the '90s when acid jazz with house flava was really happening. I do like some of the rock elements heard on several of the tracks. Audio tune is also being used here and there. Might that be to just be current? Sounds like the group just released whatever to satisfy the record company. Concept project this ain't. Message project this ain't. \\"Whatever\\" would have served best as the title of the well intended mix of funk, rock and soul. I expected more from these cats. Maybe they toned down to capture the fickle bland US culture. Go figure?
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Typical Bay film.  Shallow characters that you don't really start to care about.  Non-existent story to the movie.  The CGI is the only good thing about the movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|What can I say... its the Dark Knight Trilogy!  At a good price and in a nice BluRay set... its perfect.  I had the first two films already but not in BluRay so this was perfect and the price made it even better.

B009X2CRMK|4.0|This book was really entertaining as it had many unexpected twists and turns.<br />The characters were largely believable, although not always.<br />I enjoyed the continuance ,over time ,of the family and their need to explore the past.<br />An engrossing read with lovely descriptions of the countryside and interactions between even incidental characters,
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I was looking for so long for somthing like it it is everything I wanted I love so much it's the best :) !
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I enjoy this show a great deal. It's one of the few that I have every season of and it makes me happy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The writers have woven a fasinating story that not only can you not come back for more, but you can not take your eyes off the screen for fear of missing an inflection or word that is vital.  Very good and getting better...
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Originally I Bought The A8 6600K And Decided It Wasn't Cut For My Taste! Exchanged It At Fry's Electronics For This Processor Because It Looked And Sounded So Juicy!

B005OYKIJ0|3.0|A decent action flick, but has the &#34;been there, done that&#34; effect. Dwayne looks monster as the federal officer chasing our anti-heroes, Vin DIESEL is a great name for someone acting in a car movie. Not a waste of time.
B002RVCD6O|3.0|This is probably the Harry Potter movie I like the least. I still liked it, just didn't really love it. I've seen all the movies at least once, if not more than that, over the years. I'm now getting my husband to watch the series. He's actually really enjoyed it so far, but he fell asleep during this one. It is just much slower than the others. The action doesn't really start until the last 45 mins of the movie. We had to finish the movie the next day when hubby wasn't so tired anymore.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the best music, sound, relaxing melodies ever.  I use this during our quiet times at home and to fall asleep too after a rough day.  I love the timer feature and all the different combinations that you can create.  The save feature is wonderful as well.  I would recommend this app.

B004J713JW|5.0|Billy Joel and friends - including a highly participatory sellout crowd - gave a goodbye worthy of an historic location like Shea. The stadium obviously means a great deal emotionally to the respectful but very involved audience and many of the performing stars. Billy's running commentary was a great historical thread which enlightened those of us who were not able to grow up near Shea and who appreciated being clued in on the many happenings over the years.I came away with greater respect for both the stellar past of Shea, as well as the obvious deeply-emotional involvement of the crowd.  Very well done l!!
1400049628|5.0|This book should come with a warning:  read it sitting in a chair with armrests or if not, over a soft surface.  Why?  The chances of falling out of your chair laughing are very high.<br /><br />It is a quick, fun read but makes you worry about security at the same time!
B0041KWDE6|1.0|I ordered this DVD (a favorite of mine for a long time) from a company called Moisio SRL...unbeknownst  to me, a company in Italy. When I finally received it (took a while) I noticed that the surface of the disc was a little different, like it wasn't clean or something & when I tried to play it, I got an error message that I had never seen before, telling me this disc wasn't &#34;coded&#34; right. I contacted the seller via email requesting a replacement. They replied telling me that their  DVDs would not play in MOST American players & I could return it for a refund! If they were aware that it would not play in most American players, then why are they selling these discs to addresses marked USA? It cost almost $10 in postage to mail it back...I have not been credited yet for the returned DVD but I'm still out the postage & have nothing to show for it. Buyers, beware...double check to see where your discs are coming from.....

0385349831|5.0|It was so amazing to read these words of wisdom written so many hundreds of years ago, that are relevant today and in the future. If I was facing disaster as the listeners to the Copt were during the Crusades I would be grateful to have heard these words instead of running about freaked and stressed out. I'm going to keep this book on my \\"special\\" shelf for those times when I need words of wisdom to help me though difficult times in life. Thank you Paulo for making this available to the world.

B004N7B8DY|4.0|Good video quality. Audio is mono but clear. Nicely packaged. Great value. Fight scenes are simple. Refreshingly clear and pleasing to watch.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|It's heartwarming to watch a movie that is inspirational and well created without being religious.  I wish more producers focused on everyday experiences than all the science fiction and horror films that are now being made using computer animation for sensationalism.
1447231171|2.0|This book was a mostly boring English tome.  Very detailed on British govt and elections.  I mean-who cares?  Lots of words only a Brit would understand.  Characters were not very interesting or sympathetic.  I like Downton Abbey as much as the next person but I would have stopped reading early this early on except it was required reading for my book club.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Nice game just not my favorite kinda like Bejeweled but with bubbles. Ok to have if u have the free space on ur device.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Great adaptation of the play. Alec Baldwin's opening monologue is a classic. Amazing insight into the life of a salesman.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Great series! With all of the clones that we don't know about, it was very surprising on how often they kept on popping up. Made you wonder how the next clone would be and what she would do. A very good series to watch! Only bad thing is that the series ended too soon! Lol!
B003JTHWPA|2.0|The first half of the book kept my interest ok but towards the end I found myself drifting off and actually falling asleep. I know some people loved this book but for me nothing really ever happened and I never really got to care for anyone in the book. Not even Singer and Mick.<br />The story is depressing but I am ok with that overall in a book my issue with this book was that nothing ever really happened that I did not expect already so it made it a very boring read for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|enjoy playing. my 3 year old enjoys it also. would reccomend it! I think you would enjoy it also if you download it.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I feel like Sylvia felt pressure to throw something together for her fans. I like the descriptions and details of gideon but other than that dull.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|This book highlights specific civilizations where cultural interface with environment determined collapse.  Marginal areas for farming, herding and fishing; fluctuating weather patterns; social and cultural adaptation, etc. all played into the success or failure of these somewhat isolated examples.  The author's ideas are thought-provoking, but I can do without his Lefty-Greenie political slant.  Still, like his previous hit &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34;, there is plenty here to make you think about things in new ways and it's an enjoyable read.  Mysteries like Easter Island depopulation are captivating.  Warning:  The illustrations and maps are virtually unreadable on the basic Kindle, but they aren't essential to the book.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Both my wife and I love this concert.  We wish the music from it were available on cd--only Bring Him Home is available on cd.

B009YG2ND8|3.0|I've played MUCH better RPGs on the Kindle fire than this! It's pretty much the same thing over &amp; over, plus after each and every battle you must go through lenghthy Stat changes. The player doesn't get to choose where to put Stat points. Where is the quest log? The player also cannot determine the health of enemies, and often spell points are wasted when you could have taken 'em out w/ a sword thrust. I don't see why people are going ga-ga for this game!?!? It's also so way over priced!

B0010T0JBK|4.0|I'm a nurse, and I'd been using the same pair of classic crocks for 4 years (a testament to their longevity), but it was time for a new pair.  I opted for one of the more modern styles that had no vent holes and soles that wouldn't slide around - both very important for my job.  They feel a little tighter, and my feet tend to sweat more without the vent holes.  These do not feel quite as comfortable as the old ones, but perhaps that's just because those were so worn in.  I'm keeping them, but I'm going to order a second pair in the &#34;specialist&#34; style to see if those fit any better.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book and the movie is almost like the book,its very romantic and  I really enjoy it!<br />i would watch it over and over

B008FPOIT6|3.0|There is no immortality that is not built on friendship and work done with care. The care in which the characters treated one another was amazing. They all grew out of each other's belief that there is always something more to strive for.

B00CL1SR7O|5.0|this album needs to be heard this album is better than any album ive had and big time rush rocks thanks for the order amazon rocks
1440503257|4.0|I bought this for my Grandma, who loves Harry Potter and loves baking. The book LOOKS great and is lots of fun, but the recipes aren't anything special. They're essentially just normal food with tortured puns as names. However, there are some winners in there, and it's a cool novelty item for Potter fans.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This book is a realistic fiction book that is relative to today's world. I would definitely recommend this to kids.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|Sweet price for a great piece of BBQ equipment. No toxic chemicals need to light it, just paper. Should have got this a long time ago
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|this  is a  classic, I  love  how  it  shows  how  they  are  transformed  into  Marines and  doesn't  focus  so  much  the  war  itself  till  the  last  half  of  the  movie.
0679805273|4.0|I bought 10 of these for the graduating seniors in my youth group. I've given Oh the Places You'll Go for the last 3 years with personalized messages, and every year my students love it. This year 2 of the 10 books showed up with some mild inside cover damage, likely a manufacturing error, but other than that, everything was lovely, and you really can't beat the price. Getting them here is a great option if you're buying multiples.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I ordered this the other day so that I could start my Sonic Screwdriver collection. I am extremely happy with this, and have already, as stupid as it sounds, 'Sonic'd' my bedroom door, my bedroom fan, and my light switch.<br />ONLY DISCLAIMERS:<br />1.  There is a small, plastic rectangular shape over the screwhole for the battery compartment. (Under the slider) And it falls off very easily.<br />2. Once one and/or both pen-nibs run out of ink, it's seemingly impossible to find replacements.<br />Other than that, I am so happy with this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Couldn't get the hang of it at first but I finally figured it out. WOW! I enjoy being able to express what I feel, like, and dislike.  And, when someone is awakened by what I have done done it puts a smile on my face.

B000002AH7|5.0|Miles plays with the Gil Evans orchestra, not a small combo. The group features brass and piano, but not strings or non-jazz brass or reeds. The tunes are sublime and bring out the tender, fragile, but insistent spirit of Mile's trumpet and flugel horn. I have never heard Miles play more plaintively or tenderly. He is perfectly in sync with the orchestra, leaving us with a modern classic to listen to over and over. Elvin Jones plays percussion, but does not man a traditional drum kit.
076780421X|5.0|A cute heart felt love story. The music in this movie is great!<br />I have put most of the music on my Ipod.  This was a great<br />movie on for our &#34;Matthew Perry, popcorn, Movie Night&#34; !!

0312430000|5.0|This book does it all.  It entertains, it's informative and even persuasive if you happen to be a surgeon looking to improve performance in your daily life.  And, when lives are at stake, who wouldn't?  The Checklist Manifesto is about the utility of a checklist in a myriad of situations, with the focus on medicine.  Gawande expertly picks out the details of how a checklist is used in construction, or investing, etc. while maintaining a narrative format.  He ties this back into his collaboration with WHO in introducing this checklist to hospitals around the world as an experiment.  Finally, he adds some important comments about it.  By the end, this book is simply Gawande's best (in my opinion) because it does it all and is so well written.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Disappointed in the final episode.  After watching the previous seasons, seems they need to have one of the cast &#34;die&#34; prior to the next season.  This time they have the cousin making an entrance so they are killing off another vital member of the family.  Pretty predictable now.  May not continue with the series after this one.
0743233832|4.0|I'm reviewing this book based on the effectiveness of the translation.  And the translation is really well-done.  It reads succinctly and in a way that you can just pick up anywhere and read.  I don't have any issue with not understanding certain passages.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars though because this book could be better.  Most translated books have commentary with introductions before chapters or lots of footnotes.  Those are missing here.  And I feel like with the things Aurelius said, a lot could be illuminated by footnotes of his life experiences or why he could have said what he did.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Mama has a lot of things going for it, as well as a few hindrances. Overall though it's a pretty basic ghost story with a few original flourishes here and there. One thing I especially liked about it was two feral little kids, there were some parts where I saw them moving abnormally and thought \\"OH GOD WTF IS THAT!?\\", all without the use of quickly amplifying the volume up to 11 for an obnoxious startling noise. The ghost design for Mama was also pretty original and disturbing looking, and there would be (few) moments with her just lingering in the background or something and it had a creeping effect. Jessica Chastain as the main chick did an above-and-beyond performance with her character, not to mention she was smokin' hot throughout the movie. I know critics praised her skeletal FBI redhead look in Zero Dark Thirty, but I sure wouldn't mind seeing her don the punk rock look for a little longer. Other things that were nice were when she finally breaks through to one of the kids, it was an unexpected scene and was a nice break from the usual horror monotony regarding Investigate/SCARE/Investigate/SCARE.<br /><br />So you've probably noticed that some of these compliments are backhanded, well for all Mama's strengths it still had a few things going against it. Most notably, LOUD UNEXPECTED JUMP SCARES. I know these are pretty standard for PG-13 horror movies but... why!? It's not clever, it's not well done, it's just f***ing cheap. BOO! Startled!? That'll be $10 please. That's how I feel watching these movies and being annoyed that I have to turn down the volume when everything gets quiet. The worst part is that Mama would've been a perfectly fine horror movie without the HOLY S*** THAT'S LOUD crap; the ghost designs and story were perfectly fine enough without this cheap, lazy jump-scare B.S.<br /><br />Alright I feel better, also Jamie Lannister takes a backseat for most of the movie and does occasional snooping around to investigate ghastly origins, similar to what Ned Stark did in Silent Hill. I would've been more interested to see him and Jessica take on the ghostly stuff together as a couple, instead of \\"woman alone in a haunted house\\" standard stuff. Also some parts in the plot didn't make much sense, most notably *spoiler* if Mama wanted to re-enact her death with the kids, why didn't she do that in the first place when it was just them in the cabin for 5 years? Ugh. This wasn't a bad movie, but it annoys me more than a straight-bad movie would because it was ridiculously close to being a great movie, and instead it's cheapened up and dumbed down to be instead \\"decent\\". Shame.at Ned Stark did in Silent Hill.

B00AB16ER6|5.0|The Winery Dogs have made a really killer debut album that combines their awesome musical virtuosity with some intense rock grooves and powerful vocals. The band is a rock super group featuring guitar extraordinaire Richie Kotzen (solo and ex Mr Big), rock bass legend Billy Sheehan (Mr Big, Steve Vai), and power house drummer Mike Portnoy (ex Dream Theater). This project originally planned to have the immense talents of guitar player John Sykes but after that idea fell through this current lineup was settled on and they hit the studio to get the job done. The sound of the album is very much in a classic rock vein with lots of excellent solos and strong vocals from Kotzen who gives a Chris Cornell-like performance in both tone and style on these awesome tracks. The album sounds huge and is engineered well like most projects that Mike Portnoy is involved with. Highlights include the hard rocking opener \\"Elevate\\", the brilliant groove of \\"We Are One\\" that cracks into a massive chorus hook, the melodic ballad \\"You Saved Me\\", and the strong bonus track \\"Criminal\\" available on the Japanese import version. The Winery Dogs consistently show their amazing ability to shred while writing lots of big riffs and memorable choruses that rival the best in this style of music. This is definitely one of the strongest albums of the year and hopefully leads to an exciting tour. The Winery Dogs are highly recommended to fans of quality rock in the style of Mr Big and might also impress fans of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Cream, Lenny Kravitz, and Soundgarden.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Nice way of tricking the consumer. Seems like everyone else is having the same issue. I won't buy anything from Disney again. So deceptive
B00CW665VI|5.0|BAM! Hear that? That's the sound of Emma Chase blasting her way into the writing world with her debut novel Tangled. She had me eating out of her hand when I was only a few pages in. If you're looking for a light, hysterical, naughty, and entertaining read, look no further. Tangled is easily one of the best books I've read so far this year!<br /><br />The story is told from Drew Evans perspective. I felt like he was having a conversation with me the whole time I was reading. Emma Chase nailed it when it came to Drew. She created a character, she knew her character, and she owned it! Being in Drew's head the whole time was fantastic. I loved every word, every page!<br /><br />\\"Good guys are boring. You need a little bad to keep things fun. And nice guys? Nice guys have something to hide.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dahmer's neighbors thought he was a nice guy. Until they found those heads in his freezer.\\"<br /><br />If you're on the fence about reading this one, jump over! You definitely want to see how playboy Drew Evans falls in love, screws it up, and then attempts to finagle his way back in Kate's heart. I can't wait to read more from Emma Chase. I hope she's in her writing cave!<br /><br />\\"And another thing--don't get too comfortable. Take chances. Don't be afraid to lay it on the line. Even if you're happy. Even if you think like is freaking perfect.\\"<br /><br />5 STARS!

B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This album is fall out boy once again knocking it out of the park. One of the few bands i can look forward to making great music consistently. After two plays through this album i had hooks and choris' stuck in my head and loved them. My only complaint with this album is that its too short. As long as they have been away i wanted to see a double album. Its the one thing they need to solidify their legacy in rock history!

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Catch songs that get stuck in your head its a really solid paramore album up till the song i hate to see your heart break. then it gets all whiney and soft but the first part of the album more then makes up for it. Highly recomended if you love paramore you will love most of this album.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This app takes you FOREVER to find someone to play. It is fun when you can play but the waiting a half an hour makes it harder to say I like this app.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Fun and challenging.  I enjoy the increasing difficulty levels. Keeps the game from becoming boring. Something to take your mind off of the daily grind.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's about time this app came out for kindle fire. I thought it would never come out. And this game is fun and works perfectly!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Not the most productive thing to do with your time,, but lottsa fun.. Lots of different settings keeping it interesting.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Too bad it has zombies in it.<br /><br />I am not a &#34;zombie movie&#34; fan. I honestly believe the genre has been overdone by a long shot. But there are gems that have risen within this in spite of the trash being produced lately. &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; and &#34;Exit Humanity&#34; being two gems names offhand.<br /><br />&#34;Exit Humanity&#34; is a story first and zombie movie a distant second. &#34;It is never too late to heal the soul.&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you like outdoor movies with great scenery and a cinematographer who should have every award there is.
0811879542|5.0|This book is a must for lap reading. A wonderful interactive book without a single battery needed, I highly recommend it to parents and grandparents or anyone who interacts with young children.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I bought this movie already knowing I loved it.  Little did I know, the alternate ending theatrical version, would let me enjoy the movie even more.  Not having read the Book, I really have no idea how well it stuck to the original storyline, nor do I care.<br /><br />This movie has been a favorite of mine, since I bought the DVD about four years ago.  Now being able to get a Blu Ray Version, for less than a third of what I paid for the DVD at the time, you bet I jumped at the chance!<br /><br />For those of you who have yet to see this movie, expect to see Will Smith at his best.  He carries the movie solo for an hour... and quite well.  Granted, the CGI effects lack a bit, it does not take anything away from the overall quality of the camera work, and acting of not only Will Smith, but his Canine friend \\"Sam.\\"<br /><br />If you like Will Smith, End of the world scenarios, non stop action, Zombies, and even have a story to follow, give it a shot.<br /><br />Honestly, it is just a great movie.  Do your homework. Read up on the reviews. Maybe watch a trailer, or rent it to be sure it is your speed.... I am guessing since you are here, you have already made up your mind.<br /><br />You wont beat the price, and good luck finding it in stores.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Honestly, I can't find one thing I don't like about this album, yet I was almost hesitant to give it a 4. It's one of those, not necessarily good albums but an album that's really good to listen to. I appreciate QOTSA's dedication to rock pop, which is not the same as pop rock. If you were to ask me to name five actual rock bands making good music these days I'd have a hard time. Black Keys, Jeff the Brotherhood, QOTSA...that's all I've got really. Like Clockwork manages to appeal to the 20 year old part of me that still wants loud guitar and hard drums, but also to the 30 year old part of me that appreciates song structure, pop riffs, and vocals you can understand. I think you need to be a QOTSA fan to like this, but any QOTSA fan will probably love it.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|i have read the first book of this trilogy and have enjoyed the second as much as the first,  Looking forward to the third....
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Can't stop playing!!!!! A Must download! Started last night and can't put it down. Got my wife playing now to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a really fun app. I love to play with my friends and I love to play it when I'm bored. I highly recommend this app to anyone and everyone. And it isn't that hard to play. Its just like Temple Run but in a much cooler updated way! :-)
B00CCEHX5W|4.0|Deafheaven's Sunbather is one of those anomalies that happens every so often in metal music where you're moved to your core listening to the aural violence. Singer George Clark sounds like Deftones' Chino Moreno having some sort of attack as songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy creates transcendent -albeit bludgeoning- music that sweeps you up in the drama of life and existence. Sunbather sounds like what would happen if Explosions In The Sky dabbled in black metal. It's a record that comes around every so often, and when it does all you can do is let it wash over you.<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" is a wall of guitars. And ebb and flow of dramatic sweeps and moods. This is what happens when post rock goes through primal scream therapy. I imagine Mogwai was brought up once or twice in the studio while recording this epic opening track. A barrage of guitars bash against each other as if waves pummeling the lone schooner in a black ocean. Clark screams orders till the storm calms as the piano and echoed guitar of \\"Irresistible\\" steps in during a moment of solace, quietly taking us into the ten minute title track. Deftones haunt the sound of this song, not only in the shredded vocal cords but McCoy's exquisite guitar. His guitar is  a sound filled with both guttural pain and heavenly scope. You feel as you listen to Deafheaven that you're listening to a great epic tale -much like Homer's Odyssey- put to music. This is a journey record(and not that \\"Don't Stop Believin' junk). \\"Please Remember\\" starts as noise and increases in intensity climaxing to a buzzsaw screech before dissipating into a quietly strummed guitar. Ebb and flow.<br /><br />This album isn't for the weak of heart or ear. It's a trip filled with good and bad. It's a journey filled with as much pain as pleasure. What makes this record a journey worth taking over and over again is songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy. He takes metal and hardcore music and gives it something that too often is missing in both:  depth. At times there's a downright shimmering quality to his playing that sounds like Johnny Marr filling in for Porl Thompson on Disintegration. \\"Vertigo\\" has a shoegaze swirl about it before going into an almost Euro-metal guitar lead that opens the gates for George Clark's banshee howl. \\"Window\\" is a swirl of dread. A voice speaks in the background as piano plays and ambient noise comes in and out of focus before \\"The Pecan Tree\\" closes the dizzying journey called Sunbather.<br /><br />Bands like Explosions In The Sky, Mogwai, and even My Bloody Valentine are woven into Deafheaven's DNA. I'm sure there's some black metal and hardcore bands that were a basis for these guys wanting to make music as well, but I haven't the ear or listening experience to throw those names around. All I can say is Sunbather is Deafheaven taking all of those influences and creating something unique and moving all their own. It's not an easy journey, but one you should take. One you must take.times there's a downright shimmering quality to his playing that sounds like Johnny Marr filling in for Porl Thompson on Disintegration. \\"Vertigo\\" has a shoegaze swirl about it before going into an almost Euro-metal guitar lead that opens the gates for George Clark's banshee howl. \\"Window\\" is a swirl of dread.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This had many sound options & the cool thing is that you can play more than one at a time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was unable to stop reading this from the moment I started.amazing characters and great storyline. I can't wait for the sequel to come out!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Wonderful story from Archer stable. However the finish was not the greatest. Archer's grip on the story gets a little bit weaker than inhierlier works
B00795P4EG|4.0|I started by editing my granddaughters junior prom pictures. It was so amazing. They have a professional look. I couldn't believe what I'd done.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|This was my first experience with Amazon streaming. Loaded it on the Wii and it worked fine. The price was rather high, but there was no way to get it any cheaper on disc.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book has up to date examples from recent events in our lifetime.  I found it very difficult to set down, which is odd for a book on this subject.  Great insights into how things work for different people.  Give it a read, you wont be disappointed.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My six year old son loves this movie and will watch it all day. A must buy to keep your busy for awhile.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|Actually, I haven't watched the movies yet, but I assume they are in working order.  The case, however, is flimsy, and broke as soon as I opened it.  Still a great deal for the amount of movies you get for the price.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story. Great read. This was not a sequel featuring a detective. It was not a run of the mill novel. It is unique and inspiring. Loved it and would recommend it to anyone.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Plugs in to my Nikon D7000 and allows me to activate shutter.<br />I am not doing anything special so I have only used it in regular one image capture mode.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This app is awesome! You should try it! You can download videos with no access on kindle fires! Try it plz
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once again, I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  Well written, the characters are all intriguing.  Highly recommend, but start with Season 1!
B001B93H0O|5.0|Easy to follow. Fun and would make you sweat and wouldn't want to stop. I would highly recommend this to whoever wants to have fun sweating.
B00AK57N00|1.0|Love the iOS version played that for hours, this one however, I can't get anywhere without a force close.  Usually within a couple minutes if starting.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe after this book has been pushed back for almost 6 months I have to wait for another one!!! This was suppose to be a triology not a four-ology(No a real word) I'm so disappointed at this point I could care less.<br /><br />Thanks but no thanks!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Keeps me entertained when I get home from work and just want to relax.  No brain power needed for this one.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This app, is such a surprise, you never know what to expect, and the addition of the jewels and watchpieces for each level is just another good puzzle for the game.  It is a  good addition to Quell and Quell Reflect.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The serie was superb!! Quality image is super. May be for new verison of the BR could be better to work on the menu. It is not fierndly at all.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|i dont care for it, but it keeps the kids busy for hours it seems. Wish they didnt have to join a social group to access all the features. i dont like that, but otherwise they do play it often
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this is a good game.I give it a five star.so anyone that thinks that it sucked you are worng.it is also perfect for my five children it is a very good app .so rate it it is really fun.
B00A757EFW|3.0|wish it wasnt so 2 dimentional. i loved the original pac man, but it seems alil difficult to play on touch screen.
B004SBX112|4.0|Fun to play.  I really like the variety with all the seasons.  Sometime it seems more challenging than the regular game and RIO.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|Very addictive game until the end when you find out you have to Pay money for the last three levels. Not worth it
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Sometimes I like it better than the regular Angry Birds game, because the tropical birds just fly away.  Very addictive and fun!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is a perfect timewaster. I personally love games like that. It looks good and the challenges give you just enough incentive to keep playing.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Very addictive!  Fun to play.  Ads free is even better, because I can see more of the screen.  Love it!
B00001W9G0|5.0|I watched it back when it first came out and seeing it again after all these years I understood it better and loved it just as much.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have never seen a movie as unique and beautiful as this, and I've been in love with it since the first time I saw it. The plot is the story of a young girl forced into servitude in a bathhouse for spirits in order to free her parents from a curse which turned them into pigs. She meets a lot of interesting spirits and makes some friends along the way. The whole thing is absolutely heartwarming and the artwork is dazzling. It doesn't matter what sort of animation you're into or not into, this movie is very enjoyable and has something for the whole family, though real little ones might be spooked by some of the spirits' appearances and behaviors (and there is minor bloodshed as well). Some may disagree, but I see Spirited Away as Miyazaki's crowning achievement.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I loved it! Cant wait for the next one! IF you like this you should watch the Avengers. Also a very good movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Very fun movie, especially for the adults!  Kids loved it too.  Very sweet and funny and entertaining for everyone in the family.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoyed this first season of Suits. It has plenty if variety of serious, funny, relationships.  I liked that it wasn't too,too heavy like Revenge or Grays Anatomy.
B003B02O7I|5.0|$11billion is at stake. A will to cut out all family members but one, who has no interest. Greed and legal maneuvering to get family members and lawyers their share is the goal. A final twist resolves everything. This is an excellent book.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|i never write reviews but i have never been so mad when i got this book i couldnt wait to start .....few chapters in i was waiting for it to improve....and it didnt it got worse......<br />SPOILERS......<br />i nearly tossed my beloved out the window i mean her mother and father go at it IN HER BED and she feels bad about it..come on i hate her mother she is a spoilt high paid hooker who slumbs it and i used to like her dad but he so guilty and worried about eva that instead of slapping the ma he comforts her in his daughters bed........then theres eva who if was someone who i knew i would slap i mean she is all over the place .....she looooves gideon so much cant live without him but my god she cant breed when bret is around....and when does the muisc vid shes mad but wont say it cas it ruin his day...she is a walking hypocrite who needs to grow up and get mad at the real problems instead of letting them go and holding onto the most stupid things......ms day even ruined cary for me she made him into a horrible person and really self centered .....80% ofthe book is just sex which would be fine if she hadnt messed up the charteraters so bad that i just found myself rolling my eyes and thinking yeah yeah ........if this book had of been what i hoped it would be i would of been delighted with it turning into a series as it is iwont be reading the next 1
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This is a riveting look at British (and perhaps American) politics from a behind the scenes perspective. The lust for power becomes the catalyst for total corruption of almost all involved and they will stop at nothing to hold onto it. Brilliant casting, acting and writing.
034580404X|5.0|Since I have all 3 books, I am still reading. So far it is like all the reviews I have read. Steamy!!
B00881PTRC|3.0|After I played it a few times, it was kind of boring......The same picture of the hangman over and over again.
B0061IIIAY|5.0|What's not to love right?  This is REM at their best.  Great CD!!!  I highly recommend it if you don't have it in your collection already.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Happy With Purchase And Grand-daughter loves the dvd<br /><br />Was very happy with my purchases, and would recommend to friends and family.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Best of Uma Thurman that I have scene, she shines with blood all over, great acting, for entertainment, you cant go wrong with Kill Bill 1/2,my grandson took my first ones he liked so well, I had to order myself a set, really very good.  Eve
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched it because my 18 year old niece liked it.  But I enjoyed it just as much, and I'm 64!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great follow up by rowling. I like all the Harry Potter series. The cinematography in this movie is alfully dark. Hard to see the detail on a TV screen.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|very frustrating. it would not connect. kept asking for password, but would not accept it. I tried everything for an hr.  Had to delete it.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|watched it love it I have them all I will be buying them on here in blu ray soon in love with these movies
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Every episode flows great, with great topics and characters. It spans all issues, not a boring moment, keeps you in the moment.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|love it great show warewolfs hybreeds vampires its all awesome I am so excited about the 4th one coming out soon
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down!  Unusually written and such a complicated plot!  Characters underdeveloped and unbelieveable.  This is no classic, but a good easy read!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Damon damon damon all the way awesome show a must watch show if u are interested in vampires you will love this show
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loving Sylvia's wonderful work, can't wait for the next book!!! Hope the wedding is beautiful and lots of babies Cross's
B003L77GH4|5.0|I watched every single episode and needed to buy them so I have them all so I am buying them as a colletion n I watch them off Netflix hehe
B008I43DYU|5.0|Good tool. Easy to use. I like the different background choices. I like it on my kindle fire. I use it often.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|For those that love the poetry of spoken Shakespeare this is a must see. Plus the delightful casting, especially small parts with people you would not expect. You can see in the actors faces the enjoyment in their rolls. This is no dutiful slog through dusty old roles, but people that truly enjoyed what they were doing.<br /><br />It shows in every scene.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like it. it's jut that you have to BUY the game to actually enjoy it. if you only stay in demo mode( that's me to) you can only stay in that world for like 7 minutes then your done and have to make  New world ans start all of r again.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|production is sort of muddy but as it's sort of home recorded, to be expected. This guy is very talented and it will be interesting to see if he can sustain unique music of break down and follow what worked previously. I'm looking forward to hearing more.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The 1st way is if you're at least level 14 you can put plant then air in the breeding cave and in 14 or rarely 16 hours you can get 1,000,000 dragon cash. The 2nd way is you can put plant then lightning and in 1 hour you can get 100,000 dragon cash. That may not seem like much but in 12 hours you can get 1,200,000. Trust me, it will get you money faster than ever
B009WO7NQO|5.0|We have been very happy with the other angry birds games and we love Star Wars so when I saw this game we had to get it.  Great game!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the perfect sequel to the first. It has all the improvements the first one didn't and all kinds of new features, just to make it all the more fun and addicting. My favorite part is driving on the railroad track!! :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the trilogy, Suzanne Collins is a wonderful storyteller and I will be looking for more of her work.
0316216453|5.0|After reading just a few of the 1500+ reviews on Goodreads or the 244 on Amazon I can see there are some very insightful, thoughtful commentaries, much complementary and some constructive criticism. It's fun to read and compare.<br /><br />I suppose the point of continuing the conversation revolves around how much each generation of readers has changed their own views of the issues of the day: religion, sexuality, infidelity or views on entitlement and elitism or just our general interest in how the other half lives.<br /><br />In lesser hands the book might easily slip into a bit of self serving narcissism. The characters lead lives that allow for emotional decadence which could turn shallow but fortunately does not.<br /><br />Charles Ryder seems to have had an intense but only gently alluded to relationship with Sebastian Flyte. The Flytes are a very wealthy, Catholic Aristocratic family living materially charmed lives as the British Empire is gradually receding in the 1920's and 30's. But all the Flytes and Ryder seem preoccupied with the smallness of their lives. In some cases piety or the perception of it or searching for a purpose or the right relationships or dwelling on ones that cannot be.<br /><br />But Waugh writes so well and draws us into this family with such subtle tools that I found myself more living in the book than reading it. He strings together smoothly a series of vignettes that move the characters through roughly 20 years from the 1920's to the 1940's. The specter of war is woven into the backdrop by a series of concise snippets of political dialogue between characters overlapping other events in the same room. It's just enough and given when it was written it's quite prescient.<br /><br />Waugh says in the forward that this is a story about exploring Grace on the imperfect people that occupy his book. Ryder is atheist. The Flytes run the gamut from resistance and rejection of religion to needing and wanting it in their lives and they all evolve in their views which I suspect is quite natural. They are all tested in one way or another with uneven results which are for us to mull over.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the ride. The characters are rich and interesting and the writing is well worth a re-read.lve in their views which I suspect is quite natural.

B005LHOKFS|5.0|This is my go-to spot for travel planning.  The reviews are usually spot-on.  Very helpful for deciding where to go, and what to do when I get there, and where to eat and stay when I get there.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Excellent movie, great acting, Bradley Cooper should have won the Oscar also.  Witty, wonderfully acted and a lesson for all about bi-polar disorder.  Love and human spirit prevail
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for the few times I need it.  I downloaded it because sometimes I need to talk on my phone and use a calculator at the same time.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|enjoyed the story and the excitement that the book held. I was surprised at the ending and didn't know if it was the right one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the trilogy, it is such an interesting story.  I'm looking forward to the movie version.  I will be looking for other Suzanne Collins books.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Surprisingly funny, entertaining, informative and good for all ages! Great cast and really shows the trails and miracles of having a baby. My husband even liked it!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|The app keeps closing, saying it encountered unexpected provlems. Before all this trouble, I considered it a fun little game. Now, I'm considering uninstalling it.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|The movie was almost satirical in portraying a shameful period in history.  Actors gave good performances, considering material they had to work with.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The show is well written and I love the characters.  The acting is fabulous.  I am addicted and have been since the second show of the first season.
0763644765|5.0|I have twins toddlers boys and at age 3 they still are in pull ups.  I tried everything but their lack of interest sabotaged everything.  So, I came on here, looked at the best seller for books and hallelujah they have now gone 2 days dry!!  They relate to the kid in the book without words.  I read to them and they looked at it themselves.  I am ecstatic to say the least.  I did get a new potty chair to that that has a step up to the toilet and they loved it.  Highly recommend this book!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game. But I really want mowing to bring boats and wheat into the picture. I hate having to swim all the way across the river or ocean after collecting resources. And they should put in minecarts.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Never figured out the ending! What an awful thing to live through for years! I heard this type of amnesia can really happen! Devastating for your loved ones I'm sure.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Loved every minute. A very well done Bond film. Probably my favorite all time. I especially enjoyed that they brought back the humor, some gadgets and of course, the car.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was excellent reading.  Didn't think I would really like the Hunger Games, but once I started reading them I couldn't put them down.  They just kept getting better.  I would recommend the series to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This came recommended by my friend who studies a lot.  I would recommend this to anyone.  There are other free versions I would also use and/or have.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My 10 year old and I read the book together and then watched the movie - we both loved it and she's become a huge Gregory Peck fan!
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|This film is a brilliant and tragic event of a film. It captures all of the play in a beautiful and powerful way. The actors show some of the greatest and most intense performances I have ever seen. Everyone was in top shape for this one.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|I'm glad I bought this movie because I've watched it five times already... and its a long movie. Definitely one of my new favorites.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it! Better than any of the other apps out their!  Tried a few before I found this one thanks!
1603420398|5.0|I am newer to the world of crochet, but have worked my way through several books to learn the craft.  I love how this book goes past the idea of making granny squares, and expands into other shapes.  I am incredibly happy my brother purchased this for me off of my Amazon wish list.<br /><br />The photos in this book are gorgeous, and very helpful for learning how to make these motifs.  I have found the patterns to be pretty good and accurate, and I especially appreciated the author's section at the beginning of the book about technical details, starting a new color, joining, etc.  For some reason, a lot of author's leave those details out, and it makes it tough for those of us who have been learning by reading books.<br /><br />I also particularly enjoy the way Ms. Eckman doesn't write a \\"fiddly,\\" instruction book, i.e. I like the way she presents a couple of different ways you could solve a problem, and lets you choose which one would work for you.  It is a lot more useful to understand why it works than to memorized rules by rote.<br /><br />The only thing I wish there was a bit more discussion on in here would be yarn selection, but that may be because I am a novice at this craft.<br /><br />I am very much enjoying this one, and plan to purchase the author's other books \\"Crochet Borders,\\" \\"Connect the Shapes,\\" and \\"The Crochet Answer Book.\\"
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This works great just wish it had a few more alarm sounds to pick from.  Other than that I love it!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I received the movie timely.<br /><br /> I had forgotten much about this movie and was surprised to find many details in this version truer to the book than the current version.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I hated everything about this could not comment on your Facebook so I had to deleted this app I really think a 1 star is over rated!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was an entertaining story. I really enjoyed reading it from beginning to end! I needed it for a homework project and it was wonderful.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Mr.  Cross is at it again.  This was hot and exposed more layers.  I was disappointed that this was not the last book, I was left wanting more.  Still, I will be waiting to see hopefully how it ends.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I had heard so much about this book and couldn't wait to read it.  The story was intriguing and the main character likeable, but when it ended I had such a feeling of hopelessness. Maybe I missed something?
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think that this game is very fun. Me and my little sister love this game we play it all the time. It is so worth 2.99  cents it is a awesome game I say get the game.
B001XV09UG|2.0|This film pretended to be a discussion of a serious sociological question of relationship and marital fidelity.  But though it was beautifully filmed and somewhat competently acted, I found it quickly disgusting.  The film was too stereotypical, and I thought this was the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a role for Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />She also either poorly performed in interpreting her role, or was poorly directed.  It was over the top and not very believable.  Except the dance scene, I thought, was well-handled.<br /><br />I thought the bedroom discussion about reasons for fidelity between the doctor and his wife was not very believable, but Tom Cruise's character and his point of view was more believable.  Overall the dialogue was pretentious and the parts overacted.  I had to turn it off during that awful bedroom row -  I thought &#34;When is this ever going to end?&#34;<br /><br />The movie had never appealed to me, and I wasted too much time giving it a chance.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I was shocked listening to this release. Not only does it line up well with the original 5 masterpieces, but, they actually sound like the band we've come to love. I had expected much less listening to Ozzy's recent releases recycling trash from better records.<br /><br />They sound like a band satisfied with what is being delivered. Tony and Geezer sound absolutely great! Geezer drives the effort with the best performance of all in the band. Tony's solos are great. While competent, Bill Ward is definitely missing in Brad's stead. You can hear where Bill would be going crazy with drum fills, my only disappointment here.<br /><br />These are Sabbath songs played by more of Sabbath (given touring personnel changes), than anyone has heard in a long time! Sounds a bit like Volume 4 with a recording quality more like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.<br /><br />Thank you very much indeed!

B00915G6WQ|4.0|This season takes Deb down into the deepest layers of hell. It starts with Deb falling upon Dexter's killing a Christian serial killer in his church and it ends with an even grosser and more deliriously crazy crime. Dexter used to be more or less manipulated by his Dark Passenger, by a need he had to satisfy, an impulse he had to follow, but little by little he realizes that there is no dark passenger and that he is entirely responsible for his crimes and that leads to the idea that he is killing to survive, and eventually to avenge the killing of his mother.<br /><br />As soon as this idea that survival is the main objective Dexter becomes a plain ordinary simple and banal serial killer. He does not kill dangerous people, I mean dangerous for society because they are serial killers themselves, but he kills because he feels menaced. His killing is no longer an act of vigilante justice but an act of pure fear, the fear to be taken, and when his sister is totally involved, the fear she might get caught or that she might become the target of some other criminal, and little by little of the police itself. It is no longer awesome but it has become awful.<br /><br />The psychological level of the characters, Dexter among them, then loses a lot of its appeal. Dexter is a monster, a self-centered, egocentric, selfish monster. He has not one ounce of humanity left. He has become a danger for society by not being a scavenger that takes care of mental rubbish and social garbage. Then the suspense in the series is no longer only about when and how he is going to be caught but rather how he is going to get out of his mess by killing whom, when, where, how. Up to now there was an ethical dimension he called a code in that appeal. Now it is purely morbid and nothing but morbid.<br /><br />The series uses some circumstantial subjects to build some kind of setting and environment to the predator's hunt. The Ukrainian mafia in Miami opens night clubs with Ukrainian dancers who are essentially strippers and pole dancers, in other words something close to prostitution that is more or less tolerated but the Ukrainian mafia uses that cover to import all kinds of highly profitable drugs. This clandestine commerce then comes to a direct clash with the Colombian drug mafia that tries to defend their territory. But that transforms the series again into a simple criminal action film like so many others.<br /><br />The series tries to widen Dexter's scope by making him fall in love with another criminal who has killed exclusively to protect herself from all kinds of ills, a father first who was brutal, a gambler, a child molester, etc, and then juvenile institutions and then the serial killer she makes an escape at 15 with and whose crimes she shares, apparently with a lot of zeal but her lawyer manages to get her some immunity for these crimes because she was considered to be a hostage more than an accomplice. She knows what killing means, and she is in poison, and she understands Dexter and Dexter understands her. They fall in love, real love, not some social convenient arrangement like with Rita. But she menaces Deb who is trying to step between her and Dexter. Then Dexter has to get her in prison for one crime he had covered up.<br /><br />But she escapes. Food for the next season.<br /><br />Then this season revives Maria La Guardia, the Captain, and her love affair with Dokes, a Haitian sergeant who hated Dexter and had seen him through, and her obsession, in continuation of Dokes's own obsession, against Dexter and she brings back out of the boxes the case of the Bay Harbor Butcher, but things have become tricky and since Dexter promised Deb not to compete with the police any more, he has to find other solutions than killing people and he becomes very good at framing them. He thus frames Maria who has tried and is trying to frame him. These two framers and their accomplices are like writing the new constitution of the Crime Republic, but that is easy, that is not even respectable, nor believable. And the framers lose their frames in the mean time and have to come back to the radical solution: dispose of the menace.<br /><br />I am afraid I have to say this season is packed with action and dynamic intrigue, but the main and most successful actor has become the mosquito in the very opening credit sequence, even if its nlife is very short-lived. Even the love of Deb for Dexter is turned into something perverse and sickening. Crime corrupts and absolute crime corrupts absolutely.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUasy, that is not even respectable, nor believable.

1781162646|5.0|If you still believe Stephen King is still the master of horror and nothing else, you will be highly disappointed. This book is partly a thriller, but essentially a social novel that deals with questions that have nothing to do with horror, except the mental horror that some extreme religious preaching and bigotry can represent in a society of liberal and free humanistic thinking.<br /><br />But this book is a masterpiece and you will spend a full night reading it from cover to cover. So I would advise you to start it on a Friday night since on the following morning you may not be obliged to get up early and go to work. At least if you are one of these lucky schmucks who do not work on Saturdays, nor on Sundays. Not true of the people in this book since the employer is an amusement park owner and the industry is that of amusement parks, or carnivals, the ancestors of theme parks and other Disney Land and Disney World.<br /><br />What makes it such a masterpiece, such a short and mesmerizing story?<br /><br />First the story teller: an older man who tells us what happened to him when he was 21 or so, after his first year of college, when he accepted employment in the amusement park Joyland in North Carolina for the whole summer. The distance this older story teller establishes between himself and the character is very interesting: the vision of an older man on what he was when a young greenie in social experience. This life in 1973 for a young man and his college acolytes just one college year after high school graduation is fascinating, sex life of course which is in fact very limited, love life which is slightly more developed though it is more lover dumping for him and it is the poor young greenie man who is dumped by his high school sweetheart who left him a virgin on the shoulder of the road with the memory of just a few soiled pants and underwear by indirect manipulation. The vision of the world by this young man, Devin Jones, Jonesy for the Carnival world, is absolutely amazing and extremely moving and emotional. We have to fall in love with this young man, fully in love, including when he is playing the bigger than nature doggie for the kids in the amusement Park, when he is wearing the fur as he says.<br /><br />Second this first chap is surrounded by two close friends, friends for the summer who will become friends for life and who will be crucial in the story. Tom and Erin become a love-at-first-sight-and-for-life couple and Tom will be able to see the \\"ghost\\" of the girl who was assassinated in the park some years back, whereas Erin will do the research necessary to find the killer. The fact is that Devin will stay in the park after Labor Day to button it up for the winter as a permanent employee because he wants to know the secret, because he is not sure he just wants to go back to college, because he wants and needs some real time to think about the future. And beyond these three young people there are many other people, including a serial killer who killed many girls and the suspense is to find out who he is.<br /><br />Third and that is probably even better Devin manages to get acquainted with a young mother with a physically challenged young child who is bound to die soon. The woman is very reluctant at first to let Devin come close but the child, Michael, insists because he has some kind of psychic power and sees that Devin is his last chance before dying to go to the amusement park. With this woman and her son we reach a tremendous level of emotion: how can you satisfy the expectation of a ten year old child who knows he is going to die in the coming months and who just wants a last pleasurable experience before going back home, before stepping beyond the screens of the living. At this moment Stephen King proves his mastery in human emotions and sentiments and we are totally possessed by his tale. Even if it were only for that emotional level you should read that book at once.<br /><br />Stephen King adds a theme of his he has often touched. The mother's father and Michael's grandfather is one of these radio cum TV preachers who were starting to become more than famous in these early 1970s.  How can we accept the vision of hail, brimstone and fire that rejects the daughter when she rejects the bigotry and starts having some kind of free life that made her pregnant? How can anyone decent accept the idea that Michael's physical challenge is the punishment of god against his own mother who did not respect the bigotry of her father? There are many pages of pure joy and pleasure in the deepest emotional experience we can feel in our heart, mind and senses, joy and pleasure that brings up the light of some better future that might be free of such fundamentalist fanaticism.<br /><br />Then the thriller part is fascinating too, but I will not reveal the killer, of course not. I will not reveal the end either but rest assured that Devin will become the prisoner, hostage and next victim of the killer. And Michael knew it all along, without maybe knowing the identity of that monstrous serial killer.<br /><br />And you will absolutely share in full communion the last scene of the novel after Michael's death. So beautiful, so alas impossible in so many countries where funerals are over regulated. But Stephen King imagines the last voyage of dead Michael in the most realistic way that nevertheless makes him fly to the sun. The dream of all children who are doomed to live in a wheel chair.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUheme of his he has often touched.

B008JFUPK8|3.0|It appears that due to a weak script the filmmakers opted for as many special effects as possible.  The story opens on Krypton (which looks like [[ASIN:B00006JDVV Reign of Fire]]) where Jor-El is telling the rulers, who wear total body chainmail, that the planet is going to blow because they were mining the planet's core.  Then Gen. Zod shows up with his #2 gal in tow and starts shooting. Jor-El gets Krypton's codex, Krypton's people DNA and puts it into Kal-El's body (?). Kal-El is sent on his way and Zod and his posse are sent to the Phantom Zone.<br /><br />Told in occasional flash backs that are not in chronological Clark's childhood unfolds briefly with John Kent overseeing [[ASIN:B003Y5USG4 Twister]] due to...A DOG! We do see Clark wearing a Kansas City Royals T-shirt, we are treated to as much product placement as possible. As an adult he leads a life akin to [[ASIN:B000FDDYPA The Incredible Hulk - The Complete First Season]] as he travels around from job to job, clothes getting tore-up along the way.  Eventually Lois Lane pulls the whole story together.<br /><br />Zod shows up on Earth requesting Kal-El show himself.  From there it turns into [[ASIN:B00008G8M4 Independence Day]]/[[ASIN:B00005B8UD V: The Original TV Miniseries]]. What Zod aspires to do is so complicated that the characters in the movie have to explain it to the viewers. Henry does the voice well.  It just seems with 70 years of material that they could have come up with something.  At one point we do see 'Luther Corp' in print.  For the most part to me this looks like an updated...version of [[ASIN:B000059XUI Superman II]] but without any of the original fun. It sets up for another movie which hopefully might have some personality/fun which this lacks. Oh, and we are exposed to battery, ugly and unneeded.<br /><br />Who will play Lex Luther?

B008JFUPK8|5.0|WOW! What a film, the finest film of the summer so far.  I enjoyed Man of Steel so much I really did not know where to start with my review, I had to rewrite the first paragraph a couple of times.  Should I begin with the astonishing action and effects or the characters that come alive on the screen?  Maybe I should talk first about Zack Snyder, and with his direction of Man of Steel he solidifies as one of the best modern day directors along with the likes of Christopher Nolan and David O. Russell.  I thought about first talking about the characters and how they came alive on screen giving emotional depth and impact to the film, but I have decided to first talk about my knowledge and opinion of Superman, in that way you can understand how surprising it is for me to love Man of Steel.<br /><br />In all honesty my attitude toward Superman and the Superman comics is one of indifference.  Clark Kent or Superman was just never a compelling character to me.  I mean come on he is essentially a god, and was so invincible that the writers of the comics had to find some kind of weakness for Superman and came up with the lame excuse of Kryptonite.  It just seemed ridiculous to me.  My only contact with Superman in the comics was with the whole Death of Superman saga when the Death of Superman storyline came out in 1992 it captivated me.  The comics were brilliantly written, and the story was emotionally compelling, but then DC writers decided to make clones or whatever of Superman, and what was even more of a middle finger to the fans was that the fans brought Superman back to life and so quickly.  It just came of as an insult to fans, and I do not understand how fans of the comics and the character could forgive that slight so easily.  Needlessly to say that turned me off to the comics.  I still watched the cartoons along with the old Christopher Reeve films and the regrettable Superman Returns.  My favorite adaptation of Superman was in the Lois & Clark television show staring Dean Kane as Clark Kent/Superman, and Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane.  It was well crafted and Kane and Hatcher had chemistry on screen, but still I was never that impressed with the character and my opinion over the years has turned to indifference until the Man of Steel.  DC comics along with the heavily underrated Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have created a near masterpiece in Man of Steel that pulled me into Superman's universe making me emotionally invested in Superman, and the rest of the characters creating the best film of the summer so far, and one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />I cannot speak on accurate the storyline is compared to the comics, so I will not discuss or try and compare the two.  The script was written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, and together they do a superb job of creating a realistic world for Superman and what would it be like if Superman really appeared on Earth along with our reactions toward him and the reality if someone like Superman got involve in a battle in a major city like New York.  The two writers along with Snyder bring to life Krypton like I have never seen before.  I do not know if what happens in the film actually happened in the comics, and honestly I do not care if it did, because I loved the world Goyer and Nolan wrote, and that Snyder brought to life.  On Earth Clark struggles to find his place in the world where he grew up, yet is an alien to it.  Clark becomes a wanderer traveling from place to place helping people along the way, and in doing so he finds a friend and confidant in Lois Lane.  Clark is forced to make a decision about the direction of his life when General Zod appears demanding that Earth hand over Superman to him.  Does Clark keep his identity hidden because he does not know if he can trust the humans or not, or does he turn himself over to Zod even though he knows without a doubt that General Zod cannot be trusted?  The depth of the writing is as I said outstanding givingeverything you could want from a terrific film.<br /><br />Who do DC and Snyder cast to play Superman?  It is an important question, because without the right actor for the role a Superman film will fail, and I believe you need an actor with both the acting ability along with the physical presence to play the iconic character.  Reeves did an admirable job in the role through four films while Kane lacked the acting ability to pull off the emotional depth I think the character should have, and Brandon Routh was just a plain terrible choice to play Superman.  Henry Cavill I believe was the perfect choice as he has both the physical presence and acting ability to pull off playing a god on Earth, and Cavil performance splendidly showing viewers how conflicted Clark is about whom he is where he comes from, and who he supposed to become.  Amy Adams is gives a great performance as Lois Lane the investigative journalist for the Daily Planet.  Along with having great chemistry with Cavill she shows that Lois is more than just a pretty face, and a damsel in distress.  Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as Jor-El, Clark's biological father giving an emotional performance especially in the beginning of the film on Krypton.  Michael Shannon has already given a great performance earlier this year in Mud, that I believe he should be nominated for his role as a supporting actor.  Shannon's performance in Mud was more subdued than in the Man of Steel, but playing General Zod you should expect that.  I have read criticism of his performance in his performance as Zod, but I thought he did a wonderful job playing the flawed character.  Zod is a man whose job it to protect and ensure the survival of the people of Krypton at all costs even if it means damning his own soul in the process.  Zod I do not believe is a truly evil character, he is doing what he believes he has to do to ensure the survival of his race and Shannon does a good job displaying that especially one scene in the film when all hope is lost for him and his people.  The rest of the supporting cast does a good job.  Diane Lane does a good job as Martha Kent as does Laurence Fishburne who gives a good performance in his limited role as Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is does a decent job as Colonel Nathan Hardy.  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent or maybe it had to do more with the how the character was written than Costner's performance.  It just seemed like Goyer and Nolan did not know exactly what to do with the character and his relationship with Clark.<br /><br />For all the criticism Zach Snyder gets he is without question on of the best visual directors around, and has proven so with 300 and Watchmen.  Snyder finds a way to bring his films to life for his audience pulling them into his films like no other director can, and he does it again with the help of Warner Brothers, DC and a large budget.  The effects are breathtaking from the war on Krypton to Superman battling two other Krytonians in Smallville are mesmerizing, and I do not believe any other director could bring to life Superman like Snyder had.  His visual expertise along with the CGI bring to life the action making to real, and that what you are seeing is actually happing, and is that not the point of great CGI in that you cannot tell the difference in what is real and what is fake, or that the CGI and action is so good that the viewer does not care, and that is what you get with Man of Steel that Superman action film fans have always wanted as well as showing the devastating impact of gods fighting on Earth.<br /><br />I really do not understand why people bash Zach Snyder.  The man is a really good film director with an outstanding visual eye.  I am not a big fan of 300, but the film was visually wonderful.  With Watchmen Snyder beautifully brought to life one of the best comic graphic novels ever, and created one of the best comic films to date.  Here in Man of Steel he continues his journey in becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood.  With the help of Nolan and Goyer, Snyder creates a beautiful film and a memorable world of Superman that no director has done before.  The only problem with the production of the film is with the score that was done by Hans Zimmer which is surprising because I usually love his film scores, but with Man of Steel the music was a little too bombastic in tone, which I thought took away from the film.<br /><br />What are the critics thinking I do not know, because I loved Man of Steel.  Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Superman comics or the character.  Who knows, but I thought the Man of Steel was an excellent film with great direction, a well-crafted screenplay, well written characters that were wonderfully performed along with simply amazing visuals and effects that make Man of Steel the best film of the summer, one of the best films of the year and a must for comic and non-comic fans alike.  I think DC has finally realized what they do to continue their longevity of the comic properties and though I am definitely not a DC fan I am surprisingly looking forward to a sequel and what DC does next with its properties.  I highly recommend Man of Steel and I do not think anyone should be disappointed with the film.

B00821PCJS|4.0|The first time I watched this show, I really didn't care for it. I think I watched half the pilot show and wrote it off. Then my friends kept raving about the second season and so I decided to give it a second look.<br /><br />I would have to say that if you can muscle your way through the first episode, then your going to love the series. The character development and story line have improved a great deal. They do a nice job of providing back story without sacrificing the current story line. I am hooked and can't wait to see where season three takes us.
B000I62JBE|5.0|Cool movie! Just when you think you have it figured out it turns on you. Deniro once again SCORES! Watch it.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|The most criticisms in the reviews about the lack of detail refers to something that has happens to the 3 albums produced by Ben Hillier: The international releases has been heavily compressed (search for \\"loudness wars\\" in Google or take a look to this explanatory video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ).<br /><br />After listen the uncompressed version offered by HDtracks I can say that they almost ruined the album. This release has a dynamic range value of 6 meanwhile the HDtracks' version of 11. The same value that the vinyl edition!<br />http://www.dr.loudness-war.info/index.php?search_artist=&search_album=delta+machine<br /><br />This edition lacks detail and depth and it's tired of hearing. So, if you like Depeche Mode, do yourself a favor... Do NOT buy this edition. Download it from HDtracks, it will cost you the same money, you'll get an audiophile grade-high resolution version without compression plus an extra track (Heaven - Live from Studio) and also you can convert it to regular Cd audio or to mp3. Or simply buy the vinyl.<br /><br />The album is great!!!

B00C7JGDBW|2.0|This movie did not make any sense. If you have seen The Wizard of Oz, then you will be very puzzled by this movie. And if you haven't seen the Wizard of Oz, then you will still find this movie to be strange. There was no magic and wonder in this movie, and the acting from the main characters is horrible. The only one who did a decent job was Michelle Williams in the role of Glenda the Good Witch. If you really feel that you must see this movie, don't go into it expecting a lot, that way you won't be very disappointed; which you will be.. trust me.

0670026557|5.0|This book is the proof from a professor that people who consistently help others without expecting anything in return can with a few adjustments become successful, instead of burning out and being a doormat.<br /><br />There are three types of people: Givers, Takers, and Matchers.  Givers are like the sun and illuminate those around them, takers like a black hole.  Matchers are about reciprocity. Each type can achieve success in a different way.  This book has interesting stories from a wide variety of professions, industries, public and private people, athletes, CEO's, lawyer, entertainment folks, politicians, and technologist.<br /><br />Many of the givers are not household names yet they are in their world the most respected and successful people around.  Adam Rifkin, a giver, says you should be willing to do anything for anyone in 5 minutes or less.  David Hornik, a giver, says I want to demonstrate success that doesn't come at someone else's expense.<br /><br />He has classified givers as selfless or other-directed.  Selfless givers don't take care of themselves, burnout, or are seen as doormats.  The three major traps they fall into are being too trusting, too empathic, and too timid.  They help others to their determent.  Other-directed givers ask for help when they need it, focus their giving into meaningful chunks of time, get feedback, and are validated from their giving.  People are a mixture of all three types and it is situational.  You can rate yourself with an assessment at www.giveandtake.com it is 15 questions and allows you to compare your profile with others similar to you and has the option to ask others for their input on you.<br /><br />I was curious about the role of biology on giving and wish this was more than a footnote in the book, \\"Are women more likely to be givers than men?\\"<br /><br />I loved this book.  It has put words to what I have spent my life learning the hard way.  The insights on powerless communication and the two types of givers hit home for me. This book shows how to give in a sustainable way.  The last chapter is called Actions for Impact.  It's a list of ten resources for applying the lessons in the book for healthy giving.vers hit home for me. This book shows how to give in a sustainable way.

068484267X|4.0|The book Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a very intriguing book. It follows the life of the author who goes through many hardships in both Ireland and New York. The book shows his coming of age and the struggles he goes through. He loses many family members throughout the book and must fight through poverty. His family is very poor and his father is an alcoholic who spends all of their money on alcohol. Angela's Ashes is a good book but it is not for those looking to read a cheery and uplifting story. I thought it was well written and interesting. The author made sure to give the reader a sense of his age throughout various points in the book because he ages greatly over the course of the story. The author leaves the end of the book at a cliffhanger and it makes the reader want to read the next books in the series.<br />Over the course of the book he gets bullied and made fun of for various reasons. In America he gets made fun of because of his Irish accent. Then when he moves back he gets made of for the American accent he acquired. He has many bad experiences such as losing siblings and his father being and alcoholic. Author writes in a very matter of fact manner. He manages to do it well and everything flows. He does distract the story by using unnecessarily large and complicated words. He writes everything in a way that a normal person can understand and does not try to overcomplicate everything. McCourt stopped the book at a good point in his life story. It leaves the reader at a kind of cliffhanger and makes them want to read the other books in the series. It was quite frank and even dry at times. Used in moderation this is not a bad thing but much of the book was written in this style. Granted much of the book was written from his point of view when he was still a very young boy. In addition, he does not add much embellishment to whatever events happen. He is also not very descriptive about the environment or people. He gives very brief and undetailed descriptions about the environment he is in and the people he interacts with.<br />This is an autobiographical book. It would appeal to anyone with an interest in learning about the lives of other people. The reader does not need to have a specific set of interests in order to enjoy this book. There are many people with many different lifestyles who have read this book and enjoyed it. Angela's Ashes is well suited to people fifteen or older. There is mature content which is a bit much for anyone under fifteen. There is not a specific gender bias in this book. However, it may be suited better to males because there is some relatable material.<br />This is a relatively accomplished book having won the Pulitzer award. Many positive reviews have been written about it too. One review by Amazon.com stated \\"This powerful and heart-rending testament to the resiliency and determination of youth is populated with memorable characters and moments, and McCourt's interpretation of the narrative and the voices it contains will leave listeners laughing through their tears.\\" Finishing this book will leave the reader thirsting for more. To find out what happens to Frank after the conclusion of Angela's Ashes, one can read the sequel called Tis: A Memoir. He has also written Teacher Man: A Memoir which recounts his experiences of teaching high school in New York for 30 years.<br />Overall, this book is a fantastic read that will take the reader on a journey through the very difficult life and childhood of an Irish man who lived in the U.S. It sheds light on how alcoholism can tear a family apart and affect more lives than just that of the alcoholic. Over the course of the book, he loses many people in his life which adds to the hardship. It is a book that Almost anyone can enjoy and is well suited to those who like to read autobiographies.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game...fun. Flashlight mode could make you crosseyed. It is a bit slow moving compared to others on Zynga. I do love hidden picture games.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book when I was much younger, and I just re-read it because I was thinking of allowing my 10-year-old son to read it this summer.  I remember loving it last time, and I think it was even better this time.  Ender is an amazing boy who takes an amazing journey.  I worry a little bit about the violence in the book, but I do not believe it is romanticized in any way.  If you aren't familiar with the story, it's about a young boy who is sent off to a kind of space military academy to train to fight in a war against an alien race which came close to wiping out humanity in the last war.  It also tells the story of what happens to the siblings he leaves behind.  I will be letting my son read it, and I encourage any other fans of the genre to pick it up.  A true classic.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like the city game it very addictive.I can't seem to put it down. I want to play all the time.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|All the real action seem to have happened near the end of the book.<br />It never explain what happened to the other men that were with Lane.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Is a great movie a wish the video quality was better, I will rent next time through my PS3.  You pay to much for a bad steaming

B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Slow in the beginning but picks up. Very good for a TV series. Graphics and special effects are like a movie.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|I absulotly love this movie. Real emotion and organizes confusion<br />A little gory in places but then so is war<br />Great video and a little humor thrown in. Proves there's always a little heaven in a disaster area
B00CWVGNS8|5.0|I liked the seriousness and depth of this film which is a powerful depiction of the lasting impact of loss and grief, no matter what one's sexual orientation might be. The film takes on the subjects of love and loss respectfully. Perhaps because it does not derive from the U.S., which perplexingly has offered inconsistent quality (acting, directing, and writing) and often devolves into camp, over-dramatization, or cliche, this film crosses none of those lines, is subtle, kind, and satisfying emotionally. The end of the movie - no spoiler here - leaves you wanting more; wanting more story, wanting more for the characters, and wanting another film in less than 10 years (fingers crossed).
B003H9MSPG|2.0|I don't know if the gun that i got was defective or what but it is the least accurate Nerf gun in my entire arsenal. My maverick shoots further and more accurately than this thing. Yes it looks cool. Yes it's really fun to pull a massive blue rifle out of no where. But, if they're trying to sell this as the \\"super accurate sniper's weapon of choice\\" or whatever, it falls severely short of the mark.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Yup, that is what I meant -- it is simply addictive.  I have to stop playing it at night because I am missing my bedtime. Beware!
B000AOA2G8|5.0|This worked perfectly for removing both ends of my Sugino bottom bracket. So far I have had no problems with it at all. I would say the price is a little steep, but this is invaluable for bike maintenance for me.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was an amazing, emotional, journey. The terror of the tsunami and seeing your family washed away, The acting was powerful,I cried throughout the movie. I Highly recommended this film!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I've always liked this group, but am glad I waited for a &#34;greatest hits&#34;. This has all the ones I remember LOVING back in high school.  Good addition to my music library.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's like a good movie that never needs to end! I like how the show had good actors from the very start.
B0052GACNM|5.0|CD was wonderful!  Tony can still belt out a tune and did a wonderful job teaming up with the various artists on the CD.<br />I would recommend this album to others!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades has been breathtaking,from the beginning.I fell in love with Fifty.His Kinky F.... was as bit much,but I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy.Excellent book.MeMe
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this miniseries, and have been passing it around to friends.  The UK version is always better (i.e., The Office!).  I had missed the first two seasons, but it was getting so much hype before season 3 that I decided to purchase the first 2 seasons and get up to speed.  Had a marathon DA weekend and enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Even though I have temple run 2 I play this game more often. In a  road trip I can take my kindle out and play this game and it will keep me entertained for most of the trip actually.
0307950689|4.0|I forgot that I had read it years ago and bought the book.  It is one of the few books that I could enjoy reading again.  Definitely a page turner.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I Just Don't Care. Not at all really. It came in my email and I'm bored so I decided to open it and give a rate. I'm just going to go. Bye
B00BI745AA|2.0|Perhaps I've seen it too many times, but this version was low on my enjoyment list.<br />Not great musical material, to me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun and enjoyable to play. It keeps the mind going but not for long as this game is quite easy. If is also short unless there is more it made me rate after the 8th room. But it was a fun game all in all.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and now my kindle.  Also, use on my computer.  I use Evermore daily on all platforms.  The app works well on my Kindle Fire HD. Nice display, syncs nicely and no lagging.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Compelling plot, virtuous heros, illustrates empathy and morality. Great pick for adolescents due to the underlying theme that there's honor in kindness, strength in compassion.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is terrific!  I now have to wait until Jan 2014 for the next Season.  I'll never last!!  This series is highly recommended
B0013TO3HS|5.0|Golden Compass is a classic story made into an excellent movie.  Great actors make the story enjoyable to watch. Although I can understand the difficulty it is too bad the other books in the series could not be adapted for a movie presentation.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I had higher hopes for the movie.  Franco never really sold me on his character.  The witches stole the show, of course.  I am glad I didn't pay theater price.  Not the worst movie, but not as good as I hoped it would be.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I loved this app before the upgrade. Now looking to replace this app to something more like it was before...which makes me sad. :-(
0062218867|3.0|In some ways, &#34;Snuff&#34; was a bit of a letdown. There was no dramatical tension; at no point did it ever feel that Vimes couldn't handle the situation in front of him, except maybe at the climax. The prose is still excellent (although Willikins was an overused character and I was tired of him by the third monologue about how dangerous and mean he was) and the story is beautiful; the characters just didn't engage me as they usually do in a Discworld novel.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I can consistently count on this author to provide an historical novel that will keep me entertained and engaged.  The characters were colorful and the mysterious circumstances of the plot kept me guessing until the very end.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always, his characterization is superb, and his themes tug at our hearts. I never want his books to end. His motifs and parallels are subtlety done. Hosseini's writing makes me feel so connected to the world.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Although the details are breathtaking the story is hard to follow. If I hadn't seen the origi8nal I would not have known what was happening.
0425263924|5.0|The release of this book was long awaited and it was well enjoyed! It had a real surprise ending for me!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This story might be an autobiography of many a scorned wife. The story line is very believable and is very well written without too much sex.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. Good plot line with no slow times. I highly recommend this movie to be enjoyed on family night.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I love the young lawyer and so does my grandkids. He is older than my gandkids but they love the stories.
B000YPWDSS|4.0|Bought this for my wife, who very pleased with it, says Amy was a talented and gritty soul singer, among the best.
B001NXDIMK|4.0|Season Two is pretty good. It does a good job of continuing through with the story lines from Season One. I did enjoy the new characters introduced this time around as well as the dynamic between Ms Hewes & her family.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot wait until the next season to come out.  I watched them all so far and the last season leaves you wanting more.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game has gone above and beyond my expectation.  First its truely free.  You can buy extra stuff but you don't have to. Second there are so many quests your never get bored.  Third its very easy to follow so your have no trouble knowing how to do something.  I could go on and on but I will spare you all that and end saying way to go on a great game.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I don't know what else to say. This is a masterpiece and I would expect nothing less from David Gilmour.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is addictive. Didn't know how much fun i could have alone. I play several times a day. Try it you will have loads of fun.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I don't buy CDs unless I like every track on the album. I love how they stayed true to their sound, listen for yourself.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Some of the best 3D I have ever seen and when I have 100 plus 3D movies thats saying alot I almost returned it as $32, as thats way too mush just for one disc even if 3D, but disney has a code inside where you can get the 2D blu ray by mail for $5.99 so that makes it worth it, sharp image, great colors played on a 60in LED LG 480 hertz using LG shutter glasses, you eye popping 3D and bright colors with a great family film also this is the one to get, just make sure to use the coupon code to get you 2D disc.
B00004W221|5.0|This film is very motivational and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it more meaningful.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I own this product on both the iPhone and for Android.  Though the company has only released this app, they have obviously spent a lot of time and energy perfecting it.  I am always so impressed that they continue to support the program with free updates, whereas their competitors do the opposite.<br /><br />Remember, if you use your Google account with the PC/Mac-based software, always use 2-step authentication.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Somebody commented that it was a terrible story line. Who the \\"HELL!\\" watches a die hard movie expecting a storyline? I personally didn't like Bridget Jone's Diary because there wasn't enough explosions.
1401216676|5.0|I loved it when it was first released, but the colors in this edition are outstanding. Exactly what the artist intended them to be in the first place. Plus i loved the bonus story, and the foreword. Great buy, and if you already have the original, you still should get this, because this is the way it should have been done originally. Plus its fun to spot the differences between the 2.
B004EBBPU0|3.0|The movie was mis-named as it is all about Jim Morrison who happened to be in the doors. Was it really necessary to make this movie? Another true story about fantastic musical talent lost to drugs. Kilmer and Ryan play the parts well, Seeing it once is enough.
1401233376|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed the comic´s premise, and specially liked the alternate Batman.Flash is an awesome character, and this piece shows a new side to him. Masterfully drawn, inked and written, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.<br /><br />One other thing: Bruce Waynes reaction at the end. Never seen the Dark Knight quite like that before, and it was truly a moving moment.
0938045768|5.0|This book is an excellent source of information and a progression of fitness exercises. The progressively more difficult exercises build on each other and have given me insight into how I can reach my fitness goals over the course of the next year without spending money on trainers, machines, or gym memberships. The program has worked well, and the book is filled with sound advice. The title is a bit misleading and the first section of the book is historical backdrop of modern fitness techniques and their misleading and harmful consequences. Whether or not modern fitness is a harmful scam is irrelevant to the quality of exercises that are found in the rest of the book.<br /><br />A solid buy.
B000056NX5|5.0|I am so pleased that I purchased this dvd. I have always loved the music, but was not impressed with the original film.(too over the top). There is something really inspiring about this version.I saw elements of Star wars, West Side Story and  other things in this one. The storm troopers were very scary and very effective. One of the disciples looked like my nephew. A worthy addition to any collection.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|His style, his character development, his plot lines are still top notch and the standard by which other novelists strive to equal.  Always worth the money.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Using on my Kindle.  The game rolls easily, without lags. Offers several customizing options &amp; methods of play, including multiplayer.  Good for killing time!
B0046UGSNS|4.0|This is a comedy drama about a lesbian couple who are working to raise their children with the introduction of the child's actual father/semen donor. It provokes a difficult questions for an inseminated child and the decision to discover who the blood relatives are. I never knew myself in a world of semen collections and insemination that at certain age the child could get the information on the parent.<br /><br />Overall, well casted, it was a great role for Annette Bening and Julianne Moore who play roles of parents, partners, and opposite personalities that in many ways simulate the &#34;Traditional&#34; thought of household, not that the term means much of anything now. (I apologize if that term was found to be offensive by the reader). Overall, a few laughs and in many ways the movie is touching. Worth the time to watch it!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Awesome movie, me and the husband decided to do date night in!! Were able to rent it and play it on the ps3! Loved it and plan on buying it!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Fantastic acting, great plot! Every episode presents a new angle on the overlying plot and I want more after each!
B003AO1SVS|4.0|My wife found this group on line. Never heard of them before and I thought I pretty well knew almost anyone that was worth hearing. I was impressed with them and decided to get this album for my wife. Though not an album that the Black Keys normally turn out, it is a GREAT sounding album. There are a few songs I'm not really fond of but over all the majority of the album is really good. I bought it as a gift for my wife and it is a good investment for our music collection. It reminds me a little of CCR or John Fogerty as far as the sound. Some may think of others when they hear this one. I feel you can't go wrong on buying this one.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I was really dissapointed with this book.  It didn't keep my interest like the other 3 and I had a hard time finishing the whole book but had to if I wanted to continue to the next.  It might have been because I really hate the Cersei and this book had a large focus on her.  I really like the men characters and some of them were not in this book.  Sansa and Arya get a few short chapters but other than that it is Mostly Cersei, Jamie and Brienne.  They also introduced some new characters into this book which is starting to make it hard to remember who is who and where they fall in the big picture.  This also makes me concerned with how they are going to translate this book into the T.V. series (which I also love).  Not much happens and will make for a boring season.  Could have been better but maybe it's to set something up for what happens next.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He always catches his subject and makes his people real. Even though they and their lives certainly are very different from most of us, we get to know them and struggle with them in their their lives. His rhetoric is wonderful and some as  I read it almost sang. Once in a while, if I had put the book down or away for a bit, I did have trouble catching up to where I left off and where I should be in the world at large and with him or her as a person. He jumped continents and time freely. However, it made me a more careful reader. Loved it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app gives me an estimate on how much use I can get from my Kindle before charging and the time it will take to charge it via an outlet charger or by USB cable. It works and I probably use it more than I realize.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Just got it today, 6/13/13, after only ordering a few days ago. Perfect condition, lightweight, and easy to use with my new Kindle Fire (which I'm now obsessed with)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A Calculator is always handy to have around and this calculator is capable of meeting and exceeding all my needs
B002ZG976U|5.0|Some of the dialogue may be a little cheesy at times, but the music and dancing keep me from sitting still. Now I want the soundtrack.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app!  Very intuitive and easy to use.  Wanted something that my nieces and nephews would enjoy and this does the trick.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|An amazing account of human endurance and ingenuity.  It is a very exciting story of escape from a prison camp in Siberia during WWII without any maps. An amazing account!
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Imaginative story, serving escapism and our imaginations. Mediocre acting, partly due to the script. Villains are caricatures. Overall, likeable though not intellectually stimulating.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|What can one say about an artist at the top of his game that hasn't already been said before?  Nothing other than thank you for sharing his wonderful gift!  This album is wonderful!
B00CNGA1PS|1.0|This podcaster is just plain hard to figure out and unusable.  I'll stick with the BeyondPod app instead of this one.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|I recommend this movie to people who like actions and comedy's movies it was a great movie and a lot of humor
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|It is very good compare the thesis that generated the book (that is very interesting) with the book produced years latter. The &#34;seed&#34; for the book was the thesis  and &#34;the water and the sun&#34; was  the design and colaboration. The book itself is &#34;a case&#34; for business strategy  and for academic works that always remain on the shelves.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|Nice arrangements. The guest vocals were amazing. Close your eyes and he sounds so much like Nat , it's amazing
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|The disc as stated only comes with a 3-D version and a digital copy. For the steep price I paid, I thought Disney would embed the disc with both the 3-D and the 2-D versions, like so many other companies have done recently. Instead, Disney has left me with a film that will cause me constant eyestrain and pocket gouging. Like the Great Wizard of Oz, Disney is the master of trickery
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Saw the movie after the book. Naturally not as much details in the movie but it hit all the important parts.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An uncommon story.  Believable?  Well,  I suspended reality for a while and focused of the goodness of the characters involved.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Pushing those coins around can be a relaxing game, and it also has some strategic thinking. Best of it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|The composition are mind blowing and one can enjoy the tracks anywhere either while working at the desk or working out in the gym.
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|great movie for the kids,  broadcast from Amazon was great and cheaper then VUDU.... nice to have it for 48 hours so the kids can see it over and over again....
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Really! It takes you step by step through the process, with pictures with circles and arrows and everything.  Just what I needed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Every so often a book comes along that is such a delightful surprise, you just can't help but tell all your friends.  \\"Tangled\\" is one of those.<br /><br />Andrew Evans is that \\"guy.\\"  You know that guy?  The one that is promiscuous and so full of himself that you just know you shouldn't like him.  There's something about this guy, though.  Maybe it's his wit -- he's funny as hell -- or maybe it's the unique way in which he views the world and shares his observations.  As much as you think you should avoid a connection with his character, there's just something compelling about him.  And if I felt it, imagine poor Katherine Brooks.  Don't worry.  Kate is nobody's fool -- least of all Drew's.  She makes him work for it, and wastes no time calling him on all his shenanigans.<br /><br />How does the reader get to know so much about Drew, you ask?  Well, let me tell you.  \\"Tangled\\" is written from Drew's perspective.  No actually, it's more than that.  Drew is the narrator -- telling the story as though the reader is on the outside looking in.  The story moves effortlessly between a first-person account of Drew and Kate's expected (and unexpected) encounters and the Narrator voice where the author \\"breaks the fourth wall,\\" and Drew speaks directly to his audience sharing his wisdom and personal observations in a humorous and endearing way.<br /><br />Emma Chase has created nothing less than a masterpiece here.  It's a love story full of all the angst and steam you want and expect from a book in this genre, but to call it an erotic romance would simply sell it short.  It's really more like an experience; one that you'll want to have again and again -- kinda like hot se* ... well, you get the picture.  \\"Tangled\\" is on my re-read list for sure.<br /><br />Can't wait for book two --\\"Twisted\\"

B002ZM74Y6|3.0|I guess if you know the mafa, then the language and power explains itself.  I would not be able to handle the stress of knowing if I had done all the jobs right so I would not get shot for something.

B005ELZMH6|4.0|A great second album for these talented sibs.  Several of the cuts are raw, but KDL always deliver.  Saw them in San Francisco last year and they were great.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|The story is different then the note book, but with the suspense of escape and survival! With of corse a love twist.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The best period love story ever. It will touch your heart and leave you wanting more.I highly recommend it for purchase.
B003N0XDT4|4.0|This got rid of the annoying background noise on My PC's sound card. Coupled with some good headphones, the sound, especially the bass, is amazing.  I use it everyday, all day at work.
B0095P31L6|1.0|I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this horrible movie. It is not kid-friendly in the least! Crude and just plain boring.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|We really enjoyed it and it was a shame that the series was cancelled so early on. We would really like for them to reboot the series. The big movie &#34; Serenity &#34; was a great way to enjoy again the characters.
0425263924|5.0|I can't wait for more i wasn't ready for Gideon and Eva story to end! The book was very interesting and sexy! And had a lot going on.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's amazing downtime game and you can lose time playing. I like playing right before bed time. good bye and good night.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I take the chance to use it, and it does an OK job, most of the times. But in one ocasion, it didn't get right the page boundaries, which made it a bit difficult to adapt. You can easily get a pdf with the images, but couldn't find how to export just the images, since when you share it, it transform the pages to a pdf.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|I have purchased all of the &#34;Dr. Panda&#34; games for my four year old daughter, she loves them. I think they are great for her. There is plenty to do in each of the apps and they are based on learning and creating. There is a &#34;reward&#34; system set up on them too which I think is nice. On Dr. Panda's Handyman he gives her a high-five when she completes a project and she just loves that. I will be watching for the next one to come out. Definitely worth the small cost!

B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I heard people complain about how Disney separated the dvd, Blu-ray, 3D etc..I got my 3D Blu-ray disc for $5.99 at Disney movie rewards .com if you purchase the Blu-ray + dvd combo pack you have a reward inside the coupon to order the 3d version for just $5.99 directly from Disney.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Michael's painstaking research confirms what I have suspected all along: that the cravings we feel for not only junk food, but all processed food isn't an accident, it's by design. The storytelling brings to life the history of the food industry in the US (and now the world really). My only critique is that at the very end, after showing the parallels between our brains' response to salt, sugar and fat and drugs like heroin, he says that we still have a choice. In theory yes. But, this statement hit me cold after arguing the whole book that the foods are engineered to be addictive. I don't disagree that we have personal responsibility. But, if these foods are truly addictive, we have about as much choice as an alcoholic has in deciding to take another drink or not. Regardless, this is a fantastic read and everyone interested in what's in their food should read this book.
B001HC8516|5.0|I recommend to every single female!  It's the solid advice and inspiration we all need sometimes, especially the stuff we don't want to hear.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I enjoy match 3 games with something a little different about them - and this really fits the bill.  Levelling up my little man was very addictive - to the extent that I continued playing after I'd won 'freedom' so that I could max him out!<br /><br />I'm normally quite fast at finding matches, but this game requires you to be extra fast if you want to stay alive for longer.  If you're slower, then don't worry, it's still very playable, it will just take you more runs/games to win freedom - but since the game is very enjoyable, that's actually probably a good thing.<br /><br />Definitely one I'll play through more than once.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Bought the new season for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it! He's watched like 8 episodes already!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the best ways to pass a little extra time. This game encourages you to reach out and make new friends to complete collections, and offers little boosts called power-ups to add extra excitement.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|I enjoyed watching this.  I think it is well put together and covers a lot of material that adds to the stuff already covered in the Beatles anthology series.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in George.

B00CHI5B7A|5.0|The movie was full of suspence and drama. Loved the era setting and the scenes shot in a dark background.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Such a cute and funny movie.  Very entertaining.  It was a very creative movie with great humor.  Worth watching and good for children a bit older.  Not really appropriate for the very young.  Video game violence is present but they even make that funny.
B009POHHRG|5.0|The Belief that mankind created the notion of morality and most people are basicly good is questioned. The Joker believes that everyone is \\"just one bad day\\" away from his level of madness.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I was determined to find this album as disappointment, as rave reviews and a #1 Billboard debut rarely bode well for the type of music I love.  This album, however, seduced me in a uniquely twisted manner.  Like a bad relationship, the music tears into your soul and departs only after having revealed the truth of itself.  This time around QOTSA is so goddamned 'real' it's almost irritating.  The pleasures of this album reside in the revelation of the pain that is endemic to the human experience.  Consider yourself forewarned.
B0064W65SO|4.0|The first person narration of Jim Gordan and Bruce Wayne/Batman make this story unique. Do not expect it to be intense like \\"The Killing Joke.\\"
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I am so in love with this album..Tom Keifer gives so much of himself in every song. My CD is on repeat..and I swear it plays at least 10x a day maybe more! I have nothing else to say but.. if you loved Cinderella, this will NOT disappoint !
B00847KFDS|5.0|I bought this album after seeing a recommendation on my Kindle Fire, and I am very glad I did, because it is a great album with some old favorites that sound both familiar and at the same time, brand new. There are also songs I had never heard before, which are quickly becoming new favorites, especially WROTE A SONG FOR EVERYONE, with Miranda Lambert. Banjos, fiddles, guitars, country, rock, various artists singing with John Fogerty--it is all good.

B009NY43NY|5.0|I do not know how Charlaine Harris continues to write such breathtaking novels about Sookie and her &#34;friends&#34;.  I truly feel as if  know Sookie personally and all her frieds, enemies and relatives.  I relish every novel and find  difficult to wait until the next novel.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its a good game but its hard to craft sometimes and it needs more time because you only get 15 min

0544002318|5.0|Christopher McDougall's Born to Run, which features several non-Tarahumara runners, including Scott Jurek, is my favorite book about running. So, it Eat & Run, which includes an entire chapter with Jurek's version of the events involving \\"A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen\\" was an easy choice. The author's claim to fame is Ultras, but the fact that he is a vegan, is, to many, just as amazing. In this book, he recounts his upbringing, which was difficult due to his mother's afflicted with MS and his father's strict disciplinarian style of parenting, and his transformation from competitive skier to ultramarathoner. He explains (p 6) the ever-changing reasons why he runs, which, ultimately, comes down to this, \\"...because overcoming the difficulties of an ultramarathon reminded me that I could overcome the difficulties of life, that overcoming difficulties was life.\\" The author's recounting of races is entertaining, but the book also contains useful information about running, including: the benefits of supplemental training, breathing, the physiological facts behind hitting the wall, protein consumption, the benefits of eating vegan and a number of delectable-sounding vegan recipes. To top it off, Jurek, and co-author Steve Friedman, have composed a well-written book, which is, I confess, important to me. Such was not the case in a more recent read, Dean Karnazes' Run! In summary, you do not have to be an ultrathoner or a vegan to benefit from Eat & Run. Best of the book: recounting of races, running and training tips, recipes, relationships (with fellow competitors and friends) and the writing. Also good: Ultramarathon Man by Dean Karnazes, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami and (for women) Mile Markers by Kristin Armstrong.
6305882592|5.0|Captures your attention right away and takes unexpected turns throughout the movie.  I remember this movie when it came out.  It was a sleeper but as word spread it became a classic.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm tryin to give this book 4.5 stars but can't. This book was engrossing. And watch out for the Epilogue.  I went back & read several chapters of this book again. I read a guide to this book, while readin the book, that's how good this book is. I wanted to b sure I didn't miss a single thing. The reason I'm givin it 4.5 stars, is b/c some of the descriptiveness was unnecessary & I didn't really care for Sam's storyline. I only see his storyline being there for a bigger purpose. If not, I'll b slightly aggrivated b/c his chapters were a waste of my time. I give much respect to Martin for the characters he created, in a world he created, w/ a history HE CREATED. If u didn't understand what I meant, let me say it more clearly. THE WORLD HE CREATED HAD IT'S OWN HISTORY. And not some eluded to or vague history, a fully fleshed out history. I'm not gonna go on & on about this book, I could but I won't, sometimes less is more. This is the 3rd in thee series, so if u're about to read this book, u don't need me to tell u how good it is, u already know. My absolute favorite characters r Arya & Tyrion, can't get enuff of'em. And the Epilogue I told u to watch out for, there's a certain point where I wanted to put the book down, stand on my feet & clap. Feast For Crows gets away from our main characters, so I know I may b a bit disappointed w/ it. I can tell u I may throw my Kindle against the wall in a fit of rage, if what happens in the Epilogue doesn't come up in that book. And I'm gonna say a prayer every night that the Lord will preserve Martin till the last book is done. THANK U & GOODNIGHT.

B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Great story as usual, happy with how things ended for Sookie but some things left hanging or not concluded in a way I would have hoped.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|a combination of Character and Projector, with some feel carrying over from Void and Fiction. I think this album is better than the last few and more dynamic than any since the Projector/Haven sound.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This picture was fantastic to say the least. This is easily one of Denzel Washington's best performances of his entire career.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|being a Megadeth fan, you pretty much have to be ready for anything. From masterpeices to pieces of other stuff. As far as i am concerned there are 3 eras of Megadeth, and this album falls right between era 2 and 3. If i had to place it somewhere in the evolution of sound, it would replace RISK , between Cryptic and Hero. Basically this album is more metal than Cryptic, but more rock sounding than Hero. The overall style varies, at the surface it is reminescent of Countdown, but actually reminds me alot more of Hero, only executed 10x better. There is a little bit of everything on this one. But for sure this album is moving away from the Endgame sound and more to the Countdown sound. Because of a few soft tracks (Super Collider, Burn...think \\"CrushEm\\" for comparison), i give it a 4, but it also has a few that are as good as any...most notably, 'Dance in the Rain' starts off melodic and heavy, then shifts into a riff that sounds like it was off 'kill em all', topped off with some Dave Draimen guest vocals. Additionally some favorites are 'Kingmaker', Built for War' and 'Don't Turn Your Back'. The drumming stands out on this album, i think that deserves a mention, additionally, some of the best song writing since System as an overall album. Dave's vocals don't seem as forced and the song really feel natural, the chemistry has everything falling into place. Ultimately i think this will be very much like Cryptic Writings, feeling soft at a glance, but becoming a favorite over time for its melodic, diverse sound and great song writing throughout. thank you
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I thought this app was ok in general. I just have not had much use for this app as of late.
B009NY43NY|5.0|My absolute favorite series!!  I am so sad it's over! I'm sad Eric and Sookie did not end up together, but somehow Sam makes sense.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|I enjoyed this little hooror flick. Chastain was superb as the reluctant hero. The ending was a little bit shocking.
B001AJ09JW|4.0|Emily Browning was in it. That made the movie for me. she's a babe now thts she's older. Cute to see her a a kid. The rest was ok.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love playing this game. It does frustrate me sometimes on the more difficult levels. But I like a challenge.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Rulez best Tv Series ever. Hot chicks, Action, Swords a must have. The best no doubt. Watch it now, Yah
B008220DGE|4.0|This flick is not for everyone to be honest. But for me personally I thought it was quite entertaining. Especially Joaquin's exhilarating performance is a treasure to behold.
0061122416|2.0|I've wanted to read this book for quite a while, after all the praise it has received. In fact, I tried starting it numerous times, but always stopped after a couple pages. This time, I was determined to give it a whirl. Frankly, it just never grabbed me. Just a simple tale of a boy seeking out a hidden treasure; the book tries to hard to sound wise and philosophical. There are pithy \\"words of wisdom\\" all over the place, none of which are meaningful in the slightest. Lots of sayings along the lines of \\"When one seeks out one's dreams, the world conspires to help one succeed\\" (as a paraphrased example). Statements like this sort of nonsense are made continuously. We follow the boy as he crosses the desert in search of his dream and his treasure, and follow along as he gets robbed a few times and outwits some armed tribesmen a few times. Nothing grabbed me in this book. The ending is somewhat clever and humorous and ironic, though. I will give the book credit for that.<br /><br />For me, the book was boring, and a chore to get through. Seems like it might appeal more to young males, so perhaps I was the wrong demographic.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed the movie. It was very well directed and acted. I jumped a few times and the movie kept my attention throughout.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|That pretty much says it all.  I just can't wait until they come to SD to play the music live.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|We have now watched this film several times.  I plan to watch it with my granddaughter when she's around six or seven,  IMHO, there are two reasons why this film is so good ...<br /><br />1. Jaden is at the perfect, most precious age for a child/adolescent and yet his acting is superbly engaging.  I continue to be amazed at how any director can extract such persuasive acting from such a young person.  I hope that Will is extremely proud of this young man.<br /><br />2.  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL -- this film helps to inculcate strong moral and ethical values!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is pretty awesome. I was super surprised that I really enjoyed the whole album vs just the three songs I knew.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I absolutely loved this series!  I fell in love with the characters and read the entire series back to back and got the rest of my family, including my mom and sister, husband, and child, and their friends to read it!  It was a great read when I was looking for a series to read after finishing the twilight books, the hunger games, etc.  This was a nice series, though not comparable to them, in any way, shape, or form.<br /><br />About the movie and books:  The movie was such a disappointment as it did NOT follow the book series at ALL!  if you think you can watch the movie the movie and have it be a close tie-in to the book, think again!  Major characters were completely missing from the book, the characters in the movie look NOTHING like the book characters!  For example, Ridley is supposed to have blonde and pink hair, which is mentioned over and over in the books, yet, the movie has her having short, auburn hair!  Lena, should have black hair and green eyes, with a crescent shaped moon birthmark on her face.... the movie has brown hair, brown eyes, and NO BIRTH MARK!  Very bothersome.<br /><br />BOOKS ARE AWESOME THOUGH!  FORGET THE MOVIE!!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the first season wish the second was free on prime also. Great acting, story & love their interaction together.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a pretty good read.  The characters are interesting, the story-line was interesting, and it had you hoping that Jacob really didn't do it!  I would recommend this book, but it isn't in my top favorite books of all time.  It's a good read, but I have read better books.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Good way to play your spare time away. I hope there is an update soon. Worth every penny I spent.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was anxious to read this book, with the intention of finishing it to watch the movie afterwards.  I stayed up late and read the entire book in two days, only to feel a little disappointed.  Now I am not even sure I want to see the movie as badly as I did (though, I will because I love the actress in it).  The characters are intriguing, kept you rooting for the underdog and hoping to see a huge rise in the \\"ending of the movie\\".<br /><br />Spoiler alert:  I was anxiously anticipating Nikki's appearance, though I knew it would not happen.  The father's role was disheartening in his lack of compassion for his son and not showing up for his son's performance.  I wish that their relationship would have be rekindled more at the end, but it wasn't.<br /><br />While the book was a good read, it sort of lacked the expectation I had for it.  I would have rated it at 4 stars but felt a little let down, so I would give it 3 1/2.  A decent read, but not on my You MUST read this list!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Ok, I watched the movie last night, and really enjoyed the movie!  Apparently the producers must have felt the same way about the things that bothered me about the book, because the movie changed those parts.  The father had more of a relationship with the son, he DID get to meet up with Nikki, and it had a more heartfelt ending.  Enjoyed the movie so I would say it was worth reading and watching the movie!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is just absolutely amazing. The whole dynamic of the characters and the way they solve crimes is truly unique. If you haven't seen the show I would suggest giving it a try.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It grabbed me right from the start. In addition to an absorbing story, the courtroom scenes were very interesting. I also enjoyed reading about the &#34;murder gene&#34; and, since I was reading on my iPad, I Goggled it and read about some actual cases that had argued this theory for the defense. Lots of food for thought in this book.
B00A6WSTIW|4.0|Love the sharks  Love love Lawrence Fishburne!  Special effects were good too. After I watch it I always want to watch The Punisher.
B00985E3UG|2.0|Good message in this book, but poor delivery.  I wasn't impressed with how this was written.  It is one of those books that just wears you out to read, to get very little message out of the text in the end.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This is another classic masterpiece by Eastwood. I recommend this movie as a must see, the story never gets boring and the plot is very meaningful. Arrived quick and no problems.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This was a really cute movie. I can't wait to see the next one.  This is a good movie to kids and adults.
1781162646|4.0|Joyland, Stephen King's new novel, is a strange beast. Coming from Hard Case Crime and being billed as 'a mystery, a horror story, and a bittersweet coming-of-age novel', it appears to have a little of everything. Perhaps that's the main problem with Joyland - what, exactly, is it? It's a question I asked many times during my reading, because the story I found within the pages was so much more than the billing Joyland received.<br /><br />In Joyland, King has written a novel that has many of his trademark story elements: coming-of-age, mystery, murder, and friends. It recognisable as a Stephen King story almost from the get-go, and the further in you read the more you realise just how King is able to weave a fairly simple story into something more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The narrative is told from the point of view of Devin Jones, remembering his summer working at Joyland during his time at university. While events are recounted, the benefit of hindsight allows some comments to creep in here and there, giving the story more emotion and grounding, letting you believe that this truly is an old man telling a tale of his youth. His memory of his first love, the fall-out of the relationship, and his reaction all play a large part in the story, a seemingly central point around which most of his thoughts revolve, at least to begin with. It's fortunate that King doesn't dwell to much on these aspects of Devin, instead focusing on the main attraction of Joyland: the park itself.<br /><br />Anyone that has been to an amusement park, or touring fair, will instantly recognise the vivid descriptions King employs in exploring Joyland. I suspect that even those that haven't will be hard pressed not to close their eyes and see the place come to life. The park is a character in itself, not simply a location in the novel to serve a purpose - although the purpose it serves certainly elevates its status. With a carny spirit and enjoyable characters, Joyland is every bit the perfect place for this story. The history of the murder plays a large part in the revelations we discover, but perhaps not as large as you may think.<br /><br />Joyland is an exceptional novel. Not only does King deliver an interesting murder-mystery that will keep you guessing, but does so without it obviously being one. It's often heartfelt and emotional, with relationships playing a large part throughout, and never is it a chore to read. Perhaps one of King's best novels in recent memory, Joyland is a slow-burner that will not let you down. Highly recommended.

0679805273|5.0|As a school teacher I always used Dr. Suess to satisfy and please children.  They were always enamoured.  I started reading this book to them in elementary and middle school.  If they hadn't set a dream or a plan,  this helped them see how to dream!  Many students come to expect their own copy upon graduation,  and I love giving it to them.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I personally this this is the best book ever.  I also think that she should make a part 2.Thank u for helping me understand that it  doesn't matter what you look like to be a helper, a friend, anything. U can be the best if you are not a bully or make fun of people.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Started off with excellent concept and visual writing. However..and this is my issue... The middle of the book started a downward spiral of writing. I felt as though another writer took over. The ending was worse, and left a hollow feeling.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|A friend of mine who has this on his iPad asked me to load it on my Kindle so we could play.<br />I was never really into these kind of games. BUT...Since he and I r artists, it's actually a blast :D<br />And the best thing for everyone is you don't have to be an artist to play. You can even do stick figures.<br />I recommend this for everyone.
B0053B347M|2.0|I liked the lights enough that I ordered more sets.  The LEDs could be a little brighter, but they DO make a difference - just enough to reduce some eye strain. They have an inline power switch but it's not in a convenient place so I never use it.  My complaint is with the adhesive that is supposed to hold the strip to the back of the monitor.  It will not hold the strip in place!  You will need to make your own modifications or you will find the light strip detached laying behind the monitor.  I will probably order another set if I install another monitor, but the weak glue will probably make me mad again too.    UPDATE: After just over one year, I am re-rating at two-stars.  The two out of three sets have become so dim that I don't see any light on the wall.

0374533571|1.0|This book was simply awful to get through. The characters had more depth and heart in the movie, where the story was almost completely different (and much better). I've never encountered this with a screen adaptation of a novel. I'd almost argue that the movie should have been nominated for ORIGINAL screenplay, and not ADAPTED.
B00B1L6B4G|5.0|This, to me, was an absolutely fascinating book. It's a murder mystery that involves men who are already mass-murderers. It also gives an interesting view of Berlin during the earlier part of the war. The propaganda aspects are also interesting, how the German government was trying to say things in Russia were fine when they were falling apart.<br /><br />The suffering of the ordinary people is covered, along with the way the Jews were treated. There were some groups, though, that fought against the German takeover of their country, again showing how intense everything was at that time.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the novel and look forward to reading more of the author's works.
0761171703|5.0|She loved it. Good value, lots of sweet pictures. Very beautiful. I need to type nine more words. There. Done.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book as well put me one more step closer to uploading a well formed Kindle Direct eBook. Thanks you.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried to connect to play with other people and it didn't work. I waited for 5 mins and nothing happened
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's just okay....don't know what else to say about it.<br /><br />It doesn't require much thought at all since the game pretty much plays itself..
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|A friend of mine has this app on her phone and I thought it was funny. It is just not the same on my kindle fire as there is no microphone so Tom cannot repeat anything, but my grandchildren enjoy his actions anyways. I would recommend this app for anything but a kindle if you want the full effects.
193700788X|1.0|So disappointed.  The book was boring, nothing like the other books in the series and the ending was horrible.  What a waste.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Turns out this is not as scandalous as people said.  It's fun and good light reading when hubby is watching sports.  Also great ideas for those of us who've been married a long time.  You never know what it might inspire.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this game is so hard to stop playing and once you stop, you find yourself picking it back up again. I love it
B004D9FLJE|5.0|this from the very beginning. Cannot wait for Season 4 since I bought 2 and 3 also. Music is what it is about.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was captivated by the characters,  by the descriptions of the times and places, by the hardships and strengths, and the melding of generations facing the same misfortunes and finding peace and understanding together.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|The story held my interest and all was well until the end.<br /><br />I think something more could have been said----but when you deal with Stephen King, you don't question, right?
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The item is great, it was a birthday gift and she loved it... It was in great condition and looked just like the photo:)
B008PZYZH6|5.0|Good story and action. Was not sure if it was going to be a good movie but it was. Started to watch it with my seven year old son, when he had to go to bed, I could not turn it off.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|In any other year he'd have bagged the best-actor Oscar. He just ran into Daniel Day-Lewis' Lincoln. As Jean Valjean, he brings his considerable array of talents to the role: signing, acting, singing while acting (something my normally-favorite, Russell Crowe, could not do), and acting while singing. Anne Hathaway deserved her Oscar for an inspired twenty minutes work. Strong staging and bold settings compliment the fine work of the entire ensemble. It's Les Mis!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Why can't I get Draw Something in Great Britain l am here on vacation.l love the game l play with my friends back in the USA.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am thrilled to recommend this book. For dog lovers it is a unique opportunity to experience life as a canine, viewing the world from a dog's perspective. For racing fans it is a delight since author Garth Stein clearly knows his subject matter. This sweet and poignant tale will enchant and enrage you, but ultimately leave you feeling as exhilarated and breathless as if you had won your own intense race.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I love this series! It's so interesting and keeps you hooked and wanting to see more. The characters are great and the actors and actresses portraying them do a great job.
B000002B2T|5.0|Buy it if your a fan of Layne Staley, R.I.P.  I high recommend to others.  Does not sound like grunge rock but is surprisingly bluesy.  Plus you have the supreme Staley's voice.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I bought this DVD set for my girlfriend on her birthday, she's a huge Harry Potter fan and she said that she loves it but that she wishes there were more special features but other then that it's perfect.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read every book by this author. Having said that, this is beautifully written and insightful. I have learned so much about Afghanistan and her people through all of Mr. Hussein's books.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Love this Movie. Quick pace story, has a little back and forth story line but keeps you continuing throughout the movie without confusion with good action scenes.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book made me pine for unrealistic and permanently passionate young love renewed after 25 years of separation between the main characters. I understood the very real ties that kept Amanda ultimately loyal to her family and husband, but admit that I was secretly rewriting the ending that the accident ended fatally for her husband and Dawson survived the bar fight. Just call me silly, emotional and idealistic.
B002JXICCY|5.0|Wow, talking about a blast from the past....This is a visual journey into a place that, for me, is peaceful and relaxing.  Come in, sit down, relax and enjoy.  Seriously, good stuff.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I have played all the angry birds except space, which I don't intend to play because I am afraid it will suck like star wars does. It is extremly hard in my opinion. I love all the others.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|This game is UN explainable its not even a mystery game and its not even a hidden object game. You just tap on everything and build things that are hidden in order to use them<br />Not only that it used 309 mega bytes and took a half hour to download. The graphics are the worst I've ever seen,even a 5 year old could play this game that's how easy and pointless it is. Save your time and money trust me it's that bad.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really enjoy this game!!! It is fun and while some of it is pretty easy it alson has some parts that can really challenge you.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|The movie Oz is a great mix of romance, action, mystery, and suspense. Perfect choice for the kids as enjoyed the graphics, details, and colors which add to its 3D effects. I will look forward to purchasing the Blu-ray Disc for the family.
030746363X|2.0|Rapid fat loss?  May work for some, but this was not a good guide for my husband.  Too much protein.  A bit extreme.  He actually ended up putting on a few pounds!  Started a balanced diet and portion control instead and immediately got results.  Don't need a book for that.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Very long, but the momentum builds and the main characters are burned in your mind by the end of the book. The journey across dangerous land is the main engine of development for many of the characters. Sometime I wish Martin wasn't so dark, but he's an equal opportunity destroyer, so both the good and the bad are bound to get their comeuppance at some point, you can bet on it. I haven't read much fantasy but this kept me going for three books so far, so I'd guess you'd say I'm hooked. The Dany scenes are my favorites: exotic, heroic, grand. It doesn't hurt that HBO is putting flesh on these literary characters. Get it. Read it. It's an adventure you won't forget.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|I installed a bunch of these banana plugs yesterday.  I was pleased with the quality of the devices, and particularly pleased that they come with red and black rings that help keep polarity straightened out.<br /><br />The offer the option of running the cable through the length of the device, clamping at the bottom, or alternatively you can run the wire perpendicular to the device.<br /><br />I had purchased #12 speaker wire which I thought would be pretty heavy wire.  I found that the clamping mechanism on these plugs didn't work well when the wire is run through the length of the plug,  It worked better, albeit messily, when the plug is clamped perpendicular to the plug.<br /><br />They are kind of long.- 1.75&#34; total.  The plug portion is .5&#34; so you'll have 1.25&#34; plus the speaker wire itself projecting from your speaker.  This was a bit too long for a pair of ceiling-mount outdoor speakers I purchased.  The plugs interfered with mounting the speaker to the ceiling at the necessary angle.<br /><br />For my inside speakers, the plugs worked really well.  They were quick and easy to install, and a great value - particularly if you are wiring a full surround sound system!  I'll be buying another set!
B0084HJE0S|2.0|There was nothing here I could dig into and learn from.  It was all very general stuff that I already knew.  It was more of a &#34;I want to promote these technologies&#34; than &#34;let me teach you about them.&#34;
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Harry Hole, burned out Oslo ex-Homicide Inspector, interrupts his journey to death by bottle and needle and gets clean to hopefully save one of the two good parts of his former life. The clock ticks and life is diminishing second to second. Nesbo can tear out a reader's heart.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Reminds us of what caring truly means.  A quick read with a lasting message.  Have recommended it to others as well.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I so enjoyed this crazy movie and so i am loving the soundtrack.  The whole album is very upbeat and, of course, brings smiles when remembering scenes in the movie!
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|Definitely Eragon or Eldest are my favorites so far in the series. I really enjoy this book, I found myself more than one time sharing the characters feelings, at times seem that the plot is getting longer and longer.  But I have to agree with some of the reviews it's a very violent book considering the target audience. About how the book is written well English is not my first language so I wouldn't comment in that matter, but certainly is easy to read.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|GREAT game. Lousy freemium pay model. I'd pay $10.00 for this game if it didn't have all the restrictions. Once I got to where I had to pay to keep playing, I removed it from my Kindle. Shame.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Good calculator to have on the kindle when something needs to be solved quickly. I like the big numbers so I don't punch in the wrong ones.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|One of the ways I can tell a movie is good is if it &#34;absorbs&#34; me, as this movie did.  I tend to separate out superficial science fiction (lacking substance/just entertainment) from &#34;true&#34; science fiction (takes on substantive concepts) and this one is in the &#34;true&#34; science fiction tradition.  I have read a lot of metaphysics in the past and this movie clicked along those lines.  One book that especially came to mind was the 'Conversations with God' book series that deals with our souls, lives, and how we are connected.  I was surprised and delighted seeing the actors made up into different people/characters and they all did a great job - it was fun.  I didn't know if I was following it properly, or thought I was missing something, but a friend said it is just something you have to watch to the end, and this is what I recommend - don't worry if you feel like you are confused at times, just keep watching.  I did think it was a little violent, with a lot of mankind's negative/tragic sides in full bloom... with the good sides struggling to correct the imbalance.<br /><br />And now the non-movie comments:  I watched this on my roku player and I was afraid it would buffer, or come across not so well, and it came across perfectly so I guess some roku channels servers are better than others (I get buffering on some channels - very annoying and I had a tendency to blame it on the roku player where it is probably the channels server).  I am thinking about signing up for a movie service and am looking at Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.  This movie I tried on Amazon because Amazon lets you &#34;pay-per-view&#34; or &#34;rent&#34; the movie... so thank you Amazon for providing that as an option.  The rental time is 48 hours and this movie is worth watching again.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|I love Judy Garland and it was amazing to be able to own this movie and add it to my collection :)
B008OOYALE|4.0|its a good app. I've spent a lot of time playing and am liking it a lot. the dragons look awesome. the only down side is at times I can't visit my neighbors. when I attempt it, the app force closes. other than that it's all good.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Arakanoid game any day is awesome. From the original to any one keeps me busy. I like the different back grounds.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensly.  It was difficult to read (as a 5 year-old) but it became easier as I went along.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|It would be better if I didn't have to hold up it and my arms were killing me at night
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is in my car (yes, I still do CDs). It evokes summers - past and present. Love the lyrics. Especially love &#34;Isn't It Time?&#34; because for me it is always time to dance the night away.
B008K8U13K|2.0|I am an avid Sonic lover but this app sucked. you never knew where to go, nor did it show what needed to be done before completing the episode. I cried :(
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Heard this group at the Grand Old Opery in Nashville and just had to have the CD. &#34;Dream&#34; is an anthem for anyone who has been told - you are too old. Just put it on and crank it up!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I wandered over to Torchwood from Dr Who and the shows share the same \\"universe.\\"  Capt Jack Harkness, the head of this investigative unit based in Cardiff, Wales that supersedes both the police and the govt, first made his appearance in a Dr Who episode.  An enigmatic charming character who isn't at all shy about his sexual interests (both sexes), he is one of the biggest draws for me for Torchwood.<br /><br />In the first episode, we are also introduced to the other members of Torchwood, who are also each fascinating and strong-willed in their own right and so don't always get along as a team.  Great fodder for the show, definitely, as we explore these characters and their interests and quirks over the course of the series.  They aren't perfect and they don't always get along and they keep secrets from each other.  Plus there is always the mystery of Capt Jack to keep us guessing.<br /><br />My second favorite, after the incomparable Capt Jack, is Gwen Cooper.  A former cop, she stumbles across Torchwood and just can't leave it alone, eventually finding herself drawn into the world of aliens, alien technology, time travel, and the like.  She is a breath of fresh air, warm and determined, one of the better female tv characters in a long, long time.  She tries to balance her own \\"normal\\" lifestyle with her boyfriend with the demands and strangeness brought by her association with Torchwood and the people she ends up working with as they deal with the \\"rift\\" in space and time that sweeps all sorts of oddities into their little pocket of Wales.<br /><br />The show has adult themes to it at times, so it may not be best for younger viewers without parental oversight or approval.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Way more than just a spin-off of Dr Who.
B00B3YLI8U|5.0|It was apparent it was written in the 1800s with the language, but it kept me hooked until the end. The twist in the story and what happened afterward is indicative of more modern writing.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|It is a game to pass the time. The coinage needs to be alittle cheaper for those can't afford it. Thank you for the game though.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|A lotta soul in the voice and groove backing it up.  Gritty rock that seems steeped in that Southern tradition.
1439152799|2.0|I have read a few of her other books...I pressed forward and finished two.<br /><br />This book, OH, I wanted to LOVE it, to dig in, make some tea and relish<br />the plot!  It sounded so good!!<br /><br />After 140 pages....I just gave up due to boredom!  Omg, I tried to deny<br />my boredom....I pressed it's little voice down..<br /><br />I gave up.  Put it in my \\"trade\\" pile and moved on.  Not looking back.
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|Ben Affleck may be the worst big-name actor I've ever encountered... This movie is Choppy and confusing, not emotion-evoking in the slightest.  I don't see how I made it thru this movie--painstakingly, with the help of an alcoholic drink or 2, I'll say that.  I would not have made it thru if I was truly looking to be entertained. I have sat thru many hollywood movies lately that severely disappoint me--I keep waiting for them to get better.<br /><br />This movie, I knew, was doomed from the beginning.  One that I just want to turn off immediately, and I wouldn't feel bad about it, whereas I'll usually give a movie a chance to get better.  Really starting to hate these movies that have a decent last 20 minutees or so, maybe more so than those that are horrible all the way thru.<br /><br />\\"Edge of your seat\\" is exactly the Opposite of what this movie was.  The only tense moments were in the marketplace and in the airport at the end (If you made it that far I'd be surprised).  Such a disappointment at what could have been a great historical rendition, based on such an interesting story.<br /><br />I thought Canada has always been neutral...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is really helpful whether you are going to school or work! It is really easy to use and doesn't drain out your battery.
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|The playing is good, but Plants voice sounds old and tired.<br /> I'll give it 3 stars , it's just OK.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|I am so mad at amazon. I searched mandarin movies and this came up. I ordered and this was not in Mandarin. I want my money back.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The case is great for protecting my Kindle Fire HD. I was surprised to find that when you close the case with the unit on, it keeps it in a standby mode, just as with my MacBook. A bonus feature!
B0049J2CKE|1.0|I am so mad at amazon. I searched mandarin movies and this came up. I ordered and this was not in Mandarin. I want my money back.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It has many sounds for the alarm and options to set it up depending on your preferences. It's amazing and easy to use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse really shows great horsemanship and includes activities you really do with horses. I love how you can go through all the stages. the graphics are really good to. I love this game so much!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got The Weather Channel for my Kindle Fire and it's amazing. The information is complete and it's easier to get it than to watch it on TV. I can see the weather information at any time. I am glad I got it.
B0017QSZW6|4.0|Plenty of liberty taken to make the story appeal to broad class of TV viewers -But it follows the historical outline and makes an entertaining (if loose) review of what you might have learned in school.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I already  had this movie but I bought a copy as requested by a family member. I think Julianne Moore played Agent Clarice Starling as well as Jodie Foster. I also thought adding Ray Liota into the mix was great.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|I have tried, over and over, to download the maps for England and Norway so we can use them on an upcoming visit, but I consistently get this message &#34;downloading England (UK) (or Norway) has failed&#34;  &#34;Try Again&#34;  and I tried over and over again.  This app just doesn't work if you can't get the maps.  I notice the only option is to delete it and lose what I paid.  Great product Amazon!  NOT!
0061673730|5.0|really open the eyes to what can be important to ones life. a must read to anyone in search of themselves
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is very fun to use. I love it!! its great for everyone! you should definitley buy it! its very cool also.
B00B69UQJY|3.0|Not as good as previous efforts. Only really liked one song. I liked &#34;playing the angel&#34; much better. Others may disagree.
1444737112|5.0|I loved reading it, especially knowing that the story was real. Well, I detected a few places where the story had to have been&#34;improved&#34; a bit, but it was still sweet and I didn't mind the improvements. As soon as I finished the book, I went to YouTube to see the videos. I highly recommend this book. Especially if you love red tabby cats. I had one for 19 years and he was the smartest sweetest cat ever. I am sure that he and Bob were related!
B001IBIQU6|2.0|My preferences for Depeche Mode are along the lines of &#34;No good&#34;, &#34;Never let me down again&#34;, etc. Too many slow and tedious songs. Just my opinion.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Enough with the slavery stuff.  You don't see holocaust stuff on a regular basis.  Enough with the slavery stuff.  You don't see holocaust stuff on a regular basis.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|My first thoughts about this game were that it had great graphics and it was a fun games to play.It is really not that difficult which could have made it better. Other than that it is a great game for my kindle fire
0316212261|5.0|I have all of these books on my kindle but I didn't enjoy rereading my favorite books on it.  So I ordered this and it came out great.  I love it!
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I'm so glad I read this book.  It's unique and follows its own rules.  Occasionally, that bothered me, but most of the time, it intrigued me.  More than anything, though, it was a pleasure to read such mastery of language.  There were passages that I bookmarked so that I could reread them over and over again.  I love myths, especially the Greek and Norse gods and goddesses.  To have so many gods, from so many countries, all thrown together in one story fascinated me.  And the concept of America being a land that was not good for gods made me think.  Sometimes, I missed a sense of direction, (I'm a plot driven person), but meandering through such brilliance was truly a pleasure.
1599290634|5.0|Great piece of work.  The pictures are great and it just so much fun flipping through it getting ideas for my next projects.  People are just sometimes amazing.
B000I9YLWG|4.0|The film is a splendid well-done classic from an objective film-critique standpoint.<br />The very best scary classic movie ever made.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|This movie is just to perfect.  It's cute, funny and sad.  I'm a romantic and I can't believe I didn't see it in theaters.  Something I'm now regretting.  Disk works fine and the case is cheap but no worries for me on that part.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I like that you never see the actor. A bit gory at times. Cool slowmo stuff. Reminds me of robo cop one. Just blasted bad dude all day. Haha.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked this very much, she put a ribbon on it and that was nice!  Thought provoking insightful book.  Worth reading.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun game. The hidden objects are fun to find.  if you like hidden object games...you will like this game.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like knowing exactly how much battery power is available. I wish it could be made small, like an icon rather than keeping it on the carousel.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|This series of Doctor Who is absolutely riveting. I bought this because I couldn't wait to borrow the disks and watch it for free. The picture quality was pretty good, although it became a little pixelated if expanded to full screen. That said, the sound quality was excellent. Besides, the content of the episode was so wonderful that it made up for the minor flaw.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The movie was based somewhat on the book.  My wife is an avid reader of historical novels and this has kept her mesmorized.  Her only problem is some of the wording used and expressions are a little had to uderstand.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fun game wish you didnt have to use your points to get more games a little misleading for free
B002QYSZBO|4.0|Great movie! I love Robert Downey Jr!  I really enjoyed this movie and it was well worth the watch! Great!
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Not too bad at all and well worth it. All the items were there from the director's cut I was amazed how well who ever own it took such good care of it. I give it 5 stars.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr!  He is amazing in this movie! He did a superb job as Charlie Chaplin and the role couldn't have been done better!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Funny characters and geeky scenarios that make you laugh at your own geeky nature.  What I've thought about they are acting out and it's just soo funny.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|I like how Robert Downey Jr played a completely different role, and transformed himself into a black man. He did a awesome job, and at times it was hard to tell that it was him. Overall the movie is rather cheesy.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|The better of the first two Ironman movies, IMO ...<br />3D is spotty but looks great when it works.  But I'd have bought this title regardless.
1591845556|5.0|Josh, writes a book like he's talking to you. It so easy to read and yet carries such great content. His first book The Personal MBA was fantastic, read it 3x...he takes technically challenging content and makes it easy to digest, understand, and implement.<br /><br />Just got started in this book and I am totally sucked in...can't wait to read and implement his methods and systems. Josh has a crazy big brain and can make anything look easy so glad he has taken the time to show the path...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great moving story about an orphaned boy and Bengal Tiger lost at sea for many weeks. Beautiful scenes that you can envision happening on a similar journey. Highly recommended especially for children.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great writing, great acting, exciting storyline.  You're never bored with this one -- keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Is Washington politics really like this?!?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thought it was so interesting the way the author took the reader from Afghanistan to Paris to Greece etc. I liked the way the characters developed into mature, talented individuals like Pari becoming a professor of mathematics after her studies in Paris considering the humble village where she began in Afghanistan. Her Paris Mother was a poet and they all seemed to possess such talent.<br /><br />The driver told quite a tale considering that he saw everythig from afar.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Fun to play; and the sounds the game makes even makes it more fun to play anytime anywhere. Buy. You won't be sorry.
B004EF8AJA|4.0|Really appreciated this high-quality program, excellent actors and actresses. Have already recommended it to friends. Love blossoms at the end.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I ordered this movie for God's knows why. I should have just DVR-ed it instead of paying hARD earned money but oh well thids is America
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Its what u would expect for a 1dollar game. Its decent, for a dollar. 8/8 pages on first try, lame, slender is not scary, &quot;slender rising&quot; on the apple industry is by fare the greatest mobile slender on the market, sadly though its not on the android market, if you want a real mobile slender, get apple, or just buy &quot;Slender The Arrival&quot; on the pc, it is the scariest slender there is so far, but take my word for it ive gotten better free apps than this game, so don't waist ur time
1933952806|4.0|Like a manual but arranged much better and clearer.  Follows a logical path to understanding this high tech camera. Recommended.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun game, but with this new update there's a bug: Whenever I touch the screen during a level the game simply freezes and there's nothing I can do but exit the app.
6305428042|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  Great movie for Halloween or anytime.  Bette is hilarious in this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|i would give it more stars if possible. this game is great with no noticeable problems!!!! days of fun!!!! buy it!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot but why do all of the ponies have to be so expensive?  And where is rarity's horn?
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Exceeded my expectations.  I would highly recommend this movie for a rainy day.  Great for adults and kids.  Great streaming HD quality.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Where do I begin?  Biker shows are not my cup of tea.  Comedies fascinate me, but by season two in Sons of Anarchy, I am grasping how the bikers feel and pulling for them.  There are so many sub plots, and the stories are really vicious at times, but I find even the viciousness is applied correctly.  I loved season 2, and today I start on season 3.  Season 2 took 5 days to complete due to how it grabbed me, and I hope season 3 is similar.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We liked that the movie didn't have the typical predictable plot.  It was also refreshing to see a family film that's not filled with potty 'humor.'

B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughters (1 of whom is 10 and very tech savvy) tried to play this game and it doesn't seem to work.  To start, they were forced to buy a windmill (6 yr old who I bought the game for didn't want to use any of her jewels to buy a windmill).  She was then told to place the windmill where she wanted it and click the checkmark.  They tried putting the windmill in a bunch of places, but there was nowhere that it would allow them to check mark it to actually place it there so she could begin playing the game.  I tried it, and had the same experience.  This game is total garbage.
1401322786|5.0|Deep, profound, and thought provoking.  Clever interpretation of time.  Especially good for young adults trying to find their way in life.  I enjoyed reading this book greatly and shared many parts of it with my kids.  Highly recommend!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Excellent cast in an interesting film about a hotel in India.  I love Judi Dench and the other actors in the movie and their understated, British manner of expression,  Great job !
B0036UW09U|4.0|Christoperson and Streisand are an unlikely match but it's hearing Streisand's songs and getting a peek at the world of the rock star is entertaining.  I enjoyed it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|What a cool film !  It just goes to show that sometimes two people who are opposite each other in every way can get along and even love each other and live in a really cool way !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works fine...does what I need it to do and like the large buttons. Very easy to use and easy on tired eyes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game if you have kids who love horses. You can feed it and train it to compete.

B00AAQWMB4|2.0|Ive had a couple of people read the directions and try to play this game with me but its really hard to understand.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed this game but wish there was more levels some levels were really easy and others you had to search for a while.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Loved my little ponies growing up so this is like a little walk down memory lane. Fun game to play to pass the time
B006TLFPKO|1.0|So awfully bad. I can't even believe it.<br /><br />Where do I start? Well, the acting is atrocious. That's not any change from the previous movies' flat delivery of the boring script, however. The long awaiting wedding and sex scenes plod by. The talking wolves are funny, unintentionally. Bella finally gets to sleep with Edward and she looks absolutely repulsed. Bella tells Jacob the baby's name and Edward starts to laugh and oh how I hope that was intentional. Through some CGI wizardry Bella looks like a cancer patient and the chemo's not working. I have to say, the movie really turned itself around in the last twenty minutes. Bella has a lackluster labor, delivery, and death scene, and finally, Kristin Stewart has found her niche as a corpse!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Yet another book series that has me champing at the bit to get the next book.  It is a fairly long book, yet somehow not long enough.  The magic in the book is quite interesting, the history of the world is deep, and the structure of the story (Kvothe narrating) works very well.  If you are looking for something new to read, I highly recommend this series.  Be warned that we still have to wait for book 3 (and beyond)!

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Note: I started this review after only 16% finished and I gave it only one star.  I updated the review twice.<br /><br />I've only gotten through 16% of this book and I may update this as I read more (IF I read more). I gotta say I don't get it. This is the most boring book I have ever started. So far it is worse than watching paint dry. It is really curious that so many people think it is fantastic whereas I (and a few others) don't see it that way. Maybe it's me. Right now my Kindle estimates that I have to spend 11 hours more on this book. I don't think I can devote that much of my life to this.<br /><br />I'm going to read a bit more because I really enjoy a good read and all of those 5 star reviewers can't be wrong.  Can they?<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll have a positive update.<br /><br />June 20, 2013 Update.  I have to change my whole opinion of this book. I stuck with it and I am at around 50% finished. I'm going to leave my rating of 1 star for now so people who intentionally read the one stars can see that the book does improve.  The folks who've said that nothing happens must have bailed out at around 20% because after that it picks up considerably and I'm actually enjoying it.  If I had to rate it now, I would raise it to 3 stars and I suspect by the time I'm done (I will update and re-rate) it may get even four stars.  I'm glad I didn't bail out.<br /><br />June 23, 2013 Update.  OK I finished the book. I give it 3 stars.  I would give it 4 stars except that it was soooooo slow in the beginning and Mr. Howey tends to dwell far too long on unnecessary details.  This happens several times throughout the book and runs for many pages.  So I ended up skimming, especially towards the end.  This book need some editing.  It should be about 30% shorter.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Uh i like this uh game its fun but i get sad when the birds die but id rather watch a good dvd than play this

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I thought it used humor very well yet had some amazing underlying theme's of how people can change, listening, understanding why some people act the way they do, believing.  I really enjoyed it and would even watch it again.  It was a good movie for a mom and her teen boys to enjoy together...not easy to find an enjoyable zombie movie with a good message - great job to all involved!!
B00000JNNY|5.0|Good gutsy music. Have ordered ' Greatest Hits' album. Current wannebe's would not hold a candle to Ettas' style of singing.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|13 requires a few listens to fully appreciate. My first reaction was not very positive at all. If you go in expecting classics like Snowblind, NIB, War Pigs, Paranoid, etc. you will be disappointed. But give it a chance and I think you'll be pleased. All 4 musicians get the job done, and hats off to Iommi for performing masterfully through bouts of chemo. It sounds like Sabbath. It feels like Sabbath. Job well done.

B00821OX98|5.0|I stayed up until two in the morning watching season one.  Absolutely addicting!  The relationships between the survivors are innovative, no clichés.  The action scenes are nail biting, but no gratuitous violence.  Best show I've seen in years!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|it is easy to use if you are taking pictures of yourself, but can be difficult to use when you are trying to gt other things since you have to look at the screen to aim and the camera is on that side. However, this is not a reflection of the camera app, it is the device design.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Sons of Anarchy reminds me of a mix of The Shield, Sopranos, and Shakespeare. It's not so amazing that it has all of these at their best. It does have some of the genetics of these great works of art. It is a truly addictive experience because it pleases the mind, the heart, and that part of us that craves an adrenaline rush.
1451696191|5.0|Since I first enjoyed the film based upon the book, I was curious to compare Chbosky's book to the film.  Although I  enjoyed the film enough to see it twice and purchased the DVD, I found the book far more powerful.  Since the book tells the story primarily through letters that Charlie writes, we see everything through Charlie's eyes.  Quite a few books are mentioned during the flow of the story but Catcher in the Rye was a book that moved me deeply as a teen and Chbosky's tale reminds me in several ways of Catcher.  For example, both central characters realize they are weird.  Charlie's wierdness is explored much more fully in the book than in the film so we sympatize on a deeper level with Charlie's frustrations, his panic attacks, and his love of Sam.  I wish Chbosky told us more about Charlie's friend Michael.  The Reading Group Guide at the end of the book is an excellent addition that I plan to use in a discussion group that I facilitate.  I consider this book one of the best I have ever read and I'm a voracious reader, so that is saying a lot.  It touched me deeply.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me interested that is for sure. I drop off and start to skim a bit in the middle of most books and this one was no different. Twisted character.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice, then purchased the DVD to enjoy sometime in the future.  Then I decided to read the book upon which it is based.  If you like the film, please read the book.  As good as the film is, the book is much more powerful.  It is good to see Emma Watson in a film other than a Harry Potter one.  She is excellent as are the actors who play Charlie and Patrick.  In fact, the success of the film is largely thanks to the actor who portrays Charlie.  The story unfolds on many levels, some very serious, some light and even funny.  This is one of the best teen movies I have seen and the multiple relationships--friends, siblings, gay couple, straight couples--combine to reveal the varying ways that people interact.  The story moves from drama to comedy back to drama.  Excellent movie!!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Yes, explicit but still a great bunch of songs........I am way over 50 and still tolerant enough to find new music good and that includes BM.
0143122916|4.0|Very moving and well written. It leave the reader desiring to take action. The inaction of the world community toward North Korea's madness appears similar to not bombing Germany's rail lines to the concentration camps, as the author points out. If the book lacks anything,it is that the author apparently seems to fail to fully understand and appreciate the consequences of a child missing what was need during those early developmental years when he was pervasively neglected and permanently injured.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|CAN'T DO ANY WORSE THEN 10 SEASONS OF SG-1, 5 SEASONS OF ATLANTIS, 3 FULL LENGTH MOVIES AND 2 SEASONS OF SGU.  THAT'S A LOT OF GOOD VIEWING!

B00DE8OLTQ|5.0|When I first read of plans to create a \\"Hannibal\\" series, my heart sank. We've all watched failed attempts to translate the Thomas Harris world of Hannibal Lector on film and I jadedly assumed this television series was another DeLaurentis attempt to squeeze some cash out of the Lector character... until I read that Bryan Fuller ([[ASIN:B0006GAO18 \\"Wonderfalls\\"]], [[ASIN:B000YAA2SQ \\"Pushing Daisies\\"]]) was named as showrunner.  The \\"Hannibal\\" series rivals the best elements of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and solicits the engagement and excitement I had while reading the Thomas Harris novels (\\"Hannibal Rising\\" notwithstanding...)<br /><br />The writing is exemplary, the language and storylines demand engagement and intellectual curiosity of the viewer. Mads Mikkelsen plays Lector very differently from Brian Cox (too often overlooked for [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 his performance]]) and Anthony Hopkins; this quote from Bryan Fuller may explain why Mikkelsen's portrayal is so unique:<br /><br />  \\"What I love about Mads's approach to the character is that, in our first meeting, he was adamant that he didn't want to do Hopkins or Cox. He talked about the character not so much as 'Hannibal Lecter the cannibal psychiatrist', but as Satan - this fallen angel who's enamoured with mankind and had an affinity for who we are as people, but was definitely not among us - he was other. I thought that was a really cool, interesting approach, because I love science fiction and horror and - not that we'd ever do anything deliberately to suggest this - but having it subtextually play as him being Lucifer felt like a really interesting kink to the series. It was slightly different than anything that's been done before and it also gives it a slightly more epic quality if you watch the show through the prism of, 'This is Satan at work, tempting someone with the apple of their psyche'. It appealed to all of those genre things that get me excited about any sort of entertainment.\\"<br /><br />Also uniqueand compelling, Hugh Dancy's portrayal of Will Graham is an extreme departure from the performances of William Peterson and Edward Norton. The writer's characterization and Dancy's portrayal is simultaneously manic and tender, a man teetering on the edge of insanity, clawing his way towards the ugly truths of his mental state, his \\"gift\\" and his work with the FBI.<br /><br />The \\"Hannibal\\" series is an aesthetic pleasure, particularly the art direction, photography, costuming (Lector's wardrobe is so very.... *Lector*) and music. Anything true to Hannibal Lector's universe requires extraordinary standards and detail: barely noticeable in *part* of one scene in one episode is Lector's Rolls Royce, and the show has on staff a Culinary Consultant to assist the writers with Lector's palette and culinary endeavors (*ahem*).<br /><br />The supporting cast -- Laurence Fishbourne, Caroline Dhavernas (glorious as the \\"Wonderfalls\\" series lead), Hettienne Park, Scott Thompson (\\"Kids in the Hall\\"!!) shine, on par with the series leads. And then there is the delightful surprise of Gillian Anderson (\\"[[ASIN:B000BOH990 The X-Files]]\\") in a reoccurring role as Lector's psychiatrist, a woman who appears to harbor secrets regarding her past with Lector. I look forward to watching this storyline unfold next season. The series also boasts guest stars such as [[ASIN:B00003CWOU Eddie Izzard]], [[ASIN:B000RZIGW2 Molly Shannon]] and [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Gina Torres]].<br /><br />Thankfully, the series has been renewed for another 13 episode season. With the exception of AMC's original programming, I had almost given up on this level of quality, intelligent story telling in the television medium.

0143123173|5.0|Craig Johnson hit the nail in the proverbial head with this one. The man knows Wyoming and how to put you there. While based on a \\"mystery,\\" the central strength of the novel is Johnson's excellent blending of place with characters that seem to belong there as if by some sort of divine destiny. Sheriff Longmire's repartee with his deputy, Vic, is worth the read. As is Henry Standing Bear's presence. This is not a fluff piece. Nor is it overly erudite, although the author appears capable of going there if he chooses.<br /><br />The A&E version (Longmire) is a nice fit.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|This is a funny and new entertaining approach to the zombie genres. This had a little bit of Twlight theme to it but not enough to make it suck. Good overall.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I don't understand why this is a hard to find classic.  It was a classic of the the 60's (or was it the 70's?) and frankly at least as good in my opinion as Easy Rider.

B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|The book started off quite well  and as of about half to three quarters the way through I enjoyed it. However I found it disappointing how a main character ( I won't spoil the plot) in the end can be dismissed so easily. Not the ending I was hoping for!

Long, drawn out, with dead in the eyes Franco not really carrying this movie, it felt like a sad excuse for a Wizard Of Oz rip off.  Terrible.  Bored out of my mind.

B00AWJYJVA|4.0|&#34;A Most Wanted Man,&#34; and &#34;Our Kind of Traitor&#34; gave the impression that Le Carre was to some extent marking time. While by no means bad books - he is too classy a writer for that, they felt more like books written to fulfil a contract than books driven by real passion. &#34;The Constant Gardener&#34; was a book driven by genuine anger, and &#34;A Delicate Truth&#34; has the same feel to it. At times that underlying emotion overwhelms the finely detailed characterisation that has always been his forte, but there are ample compensations elsewhere, with strong plotting and a brooding atmosphere that draws you in.<br />Above all, there is the powerful sense of morality that is the hallmark of all his best books, and that wonderful affirmation of genuine human values in the face of those who would try to deny them. It is these things that mark Le Carre as so much more than just a thriller writer, and this, while not his best ever, is still a fine addition to his body of work.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is by far Harris's best.  Spoiler alert: Harris's ending is perfect for Sookie's personality.  I am so pleased she stayed true to her characters' personalities.
B002OHN5NQ|4.0|Liked the other reviewer claimed, it was too short. I bought 2pcs for my motorcycles and had a hard time to route the  connector from the battery compartment to the outside where is convenient to plug into the charger.  The hole of the eyelet was actually too large however it could still be tighten to the battery.  Other than that it is a perfect connector for my CTEK charger.

The price is great for the service considering I would have had to pay on demand for each episode. Thanks Amazon!

0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is sheer genius. A complete and utter masterpiece for anyone with positively any interest in fiction. I would confidently go so far as to proclaim it one of the top three fantasy novels ever written. Kvothe is a character beyond perfection (comparable in many ways to Megan Turner's Eugenides) and this book will make you laugh, weep, and love in turn.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|Absolutely terrible acting. You'd think with Ned Stark & Jon Snow in the same film that things would be enjoyable. The storyline was weak, the acting was terrible & for us true Silent Hill fans, it was a complete disappointment. Positively, the special effects were pretty nice. If you have time (and money) to waste, then this may be the film for you.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Although I typically go for folk legends and classic rock anthems, Lonerism has a couple tracks that have become an expression of me. In particular, Feels Like We Only Go Backwards, Elephant, and Mind Mischief are young, restless, and craving both meaning and rebellion.

B0011NVC98|5.0|Being something of an &#34;innerlekshul&#34; I've read the Beowulf epic poem and found the movie to be true to the story of that poem.  The semi cartoonised presentation simply added to the impression that this was a legend, an epic saga and, for me, part of my heritage.<br /><br />I would urge anyone who has an appreciation of Nordic/anglo-saxon history and legend to buy this movie.  For the rest of you, it's a bloody good action adventure, full of sex, violence and heavy drinking with the added benefits of heroes, monsters and dragons.

0240815807|5.0|If you're mixing music, this book should be on your bookshelf. This book did more for my mixes in 4 hours than the previous 5 years of random tidbits of information, advice, and experimentation.<br /><br />It does a good job of walking you through from start to finish, from monitoring to final mix, and a few tidbits about mastering.<br /><br />Good information, easy to read, and applicable:<br />Author did a good job of providing examples and making the information relative to the small studio.<br />The tips provided are excellent, and very helpful.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three book and found that I couldn't<br />  put them down!  Not only did I see a love story, but also something that most people fantasize about  but are unwilling to talk about. Don't get me wrong I mean changing it up in the bedroom, but not to the extreme that the two main characters did in the books.  Other than that I am looking forward to seeing if another book comes out.
B0090EJ99A|1.0|I am a fan of Sasha Baron Cohen and was looking forward to this. Unfortunately the humor was forced and predictable.  I literally laughed twice while watching and the rest was agonizing.  The only good thing was the amount of cameos by other stars.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Having waited quite a while to watch this I can say i'm sorry that I waited one moment. Brilliant acting and an incredible script. In a day when computer generated animization and fast action seem to be the theme of the day this story absolutely had me from act one. Jennifer Lawrence is a true national treasure and richly deserved her Oscar for this talented performance. She is quite stunning. Bradley Cooper was incredible as usual and i'm a bigger fan after this movie. It was a pleasure to watch and i'm not embarrassed to say I had some tears a flowing in the final moments...

B004G0SJU8|4.0|The movie deals with difficult topics such as death, afterlife, angels etc. and is built around a romance.  It is both sad and thought provoking without delving to much into the unknown or into religion.  Perhaps just enough to raise a few questions but mostly just to entertain.<br /><br />Both Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan are wonderful and both bring realism to their characters.  For those who have not seen the movie I think you will enjoy it....for those who have not seen it in years perhaps it would be a good movie to revisit.  Our perspective of life & death changes as we mature.

1594746168|5.0|\\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black\\" opens with a dense, interesting narrative: the biography of the dark protagonist. Readers tend to get bored with extended narratives, so this introduction is appropriately short. It is a compelling setup, of course, for the illustrations (the latter 2/3rds of book). The author sets the horrific tenor here, enticing the reader to share the excitement that Spencer feels for defining the human condition. Only sensitive readers will cringe at the horror since author E.B. Hudspeth is tactful in his delivery of the macabre. He, like his character Spencer, merely wants to set the readers \\"free.\\" True to the role of speculative fiction, he presents art that appears real...then lets the reader ponder the boundary between fact/fiction. The below quote from Spencer seems to echo Hudspeth's motivation:<br /><br />\\"I hear them marvel at my work--my indignant science. I hear them call out in fear of what they see. And there are some gentlemen who doubt what I will tell them. They call me a liar and a charlatan or a quack. But in time the methods of science that I now employ to convince people will surely set them free--alas, this I cannot explain to the angry fools.\\"<br /><br />The setting is ideal for redefining the nature of \\"man.\\" The turn of the 19th century was rich with advances in evolutionary theory, science, and even speculative fiction. Anatomists, philosophers, and scientists ruminated on how far to extrapolate Darwin's assertions. Most understood that all vertebrates shared a common skeletal structure; but if animals and man were connected in their development, was it not reasonable to reconsider the existence of creatures termed mythological? Were centaurs real? Harpies? Demons? Spencer Black needed to know. Hudspeth uses him to lure us on this quest.<br /><br />There are real life analogues to the fictitious Spencer. Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) comes to mind. A dedicated, philosophical scientist with outstanding artistic skills, he documented thousands of life forms and published his beautiful plates in \\"Art Forms in Nature\\" (translated from German: Kunstforman der Natur). But then his fascination with Art-Nature caused an uproar when he tweaked his drawings of embryos in 1874. Haeckel envisioned familiarities across the embryos of fish, salamanders, turtles, pigs, rabbits, and humans; then he represented these in an evocative table. At a time when photography was not practiced, data was art...and vice versa. Some still claim his drawings were legitimate, but in any case, his artistic embellishments stirred a controversy. That controversy is the same the Hudspeth delivers:<br /><br />At what point does \\"man\\" begin and \\"animal\\" end?<br /><br />The fictional Spencer Black is more corrupt than the real Ernest Haeckel, but now their books share space on my bookshelf. I recommend the hardcopy so you can use it as coffee table book. The anatomical drawings of mythological creatures will certainly entertain and inspire.g artistic skills, he documented thousands of life forms and published his beautiful plates in \\"Art Forms in Nature\\" (translated from German: Kunstforman der Natur).

0316223239|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and the point of view was interesting (as it's from the view of a five year old). I felt so bad for the characters as the book continued. I really got a good sense of the Room and how odd it would be to grow up in there then go out to the outside world. I think Emma Donoghue did a great job with this book.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five was because I felt that the ending was lacking somewhat. I mean, I understand that the little boy wouldn't have a total, complete understanding of what was going on, but it was definitely the one part in the whole book I would've loved to read it in the mother's view!<br /><br />Beyond that, I would recommend reading this book at least once, if not for the uniqueness of the story.

With patience, effort, and logic you can breed any dragon, or you can purchase it through rubies, which are the payfor currency.

0143122010|3.0|This book is a textbook example of somebody looking ad an interesting pattern with a preconceived idea.<br /><br />In all honesty, I would have given the book 3.5 stars. But, as I have to give either 3 or 4, 3 is more accurate in my estimate.<br /><br />Lets start with the good:<br /><br />1. The book is very clear. It can be read easily, despise being a big book.<br />2. The book notices and comment on a true but often forgotten fact: that we live in a very, very peaceful moment in human history. It also gives ALL the correct statistic to show how true it is.<br />3. The book hits some interesting and true fact about genetic.<br /><br />The bad points though are in the background and end up overshadowing what could have been a true landmark and a to-read for everybody. But the bad points can be in truth pinpointed to one in particular:<br /><br />The Author is a firm believer (from his words) in evolutionary psycology. And an extreme one at that. To explain myself: he is one of the people who believes that all humans being do and feel depends strictly on genetic, and that cultures have little or no importance in actions. He is the \\"child\\" of a particular age of biology (started by Dawkins masterwork \\"The Selfish Gene\\") in which everything seemed to be able to be pinpointed to genetic and single genes at that.<br /><br />While it is true that \\"nature\\" has a great part in the building of human beings, even a high-schooler is able to point the fallacy of the reasoning, when it goes to the extreme that mr Pinker use: namely that for a being as far spread as the homo sapiens sapiens any gene that foster a great diversity in the \\"culture\\" has a very high chance of being selected and perpetuated.<br />Mr Pinker shows the clearest his fallacy in the chapter dedicated to rape, where he slides head first into gender stereotyping. For example, there is no mention that in Western Countries gender identity seems indeed \\"natural\\" but in some polinesian islands it seems to be more \\"nurtured\\". Such a thought would invalidate all his reasoning after all. So those facts are convenientely never mentioned.<br /><br />He is also guilty of some measure of scientific disonesty. At first my alarm went off when he claimed that most of historians thought that, without Hitler, there would have been no IIWW. Well. No. Many researchers on war that follows Waltz (the so-called realpolitik) thinks that IIWW would have happened anyway, even if perhaps with less focusing on the Jew. Yet nowhere he gives even a lip-service to different interpretation on the facts he talks about.<br />End when he slides in talking about global warming, he really goes overboard.<br /><br />All in all, he does shows that there had been a marked decreased on violence, but his motivation on the reasons are based on an outdated evolutionary perspective that don't convince.e \\"nurtured\\".

B008YKRRI6|5.0|I find it amusing that listeners writing in this column feel motivated to give vent to their personal opinion about these interpretations. This symphony is good, that one too slow etc. etc.<br />You have to acknowledge that personal opinion can be an irrelevance. I dislike novelist Patrick White, and am very taken by Lawrence Durrell, but White got the Nobel Prize and Durrell did not. Klemperer is a Nobel Prize category conductor, like Furtw&auml;ngler and Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Karajan. They all have their flaws and demerits, but this is saying nothing when you set their recordings of Beethoven beside the dozens of dispensable albums that are produced by sometimes well-meaning, sometimes over-ambitious or just commercially oriented musicians who may still be personal favourites for many listeners. It boils down to the fact (and I think it is fact) that Klemperer's Beethoven is indispensable to the artistic legacy of 20th century performing arts. You would hardly look to (say) Walter Weller's recording for the kind of quality that bears the stamp of \\"indispensable Beethoven performances\\" on it.<br />This does not mean that you have to \\"like\\" Klemperer's way with Beethoven. Only that nitpicking - perfectly in order with run-of-the-mill performances - has no point to make. To \\"like\\" these performances you have to enter the mind and spirit of a great conductor. It can be difficult, and Klemperer doesn't make it easy for you. But there's the rub: Beethoven is not meant to be \\"easy\\". To experience his music, you must switch off the \\"easy listening\\" mode that might do for Mendelssohn or Tchaikovsky or Villa-Lobos. This is deep-digging, disturbing, uprooting music; something that should grab your soul and shake it up. Any performance which fails to do that could be judged a failure under that criterion. There are dozens of them in the catalogue, against a tiny handful of truly great readings.<br />I suggest to you that this is the platform for judging the album. Put aside your meaningless personal preferences and submit to the spirit when it speaks to you - as Beethoven himself once said. Klemp's recordings are part of this journey. Not perfect, nor especially likeable, but great and profound, and above all sincere. Don't expect to find these qualities just everywhere you look!side your meaningless personal preferences and submit to the spirit when it speaks to you - as Beethoven himself once said.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The movie consists of a several timelines, but the interconnectedness between timelines is not explained at all. The movie talks about reincarnation, destiny, racism, etc., but it is very difficult to follow the story because there are several timelines. The movie jumps from one timeline to another, and you will be left wondering how the timelines are related and what each timeline is supposed to mean.<br /><br />The special effects are great, but there is simply no central story to this movie. I cannot recommend that anyone watch this movie; it is completely unenjoyable.

0375842209|5.0|Death spoils the ending for you many times, but when characters finally get around to dying, it still breaks my heart and starts the tears because before the inevitable, we get to know all these wonderful moments of the characters being themselves that you feel more and more the tragedy and waste of such fine characters dying.<br /><br />It's an ambitious novel with Death as its narrator and being set in Nazi Germany. I believe it was well researched and sensitively presented and focused on people's humanity. When I say it focused on people's humanity, it does it in the spirit of a story for children and young adults. It isn't complicated or overly political, but it makes the politics feel very present and disruptive to the flow of the lives we're trying to live, and it does it with characters participating in so much mirth, mischief, and maturation. There are occasional illustrations for a fantastical, children story's rendition of Hitler as a manufacturer of words and people. Detailing the quirks, triumphs, defeats, and antics of each character would endear you most to this story. It has many surprising little details of people's behavior that's very endearing and relateable.

0321934946|3.0|The fact, even if true, that the Digital Photography Book is \\"the #1 Top-selling Digital Photography Book Ever\\" as heralded on the cover doesn't mean that it's a great book.<br /><br />In this revised book there are  chapters on getting sharp photos; photographing flowers, weddings, landscapes, sports, people and travel; avoiding problems; taking advantage of digital; printing ; and ten things the author wishes someone had told him. He concludes with recipes for fourteen types of generic shots. Each tip is less then a small page in length and includes an illustrative photograph.<br /><br />I dislike tip books because they don't put photography technique within a larger context so that the reader learns a principle which he can apply to any circumstance. \\"Give a man a fish...\\" might have been written about tip books. For example, in the space of a few pages, the author tells us to shoot portraits with wide angle lenses and then tells us to use telephoto lenses. What might be called a comprehensive book would help us to understand the considerations involved in making a choice of focal length for portraits. Kelby must have been aware of this type of criticism for he offers a long explanation of the tip method and then tells you that after you start getting amazing pictures, you can buy what Kelby calls a \\"tell me all about it\\" book (even though he later says, I hope facetiously, \\"Stop reading books about photography\\"). I suggest that if you are going to read this book, read one of the \\"tell me all about it\\" books first so you can place the tips into context.<br /><br />This is particularly so given the sometimes apparently contradictory advice. For example he tells you to use a tripod and the lowest ISO on the camera and to avoid high ISO \\"like the plague\\". Well, sometimes even if you are using a tripod, the subject may be moving and you will need to increase ISO to avoid a blurred picture. Later, another tip will tell you to use high ISO's. This kind of advice makes sense if you understand that exposure is a three-legged stool of aperture, shutter speed and ISO, but the author never explains this.<br /><br />Sometimes Kelby tells you things that most photographers would warn against, like editing out images as you shoot. Perhaps when memory cards were smaller this might have made some kind of sense, but in this day and age of large memory cards, it doesn't. Instead picture how you will feel if you miss a great shot while you are fooling around deleting images.<br /><br />Sometimes Kelby makes statements that might be true, but require more explanation for you to get the most from your camera. For example he says that macro lenses have a very small depth of field. Actually depth of field is a function of focal length, aperture and distance to subject, regardless of minimum focusing distance. At, say, 25 feet and an aperture of f/4 a macro lens and a normal lens, both of 60mm, will have exactly the same depth of field. At five inches the depth of field is significantly reduced, and a normal lens usually cannot focus at 5 inches while a macro lens can. But to suggest there is something about a macro lens, other then the fact that it can focus more closely, that gives it less depth of field is misleading. Yet Kelby's tips are regularly misleading in this way. That's why I recommend reading a \\"tell me all about it\\" book first. In fact, if you understand what the \\"tell me all about it\\" book is saying, you may not even benefit from this book.sense if you understand that exposure is a three-legged stool of aperture, shutter speed and ISO, but the author never explains this.<br /><br />Sometimes Kelby tells you things that most photographers would warn against, like editing out images as you shoot. Perhaps when memory cards were smaller this might have made some kind of sense, but in this day and age of large memory cards, it doesn't. Instead picture how you will feel if you miss a great shot while you are fooling around deleting images.<br /><br />Sometimes Kelby makes statements that might be true, but require more explanation for you to get the most from your camera. For example he says that macro lenses have a very small depth of field. Actually depth of field is a function of focal length, aperture and distance to subject, regardless of minimum focusing distance. At, say, 25 feet and an aperture of f/4 a macro lens and a normal lens, both of 60mm, will have exactly the same depth of field. At five inches the depth of field is significantly reduced, and a normal lens usually cannot focus at 5 inches while a macro lens can.

0674059719|5.0|If you're an Alcott fan, as I am, this volume will be a delight. I've read LITTLE WOMEN since childhood (all the way back to when I complained to my mother when I found out I read an abridged edition--I wanted the whole story!) and, by dint of further reading, found out many of the historical background items for this book, but this collects all of them in a super package, from the many references to Bunyan's PILGRIM\\"S PROGRESS, to how book events paralleled the Alcotts' real lives, to definitions of familiar objects and terms in the 19th century that have since disappeared, like a charabanc, pickled limes (which, BTW, sound disgusting!), and \\"trumps.\\" (I did find it a bit sad that the author needed to translate several words that I found commonplace; is it really necessary today to tell someone that \\"sober\\" means \\"solemn,\\" for instance?) Other than the fact that a couple of the annotations struck me as incorrect or odd, and that one illustration was mislabeled, this is thoroughly delightful from cover to cover. Included in the text are illustrations from various editions of the book, from May Alcott's originals to the Louis Jambour drawings that I grew up with, and stills from the various film versions of the story.<br /><br />An introduction provides historical and biographical background to Alcott and the writing of the book. Also cool is the fact that Shealy uses Alcott's original publication text, which was edited when the book was brought out in a uniform edition several years later (this is the version most people have been reading since 1880; Alcott's publishers objected to the slang that had been used in the original version, such as \\"ain't,\\" and \\"don't\\" rather than \\"doesn't\\" and corrected them, as well as fixing other descriptions--\\"stout\\" was removed from descriptions of both Mrs. March and Professor Bhaer, for example, with \\"tall\\" substituted); these changes are listed in an appendix. Absolutely worth the money!
B000001F76|5.0|The greatest ever to sing REAL country music. There's only a few old timers left to sing good music.Nashville wont plat or record them anymore. They say it's too country. What the heck is that all about.? That's about as dumb as a rubber beak on a woodpecker.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|A fabulous fast pace as usual from Jo Nesbo. Well researched. Harry Hole character  wonderfully flawed.  Other characters very believable!
0061777250|5.0|This book is about the near death phenomenon, present  in many cultures around the world and even in the antiquity.<br />It tells us the our conscious is more than our brain , in a comparison our brain is like a computer and the mind is like the internet. In this sense our bodies are like shells but  the conscious is for ever. The book has an scientific approach, not sensationalist, no linked to any religion.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the last installment of this series. I always thought the way it ended was the way it would go, though I'm sure many readers will be disappointed in who Sookie ends up with. I do think the series went on a bit too long, but die hard fans will enjoy this book.

0399165274|4.0|I have read many of Frederick Forsyth's books , but after awhile found them formulaic. Until now, that is, 'the Kill List' is a superb thriller. It s full of useful facts that we might never hear about except for Forsyth. He doesn't give us the psychology, instead he loves the plotting, based on detailed research. He spends a great deal of time in somebody's libraries.His books are full of information about the technical details. In this novel we learn of the CIA, MI-5 and MI-6, the Mossad, and other intelligence agencies. We learn how they work, how they are staffed, how they make decisions, and what the secret life of a spy is like. His morality is a harsh one: the world is made up of predators and prey, and only the strong survive.<br /><br />In this novel we meet the 'Tracker', a soldier who specializes in finding murderers and terrorists. He works for a secret branch in the US. He is given an order to find and eliminate the 'Preacher', a Jidahist who is so fluent and mesmerizing that his followers become killers. We go from the US to Somalia, to Israel, London and many places in-between. All the time we are fastened to our seats, we never know what will occur next. However, the story is methodical as is Forsyth's wont. Good and evil and only the good survive. Side stories give us a glimpse into the lives of those we meet, but the main goal is to get the'Preacher'. We find out how and why this man, the 'Preacher' was born,and what made him a killer. Each page is filled with so much information and detail,you must keep alert. This is a real spy/thriller novel, and one to be considered one of Forsyth's best.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-10-13
B007JNR518|5.0|Whats not to enjoy, great acting, photography, subject matter and the rest...... Redford (IMHO) always hits it out of the park!
B007P7UF0G|2.0|Don't get me wrong - I love the movie and always will!  I bought the DVD over the BluRay so I could watch it on multiple devices, but that was a mistake.  I watched it on my DVD player when I bought it, but a few months later loaded it on the BluRay and found that the voice track (both dialogue and singing) didn't work.  To experiment, I've tried it on friends' systems with the same results.  Sadly, it was too late when I discovered the malfunction to exchange the DVD and see if it was a problem with all copies or just mine. :-(
B005QVCXM6|5.0|Music is quite subjective and personal so reviewing it is always a challenge.<br />But to me, this is the best work from the band, hands down my favorite album, and I love every song on it. If youre a fan of Evanescence, then this album wont dissapoint!
1857885082|5.0|I'm English and live in America. A lot of people just don't \\"get\\" the way we work, the way we speak, our manners, social codes, and terms of reference. This book is an essential guide. Written under the guise of anthropological study, this is really a work of observational humour (not humor, which is different). That is not to detract from its accuracy as a study of the English. It explains why we do a lot of what we do, in terms the Americans can relate to. Fox knows whereof she speaks, being brought up largely in England, but also spending a lot of time in America, and being a sociologist, she is probably in an unique position to write this book. Her gift for humorous writing makes this entertaining, rather than turgid.<br /><br />There is much explanation of our class structure, eating rules, and things that many people from other countries may think they understand (say, from tv or films), but in fact don't. I have been frustrated by the fact that if I invite an American friend to tea, they think they are going to get just a drink. This book explains to them that they will in fact get sandwiches, cakes and possibly a cup of tea as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to Americans who want to look beyond BBC America and Evelyn Waugh books, and also to English people who want to know where they might be perceived by Miss Fox to fit in the class system (I'm upper-middle apparently, but desperately keen not to appear middle-middle or lower- middle so on no account must I have doilies or porcelain figurines in my house).
B008FTAAG2|4.0|music is quite subjective and personal so reviewing it is always a challenge.. ill only really be reviewing it from my perspective based on when I started listening to ITM, which I think impacts which songs I like best. Overall i like all the songs on this cd, but only really love about half, where-as the other cd's I love 9/10 of the songs. Still, that being said, if you like ITM, and own their other cd's, then you will likely want to own this cd as well, as it will offer good songs worth listening to over and over as you come to expect from the band.<br />My favorite cd's from ITM are A Star Crossed Wasteland and The Dream<br />however my new favorite songs are probably 'whore' and 'scarlet' from this new cd.<br />Again its hard to review/suggest music to people because its all preference, but overall, at least if you like ITM, this album is worth owning.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|okay, last sunday, i re-read the first 2 books in preparation for book 3 since i read a lot i already forgot the flow of the story but not all. i just sometimes mix the stories from different books if i try to remember. so i decided re-reading. i finished reading the first 2 last wednesday. i bought the 3rd book last thursday and read it immediately the moment i got home because of my excitement and since eva and gideon's story is still fresh and i finished it at 3am this morning. what can i say? i love the story, that's given. i was hurt just like eva when she found about the watch her and stanton gave her. i felt like i was in the place of eva. i find this story more realistic than 50 shades that made me like it but that does make me to like the other less. i just love both! i really really like cary. i love him. but not him for screwing 2 people and getting one pregnant where the other one loves him. i cant wait what will happen between cary, trey, tat(i dont like her, she's a bitch) and the baby. i am curious what happened to megumi. i was looking forward to eva and cary's trip to san diego and was disappointed that i would wait for more or less 6 months for that. i wonder who put the bracelet of nathan to the \\"suspect\\" i forgot his name. and i wonder why did s/he do that. for sure to help gideon. but what would it take in return? i find weird how eva handled her situation for telling people that she is engaged but the fact that she is already married. i wonder how would her family and friends feel if they found out that she lied. but i find the wedding intimate. i like it. i am desperate just like eva to find out if the girl in the emerald green dress is Anne(Dr. Lucas' wife). there are many questions and im looking forward to be answered in book 4. I also hope on knowing more about gideon. more of his secrets to be revealed. To make everything short, i really like and love the story. though from the moment i started reading bared to you, the only complain i can say is sometimes i dont know who's talking between the characters that make me read it again to understand. sometimes im just clueless and leave it alone. and im quite disappointed with the ending. yes, there are many questions left hanging but the way it ended, it will not make the reader really excited about the next book. but i dont care. i just want to know how will the story continue and end. Sylvia said book 4 will come out before the year ends. so lets wait and read what will happend next. oh btw i forgot to mention that i really like ireland. sometimes i forgot that she's 17 and feels like she's 12. and also i like the idea of gideon-eva-brett love triangle. i wonder what will brett do to win eva back. :) and also, i am not one of those who are disappointed about having more than 3 books. i just want every story to go well.<br /><br />have fun reading guys.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Since I've started reading this series for the 6th or 7th time I guess you could say I'm addicted. It's not the sex, though that doesn't hurt, it's the love story between Christian and Ana that brings me back each time.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie is 6 stories and 600 years. It is also almost 3 hours long. Watching this movie is like a weekend project. You will have to really pay attention to remember all 6 stories and how they are connected. Pay close attention during the closing credits for the multiple roles of each actor. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry both played 7 roles each. Males played females and females played males. Even though it may be difficult to follow just the visuals will keep you entertained for the entire movie. Watch it with breaks and you will never forget it.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Bruce Lipton has a great ability in understanding and explaining the basics of the biology and how these principles are found in the development and growth of our consciousness. Probably you may ask why is this understanding important ?<br />It is important because it contributes to the deeper understanding of your existence as human beings ( and not human &#34; doings &#34; ) and of what is possible to achieve when you really grasp what is your essence.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Way too too too repetitive and what could have been a good read, became a 'okay, so move on already' saga
B00CRW2066|4.0|I really, really enjoyed High Violet and was hoping this album would exceed their last. While it is good, it still lacks the imaginative lyrics and frivolity of High Violet. But I will always enjoy the deep baritone of Matt Berninger no matter what he's singing! A good album but I hope the next is better and that Matt shows off his talent even more!

B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read and it has come to my attention at a perfect time. Before, I had heard and read about Anita Moorjani's book from Dr Wayne Dyer a lot and thought I alteady knew what it was all about. Well, I was completely mistaken! It is not only her NDE experience which intapires me so much as all the things she has learned from it. In the last few chapters I have marked so many passages that I might as well have marked all of it! To me this story is alteady life-changing and I am utterly grateful to Anita for having  written down her experiences. I am sure I will re-read the last part of the book over and over again. I can only advise people who are not afraid of the existence of NDE's to read this book themselves and see how it changes their lives!

B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Trailers of this movie were the only good parts.  The movie was beyond childish.  The acting was poor and the special effects weren't really special. Wish I could give it a 1/2 star instead of a whole one.

B008BU75IQ|1.0|It was a rip off and just a rehash of the other books and almost the new charaters had the same traits as the old. PLUS there was no ending which makes me assume there will be another book. I doubt that I'll buy it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I absolutely love this story for the characters. There's a decent number of them, but the author does a good job of making each one distinct. Oftentimes books have characters that exist purely to make a scene work, but who have no depth and don't feel like real people in that world. Rothfuss does a good job of making me believe in everyone in Kvothe's universe, and I can easily imagine all of these individuals.<br /><br />He also does a good job going back and forth between present day and Kvothe's retelling of his life, and keeping me sufficiently hooked with all of the mysteries we don't understand. There's a lot going on behind the scenes, shown through mild hints and foreshadow, that have me excited for the answers we'll (hopefully) receive in the third book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Definitely worth watchiing. The special affects are alittle cheesy but it's different than most other shows which makes it interesting. It keeps you on the edge!
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I started reading reviews before I even bought this album.  The reviews I was reading were not flattering.  Most were saying that this was a lame attempt and was on par with albums like Risk and The World Needs a Hero.  I guess I'm bias because I like everything that Megadeth has ever released including Risk and TWNAH.  Like many I had heard the title track and was like \\"ehh, I'll wait to hear the rest\\".  Now that I've listened to the album several times I feel I can give a fair review.<br /><br />My overall feeling with the album is that it sounds different than any of their other releases.  I think this has to do with the guitars being tuned down 1 step.  I know that after Dave's neck surgery he apparently was left with a lower voice register so I can't fault him.  I know Youthanasia was tuned down half a step and sounded great but I always like the fact that Dave felt he could write heavy music without tuning down.  This is fine for new music but he now has to do it live as well.  My other feeling is that the album does seem in parts like it may have been rushed.  I was surprised that they got an album out as quick as they did considering all they've been doing.<br /><br />The title track is a simple, radio friendly song.  Megadeth has done it before and actually gotten good on several songs.  I felt with the name Super Collider it was going to be more on speed with Kick the Chair or Never Dead.  This is probably my least favorite on the album.<br /><br />Kingmaker, great heavy song.  Some are saying it's a rip off of Children of the Grave.  The vocal line is similar but the riff is not.  Plus, I'd say Sabbath was an influence of Dave's so who cares!<br /><br />Burn and Built For War are decent metal songs.<br />The Blackest Crow is not my taste but I respect Dave for trying something new.<br />Dance in the Rain is really good.  I'm not a fan of Disturbed so when I heard he would be doing a duet with Dave from Disturbed I was scratching my head.  It's a great fitwith the last half of the song rocking out!<br />My favorite song as of yet is Forget to Remember.  It's another \\"radio friendly\\" Megadeth song but this one stands out as one of the best.  This would have fit well on Cryptic Writings or Risk.  I think Dave has a good melodic side and it shows on this song.  The other songs Off the Edge, Beginning of Sorrow, and Dont Turn Your Back are decent.  The last song Cold Sweat was a good song to begin with by Thin Lizzy.  Megadeth do a good heavy version.  No complaints on this one.<br /><br />I think Megadeth fans will grow to like this album.  At first listen there will be some disappointment but I think there are several very good tracks.  I'm looking forward to the next few years of Megadeth because I was worried Thirteen was going to be their last album.  I feel like Super Collider is a rebirth for the next few years.

I carry the notebook between home and work and its very handy to just plug in one device and to have access to my printer, scanner and keyboard.

1475143389|5.0|All of the Michael Matthews books are awesome, definitely some of the best I've found about health and fitness.<br /><br />I bought Bigger Leaner Stronger, Cardio Sucks, Muscle Myths, and The Shredded Chef and have just finished reading / highlighting all of them. You don't necessarily need to buy all of them as some of the information is repeated between the books, but I liked BLS so much that I just decided to get the others too and treat them as a set. Am just about to get started with my weights and cardio routine, and also to start eating the way he recommends, so we'll see how it goes. I'm very optimistic though - the books are so well written, and so designed to cut through the extraordinary amount of BS that exists in the health and fitness arena. It's really refreshing to read something that really systematically pulls apart, part by part, what works and what doesn't, and where you need to direct your energies and where you simply don't, and to have it all be so accessible and well written. I'd highly recommend any of the books to anyone looking to get in shape and especially guys looking to build muscle. Also, before I decided on BLS, I did some quick research and found the book on at least a few 'best bodybuilding theory books' lists, so it seems like people are generally impressed. The most impressive thing is how he simplifies everything and the result is books that are really bang for buck; not too short, not too long - kind of the 80/20 principle applied to learning from scratch about an area of interest. Really, really recommend these books.<br /><br />Note: because these thoughts apply across the board to all four of the books I purchased, I'm just writing this once and cutting and pasting it into the review section for all four books, so please do not interpret that as a sign of a fake, company submitted review.
B009CG29RK|5.0|I've watched many movies with my children and this is one of my favorites, From Gru to the Girls and OMG the minions. It is just a fun movie all around.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Well, it's a fantastically shot, well paced, and occasionally (very) violent story about a quiet guy who moonlights as a chauffeur of sorts for the guys on the darker side of the law....  Who starts to fall for his neighbor. This wouldn't be a problem if her husband wasn't in prison and indebted to some also quite unpleasant people. It's a fantastic film, despite a reasonably simple idea at it's heart, the execution is brilliant. It isn't an action movie in the traditional Hollywood sense, which was a bit of a surprise to me when I saw it in the theatre here as it was billed the same as any other mindless popcorn flick. I was very pleasantly surprised.
B009J3K4MI|5.0|This is a great set at a great prices.  Sound quality is very high and the performances are superb.  Now I just have to finish getting through them all.

159463176X|3.0|I agree with Pamela and 35 others that this book was disappointing.  It certainly did not pack the punch of The<br />Kite Runner, which was more vital than reading a history of this remarkable country. I do not understand all<br />the coverage of the Greek doctor's scarred friend as being of importance to the plot. Possibly too many sub-<br />plots and a little artificiality in coordinating them?<br />Ellie
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|First of all any movie Denzel is in is worth buying renting watching I love that man his swagger alone is enough! Movie was great and easy to purchase Keep making great movies and keep offering them
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is awesome! Stick with it, eat right and you really will get results! Thank you Jillian! The motivation is there at first, everyone gets a little discouraged but then by the 20th day I saw what I was working so hard for. Now I'm ready for summer :)
B0044KI79S|5.0|Its of course Awesome, By far the best series on TV along with falling skies right now so need I say more!!!! BUY this series it is incredible!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Ordered this and soooo happy i did, my old cassetts were damaged by the heat and these songs bring back great memory's, He was and always be the KING and love his gospel music as well !!!!!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I liked the preview so thought it was worth a watch. I love these kinds of movies anyway .This is a very touching story. If you like boy meets dog stories, you'll love man meets dog!!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It takes up a lot of space and isn't easy to control on the kindle fire. Too much work for a small screen
B002HFP0R4|5.0|If you LOVE the Brothers Gibb, and I mean all of them; this is the collection for you. All the greats are here as well as some that you can't find anywhere else. True fans will REALLY appreciate the care put into this. I was excited to see and get to hear Andy's last two songs in there entirety! Wow!!
B008K9UZY4|4.0|Not the same as the old game but it keeps you preoccupied and keeps you involved for a fair amount of time
B0033TJATW|4.0|We know Michael wasn't an actor., but the vision of this piece can't be denied! He was always ahead of the game, this just put it out there for people to really see. Get past the &#34;story&#34; , yes there is one, and WATCH , I bet you'll see things you've forgotten..
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is okay for being a pocket edition but is hard to control and is missing some tools but it is understandable for being a kindle game
B00628RVV0|5.0|A great movie with an unexpected ending.  My friends didn't want to see it because \\"we know how these movies end.\\"  However, this one IS different and could be used as a springboard for discussion with older kids.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was lots of fun. I enjoyed it a great deal. The only criticism I can think of is that the clues were very leading. Other than that, it was great. The sound track added to the environment and even made the game seem spookie.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Installs easily and works perfectly. great app for listening to Jazz. I would recommend this App to anyone bar none.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|These are short stories, but good ones in the same great vein that I love and so will you if you like the Michael Connelly style. You only wish they were longer.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I was really disappointed by this book. I love Sophie Kinsella and have read all her books twice, but this one was different. I didn't like the plot to start with, I couldn't relate to the main character, and it didn't make me smile or laugh like the other books did.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|I'm not going to give a movie review. There are enough of those and I think this should be about the product.  You want to know what you're going to get....<br /><br />It's a quality copy of the movie in a basic Blu Ray package and a slip cover.<br />There is only one disc in the package and nothing else.<br /><br />I'm happy with it.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|Fun movie, silly dialog and plot, super cute actors, great production, acting not bad, better than average direction - Steven Soderbergh delivers.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I'm not going to give a movie review.  This should be a product review in my opinion.<br /><br />It's just a three disc set in a basic three disc cardboard package with a slip cover.<br />Each disc has bonus features.<br /><br />There is nothing extra.<br /><br />It's just right for the price.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|good game<br />tarries to make you spend to much money though but besides the greediness it is a good game
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I'm not going to bother with a movie review.<br /><br />This is a basic Blu Ray / DVD combo package without any extra stuff.<br />It's just like the package you would find in most stores.<br /><br />I'm happy with it.
0618871713|5.0|Sensitive autobiographical novel, Bechdel lets us view her growing-up years with a zoom lens that is both distant and intimate at the same time. Loved the graphics. Ordered copies as gifts for all the grown &#34;children&#34; in the extended family.
B000002GKT|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ,IT'S THE BEST ALBUM THE GROUP EVER MADE, WITH SOME SOME OF THE BEST BACK-UP SINGERS OF ALL TIME. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS WORTH LISTENING TO.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It is sad that other reviews are about everything other than the actual book. As a fan of Gideon and Eva, I was happy that it went from being a trilogy to a series. The more books the merrier. I want to read as much about these characters that the author is willing to write. I say that if you are a true fan you feel the same.<br /><br />The book started out right where book 2 ended and it was just a wonderfully awesome read. I enjoyed it and can't wait for the other two books.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This was just the ticket for my Plantronics bluetooth earpiece. I always carried my last earpiece in a snack size ziploc bag, so I was thrilled to have a true case for storage (and to prevent losing the darn thing)!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The answer is &#34;no.&#34; I have loved Josh's singing since he first appeared on Ali McBeal. I have all his albums, and I have seen him in concert. This album is much like his others. There are some songs I love better than others, but I appreciate everything he brings to the table. And, I also love that he is as wonderful a man as he is an artist. I will continue to buy whatever he records. Of course, that is my personal opinion, but with his record sales all over the world, I know many others feel the same way I do.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Definitely worth your attention. It is a challenge for any author to match the success of their first novel to win critical acclaim. Khaled Hosseini relays the poetry and heartbreak of the Afghan people like no other. Kite Runner is a must read, A Thousand Splendid Suns becomes imperative once you are familiar with his work and The Mountains Echoed continues the stream of fine writing. The novel tends to meander and lose direction at times but the overall experience is certainly worth while.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|3 hours long 1/3 thru some of the original story, most of the film had nothing in the book at all. A real stink fest. I will not pony up any more money for the other 2 remaining films. Utter disappointment in Peter Jackson for ruining the classic Tolkien story. Wait for it to be broadcast on TV.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Most confusing book I have  ever read. Never knew who was speaking or where they were  how would someone know where these fictional places are located?
B00COGXX7A|5.0|One of the better movies that I have seen in a long time.  Very enjoyable and an ending you never saw coming.  This is the kind of movie you would watch over and over again.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Very good read.  I loved leaning about the hotel business and Europe and New York.  I highly recommend it to you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So so disappointed, waited for this third book for months and  the ending  was terrible just left you hanging don't even know if I'd buy the 4th book. Might be time to start reading something else that has a start a middle and an ending.
B002X9W50E|5.0|I bought the man who sold the world new at the record store and all since then.After young americans I had enough.I just listened to low about a year ago and was pleasantly surprised.What im getting at is for bowie every album is a grabbag.scary monsters and lodger were absolute trash.anyways,i really liked reality and the reality tour.David seemed to bring back some magic that he seemed to have lost on SOME previous albums.This album had a good mix and was the kind to turn up and crash the same car on the freeway.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Bruce is getting too old to play &#34;hard&#34; guy. Looks like he should be rocking life in the easy chair
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Tons of fun. Frustrating when it freezes. Wish they gave more free coins daily for higher levels.  Free so can't complain too much. Really is a lot of fun!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I read the book.  It was good, more below.  The movie was nominated for all sorts of awards, so I watched it.  Jennifer Lawrence completely takes over this movie, in a good way.  She and Robert De Niro's performances are the reasons to watch this movie.  I loved Robert De Niro's subtle depiction of his own mental illness; clearly the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  I found this very realistic and true to my own life experience. The only puzzlement to me is how she fell in love with that dweebie simp, Pat, who is clearly still obsessed with his ex. Though in the book as in the movie, Tiffany falls for Pat almost immediately. It had to be his rockin' abs. Bradley Cooper, a fine actor in other vehicles, is too old to play Pat, for one thing.  The age difference between the actors distracted me here. I think what the movie does best, like the book, is show the complexity and reality of dealing with mental illness, both from the family's and the individual's standpoint. I loved the families depicted in this movie; they adjust to the reality of dealing with their family members' illness and support them. Oh, I absolutely hated the ending, with Nicki showing up at the dance competition.  Hated it.  The book was much better here.  Watch Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone instead. Now THAT is an Academy Award standard movie.
B000209ZAE|5.0|I have used this Proxxon drill press for quite a few years, now. When the appropriate screws are tightened, it is rock solid. The only downside is the return spring is not quite strong enough, IMO. The press doesn't always return all the way to the top, without a little help.<br /><br />Even though I have an 8&#34; drill press, I still use this little guy quite a bit. It takes up much less bench space than a real drill press. The adjustable fence it very handy. And it stores away, easily.<br /><br />Recently I purchased a second Proxxon drill press, just so I don't have to switch tools back and forth so much. The stand, itself, has become quite handy to me. A homemade wooden clamp is easy to make, with which to fasten various gizmos to the stand where I want an adjustable height.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I am a total fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  I own all of the novels in the series and have read them more than once. Like many other such fans, I reacted very badly to the news that Tom Cruise was playing Jack in this movie.  Tom owns Reacher's character, though, and unexpectedly won me over.  Physically of course, Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher, but psychologically he carried it off.  That's why they call it acting!  The movie's plot is pretty much true to the book, which is the story of an ex-army sniper accused of a mass shooting. The accused man asks for Reacher, for an initially mysterious reason. I actually found Rosamund Pike more distracting because of her trace accent. The evil Zec and his gang were suitably scary.  I would love to see another Reacher movie.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|This is really a fun angry birds game, takes a little getting used to with the whole gravity aspect. However, there are commercials every couple turns. It's very aggravating on a tough level. If there were no commercials, I would give this game 5 stars. Sadly, there are FAR too many.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Perhaps this story hit me so hard because its setting, in the early 1990's, took me back to my own younger years. The music, integral to the plot, definitely took me back to that time. The writing is excellent, the acting is top-notch across the board, and the story itself extremely engaging.  Charlie is our &#34;everyman&#34; here, and he is beautifully rendered by Logan Lerman. I don't want to give a plot synopsis, because everyone should just watch it.  It's Catcher in the Rye for our cynical post-post-modern age.  (Who knew that Emma Watson could really act?  She's good without all the props and spells and CGI magic. Really.  Ezra Miller is even better.  Really.  You should see this movie.)
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|This is honestly one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen.  What he goes through and has to do in order to live is a true test to the will to live.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's just outstanding!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun...great detective game you have to try to find all the clues to get the way out I would recommend this to any new detective I really enjoyed this game very fun and entertaining
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and simple puzzle game a la Myst. music is a bit distracting but the game play is easy and straight forward.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|I was very excited about getting this knife based on reviews. It only took a few minutes of ownership to decide I did not like it.  To start with on top of the tang it had several notches in it like it was cut out with a hack saw.  Then it was sprayed over with a paint that was about the texture of truck bed liner.  This made it seem like some cheap Chinese junk instead of a good quality Kabar product.  Next I notice it came with a very dull blade.  I get out a sheet of paper and it would not even cut paper with a slicing motion!!  Both Mora knives i purchased from the same order were much cheaper and sliced paper like nothing and could shave right out of the box.<br /><br />The grips feel like cheap plastic and the knife is too heavy to be as short as it is.  The weight is too much in the handle so it doesn't give the momentum for chopping so your carrying the extra weight without any advantage from it.  Get a longer blade for the same amount of weight or keep that size and go lighter.<br /><br />It feels solid like it would last forever, but I won't be the one lugging it around.
B001P36OY2|4.0|Seriously, when I saw this movie in the theater, it left me saying, \\"Wait, that's it? What just happened?\\" This 'raw and uncut' edition is a little better, to the point that the story actually has some sort of semblance of sense now, but it still needs a better edit. If I recall correctly, they cut 45 minutes from the film, and it looks like they only added about 11 minutes back, so I'm still left wondering what else was left out.<br /><br />It's better than it was, and it's an okay flick. I'm likely drawn into it because it's Vin Diesel more than anything else. Certainly not one of his better films, though not his fault at all. The studio jacked this movie six ways from Sunday.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game..it's awesome...just bought and downloaded the 2 nd version.This game is worth paying 4''..really keeps u busy...Love the new features
B0019LZV4E|3.0|I only gave this a 3 star because the movie had a lot of singing in it. The story line was fine and the acting was fine but I hated the singing. I LOVE Tim Burton movies and just about anything with Johnny Depp which is why I really wanted to watch it. The blood in the movie was also really bad, it looked like finger paint or something. Worth renting once, maybe, if you like a lot of singing then you might really enjoy the movie.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This film presents a good insight to an alcoholics life...worth seeing! Denzel Washington really shines in this movie! Good picture quality also in this Blu Ray!
B003SI3URQ|5.0|I loved this movie growing up and really wanted my son to watch it too. He loves this movie! It is a cute movie for children.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Die Hard 5 has nothing to do with the first three movies. There is absolutely no plot, Bruce Willis is just a supporting character. Movie is 90 mins, but feels like 4 hours.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I love this movie and have always loved this movie. I wanted my son to watch it since I enjoyed it so much as a child, he liked it as well. I think that this is a great movie for children and adults.<br /><br />Goofy and his son (who is in 'trouble') go on a trip even though his son does not want to go. They have a lot of little funny things that happen on the way to where they are trying to get to.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|We watched this concert on a TV special and loved it, so we ordered the CD.  It is so awesome!  The music is incredible.
B007ZLKK9I|4.0|I really liked this documentary it was very informative and put together fairly well. I would recommend this to anybody who likes documentaries, the Beatles, and George.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved theses books and could not wait for the 3rd one(AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE LAST ONE) to come out. I was SO mad NOT  to see the ending. I AGREE with the other reviews. Trilogy means 3.  Now I have to wait for the LAST one. Hope it's NOT a year from now. Still love the books Sylvia Day
B004RL9T50|3.0|I personally didn't care so much for this move, I laughed a few times but it was nothing great. My son on the other hand really enjoyed this movie, it is a cute movie for parents to put in for their kids while they have to clean or just get something done around the house.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game involves a young grafitti artist being chased by a police officer/security guard for defacing a train. As the vandal/artist tries to escape you collect coins increasing your score. The vandal/artist goes through various challenges while trying to escape. Play ends when the vandal/artist crashes into an obstacle. I find it disturbing when that obstacle is a moving train and the vandal/artist is smashed across the screen. Seconds later the vandal/artist is inviting you to do it again! My five year old has downloaded this game on every device we own. All my children love it. I've tried to play it but it makes me feel dizzy, as if I've been on an amusement park ride. However, I still find the challenge fun.  My children are able to get six and seven figure scores, I'm not as skilled. But it's fun to let them try to help me do better. If you can accept the criminal component, the moderate violence, and the repeated disobedience of the artist/vandal, then it's a really fun game to play.
B005TBN04S|4.0|I do think this is funny a very funny movie BUT it is a little too similar to the first one. With that being said the first one is much better then this one. I would not really recommend buying this movie, it would be okay to rent though (I did buy and now wish I just rented it).
B0007P0LO8|5.0|I cannot not help but agree with so many of the comments being made in these reviews and yet it still cannot shake my opinion that this version of Butterfly is both musically and dramatically brilliant. What one person criticizes, the other praises and the odd thing is that I can see it both ways.  It certainly does offer a number of anachronisms as well as a certain amount of kitsch. Nevertheless, I have had the DVD for years and I simply cannot get over how powerfully directed and musically compelling it is.  I recommend it to people all of the time.  For me the flower duet, which is done in a manner that could never be achieved onstage, is simply an astonishingly beautiful and magical idea.  Additionally, the death of Butterfly, delayed until Pinkerton arrives, is unique and powerful because it gives Butterfly's character an added level of strength which is often missing.  After all she tells Kate that she will give Pinkerton his son \\"if he will come to fetch him.  Climb the hill in half and hour from now\\".  Ponnelle's staging of the final scene, which does not follow the action described in parenthesis' certainly reflects this text which is usually lost in virtually every production I have seen, accepting those who have seen this version and learned from it!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|These games are challenging yet very fun, I have enjoyed all of them. The only complaint I have with Time travel is that it's much shorter then the first two. I really hope they add more levels soon.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|Great CD  love the songs and great music  they never disappoint with the hits and love songs a must buy
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great with all the different sounds you can make a wide variety of relaxing mixes depending on what mood your in. You can even make it sound creepy if you want. I really enjoy using this app and I would recommend it to others.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Interesting to read all of this after Chris has passed on. Makes it all seem sad, but you can't help but feel a sense of pride and patriotism thanks to the amazing men and women who do these things so we can live the lives of freedom we have!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this solitaire game.  I have it on my smartphone, too, and cannot seem to just play one game.  It is addicting and a lot of fun for hours on end.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This movie wasn't bad at all. A lot of the reviews complain about the beginning, but the beginning is excellent, and one of my favorite parts of this movie. Why? Well, let's see...<br /><br />As soon as he enters the world of Oz, we get blasted in the face with a brilliant colorgasm of CGI. It almost hurts. I kind of wished the whole movie were desaturated at some parts. The world is crazy colorful and naturific in an Avatar way, but that nature doesn't really play any part other than to bite Oz twice in the beginning (you'll see what I'm talking about). All this work done - all 9 trillion polygons of it - on the ridiculous environment and it barely plays a part at all. I expected a little more involvement, but I guess they wanted to save time.<br /><br />The plot is decent, and has a nice twist, as stated in every review on this movie. Not as crazy as Departed, but it's a twist. I kind of wanted him to meet some more prominent friends, but the glass girl I guess just hit a wall in their creativity.<br /><br />Still an enjoyable movie, and definitely worth watching! I feel like it was limited by the more family-oriented rating they were looking for, and that as an R movie it could have really been something insane, but that's just me...<br /><br />So, ahem, stop reading this and go watch it! Just bring some sunglasses or something, though...
1594204217|5.0|I must admit that Pollan ir preaching to the choir here. I'm a dedicated amateur cook, and almost everything we eat is mostly scratch-cooked. I love experimenting with different techniques and improving my game, and I'm particularly looking forward to using info from the \\"Air\\" chapter to improve my \\"artisan\\" bread's taste, texture, and nutrition.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say that it's all very well to read about cooking, but it's rather like watching food shows on TV: people do that while eating processed food or take-out, because they think it's inaccessible. What's sad is- it's really not, at least for most people. Home from-scratch cooking is cheaper than eating out if what you buy is of any decent quality, and while Pollan rhapsodizes about mono-tasking in doing this, personally I use timers so I can both cook the onions for a half hour AND catch up online, stirring them once every 5 min or so. They really can amuse themselves most of the time!<br /><br />Similarly with all the other cooking he does- one does NOT have to dedicate 5 hours to brewing beer; one simply has to be around for those 5 hours while the process goes on, and intervene periodically. As with barbecue, and braises, and breads, and cheese, and even more so with wild fermentation of veg.<br /><br />So: I don't think people don't cook because of the crazy amount of hands-on time; hell, I've made Beef Wellington from scratch, including the puff paste, taking no more than around 45 min/day... but PLANNING. There's such an emphasis on getting food on the table in 30 min! 20 min! 15 min! that \\"slow food\\"- which doesn't take all that much more time in task, but takes longer elapsed- is scanted.<br /><br />I mean, there's pretty much nothing that I can make in 30 min from start to finish that I'd want to eat. Maybe a grilled cheese sandwich? but that depends on having decent bread, which I make...<br /><br />Anyway. I've done barbecue- at least semi-authentic; many, many braises and stews; a LOT of bread (we never buy bread, though I vary between stuff made in the bread machine and the more artisnal approaches which I am working to improve); and wild fermentation of excellent sauerkraut, kimchee, and various other veg, plus some cheesemaking (nothing aged yet; I don't have a \\"cave\\"), and both beer and wine. None are hard or especially complicated, though the cheese, beer, and wine can be a tad fussy, as can sourdoughs. Still: not actually inaccessible for anyone not living in a food desert, or working 3 jobs to try to make ends meet (and even then, if one can get decent veg and meat, a slow cooker will do wonders and needs no babysitting).<br /><br />I also very much appreciated that Pollan put this into a more modern context, rather than blaming women for stopping cooking. My own mother pretty much stopped from-scratch cooking when I was a kid (I'm now in my mid-50s), and relied more and more on stuff like hamburger helper, plus a few \\"shortcut\\" meals that were pretty awful. And she was not employed outside the home, so that wasn't the reason; I think it was simply the times, and the advertising. Pollan suggests that men and kids get into the kitchen; I support that! At one point I made a Family Rule: no one got to complain about dinner unless they were cooking 1 meal a week for the family. It worked great! and got my husband and kid into the kitchen.<br /><br />I digress. I really enjoyed this book, and look forward to exploring more about breads in particular. But right now there's a cabbage calling my name that needs to get shredded, salted, and start fermenting.OT of bread (we never buy bread, though I vary between stuff made in the bread machine and the more artisnal approaches which I am working to improve); and wild fermentation of excellent sauerkraut, kimchee, and various other veg, plus some cheesemaking (nothing aged yet; I don't have a \\"cave\\"), and both beer and wine.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great acting. Excellent story line. Great action and very funny.<br /><br />Nice surprise actors. Well deserved Oscar for Christoph Waltz.<br /><br />Happy to include it in my Tarantino collection
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its a great game i love it my only prob is that it seems like coins are a bit lacking but othere than th&agrave;t its a fun game
B008Y5N3O8|5.0|All star cast and world class script. Gritty dialog, and a great story telling. You wouldn't want to call any of these guys your friend, but you feel sympathetic to their story. Classic tag lines everywhere. You can see the inspiration for the Gil character from &#34;the Simpsons&#34;.
0425252868|5.0|Each passing day takes away from us more men and women who survived the battles of WWII.  `A Higher Call' by Larry Alexander provides a chronicle of the lives of two such men - both pilots - one a U.S. bomber pilot named Charlie Brown; the other a German fighter ace named Franz Stigler.<br /><br />This book is unusual as it is told in the first person from the perspective of each airman via numerous interviews over several years. It is also unique because of the circumstances that not only brought them together - twice- but, too, the decisions by each pilot in combat and afterward.<br /><br />The year was 1943 when just four days before Christmas the B-17 Lil Pub flown by 21 year old Lt. Charles Brown and manned by his surviving crew flew seemingly mortally wounded over the skies of Germany.  Having sustained tremendous damage the aircraft barely limped along losing altitude - a lone straggler from what remained of a larger bomber formation no longer visible on the horizon.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, a Messerschmitt fighter, one with Lt. Franz Stigler in the cockpit was in position to claim another victory.  What happened next defies imagination given the wartime circumstances.  In retrospect, it may be among the more incredible encounters between enemy combatants during WWII.<br /><br />The narrative is also both engaging and compelling as each central character provides a lens through which a reader can view their lives as part of a larger historical motif.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It remains as of this writing only one of two books I have read this year and reviewed that has earned five stars.
0316247545|4.0|I'd rate this a 4 1/2, but I can't, so 4 stars suits it, I guess. I learned some new things about the MLP Verse reading this, such as Surprise being a Wonderbolt, and the possible original home of Celestia and Luna. I was disappointed to know that the book had more than half of the pages involving show episodes. I mean fair enough, it's a guidebook to the episodes, but meh. At least it was informative and provided a lot of good information for a decent price.<br /><br />Also, the cover of the book is just beautiful. It's not exactly like the Elements of Harmony book from the first episode, but it's still incorporating some of the design into the cover, so it's a great cover.<br /><br />I'd recommend if you are a brony to invest in this book. You may learn something cool, including some ideas that Lauren Faust intended for the show.

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I'm a big Jack Reacher fan so was very very very surprised and perplexed at the selection of Tom Cruise to play Reacher.  It's like a midget playing Hulk Hogan.  Guess Cruise's star quality was more important than Reacher's character & big bucks must have over rode Lee Child's brain wave.  Now that I've given my piece of mind, I must say that I was mildly surprised to find myself enjoying the movie.  Storyline was off base from the novel but movie moved along at a pretty good pace.  In typical fashion, it made for an enjoyable action movie, one that simply took me into my own &#34;fantasyworld&#34; for several hours of relaxation.  By the way, laugh if you will, but these kind of action type movies helps me to unwind from my daily life.

B004EPZ03Y|4.0|The 2011 rendition of The Muppets proved to be a successful one. Jason Segel is a great foil for these Muppets, while Walter himself is not a bad addition to the Muppets character lineup. The plot is easy to follow, and will hold everyone's attention spans for the running time (approx 1.75 hours). The only major complaint I have against the film is a really bad rap sequence somewhere in the middle that you'll know it when you see it. Fortunately, that's why there is a 'Skip' button on DVD or Blu-ray remotes. There are MANY great celebrity cameos which are a hallmark of Muppet movies. \\"Pictures in my Head\\" is one of these scenes that will make anyone of any age teary-eyed! I join in all the recommendations for this film. Anyone at any age can easily enjoy this without a second thought.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is a great series. A must watch. You will watch teh entire thing in 1 sitting if you have the time to spare.
B001TH16DI|4.0|WARNING!!! WARNING!!! I expected that this would not have the Director's Cut of The Wrath Of Kahn, but I did NOT expect a lessser Undiscovered Country which was lack over 1 minute of crucial informative scenes which were all related to Rene Auberjonis's charector who was cut completely out. It's unforgivable because it added so so much to the plot and ending. SO BUYER BEWARE!!! THIS SET ALL THOUGH IMPRESSIVE AND AWESOME DOESSHAVE ONE SERIOUS FLAW. A CUT VERSION OF THE UNDISCOVERED COUNRTY. My personal favorite.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written with 80's references and American characters that speak the queens English. There are 30 minute erotic or soft porn movies that won't waste a Few days of reading for 20 minutes of tantalizing content. Big waste of a read. If you paid for this book then you should feel like a who're.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|It's a Quentin Tarentino movie. Do I really need to say anything more? I mean the man is his own genre.
0979019710|5.0|From cover to cover Hal speaks with emotion and enthusiasm. He has confirmed something that I learned from my experience. That is, the worst time to make an excuse is when your excuse is valid. If Hal never walked again people would understand, but that's not the case today! His book is not just inspiring and motivational, although it is those things there is an incredible degree of strategy involved. I recommend miracle morning with bells and whistles. Enjoy!

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Riveting. I saw the movie first and couldn't turn away though I wanted to. Then someone was reading the book and of course was deeply engrossed in it.  I had to read it. The writing is concise and deeply psychological and almost in the form of memoir writing. It is most compelling. The book informs the film which I recently purchased and must see again. I recommend this book without reservation.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|So many of these hero movies end up being bad. But I should have expected what Joss Whedon produced, a great fun romp, with fantastic character interaction along the way. This is how comic adaptations should be.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|Against my better judgement, I was pulled in to the first novel about 1/4 of the way in. ( Brans &#34;accident&#34; )<br />From that point on I grew to really enjoy these books, with there daring characters and twists and turns. Books 1-3 have earned 4 stars or so from point of view,.<br /><br />This fourth book was a terrible disappointment. We abandon the characters we have been invested in, are forced to care about new characters (unsuccessfully) that end up just being tossed aside. It's so bad that it ends, literally, with an apology from the author!<br /><br />So sorry, but he's lost me as an audience.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|My favorite part of the book was when the mutts showed up as the dead tributes<br />I only gave it 3 stars because I was really upset about Rue and the fact that Peeta kept getting stabbed by Cato<br />I'd recommend this book to any one really HATES Twilight
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Take an hour and a half of straight reading to enjoy London's wonderful novella about a dog and the desire for life in all creatures that are not their own masters. Buck serves to lead the reader through a series of adventures and mishaps, and eventually to a better understanding of those urges we all feel when life becomes too predictable and too safe. The writing is simple and a few moments are boring, but there are also one or two episodes of suspense and a few lines of brilliance that makes the novella worth the effort.
B005MHHREI|5.0|Good book aimed directly at one of the worst human beings who has ever lived.  Long live the U.S. Constitution!

B0095ZQ36G|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this work. It begins with the author's thoughts about the German enemy in World War II while he was a youngster, and how those thoughts changed after he came to know a German flyer in later life. While the book provides an example of how one's perspective can change, there was a certain shallowness in the writing. Some people may enjoy it, but I am not one of them.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I love the many personal interactions involved between the various characters in LOST. A great show for those who enjoy watching mystery or suspense programs. I introduced it to my sister and now she's hooked on it.

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am an educator and wanted to blow off the \\"bad juju\\" of a rough school year by listening to the loud stuff first on this album, so I must have hit repeat for the back to back noise-fest of \\"If I had a Tail\\" and \\"My god is the sun\\" 50 times before I listened to the whole album. But once I did, I realized I was missing out on some great stuff. I agree with other reviews - this is the most cohesive album for QOTSA to date. Josh has been through some heavy stuff, and his contemplation of all that is evident here. For me, a lot of the slower tunes on previous albums have been throw-aways (sorry Josh, I do love you and have everything you've done), but not on this album. I do miss that there is not a song with Mark Lanegan on lead vocals, but I'll live (and buy Mark's latest effort). Check out their recent Later with Jools Holland performance(loved the menacing dude just sitting there during \\"If I had a Tail\\")or on Letterman - blew the roof off of the studio!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!

0385535147|3.0|This book had a wonderful start with an excellent plot. However, about three fourths through the book, I had to check the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up the wrong book to read. The plot abruptly changes, the characters change, and a once what appeared to be, honest man turns totally criminal.  I do love Grisham's books, that I have read, (and I have read most of them), but this one left me a bit disappointed. Nevertheless I won't stop reading his books.

B006ON41FC|2.0|At first the game is fun and somewhat addictive. But there is no level progression in this game and this is its major pitfall. So instead of advancing to another level you play the same stage over and over again. You can complete &quot;goals&quot; set by the game (such as collecting x amount of nuts in one try) but these tasks are pretty mundane in the beginning until later in the game when they become downright impossible to fulfill.  Either way the player does not gain any kind of power up or unlock any secrets upon completion of these t asks. The only payoff is...wait for it...another series of tasks. Pretty lame.

B006T5GTK0|4.0|I bought this to replace my husban's VHS copy. It turned out to be an earlier version by 20 years. We enjoyed this version so much better. It's a rather long story but doesn't seem so while watching. The later version was actually a miniseries in the 80's. The later version while considerably longer didn't add anything to the story.<br /><br />This will make for a nice movie night for the family.

0545265355|5.0|I've had the flu recently which allowed me time to read the trilogy while recuperating. I'm glad I did. I see clearly how it went from a book to a movie so quickly. It's haunting, disgusting and touches the base of reality TV programs out there.  What better way to feed our 'hunger' than with children killing each other for sport and punishment?<br /><br />When I start a book, I like to read the author's bio first. Sometimes that tells me more about the story than anything else and Suzanne Collins tells us from the beginning-this is going to be gruesome study of war and the effects on children. It was.<br /><br />The tone of all 3 books was quite different though. The first book was more for shock value and sets up beautifully the characters and settings. The hunger games itself, was not as gritty as I thought it would be. But I loved how she made the protagonist flawed and forced into a love triangle.<br />Second book, Catching Fire, really did what it promised. There was cockiness to it. The characters no longer children, but teenagers ready to rebel against what they knew was coming. President Snow be dammed. It was my favorite one out of the series.<br /><br />Mockingjay, the third installment, had me suspicious from the start. It reminded me of the movie 28 DAYS LATTER, when the gang thinks they are safe when they reach the army base, only to realize it's just another twisted obstacle to deal with. I never trust Coin and I never guess the ending would be anything but gloom and doom, especially after the Hanging Tree song.  Then, I remember the author's bio and think there's a moral to it all.  It ends tragically, but it could have been much worse. The writing was exquisite, painfully detailed and always baiting me to read further, especially the last sentence of every chapter.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!! Hope the movie is just as great!....
0307454894|4.0|When he was 15, and growing up in Germany, Michael Berg contracted hepatitis.  One day, on the way home from school he vomited on the front stoop of an apartment building.  The lady who cleaned up the mess was Hanna Schmitz. It was her apartment.  The next time he saw her, Michael brought Hanna flowers, she asked him to bring up some coal, which he dutifully did.  By the time Michael had finished delivering the coal to Hanna, he was covered in soot.  Hanna told him to go take a shower.  By the time he had finished, Hanna was standing behind him, naked.  And so began a summer long love affair between Michael a 15 year old high school student and Hanna, a 36 year old streetcar operator.<br /><br />The lovemakeing became very ritualistic, always involving bathing, but then a new element was added.  Hanna asked Michael to read to her, at first Homer's The Odyssey, and then other classics from literature.  And so, every day after school, Michael would go to Hanna's house, make love to her and then read to her.  But as the weeks grew to months, tensions appeared.  Hanna wanted to be the dominant person in the relationship, and that bothered Michael.  Whenever they argued, which was happening more frequently, Michael was the one who always gave in and apologized.  At the same time Michael was becoming more popular with girls his own age in school, and so consequently, he became later and later for his meetings with Hanna.  As Michael was beginning to feel guilty for withdrawing from Hanna, Hanna broke off the relationship, and just as suddenly as it had begun, the relationship was over.<br /><br />Michael goes on with his life, finishing high school and going to college, where he attended a seminar on the concentration camps of Nazi Germany.  He gets to witness a German trial of Nazi prison guards and their victims.  To his shock and surprise, one of the Nazi guards being put on trial was Hanna Schmitz.  Hanna was accused of barricading a church door under Nazi bombardment.  The church contained many Jewish prisoners that were to be sent to Auschwitz.  Hanna was also accused of writing the report that detailed the atrocity. Hanna was made the ringleader, but really she was the scapegoat, as the other defendants tried to gain leniency. By now, Michael realizes that Hanna could not have written the report, as he knew she could not read or write, that's why she had him read to her.  Hannah wasn't about to admit that she was illiterate, so she was silent as she was accused of these war crimes.  Would Michael step in and tell the judge what he knew about Hanna's illiteracy, and spare her from a death sentence?  Read the Reader and find out.<br /><br />I recommend this book, but it's a qualified recommendation.  It is truly a riveting story and I wanted to read the book because the movie did  not go into the level of detail that I wanted, but I soon became frustrated with Schlink's writing style, because I felt in spots where he needed to be more explicit, he was purposefully vague.  The author also likes to spring surprises on the reader, for example I thought the ending would be anticlimactic, but it was quite shocking, because in the last few pages of the book, there is a twist.  I didn't particularly like the twist it came on too suddenly and unexpectedly.  There was also times where he seemed to be assuaging the German collective guilt over Nazi Germany a bit too much.  All of these factors detracted from a very good narrative.  It's still a good book, but the story drags in places where it shouldn't.<br /><br />For more book reviews, check out my blog reviewswithatude@wordpress.com

B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This adaptation, err the spin off from the Great Movie - The Wizard of Oz, is a must see.  I am kicking myself for not getting to see it on the &#34;Big Screen&#34;, the color's are vibrant on my widescreen, score is amazing, and the casting of actors and actresses is perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />The plot is written well, but I think it should be a little bit longer, I felt like something is missing - hence the deduction of a star in my rating.  It does however take a twist in the plot early on, and the ending tells the tale of the Wicked Witches in the main movie.
B00C81AVNU|2.0|The music is good for the most part, the lyrics are not. Apart from 'What A Woman Wants' and 'History of Wrong Guys', the lyrics just seem flat out lazy. Repeating \\"yeah, yeah\\" for 4 minutes or \\"the most beautiful thing in the world\\" for 6 is hardly what I call genius songwriting. Out of the 15 songs I've listen to multiple times on this album I can only recall the melodies of 4...the rest aren't just forgettable, but near impossible to remember. The show itself is a great crowd-pleaser, but I cannot comprehend how people can think that this is \\"one of the best scores in years\\". I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but the music is so mechanised and devoid of charm (for the most part) that I struggle to grasp how people can honestly think this.<br />The orchestrations are very good and the dance sequences are great, but for the life of me the album is so forgettable. It's a shame because the show is quite good, the music, not so much. I'm sure Cyndi Lauper fans will be on the attack about this, but they must remember that I am reviewing the Kinky Boots cast recording, not Lauper.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I ASK YOU TO PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS WHO ARE LOOKING DOWN ON ALL OF US...WHO APPARENTLY CAN'T MAKE OUR OWN OPINION AND POSSIBLY ENJOY THIS MOVIE.  I don't know why people are looking so hard into this movie to the point that many folks are ripping on it or disappointed.  First Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman, I don't care what anyone else wants to say about Christopher Reever.  Reever was great for his time...but Cavill is the man when you compare them both.  His physique alone is Superman.  No other actor has ever looked the part like him.  Second---Superman is the first and greatest.  He's the most powerful.  Shouldn't the threat to him also be of a large magnitude....instead of some crazy dude that wants more real estate (Previous Superman Films)?  Superman deserves an Epic threat, epic battles, epic scenery.....epic everything.  It makes no sense to watch a Superman movie where he is not shown in his full glory.  All the previous versions did not really show him unleashed.  They were somewhat comical as well.  When you see this movie...you have to watch it and think \\"How would people react if this dude actually appeared today\\".  Superman finally gets to show his stuff in this movie...and some people are upset because he is not cracking lame public safety messages like \\"Use your seatbelt..and flying is still the safest form of transportation\\", or saving a cute little cat from a tree, etc. etc.  Really bad people with his same powers come to earth to reform it into Krypton.  What would you do to them if you had superman's powers?  Would you talk them to death....or if you had to..would you unleash and do what you had to do?  This movie ROCKS.  It does not stop it's momentum and you are glued to your seat.  When yo watch this movie, you can't think of any other version of it like the Christopher Reeve Superman.  You can't compare it to anything else because this is the beginning, just like Batman begins.  Think of how the Batman movies where so wellexplainned as to how it could happen.  Well again...think of how people would react if he appeared in today's society...and given the threat represented towards earth...what would you do in order to save your family and the whole planet?  Have an open mind and enjoy the ride...I did!
145210655X|5.0|Many of the jokes are not new, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  My grandson started blowing bubbles, with a straw, in his milk, just a few months ago.  It was that image that sold me on the book.  My son is a Star Wars fan, a trait inherited from me and reinforced by the Ewok costume his mother made for Halloween many years ago.  I bought the book for my son, because last month he took his son to a Super Hero convention.  My grandson really wanted to see Darth Vader, but the reality was a bit nerve wracking, so he held back.  Spidey, Wonder Woman and Batman posed no problem, but he was really unsure of Vader.  I sent the book to my son, and three days before Father's Day I got a picture of my son reading the book with his son.  The book is OK, typical of what one would expect from Star Wars cartoons, but the personal connection made this Father's Day very special!
B00CA4S27W|5.0|As always, this band of minstrels provides an eclectic blend of rich and robust music derived from various cultures and historical eras.  The instrumentation continues to be pristine and polished, adding a cool and soothing layer to the melodies. Whether one awakens to the music to feel a hearty start to the day or if the disc is played at night to wind down after another challenging day, the calming effect is equally rich. One unusual note is buried in the smallest of print in the album credits: \\"Thanks to Fox News for the Truth.\\"  I would assume that this great group is not racist nor homophobic, so I'll assume that this is some tongue in cheek reference.  All my friends and former students who work at Faux News always jokingly tell me that truth at the network is as omnipresent as autographed Obama photos.  A funny credit notation,indeed.
1451675046|4.0|This is a good, straightforward introduction that re-stated what are, to me, some blinding flashes of the obvious.  The book is perfect for someone just beginning to explore truth vs. dogma, but didn't open any new ground for me.  Then again, I've been exploring human belief systems for the better part of 50 years.  There are several young people I know who will enjoy this book.  I'm not sure their parents will appreciate my giving it to them!

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Most of the cast in this engrossing movie are relatively unknown. It is based on a true story about the slaughter of the Israeli athletes who were slaughtered by terrorists at the Munich summer olympic games. This revenge came years after once the intelligence was gathered by then PM Golda Meir. The Mossad were successful in their long act, but I think the movie points out the letdown of acts of revenge in any context. I think everyone should see this movie.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book is somewhat predictable and it was sometimes hard to keep track of the relationships, but in the end they all get straightened out.  There are so many topics of conversation including slavery, the role of society, who is your mother and who is the person who raised you?  The interesting thing in this book is that a white girl is an indentured servant and she lives among the black servants on this plantation.  There is, of course, the evil one,  but you can't tell a good story without one.  Fall into the spell of The Kitchen House and let it carry you to a time in our history we need all forget.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It showed how evil those orphanages could be  and how the nuns could be so bad. It was nice to see that even after all the evil things that happened ones will did not give up in finding love
B009K0P10K|5.0|The story is engaging, the characters are well built, Madeleine Stowe is absolutely amazing, and Emily VanCamp is a great protagonist. Worth of your time!
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|Instant video is very confusing and now have paid for a video I already own twice. I have a credit on my account but have no access to it. This should never be this confusing. I would like to get refuned for this movie and my code to be applied for it thanks. ZLKQ-LJJGSH-KXAXEV This is my code I was provided with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a big fan of minecraft cool game pls delete the zombies there really annoying to me I'm ok with the creepers
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|A little cinematic license with this series, some added parts that aren't in the book, but done tastefully.  Can't wait for the next two parts.  Enjoyed watching it at home.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I haven't bought this album yet but I have downloaded some songs from tubemate. I just can't totally agree with some of the bad reviews. Yes it isn't as relative as the dark Knight trilogy but it's still sick. Hans wanted to try something new this time, and I think that was interactive listening. Made u feel like u were in the song and u were Superman. Just like Zack did with the movie, which I just saw an hour ago and it was freaking excellent. I only hated sticking around hoping for some post credits action but wasdissappointed. I wont post my review on that until I see the movie<br />again tho.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />My girlfriend purchased the steelbook deluxe edition for me as birthday gift and I love her for it. Honestly this soundtrack is incredible. Alot of people criticize it because they say it has no discernable melody or some crap like that. Well let me clue you guys in on something: it's not supposed to sound like anything you've ever heard before! It's the sound of an alien race! Even the sounds and instruments used sound like there not even from this world! This cannot be listened to in any other way but LOUD. It scares everybody when I put it on. Especially You Die Or I Do, which is easily one of the best tracks on the audio. Only thing I'm disappointed at is that An Ideal Of Hope is not on there. Is it in the sketchbook and I just missed it? And I hate how theres no track listing. I only know song from song because amazon gives them to you in the product details. But freakin love this soundtrack forever and will kill anyone involved if Zimmer does not score MOS 2. Seriously.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones continues to receive overwhelmingly popular reviews (heading the yearly \\"best of\\" lists of Time and The Washington Post among others) while its plot lines make the front pages of the newspapers.<br /><br />DVD sales are stratospheric: 241,00 copies of this second series box set sold on the first day of release. On television millions anticipate the next episode on Sky.<br /><br />\\"Arya\\" is the fastest growing girl's name in the States and indeed \\"Game of Thrones\\" itself has now become a widely used term for political power-play.<br /><br />Why? What is it about this cod-medieval drama which has hit the spot for so many people?<br /><br />Locations are unusual and somewhat unlikely, ranging from Northern Ireland to Dubrovnik; the cast contains few stellar names; the budget, though massive, doesn't allow for grand action scenes on the scale of the movies.<br /><br />However, underpinning the series are the books, the as yet unfinished collection of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin. The narrative drive which the books provide means the viewer is gradually immersed in the world of Westeros, and once hooked is then a captive witness to the unfolding drama.<br /><br />The pace of the storyline is deceptive and unpredictable; long periods of dialogue will be interrupted by a sudden and occasionally shocking event. Characters which one has come to know will meet a brutal end seemingly before their time. The endless capability to surprise means that the story maintains a strange kind of reality, despite its somewhat melancholic other-worldliness.<br /><br />Production values are beyond those which one might think strictly necessary for a TV epic. A whole new language was created for the Dothraki, entailing months of linguistic development. Costumes and sets reference the medieval and are at times exquisitely beautiful, helping this make-believe pageant to become a functioning totality.<br /><br />The on-screen detail is such that I at least am content to watch one episode several times before moving onto the next.<br /><br />If you've resisted so far then I envy you. A fantastic journey lies ahead.watch one episode several times before moving onto the next.<br /><br />If you've resisted so far then I envy you. A fantastic journey lies ahead.
