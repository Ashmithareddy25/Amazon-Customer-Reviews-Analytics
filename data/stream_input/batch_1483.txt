B0086700CM|5.0|finally what everybody has been waiting for temple run for the kindle fire. also this game really fun the first thing you have to upgrade is the coin multiplier.
B003OOVVH0|3.0|This would have been a really good episode if not for the soundtrack. The last two episodes had really depressing soundtracks that played at times that weren't depressing. There were places in the story line that the track (as crap as the music they selected was) would have fit but instead they played it at really weird times and made the story seem disjointed. But this has definitely been one of the better episodes so far, storywise. They weren't horribly depressing, there wasn't sex for the sake of sex, and the acting wasn't miserable (also I agree with the previous rater and that without Owen this episode got better for me).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I loved this app and it was great for me to use at school and at home. its very conveniant everywhere I love it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|If you have read 50 Shades of Grey, this is a MUST READ!Jamie McGuire has a talent for developing her characters, while keeping the reader in suspense. Although the characters/relationship is not a fairy tale, its a GREAT read full of human emotion good & bad.
B0086700CM|4.0|it has good graphics and easy controls. I wouldn't pay for it unless it got more interesting.  however I like it for free and for moments I need something to do.

B0086700CM|5.0|soooooo fun I loved it at first you don't get it but when it tells you how to play so addicting
B0086700CM|5.0|It is glitchy, but still the best running game ever made. They should have spent a lot more time fixing the fact that it is glitchy and slow. It is still a fun game and people shouldn't hate it. It is fun and very addicting. I love it!!!

B006VA57CY|1.0|I've tried updating adobe flash, but this film will not play for me.  There is limited help on the site to fix the problem.  I've attempted this with both Firefox and IE.  It starts to play but crashes soon after the PBS logo appears.
B005L38QK2|4.0|I just got this mouse yesterday after ordering it late Monday night with next-day shipping. I have to say if you are a Diablo 3 fan this mouse is absolutely perfect. The software that you have to download from the steelseries website allows you to customize all of the buttons in any way that you can. But for Diablo fans the buttons come pre-loaded with Diablo macros. After changing one button the four side buttons corresponded with the 1-4 actions in the game. Also, as the product promises, the mouse has a lifetime of 10 million clicks. Whats nice about this is that the program i mentioned shows you exactly how many clicks you have made and with which button. The red lights that come out of the mouse wheel and the Diablo logo cannot be changed in color because, why would you want to? Diablo is all about red! But the lights can be adjusted for brightness and how frequently they flash. But why only four stars? The mouse that I had before this one is the one that I have been always using. It Was considerably smaller than the steelseries and had only 3 buttons. I get hand cramps somewhat often and I might press a button at the exactly wrong time, usually resulting in my death in-game. While these might not be problems for most people, I see it as a minor problem that will probably be fixed with time and practice. When I notice that these problems are fixed I will change this review to 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it if your bored or don't no what to do play this game and your no longer bored! The best thing is its FREE!!!!!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I purchased this app and completed it in 6 hrs.  Glad I only payed 99 cents for it. It was far to short.  graphics were good but story line was shallow. I hope they include a story line in the future.
0345803507|1.0|English is not my first language and to be honest I thought it was just me and my sometimes \\"poor\\" English that made me miss something while reading this \\"best seller\\". The story is kind of silly and certainly not bealivable, but it's fiction after all, so I kept on reading. I finished the book and I had the same feeling I ussually have when a bad movie is finally over... somehow I never walk out of the theater even if the emovie is bad and I never stop reading a book, even if it's as bad as this one. I will not be wasting my time, money or brain cells on the other two books, not worth it...... I'm glad that other people had similar views...I really thought it was just me.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I love this CD! It has merengue, latin pop, and latin rock all in one. One of Shakira's finest and I'm not a huge fan.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Absolutely no story line.  Couldn't finish it. Terrible.  Very disappointed that this book was recommended to me.  It is almost insulting amazon thought I'd like this.  DO NOT buy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is fun to play when u r board . u can also play it when u r going on a trip somewhere far

I have been waiting for it on Android for a looooong time, and when I saw that it was available for FREE, I downloaded it immediately. Definitely my favorite game...
B0086700CM|5.0|tho temple run game is extremely awesome! ! !!!!!! ! ! ! it works perfectly! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  if you have a kindle fire get this app I RECOMMEND THIS GAME WORLDWIDE
B0061S073A|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire and have loved it.  I let my kids (ages 4-11) play on it and my youngest had accidentally purchased in-game content from a game when he WASN'T in Kid's Place.  This app not only restricts which games they are allowed to play, but also keeps them from accidentally making purchases.  The only thing I wish I could do is put some books in it for the kids to read.  But overall it's an excellent app and definitely worth the purchase price.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|its amazing and you should get it buy it just do it........... i love the detail  fast shipping easy to set the time
0062101897|5.0|Given as a birthday gift for a harry potter fan, and the recipient loved it. She said the book is amazing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Hard to put down.  The level of thought and detail that has gone into creating the world in these books is breathtaking.  It is very easy to find yourself consumed by the lives of the characters and land inhabit.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan from the first TV series to today.  The improved quality of the Blu Ray Discs for the movies makes them exciting and new to watch again and again.
B0086700CM|4.0|I keep accidentially buying stuff from their store, so my coin level is low.<br />I was pleasantly surprised that the game hasn't bored me after a couple minutes of play. AND no annoying ads.<br />I suggest this game even if you doubt it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so much because its something u can play everywhere. my anut told me about this game and I fell in love with it
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just wanted to post that my order was fulfilled by Amazon on May 31st, 2012 and I received the 2nd generation BK2, even though they still picture the 1st gen without the pommel.

B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game. So much fun! going to continue playing it now! I ment to write this earlier but had so much fun playing it!
0345803507|5.0|I ordered the book through Amazon for my wife.  She hasn't put the book down since it arrived.  She has read about 2/3 of the book and says it is great.  The only problem is that she spends more time reading the book than communicating with me.<br /><br />I also ordered the other 2 books from the Trilogy.  My wife glanced at them and said they look like they will be as interesting as the current book.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|Follows both the European version and the book quite closely. Worth watching but not great. Slow start but the action picks up at the end. How the main characters evolve as a team is interesting.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Her voice *so* reminds me of Randy Crawford whose CD I have re-discovered after listening to Heaven.  Such talent!  I *absolutely* had to purchase Heaven after hearing \\"Teach Me How to Be Loved\\".  The other songs are superb as well.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I thin this calculator is amazing...Its large enough you will not miss your numbers. I use it everyday to calculate bills
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />Ok, ok, ok, ok!  I jumped on the band wagon.  I admit it!<br /><br />See, I wasn't going to read the series.  In fact, it sounded a bit too violent for my taste.  Plus, I don't really like becoming a bandwagon fan.<br /><br />But, I was taken on a date (he was nice, didn't go anywhere though) and we saw the movie.  So, I figured I should go ahead and read the books.  I mean, why not?  Especially when I could check The Hunger Games out for free from Amazon Prime.<br /><br />So, I did!  And, I was pretty hooked, no lie!<br /><br />So, I was right, the series is pretty dark and a bit brutal.  Many of you may be familiar with the concept, but I will write a brief recap.<br /><br />Set in the future when everything has changed, now where North America stood is the country of Panem.  The \\"life\\" of the country is in the Capitol, where the wealthy (and rather frivolous and silly) live.  And party.  They're the kind of people who don't get up before 10am.  Before noon, really, if they don't have to.  They lavish themselves in wealth, luxuries and outrageous hairstyles and clothing.<br /><br />But \\"layering\\" out from the Capitol are districts.  12 of them, to be exact though there used to be 13).  Once upon a time, approximately 74 years ago, District 13 was obliterated by the Capitol when they attempted to rebel from the leadership of the Capitol.  Now, as penance for their transgressions, each District is required to send two tributes to the annual Hunger Games.  The tributes are one male and one female between the ages of 12-18.  Once selected, the tributes must battle to the death in an arena created by the Gamemakers, until only one tribute is left standing.<br /><br />The Capitol insists on this as a form of \\"entertainment\\" but really, it is to keep the Districts in line.  Most districts are poverty stricken, and in order to receive the basic necessities at time, potential tributes can accept rations from the Capitol in exchange for having their name entered additional times in the drawing for tribute.<br /><br />This year, at the 74th annual Hunger Games, we meet Katniss Everdeen, whose younger sister Prim, must be entered into the drawing for the first time.  At the ceremony, called the Reaping, much to Katniss' dismay, Prim's name is drawn.  In a moment of shock, terror and desperation, Katniss steps forward to be the female tribute from District 12, the coal miner's district, in place of her sister.<br /><br />The book is a first-person account of Katniss Everdeen's experiences in the 74th Annual Hunger Games as she is forced to be a pawn in the Capitol's annual \\"sporting event.\\"<br /><br />Will Katniss survive against the tributes from the other districts?  Even against the so-called \\"Career tributes\\" from the districts wealthy enough to train some of their children to be tributes?  Will Katniss' family face the loss of their daughter, and how will District 12 respond if they lose Katniss?  Or will something different happen?  Unanticipated by the Gamemakers, to set the 74th annual Hunger Games apart in history?<br /><br />Read The Hunger Games to find out!<br /><br />I have to admit, seeing the movie first, then reading the book is quite a different experience for me.  I was unable to get the visions of the actors out of my mine while reading the books.  Luckily, the actress who played Katniss was fantastic!<br /><br />Honestly, first-person narration generally is not my favorite.  I much prefer third-person narration, so it took a while to get used to the style of the book.  I honestly think that the written version of Katniss was a good character but a bit dry.  The ability to supplement her character with the actress' interpretation is what really helped the character come alive for me.  She might have been a tad bit dry had I not had that supplementation.<br /><br />However, the author, Suzanne Collins, paints a great picture of a futuristic world, one where a \\"President\\" reigns in terror and absolute control over the subsidiaries, and forces them to battle to the death yearly to maintain order.  It's a terrifying notion, that seems scarily possible at times.  Like the kind of future that could exist when power runs unchecked.<br /><br />Luckily the book was a little less bloody than I had imagined, making it readable for me.  Because honestly, I can't handle lots of blood and gore.  That being said, it's still not great content for a younger audience because of the theme of young adults/children brutally murdering other young adults/children.<br /><br />Katniss is shown to be a resourceful and strong contender, but she has to face an arena that has other competitors that have trained their entire lives for their moment in the arena.<br /><br />This compelling tale is intriguing and also warns of the dangers of too much power, and how horribly a dictatorial government can cause the lives of the every day person to be.<br /><br />All in all, I say 4 out of 5 stars!igns in terror and absolute control over the subsidiaries, and forces them to battle to the death yearly to maintain order.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|The one word I would use to describe the novel Life of Pi is riveting. Yann Martel does an amazing job of intertwining literary complexity, and the beautiful tale of a young man undergoing a journey of self discovery.  We are introduced to Pi Patel who is a son of a zookeeper, and practices Hinduism, Islam and Christianity all at the same time. After a sudden decision to move to Canada from his native India, the boat transporting them and all their animals sinks in the middle of the Pacific. For the majority of the tale, Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with one Bengal Tiger, a wounded Zebra, orangutan, and hyena.<br /> Martel in this book, not only tells an amazing tale of survival and coping with the elements, but portrays, Pi's mentality throughout the process. Also the book also utilizes zoological facts to describe how this situation is actually possible to survive. Martel's writing style can be compared to that of Ondaatje, which is seemingly coincidence, seeing that they are both Canadian. It is hard to really just list out all the things that Martel seemingly intended from this book. He portrays the relationship between humans and the natural, the existence of the obscure and unreal, and the idea of coexistence. This book was really just thought provoking and a great read for anyone interested in psychology, animals, or someone just interested in a great story of one boy and one Bengal Tiger.
B0084MVEJC|5.0|This new vinyl reissue of Richard and Linda Thompson's most celebrated LP certainly lives up to the hype. Wax Cathedral, a new Universal Music Group imprint, has definitely done the album proud. Sonically sound, distinct and punchy, this pressing stands up against the original Island pressing and in some ways surpasses it. Dead quiet surfaces allow the rich textured recording to shine through. Deep resonant bass and clear distinct highs present a fully realized soundstage that is seldom heard on albums recorded after the early to mid seventies. I must admit my heart sank a bit when i saw this was released through Universal, a company with no great record when it comes to quality product. But in this case, I can attest to the high quality of this reissue.Compared with my first pressing, this new copy will take pride of place on the turntable.<br />For Thompson fans this purchase should be a no-brainer. Younger and newer listeners are in for a delight as this seminal folk rock LP unfolds on a well pressed record. Vinyl enthusiasts can buy with confidence, this record sounds as good as you hope it will. Now if only they would give Henry the Human Fly the same treatment.
B0083VDK96|5.0|So is the little hidden piece people are complaining about. I'm not sure of these people are tasteless, deaf or just nuts, but this album has wonderfully lush and crystal clear production. The clicking/popping sound adds sublime flavor to the 3rd song, and is present on other songs as well.<br /><br />Keep up the awesomeness, Miss Gardot!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book, because most of Nicholas Sparks books can tend to lead me to tears.  However, I liked the idea of its' story.<br />I decided to read this book with Kindle in one hand and tissues in the other.<br />Was I surprised in a great way! This book was a refreshing book to read!<br />The Lucky One is about a young man who had been through so much while at war.  The only thing he had to cling to<br />was a photo that he found of a girl whom he never knew or met.  While many of his comrades felt that he was unlucky to be around, this picture brought him luck.  A destined path he reluctantly takes to search for the answers to his luck and to uncover who and if the mystery girl in the photo truly exists.<br />The Lucky One left me feeling happy and wanting more.  I did not need the tissues at all! I thank you Mr. Sparks for that.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has never read Nicholas Sparks and especially to those who were reluctant like me.

0345803493|5.0|I loved these book! I love the characters. I love the sex scenes. I love the plot. It's a great read. It's not a complicated story. It doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.

I've already finished the trilogy, and I wish the author would write more Fifty Shades books so that I could revisit the characters again! I thoroughly enjoyed them! So get your nose out of the air and have a little fun!

B0068857QA|5.0|I was amazed at how real looking this was.  Some of the guys appeared sorta cartoony, but hey, it's a tv show. Must of cost a fortune to use all that equipment. Good characterizations. The personnel interactions reminded me very much of stuff that happens in a regular work environment, especially the competitiveness. The football game in the last episode rang very true..

1609613937|5.0|This one of the best books I've read and I would say a \\"must\\" have for those who want to re-gain their health and retain it. McDougall's very readable,down to earth writing is easy to follow. Dr McD has been healing his patients for over 40 years with a simple plant based starch diet.He tells you how he arrived at this way of eating and the science behind it. No gimicks , no pills ,in fact he gets you off those expensive pills as soon as safely possible. A diet of 70% starches like potatoes, brown rice, beans, grains and 30% fruits and veggies what could be simpler.What to cook? There are tons of delicious recipes included to tempt anyone's palette. Not only healthy but delish! I've been following this diet for about 2 years and I'm enjoying excellent health, and do tons of walking and riding uphills and down. I lost some excess weight about 15 lbs and feel 20 years younger then my 61 yrs. Believe me this is do-able and fun!  I've been able to help many of my students to get healthy by directing them to Dr McDougall's books and website. This book will be  tops on my list to recommend. Donna Dickson

B006VP1OYO|5.0|This 2 cd set collects all the My Bloody Valentine EP's into one place.<br />Probably the most logical release in a long time from anyone- the original ep's can be quite expensive, for awhile \\"You Made Me Realize\\" was selling for over $50.<br />The music is outstanding and while the sound quality isn't much better than the Ep's, it really doesn't have to be.<br />You don't want them to remaster the sound so bad that they mess up MBV's legendary noise,  we're not talking about cleaning up<br />cute acoustic music.<br />\\"Slow\\"  is my favorite MBV song.<br />I highly recommend this release !

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So glad I bought the trilogy!  These books are easy reading with a plot that can be very thought provoking.  It makes you ponder the democratic society we live in and wonder if and how a balance could be struck in a dictatorship.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I thought this book was a lot like the second book of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34;. Not nearly as good as the first, it left a HUGE cliff hanger at the end. the plot was almost the same too. The only differnce? everyhing is pre-planned. So if you,  like me, loved the huner games then you will love this series also.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins' \\"Good to Great\\" is a national best-seller based on the companies that made the transition from being just good at what they did, to being great at it. Having that said, the title is very self-explanatory. As explained in the book, Collins did not just select companies that had high stocks and were succeeding in the market. No; there was much more than that. Collins and his panel of experts and researchers had specific criterion that companies had to meet in order to be considered a good to great company. Once Collins and his team selected the few good to great companies, each was paired up with another company that never achieved greatness. These pairs allow readers to more easily see mistakes made by the comparison company as well as the positive actions done by the great company. By viewing these comparisons, readers are able clearly see what made the great companies stand above the good ones. Some of the descriptions of companies around today were quite surprising, which kept me intrigued throughout the book. However, Collins uses repetition to stress that points he is trying to make, making his stories seem a bit redundant. The redundancy is only there to help the reader to better picture each situation and the slight variations that occurred between companies.<br /><br />A few other reviews have mentioned that this book says NOTHING about how to change your company from good to great, and this is absolutely correct. For example, Collins stresses that it is essential to have the right people working for you before you decide where you want to go, but nowhere in this book does it tell you how to do this. \\"Good to Great\\" is not a bible that you can simply read that gives you 6 simple steps to a great company; that would simply be too good to be true. The companies mentioned in \\"Good to Great\\" took many years to perfect their practice, and each company had to make their own sacrifices along the bumpy road to success. By reading this book, people can gain insight to the qualities and characteristics that great companies have compared to good companies. As mentioned, there are no instructions on how to change; a company must do so on its own. The actions taken by these vary large companies can be used as a parallelism to other companies, either big or small, but results are not guaranteed. With that said, insight can be gained from this book, but it is up to the reader on how to go about using it toward \\"greatness\\". One error that I immediately saw in this book came within less than ten pages of reading the book. Some of the companies listed as good to great companies actually went under with the recession of 2008. However, being written in 2001, this data was not erroneous, but that was then. Jim Collins has another book entitled \\"How the Mighty Fall\\" which clears up the uncertainty about the so-called \\"good to great\\" companies that crashed and burned. By reading this follow up book, I was able to see that Collins had made no error; the great companies had simply slipped away from greatness. The pairing of these two books shows the rise and the fall of the mighty.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that this book was written in such a way that anyone can read this. There is no need to have a background in business; a little common sense may help here and there. I am an engineering student, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as his follow up book. This book is a must read for anyone moving into upper management and would definitely help anyone who would like to be a part of a major corporation.

0670022950|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read.  Maybe I'm impressed because Pinker claims what I've suspected for years now: the world is actually less violent, or at least much of the world.  When is the last time Germany and France considered going to war with each other?  Or with England?  These were nations that were always at war.  Who now would try to justify slavery?  Who burns cats at town festivals?  A whole town does not turn out anymore to see a person put to a painful death.  Duels?  Once common among well educated gentlemen, they are now only for losers and idiots.  The Holocaust shocked the world.  But genocide was once common and there was nothing shocking about it.  Holocaust deniers may be fools, but at least the fools you can't go around bragging about this stuff anymore.<br /><br />There are lots of charts and statisitcs to back up Pinker's ideas.  I like the charts and stats.  But if you don't, you can gloss over them and still appreciate the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is at the top of my favorites list.  It is a page turner that you just cannot put down.  I was worried about the S&M that I heard was in it but it was not at all what I expected there, however this is not a book for your  teen.  Great characters.  Great story line.

1442346949|4.0|Steve Jobs is an incredible author who has written some truly great works including the biography of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein, to name but a few. He is a man with such an intriguing story and one that I took a lot of pleasure and enjoyment from listening to. Narrated by Dylan Baker this collection of seven CD's is based on over forty interviews that include interviews with family members, friends and colleagues who all present a different angle on this unique individual. It is the story of one of the greatest and most passionate entrepreneurs, who is full of determination and drive, which has led to the creative foundations of six different industries. These are computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computers and digital publishing which have all been revolutionized by this single man of great talent and knowledge. What touched me most was how Steve Jobs encouraged everyone who spoke about him to be completely honest in their views, hence he had little input in regards to this audio book which I feel is a very brave and encouraging thing to do. He revolutionized the 21st Century to make it what we know today, by combining creativity with technology thus producing outstanding results that can be recorded within history books as single, dramatic changes of significance within time. He also built a company that merged remarkable engineering with giant leaps of imagination, which produced utterly astounding and groundbreaking outcomes. This story tells you how it is `strait from the horse's mouth' and how Job's compulsion and desire for control shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. This tale is both instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership and values all of which is most thought-provoking. This audio book told me the story of a man from the inside out which painted a vividly clear, honest and realistic picture of a most outstanding person; which opened a window into his heart for all to see. I was totally moved and found in places it to be extremely emotive and heartfelt, also very inspiring, utterly fascinating and compelling throughout. I was blown away by the amount of material there was and how widespread and extensive that each interview went into details on.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I remember seeing this film during its original reserved-seat engagement at one of the Golden-Age movie palaces on Broadway.  I thought it was a spectacular film.  I was always surprised that the film received so many mediocre reviews from snobbish film critics and was a major financial flop.<br />I watched it again on blu-ray the other night and still consider it to be a great achievement.  The actual attack scenes are quite incredible when one considers this film was made way before CGI.  (I think the attack scenes in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" are spectacular also, but one could do a lot more with that CGI today than in 1969 when this film was made.)<br />There are so many things that are great about this film including the great Jerry Goldsmith score that builds up the suspense as we get closer and closer to December 7th.  I also liked all the character actors used to portray real people in this film: E.G. Marshall, James Whitmore, Joseph Cotton, Richard Anderson, Neville Brand, etc., a terrific cast of wonderful actors.<br />I owned the film on DVD before getting the blu-ray for $9.99 from Amazon.  It is a terrific buy, the picture and sound are way better and the book included as part of the blu-ray is very nice.  Extra features include the \\"AMC Backstory\\" on the making of the film.  (I really used to enjoy watching those on AMC Saturday nights,) the History vs Hollywood episode on this film vs. the actual Pearl Harbor attack and another documentary on December 7th.  These are also all excellent.  The blu-ray features both the Hollywood cut of the film and the Japanese cut which is a little longer.  (I watched the Japanese cut.  It was nice to see some scenes that I never remembered seeing before.)<br />This film has been re-evaluated in the years following its release and it is now considered to be a much better film than it was considered when originally released.<br />I highly recommend picking up the blu-ray of this spectacular film

B004X2M3SI|2.0|I have watched Dr. Who for as long as it has been shown on tv. I have seen most episodes as many times as the local PBS would rerun them. I loved the return of new Doctors.<br /><br />Season 6 bores me. I find my mind wandering without my even noticing it. That has never happened before while watching Doctor Who.<br /><br />My husband, who has not seen season 6 yet, asked me to describe what I disliked. At first I couldn't put my finger on it, but then I burst out with this description of the Doctor as \\"OCD, with a bit of Tourette's syndrome and with a mild touch of Asperger's syndrome.\\" The hand flapping, the vacant eyes on the closeups, mumbling and bumbling and generally aimlessly running around and slamming things. I have no confidence in him. I have seen this before in other bad movies, the director instructing actors to look agitated and concerned, especially on tight shots. And could you do that again but looking over your shoulder a bit as though we are catching you off guard?<br /><br />And the reason probably is that the poorly written scripts don't give the actors enough to work with. The story lines are poorly constructed on flimsy rehashed common themes. The \\"Rebel Flesh\\" has an echo of just about every bad science fiction movie I have seen, or is it bad westerns? Good guys, bad guys. Then everyone gets confused who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Someone dies that is good. Someone bad becomes good. There are secrets about the characters that are hinted at, but not revealed. Hmm. Did anyone see Clint Eastwood in any scenes?<br /><br />Certain scenes from previous season's episodes stay with me for a long time and come to mind as great moments. The scene from \\"New Earth\\" as Doctor Who sits in front of the Face of Boe is one of those. There's not much action here, very little dialog and the whole rush of plot slows down at this point like someone hit the pause button. Why is this scene so endearing to fans? I have a feeling that the director stoodback on this one and let David Tennant work his way through it by himself with just a hint of instruction. The Doctor is his usual confident self, but allows the role to take him to a place of uncertainty and amazement. We feel as though WE are sitting right there with him looking into the Face of Boe.<br /><br />In the \\"Rebel Flesh\\", there is an attempt to make Rory seem deeply compassionate about the plight of the \\"gangers.\\" But it almost feels like the director instructed him to look like a clerk at QwikFill who has been asked to count out the change to the customer, \\"say what?\\" He ends up hugging people a lot and alternatively running around in dangerous hallways by himself (why is he doing this?). At the end, I had no interest in which Doctor was the real one and I could not tell you how this was revealed to us. With all the mumbled dialog, I got lost.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, I'll watch all of it. I wouldn't miss an episode. But I think they should retire this show. There is very little magic anymore.

B005HEED7U|3.0|Despite what the title says, this is not the remastered version of \\"Obsession.\\"  For some reason, both Amazon and Netflix do not show the remastered version of this episode.

B005LAIH3G|3.0|A common thread among those with negative reviews seems to be that they never read Princess of Mars nor probably any of the other Barsoom series from Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Some claim to have read them...but I doubt it.  If they had, they would have enjoyed how closely this adaptation followed the story.  I enjoyed the film.  Was it as good as the book; no.  What film ever is?  But, it had humor, action and even a surprise ending.  The special effects were very well done, the story was straight forward and if there was any negative it was casting Taylor Kitsch as the lead.  As he showed in Battleship...acting is a struggle for him.<br /><br />However, if you watch this with an open mind and ignore the critics, I would say that the vast majority of people will enjoy this movie.  But please, do not go in and expect too much or you will be disappointed.
B0024Y7H10|3.0|I turned the show off half way through the pilot the first time around.  There were a lot of little things that annoyed me, and I just thought the ridiculousness would continue.  After hearing good things about the show and how pissed some people were about it being canceled I decided to give it a second shot.  This time I watched the whole pilot, and I believe it's good enough to continue on but there are still a decent amount of minor annoyances in this episode:<br />-not realistic clip size...no body reloads<br />-the male terminator opens up his leg to take out a gun which I assume is from the future (because it's in his leg)...but it's a standard pistol from 1999<br />-male terminator turns to the class saying 'class dismissed'...he's a terminator.  He wouldn't make a funny quip he would just continue chasing John<br />-female terminator has more humanity and personality than expected (although we don't know her past so she/it could have been taught to act that way)<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong.  I'm not a person that has to have everything be realistic, but there is only so much ridiculousness I can take before I give up on the show.  If the show is a character driven show I'm much more likely to forgive minor things (like Firefly and Lost).  But at this point I'm just not sure if this show will rely too much on it's mediocre unrealistic story or if there will be quality character driven moments.<br /><br />I'll let you know when I make my decision.<br /><br />Update**<br />Episode 5 of this season seems to be the turning point.  This episodes was very well done, and it was the first time the audience got some back story via flashbacks and learned a little more about the characters.  For the remainder of the season it continues in this vain, and becomes a pretty decent show.  I hope it's now found its footing and continues in this way for season 2.  For now I would upgrade to a 4 star rating.

B0024Y9GZ0|3.0|This isn't really a review...it's just me complaining so here I go.    I hate it when TV shows/movies use the old staples of \\"we only use 10% of our brain\\" and \\"why is the sky blue\\".  We use more than 10% of our brain.  That has been proven and is just a false statement ([...]).  As for the sky being blue, the explanation is called Rayleigh Scatter or small particle scatter.  Small particles in the atmosphere scatter light, and these small particles are more likely to scatter radiation of shorter wavelengths such as blues and violets.  The eye picks us the scattering and sees the sky as blue.    As for the show itself...it's getting better than the pilot but not by much.  Still seems like some missed potential.

0307594165|4.0|I have frequently heard Toni Morrison's new novel, Home, described as her most \\"accessible\\" work yet, and as someone who has read bits and pieces of several of Ms. Morrison's novels without up to now completing one of them, I have to agree with that assessment.  Granted, Home, is hardly more than novella length and it can be finished in one sitting or two, but its theme and underlying message are still pure Toni Morrison.  This one just might serve as the gateway novel that creates a number of new, previously reluctant, Toni Morrison fans.<br /><br />Home is largely Frank Money's story.  Frank, a veteran of the recently ended Korean War, cannot face going home to his family.  His two best friends from back home are dead, and Frank feels too much guilt about being the only one of the three to have survived ever to look their grieving mothers in the eyes.  That guilt, topped off by misgivings about something he did in Korea, have turned Frank into a drunkard largely dependent upon the kindness of strangers for his survival.  Frank Money is a bitter man, one growing ever more bitter because he knows that the country he risked his life for, and for which so many black men died, is every bit as racist as it was the day he left for Korea.<br /><br />As children, Frank and his sister, Cee, could not wait to leave their sleepy little Georgia town for what they were certain would be better lives than the ones they would leave behind.  Both did leave that little town - and both barely survived the results.  Frank was scarred by war; the inexperienced Cee, by the disastrous marriage she jumped into in order to fashion her own escape.  When, desperate to save her life, Frank decides to bring his sister back to the old hometown, the healing will begin for both of them.<br /><br />For the most part, Morrison uses first person narration to tell Frank's story, and although the book's chapters alternate between narrators, Frank's is the point-of-view most often heard from.  Particularly interesting, is the way that Morrison occasionally allows Frank to step out of character long enough to address the book's author and readers directly, reminding us that this is a mature man telling a story that happened long ago.  He even corrects some of what the author wrote in earlier chapters - admitting that he purposely mislead her about certain events from his past.  In this manner, the truth of Frank's story is revealed layer-by-layer, until the reader has a clear sense of who he is and how he got to be the way he is.arly interesting, is the way that Morrison occasionally allows Frank to step out of character long enough to address the book's author and readers directly, reminding us that this is a mature man telling a story that happened long ago.

I try and try but usually get 1/3 to 1/2 way through if I am persistent before relinquishing to my complete boredom. I sat without tv, without food except when my husband insisted, entranced to the pages of this book.  Not for some smutty reason I've heard mentioned in the news or by others, but because the emotions, the struggle, the excitement is palatable with each turn of the page.  For the first time since I can remember opening my first book I actually cared about the characters and/or did not know where the story was going.  I'm looking forward to the next in the trilogy.

B00005QENZ|3.0|Of the four albums Aerosmith recorded for the Geffen label, only \\"Done With Mirrors\\" was weaker than \\"Get a Grip.\\" Even in Tyler's biography, he notes that \\"Get a Grip\\" was being pushed into by the suits who wanted more hits, and that's what the band delivered here in triplicate. By hits, Geffen meant \\"Power Ballads,\\" and \\"Crazy,\\", Amazing\\" and \\"Crying\\" pulverized radio and MTV, driving the album into a heavy sales pattern. However, if you were wondering where the rock was, you may have been scratching your head.<br /><br />\\"Get a Grip\\" is 80's/90's AOR by committee, with only two songs not featuring outside songwriters. That also tells you that the songs all have big, impactive hooks but little stick. The ballads are drenched with strings, the boogie-rock punctuated with horns. The only unpredictable moment is when Joe Perry takes to the microphone on \\"Walk On Down,\\" serving to remind everyone why Steven Tyler is the usual lead singer. Especially when Tyler follows Perry with the playful \\"Shut Up and Dance.\\"<br /><br />Overall, \\"Get a Grip\\" is not a bad album, just an average one. The band had settled into formula for success and milked it (I always wondered if the cover wasn't a pun to that effect) for all they could. It was so slick and commercial that the band got a Grammy for \\"Living on The Edge.\\" (The second of four they've earned.) The follow-up, \\"Nine Lives,\\" is a better album.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I highly enjoy this game.  It is challanging and has a lot of levels.  The fact that it is free is fantastic!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love temple run!!! Played it on my husband's android and now its finally here for kindle fire. I believe the controls are actually better on this version than on android. Tilt is much more functional. Thanks amazon for finally bringing this awesome game to kindle fire!!
0345803493|4.0|I needed to see what made this trilogy such a success, and after reading \\"50 Shades\\", I realized that people really do enjoy a good sexually driven story.  I'm challenging E.L. James with my novel \\"THE COUGAR CLUB HOTEL\\" by Cheryl Harrison and suggest anyone who's relishing James' novels to read mine next.<br /><br />I just sent \\"50 Shades Darker\\" to my doctor friend and he's waiting for the third installment. Don't be fooled thinking it's a chic read.  Men are reading it in bed. I'm on book three now and it's getting old but I can't stop reading. It's a mindless but entertaining story so check out my novel when you finish the the trilogy. You'll find mine more believable and you'll better understand why SEX SELLS. It's about time this genre is out of the closet! This type of novel will spice up your sex life. Why not explore how other people enjoy and fantacize about sex?
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a really engrossing game.  It requires some thought but each game/puzzle should be solvable eventually.  There is no aspect of time so you can take  your time solving it and even leave it and resume later.  Look is great and quality is very good.  The only glitches I've seen is a line in the puzzle solved message which has the bottom cut off.  It operates easily although hitting the desired square on small screens is hit or miss.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|If you have problems with the truth, then stay away from this DVD.  This is the direction we're currently heading in.  Just around the corner.

B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game. havent stopped playing it. its very addicting but so much fun! i recomend this to anyone who loves games.
B007HO392S|4.0|I was super-excited to get this album. Granted, it does have some excellent material on it. The problem is, I just repeat my favorite songs over and over. Makes me wish I would've bought individual songs on Itunes instead. My favorites are:<br />1) Good Girl-just has a great beat and kind of bad-ass feel to it. Always loved those type of songs :)<br />2) Blown Away-cannot get enough of the instrumental and vocal stylings mimicking the storm blowing in. Definitely a keeper.<br />3) Two Black Cadillacs-not bad, considering I'd expect this song to be on a Miranda Lambert album instead of Carrie's. Typical Miranda-style murder plot between the wife and mistress of a man. What gets me is that with so many cheaters out there, maybe this song is a good idea? ;)<br />4) See You Again-LOVE THIS SONG! So pretty on Carrie's part and the background vocals too! Really neat for someone who has lost someone close to them-a reminder that they will see them again someday.<br />5) Forever Changed-really hits home for me since my grandmother gradually lost her mind to this horrible disease. Very touching.<br />6) Who Are You-sounds like a Christian song to me. I like to think of this as my love song to my Lord and Savior. Carrie's soaring vocals are incredible here!<br /><br />Not gonna say much about the rest of the songs-heard them before. She tries too hard to be like Kenny Chesney in \\"One Way Ticket\\". If it ain't broke, don't fix it Carrie. Stick to what you know. \\"Leave Love Alone\\" shouldn't even be a song because there's practically no lyrics! So annoying-I like songs with a little more substance. These are fillers if you ask me. The ones I listed are the truly great ones in my opinion, which makes me wish I'd bought these songs on ITunes instead of the entire album.
B0086700CM|5.0|i friggin waited so long and im so excited now! after all these cheap knockoffs i finally get the real one!!!!! holy shitake mushrooms! im so excited!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG!  I love this game.  It is challenging and fun.  None of the levels are the same and you always have to keep changing your tactics.  It's AMAZING!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is one of my most favorite games .but dour am trying to reach my highest. score of all tyke.
0345803485|2.0|I had really high expectations for this book but it was a little much for me.  The author liked to use words over and over again like sardonic.  I think it was used multiple times per chapter.  I don't understand how this book has made it up the charts, I read a lot and this is one I would not recommend to anyone.
0061438294|5.0|Very revealing, entertaining, easy to read and understand. The photos are an added visual instruction which helped me very, very much in understanding the written information.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|The very point of young adult literature is to give the few young individuals with an interest in reading, a world to immerse themselves in, and a character or two to root for, who will hopefully teach them a thing or two about the world they live in, and hopefully, about themselves. Such a character should be a role model for these young people. In 2012, we are left with no more \\"Harry Potter\\" films to be made. The \\"Twilight\\" series, which has albeit made a great deal of money, doesn't quite cut it for those of us who expect something more from our moviegoing experience.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" has it all: a wonderful slew of characters, an unfamiliar and interesting world, real problems to overcome, not to mention a star-making performance by Jennifer Lawrence. One major problem that I find in the \\"Twilight\\" series lies in the lack of role models for young women reading them. Bella Swan is an idiot. She relies on men for every single thing she does, and doesn't change and become her own person over the course of the four books, ultimately becoming the epitome of anti-feminism, in this viewer's eyes.<br /><br />Having said that, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is something of a godsend. Katniss Everdeen is headstrong, brutal, resourceful, witty, uncannily smart and a truly original personality. She knows when to back down, yet she knows when to take charge. She is an ideal role model for young people who will undoubtedly approach the film.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" takes place in the post-apocalyptic region of Panem, divided into twelve \\"districts\\". Once a year, an Olympics-style event takes place where one young man and woman from each of the twelve districts is forced to take part in a fight to the death on national television, where only one contestant can survive. A member of working-class District 12, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) takes her young sister's place after she has somehow been chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss has essentially raised her sister, with a mother who has been useless ever since the father's death. She learns to put her knowledge to good use, becomes something of a badass in her quest to above all else, stay alive.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, is a revelation. She clearly knew the character she was playing. While her performance is strong and ever-commanding, the character of Katniss was never permitted to let her true emotions show, and Lawrence obviously understood that. She couldn't have been better. Josh Hutcherson does a good enough job as Peeta, the other contestant from District 12, who becomes a good friend to Katniss; and possibly a love interest? We'll let the next film in the trilogy tackle that.<br /><br />The film has a tremendous supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, the often-inebriated mentor to Katniss and Peeta, \\"30 Rock\\"`s Elizabeth Banks as the loud and flamboyant Effie, Donald Sutherland as the country's president, and the always-great Stanley Tucci, as Caesar.<br /><br />My only gripe lies with director Gary Ross, who has previously directed \\"Seabiscuit\\" and \\"Pleasantville\\". His shaky camerawork works in scenes where we're seeing events from a character's perspective, especially when the \\"games\\", themselves, begin. However, shaky handheld camerawork is present, even in scenes where only two characters are having a conversation. Why? It's distracting, and should have been done differently.<br /><br />However, Ross did a well enough job interpreting this novel, which I believe many other directors could have screwed up. He made a sensitive, yet not-for-the-faint-of-heart film out of a novel that felt exactly the same way. Like the \\"Twilight\\" series, there is a love story in \\"The Hunger Games\\", but it's not the most important thing going on. The film could stand as simply an adaptation of a novel, or could be interpreted as social commentary, with obvious hints being made about the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the grim picture it paints of our society could one day become. Yet it's quality entertainment that even the least discerning filmgoer can appreciate. Bring on \\"Catching Fire\\".<br /><br />Grade: A
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Please dont waste your money in this movie, its boring and bad actors, they should burn the negative in this one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Very fun -- couldn't stop until I beat every level with 3 stars... the new levels they added for free after I purchased the app was a nice plus too. Get this game!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was a great sequel to the original book and movie, which was quite good.  Enjoyed both and now reading the third book.

B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book of her. The director filmed this movie's picture beautifully. The film score is also very beautiful and enjoyable. All actors were playing the roles very well, especially Keira Knightly who starred Elizabeth Bennet.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so much fun I love it every one in my family loves it and plays it!!!!'you will love it!!!!I highly regimens u get this app!!!!Works great on kindle fires 2!!!!!!
B0081TZUAW|3.0|While this may not win over any new fans, it's certainly an excellent addition to their pretty solid catalog.<br /><br />The tracks on here are rough around the edges and loud, with a couple of mellower tunes, Sugar, Beloved Freak and the title track, all of which are great.  Control, I Hate Love and Battle are going to be staples in your Garbage playlist.  Given the production style and no sign of any single here, they definitely made this for the fans, which is admirable and makes for a more out there kind of album, which suits Garbage perfectly.  The only reason I can't give it the four stars, and I really want to, is because, unfortunately, they destroy their secret weapon, Ms. Manson's voice, with way too many distorted sound effects.  After a few listens though, you get past that and just rock out with them.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I have played it on friends ipods and when it finaly came out on the kindle I was so happy. keep up the great work.

B004021H60|2.0|We love Crocs and have owned numerous pairs throughout the family.  My daughter really wanted new pink crocs and these looked so cute.  Beware though, after one day of wearing them she had two blisters on the sides of her feet from where the straps come together.  I have tried to stretch them; however, cannot seem to make it work.  The size seems true to size so that does not seem to be the problem.  Luckily we have a different type as a spare.  Hope it works out better next time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is awesome  because  it is very addicting!It the best game ever that I have gotten because it never ends like some games do!
0061091480|5.0|This is the best self-help book ever in my opinion.  It is rare to find self-help books that comprehensively describe the psychological principles behind many popular techniques such as positive thinking, positive self-image, auto-suggestion, and so on.  If you are like me, you cannot understand why we have to repeatedly tell ourselves that \\"I like myself\\" as it is suggested by books from Brian Tracy.  Brian teaches many practical techniques, but he doesn't tell us where these techniques come from and why they are important.  So, I think it may be not useful somehow.  But Dr. Dyer does things in the different ways.  In stead of quickly jump into the techniques, he provides us clearly and easy to understand underlying psychological principles such as the definition of self-worth and why it is important when it comes to self-image and self-esteem.  By doing this way, you will understand why and how the popular technique like \\"Auto-suggestion\\" works.  It is not just the work of mouth and mind but the work of thinking instead---definitely, it begins in your brain.<br /><br />Read this book first, then \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" and \\"Psycho-Cybernetics\\" respectively.  Maybe this is the best thing you ever do in your life.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The characters are college aged.  I loved the chemistry between them and the \\"good girl, bad boy\\" combination.  It didn't take long for me to read because I could barely put it down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good time passer that u can use for a long time with a great variety of games but they should remove the ads
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a blast once you get used to the controls you will start averaging in the millions on each run very good on my galaxy tab but I would reset your device before you play it will run flawlessly.

B005IZNM0W|5.0|My son loves Cars and race cars in general. He loves lining them up and racing them down the hallway. Not all toys are meant to be educational. Sometimes they just need to be fun and interesting which will prompt their imagination and lead to questions and curiosity. :o)
0670022411|1.0|This is all Twilight - the only similarity to Harry Potter is that it's written for a very young (i.e. immature) audience.<br /><br />The first 3 chapters are good but it's literally all downhill from there.  Less than halfway through I was flipping through pages trying to find where it gets interesting again.  It doesn't, and I realize now that I wasted $10 on a book I'll never finish.<br /><br />Here's a brief synopsis to save you the time of reading this garbage: the heroine is sooooo unique and special and everyone admires her sooooo much but she has to be constantly rescued by the old-fashioned, masculine (i.e. sexist) vampire who implausibly falls in love with her in less than a week.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, it's every young adult vampire novel every written.  You can get  identical versions free at your local library.

0470876417|4.0|Consider a business model to be an engine. One that generates opportunity - wealth for investors, freedom for entrepreneurs, jobs for employees, value for customers. Like all machines, this can be broken down into its component parts and recombined to achieve different ends. Speed off the line. Social good. Enterprise software.<br /><br />That's what this book is about. Understanding what processes make up your (prospective) business, then bundling them together in a way that is most efficient. In that sense, it's a lot of Biz 101 packaged in a visually interesting way. (Parts do feel like someone got carried away with design. For example, a wall of text cut into the shape of a circle is just goofy.)<br /><br />It's also where the business canvas concept originated. (This went on to be a big part of the Lean Startup community.)<br /><br />At the most basic level, you fill in the blanks with how you're going to build out your company. It's a structured hypothesis. Sit down, think it through in these terms, then blow it up on the wall with everyone's help.<br /><br />I kind of wish the book ended here. But it goes on.<br /><br />There's a spattering of business model patterns, which is old hat if you've paid attention for the last decade. (Also, their conceptualization of an open business model is oddly closed.) Then there's a section on how to think like a designer. Maybe I haven't spent enough time with big companies, but this isn't exactly revolutionary stuff. Brainstorm, draw, solve problems, hypothesize stories/scenarios/products, test. (This section is not in order. You bounce around in a most jarring way.) They define strategy as \\"environmental scanning.\\" That's smart. Then they gets lost in the weeds trying to shoehorn a lot into the canvas. There's some pretty ridiculous looking canvas's near the end of the book.<br /><br />And that's kind of the core problem. There's a ton of stuff covered, but tethering it to the canvas feels forced. There's no holistic framework here despite their (well intentioned) effort to treat the canvas like one. It's a useful tool and I'm glad to have it. Just planning on not getting super carried away with it.mework here despite their (well intentioned) effort to treat the canvas like one.

0345803507|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books in the series, but this one is by far the worst.  I would recommend stopping after the first two, and without giving too much away, if you do read this book DO NOT read the epilogue.<br /><br />What was an intense sexual thriller turned into a blah book that I had to force myself to finish.<br /><br />All in all the series was great, but this book left me wishing I would have stopped reading sooner.
0439023513|1.0|While I thoroughly adored the first book, and moderately enjoyed the second, I found Mockingjay to be utterly disappointing. I just couldn't stop wondering how the initial story filled with adventure, friendships, relationships, politics, and more had dissolved into this heap of nothingness. Like most people I noticed early on the major flaws featured in book three, but I forced myself to read on because I thought there was a possibility that the story was going to get better. But boy was I wrong. I felt as if Collins, before writing Mockingjay, had gathered and dumped all of the issues that were necessary to tackle in the book into a colander of sorts and used whatever remained after the sifting to write the novel while she simply allowed other vital pieces to slither out the holes and make their way down the drain. I was really upset by:<br />1.The lack of detail<br />Why doesn't Collins tell us what's happening in the surrounding districts? The rebellion seems to spread extremely fast while we are, (and perhaps Katniss is too) kept in the dark. I hated the fact that we were only given tiny glances of the rebellion, and even those were cloudy. I also felt really annoyed at the fact that I couldn't really place a face to the newly introduced characters. Could she really not bear to include some information about the people besides the color of their hair or the tattoos on the body? Could she not find the time to describe district thirteen in greater detail? I still have no idea how you would enter into the living compartments of district thirteen if you aren't a cat.<br />2.Katniss's attitude about life<br />Katniss in the first book was a heroine. In the second she was slightly less of a courageous person but the way that the story unfurled played to her advantage. After reading the third book I personally wanted to shoot Katniss with one of her extra special designer arrows. Katniss is depressed, drugged, or distant for most of the book. And why, oh why does shenever do anything for like two hundred pages? Why doesn't she take the initiative to make stuff happen instead of reluctantly complying with another oppressive government's orders? Why on earth did she never attack any of the problems head on? Why doesn't she ever think about the relationships that she has the potential to be in? I kept waiting for her to figure out who she wanted to be with, to experience that moment of certainty, but it never happened. Even as the book was nearing its end and only fifty or so pages remained I expected her to pick up a conversation with one of the men in her life and confront those issues, but the issue was never addressed until the epilogue which was far less satisfying.<br />3.Untrustworthy information<br />The way the story was presented in the third book made the environment in which the action took place seem unreal. We are left out of most of the major events because Katniss seems to lose consciousness every time something important is about to happen, and most of the stuff that we do witness seems very sketchy. Why doesn't President Snow just kill her while she's visiting her old home in the Victor's Village? We are given information all along that he has connections and can easily see and hear about what she's doing, so why doesn't he just get it over with right then and there? Also, why would anyone think it would be appropriate to go hunting all the time while there's a war raging in neighboring districts and the capitol? In the first book we were given that hunting was the way Katniss was able to support her family. In the second, she hunts to supposedly support Gale's family, (Don't know why she doesn't just insist on buying them food despite Gale's stuborness??)and because it was also a hobby for her. But in the third book it seems a little ridiculous. Why didn't Collins make Katniss do something that would be beneficial to protecting the welfare of the districts instead? To me, it would have made the story more believable.<br />4.The abandonment of relationships held up in previous chapters<br />I really thought we would see more interaction with Katniss's family, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, and the tenants of District 13. I felt like Suzanne focused too much on voicing Katniss's inner feelings of hatred, disgust, confusion, and doubt while she could have been promoting a sense of unity among the districts. In the first two books she managed to do this, so why did she abandon ship at the end of the trilogy? Almost every character in this book lost their personality or drive, and it really bored me as a reader. Where was the dialogue that was so prominent in the beginning of the trilogy? I get it, war is bad, it makes everyone that's involved with it change. But I didn't expect this gloomy result from a fictional novel that was part of a series hell bent on entertaining and teaching its audience.<br /><br />I wish this book had gone in a different direction. But since I can't change what she wrote, or the fact that I read it, it will probably haunt me until I can find a good book that will cover up this disappointment.

Yes, church history, especially if it was a required course in the 1950-1960s.

B0086700CM|5.0|Im so happy temple run is now on the kindle fire.I just got it today and ive played it 190 games I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for so long! This game is so addicting. I would recommend for everybody to play this game!!!
B003XKAZKO|4.0|Poor Johnny Marr had the misfortune of dealing with an immature Morrissey during his tenure with The Smiths. Imagine how many more masterpieces could a have arisen with the more mature Morrissey before his Bona Drag period. Nothing against Steven Street mind you. He penned some great songs in Bona Drag. Its just when listening to The Smiths material and the Bona Drag release, it makes you wish that Morrisey had been a little more restrained in his lyrics during The Smith years. Bona Drag was The Smiths Album I had been waiting for and the remastered release was well worth the wait.
0938045768|5.0|Great book, I received no.2 yesterday, and had to get this one for overnight delivery . I recommend this book for  anyone whomwants knowledge on bodyweight exercises. I was stationed in the Army a couple years ago., was in excellent shape. As time went on,and the stress of life hit me.i stopped working out. Not eating right and etc. got skinny. I soon seen this book on amazon, and always wanted to gt it but the price was a little too steep, I finally got the money together for it. Trust it was truly a blessing..came right on time and the delivery process was awesome. Get this book. I'm back to being in shape once I start the book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Been playing for years..never get tired of it! Love the challenge and relaxation in one game. Happy to have it on my Kindle.
B0031SU2Y2|5.0|This is another excellent and moving film from Philippe Lioret (&#34;Mademoiselle&#34; 2000). Just when you think the world is lacking in compassion for our fellow human beings (even in the Arts), along comes one of those rare films to change your mind. &#34;Welcome&#34; (from 2009), is about the plight of a group of immigrants (in this case Kurds from northern Iraq) that were left in a kind of no man's land in Calais, France (the shortest route across the channel to England), and who were desperate to make the crossing. As there are already some excellent reviews describing this thought-provoking film, I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight for all the xenophobes of the world!<br /><br />Immigration whether you like it or not, is a side effect of the impoverishment of most of the inhabitants of this planet by the actions of the very wealthy (U.S., EU, Japan, and to a lesser degree even Russia and China are in on it). With their so-called---&#34;free trade&#34; and &#34;foreign aid&#34;---which are actually conditional loans appropriated by the IMF and World Bank, where the private-lender banks get back tenfold on their investment: i.e.---through predatory-like high interest loans (where &#34;austerity&#34; measures are then put in place---i.e. Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, etc., minerals and raw materials, slave-labor, etc., etc. And is an assured way of propping-up their sponsored regimes/governments too. The Global Powers (U.S. and Co.) are then able to dictate domestic/foreign policy in the borrower nation. The borrower nation then becomes a recipient (customer) of the MIC, and the various multinational-corps. (So where does the money really end-up, follow the money-trail.) In 1968, Al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, were &#34;sponsored&#34; and put in power with the full backing of the Oil Cartel (known in those days; as the &#34;Seven Sisters&#34;), and with the full backing and support of the CIA, and the Nixon administration the following year. So was Quadaffi for that matter (he was sponsored by Armand Hammer's: Occidental Petroleum---that received a generous oil concession from Lybia and Col. Quadaffi as a result). Why would the &#34;bastion of freedom&#34; (U.S.) lend its support to dictators and terrorists? Read your history books carefully folks!! There is no such thing as illegal immigration (this is by design). Most of these poor people are made to emigrate from their homelands by the forces of capital (the ruling elite in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, who support the entrenched oligarchs of the Third World). This is done to supply the West with a slave-labor force, thus driving down wages here in the U.S. and in Europe. They then use this as a political tool (the government loves the fact that Americans are some of the most bigoted and uneducated people in the world), for people like our drone down there (negative reviewer), who has no concept of reality. When are people in the U.S. going to learn and understand what really goes on in this world. The U.S. and every other rich nation for that matter, do not give money away ever. For free, are you nuts!! I've travelled to so many places and am completely shocked by how much more they know about the state of affairs of the world compared to people here. Have some compassion for crying out loud! Ask yourself, how and why did my ancestors come here? A: same reason, for a better way of life (of course, this is no longer the case). Remember, these people did not want to leave their countries in most cases, they were forced to flee, by poverty, wars, and sociopolitical instability created with the help of our own government.<br /><br /> NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 107 mins.

0312360258|5.0|If you interested in magic, vampires, friendship and romances this is your book. I readed this book in two days, very addicting. The whole house of night novel series is amazing . I would recommend this series to everyone, which i have and they also, love the books!!!!!!
B0085157B8|1.0|I'm actually in shock that anyone gave this movie a thumbs up.  It is a complete disapointment to the recent remake.  From start to finish each scene (especially the finale) is a constant good set up that just leaves you expecting more.  Time after time it is just a complete let down.  This movie will surely go down as the movie that could have been.  You would have more fun buying a piranha puppet and going to a local pool to scare small children.  If you really must see this movie I seriously suggest waiting till it hits cable or maybe get it through netflix or other prepaid service, cause In my opinion you'll be sorry if you spend your money on it.
1592536913|5.0|Loved this book!!! I bought it originally as a gift for my inventor/sculptor brother and had to get a copy for myself. The criticism that there are no instructions is of no concern to an artist. I found every item fascinating and so many triggered inspiration for my own work. I love all things Victorian and didn't know of the new \\"Steam punk\\" term. I have used the term techno-Victorian or industrial-Victorian for 30 years. I am planning to get a third copy for my gadget inventor son who is a lover of anything technical or bizarre and has added computer programming to run just about everything in his house--by remote. He built a Tesla coil just for the fun of it. He will love the costuming as well as the steam punk lights and  inventions.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The unconditional love is spectacular. The sex is mind blowing, and the inter-dependence of the main characters is beautiful. When it ended I felt lost. I want MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I will not spoil the ending for anyone, but this trilogy comes highly recommended by ME!  Intense, thrilling and suspenseful beginning to end.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Wow.... What a great book!! I did not ever want to put it down, sadly had other things going on so I had to but would pick my Kindle back up every chance I had to read more! A great story and I loved Chris. This book made my heart ache and grabbed me from page one.<br />One of the best books I have ever read and loved the ending! Could not have been a more perfect ending to a fantastic book.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally amazon stoped being so cheap and got temple run! been waiting forever! now if they could just get some google play apps...
B003VANOFY|5.0|don't think much about it, it's a great product, excelent sound quality, no problems with the wireless, and a lot of configurations. Give it a try.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is not the kind of book wherein events leap out of the shadows to surprise you unawares.  The first two sentences inform you that there will be both robbery and murder.  These happen to the novel's narrator when he is fifteen.  Although now 66, he has remarkable recollection of how it felt to witness your parents hauled away for bank robbery and then observe your surrogate father blow away a couple of innocent people.<br /><br />Some novels are loaded with action, others are flush with feelings.  CANADA is clearly in the introspective vein, though most readers will press on with the knowledge that crucial life-altering activity lies ahead.  But, you have to listen to the narrator make his adjustments and reappraisals of life.  I have considerable tolerance of these ruminations, but some may find them tedious.<br /><br />Ford also dispenses bits of applicable philosophy from time to time through many different characters.  Often, it's some homespun observation that attempts to freeze for our inspection some element of life's chaos.  I think this is a novelist's job, though others may find it preachy.<br /><br />At this point, you may know whether or not this is your sort of novel. In recent years, I have become more judgemental about fiction- I probably give up on a third of the novels I begin. However,I never considered abandoning CANADA.  I think it is a fresh examination of an adolescent's encounter with shock, abandonment, shame, authority and adulthood.  If Richard Ford writes a sequel about this young man's further adventures as a student, teacher or retiree, I'll likely read it.  Ford has written a few stories that I have found so informative of the human condition, that he will always be an oracle to tap.<br /><br />Had I been his editor, I might have pared some of Dell's internal dialog to be replaced by another stategic event. But, what Ford chose is certainly well above the standard for current fiction.  I am certain he structured the narrative with considerable care; a prominent mantra of the novel is the Ruskin quote that \\"composition is the arrangement of unequal things.\\"  This pertains not only to prose, but to all our life's work.  Richard Ford's CANADA is a fine demonstation.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Like most feedback here, I really like the 2nd season and the new Spartacus actor really stepped out to the plate and it is doing a great job.<br /><br />The story is great, the battle scenes are even better in this season, the roman society and their way of living and how they behave are amazing to see and the SFX are even better than season 1.<br /><br />Is a great series definetely worth having the DVD/ Blu Ray collection.<br /><br />The Romans really knew how to party :-)
0061692042|4.0|I found this to be a very powerful work, a coming of age novel in which the narrator finds the course of his life becoming irrevocably shaped by the poor choices of others.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that this novel starts slowly and then picks up, but I found it compelling from the start. It is not a fast-paced or plot-driven novel by any stretch of the imagination: it is paced very deliberately. But it is amazing for its ability to create the world of an unformed 15-year old boy whose life changes forever in a very short span of time. The writing is excellent, and Ford's ability to conjure a place in time is superb.<br /><br />I did not find the novel to be without flaws, upon which I won't speak further (perfect is a difficult standard to reach in a 400+ page novel). Suffice it to say that even when I might have had my doubts, the book pulled me along and kept me reading (the use of foreshadowing is extremely well done). This was the first novel by Richard Ford that I've read, but I'll definitely seek out others.<br /><br />Perhaps Canada is not a great novel, but it's certainly a very fine one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been playing temple run since it was first available on the android. I always enjoy it and the ability to unlock more content as you go keeps it from getting too repetitive. Highly recommended!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Enjoyed this the most of the three books. Kept turning pages to.unravel more of Christian's past, and future.  Love it and have recommended it to many friends.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Thank you for sending my order in such good condition. It was a used video but it is in very good condition and a wonderful movie. I had seen it before but, didn't want to pay the price I had seen it at. When I noticed the price on Amazon,.com I knew this was an affordable item for our family. Thank you
B00422LESO|4.0|Instead of trying to recreate the atmosphere of Austen's books, an intrepid woman starts an exclusive fantasy get-away incorporating characters from Austen's-- with a bit of courtly rom-com thrown in, and featuring a Lizzie like lead.  Don't look too closely at this fluffy romcom just enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this came it so addicting and fun btw u should defenaly get this awesome app!!!!!!<br />my fakmly luvs this game and so do i
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Would be a 5star app if there weren't  so many flawed puzzles with contradictory numbers that can't. be solved.  I'm sure it would be easier to do with a stylus, I really need to get one.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has always been wanted in my opinion, and its one of the best available games and everybody should have it. (thanks to imangi studios)
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for this to come out on the kindlefire for a  while now. the kindle app store and I'm so excited that it is finally out! this is an awesome game!

0345803485|1.0|I'm not sure why so many intelligent people recommended this book.  I will begin by saying that the only intelligent thing that the \\"heroine\\" did is her last action of the novel.  Sadly, I see that she reverses that heroic action in the following novels.  As a former victim of a controlling and abusive boyfriend, I found the \\"romantic\\" relationship between the main character and her stalker/control freak/abuse victim of a boyfriend anything but sexy and romantic.  I feel that if a reader finds this book \\"hot\\" and sexy, then they clearly (and thankfully) have never been controlled or abused by someone they love.  This is not the kind of Heroine I want my daughter to look up to.  We should be encouraging young women to walk away from controlling and emotionally abusive men like Christian, not glorifying and romanticizing them.  This man meets all the qualifications of an abusive partner.  He controls her emotionally, physically, financially, and sexually.  He attempts to alienate her from her friends and family.  He stalks her when she does try to get some space, tells her when and what to eat, how to exercise, how to dress, and how to behave.  It is irresponsible to romanticize an abusive relationship like this.  Trust me, being controlled and abused is SCARY, terrifying, and NOT SEXY.  You feel alienated, scared, sad, and many times you blame yourself.  Ana feels all these things in the novel. I have no issues with the BDSM lifestyle--if that is one's cup of tea (bag out), that is fine.  However, I believe that when one enters into a consentual BDSM relationship, they know what they are getting into and enjoy that lifestyle.  Our main character states clearly several times that she does NOT enjoy it and afterward is emotionally devastated.  She reacts like a victim of domestic abuse and doesn't tell anyone what is happening, makes excuses for her abuser, blames herself, and goes back to him when he is apologetic.  It is HARD to leave an abuser--that is why so many victims suffer in silence.  It is sad that respected people and media are promoting this kind of trash.  This novel is making a physically and emotionally abusive man seem like Prince Charming.  I have friends who wish their husbands or boyfriends were like this creep.  Sadly, they don't know what they are wishing for.<br />In addition to being irresponsibly written, it is also TERRIBLY written.  Clearly the author possesses a workbook of SAT vocabulary words, but unfortunately she doesn't know how to use them.  Her phrasing is out of date. I haven't heard anyone say they paid peanuts for something since I was a small child.  She clearly has no concept that Portland, Oregon is not in Washington state.  She also must not know how technologically savvy young people are these days, let alone how sexually savvy they are.  Her main character has two little people ( the subconscious and inner goddess) who live in her head AND have their own furniture!  I suppose they have a house in there too.  STUPID!  I feel as though I got dumber as I read this book (double crap!).  The vocabulary is asinine, the inner dialogue not worthy of a college grad, and the story line a push/pull, back and forth struggle with tons of holes in the plot and meaningless characters with no follow through.  I am sorry I wasted $10 to make this EL James person wealthier and her novel more popular.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I think the worst part of the movie was the ad campaign. Every time we saw the commercial on TV we thought we would not want to sit through a couple hours of bad CGI, but we decided to go anyway. (I bet a lot of people decided not to) It was a lot better than we hoped and although there is a lot of CGI the effects were worked in to the story so they were much different than we imagined. They did over do the jumping bits but what they heck. To those who say it is a financial flop...When they stopped giving box office reports it was at $269 million and the DVD has not come out yet.<br /><br />I plan to buy the DVD when it is available.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy, if you haven't started reading it yet staet now because these three page turning books will  change your life forever.
0312641893|4.0|In this futuristic, science fictional Cinderella retelling, Cinder is a cyborg, part human and part machine. When we first meet her, she is removing her mechanical foot in order to put on a new replacement part. She is a mechanic whose income supports her stepmother and stepsisters. And she meets the prince.<br /><br />I've been in a reading slump, but then I picked Cinder up and couldn't put it down, started and finished in one day. Cinder is a vibrant character. Iko is darling. The stepsisters and stepmother are a little one-dimensional, as is the Lunar Queen, but there are other interesting characters that make up for that. The writing is lovely and I found the whole thing enthralling. Highly recommended!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game was well executed. Was a perfect way to idle away free time. Much unlike hidden object games by other developers, this game scatters pieces of objects which must be found in order to add the object to your inventory. The game also employed puzzles and other strategic elements into game play. Well worth the .99.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great way to stay up with the Hunger Games trilogy. Fast read and very entertaining. Can't wait for ther next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Can't wait for more Wool....it is totally engrossing and I love the Hugh Howey backstory, it is really heartening to hear about a writer making it just on the virtue of his work, without running the gauntlet of the publishing world.
B005HSL626|3.0|The only hard thing is trying to get the blades. Most of them are easy but the one I really want is too hard. It is a challenge of course but...if your not in to sliceing fruit,  this is not for you. Great for all ages.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Toy Story is my all time favorite kids movie. I remember watching the first one years ago, and now I watch the first, second and third, with my son. He is four and he loves watching, wearing or playing with anything Toy Story! The story lines in all 3 keep his interest the entire time and he really understands what is going on throughout the movie. I love that we can both watch it together and neither of us get bored with what is going on. We both love it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|listening to hype leads to reading bad books.  never have written a review but it was such a let down.  too much sex, no substance.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is such an addicting game i love it! its also very challenging to dont mind my spelling doing this fast. so people u need to get this game
1781161313|5.0|I'm pretty sure the other reviews are excellent in the description of this books content. For myself I've always wanted to pick this up but usually you could never find it below $70. I was fortunate enough to get a AEV colonial marine kit sometime ago and looking for any reference material on the various uscm equipment was kinda a pain. This book truly provides all the reference material I needed to complete and detail the kit. Now I have a OUTSTANDING colonial marine for my display case!<br /><br />I haven't read it yet (I've read some small parts) but the book is chock full of great uscm insights, and story. I'm looking forward to reading it from front to back!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a very fun game that once you start playing you cant stop.  I like it and it is not that hard to play
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game is so intuitive. It allows the User to really think hard about the connections that need to be made in order to advance in levels. The puzzles are challenging enough to stump you and give you time to work them out.<br /><br />My only suggestion, and this goes for both games, would be to make it longer and possibly add to the end story some more.  OR make it in different parts to extend the time players have to use the app.<br /><br />GREAT GAME!!!!!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I thought this movie was absolutely adorable.<br />I laughed throughout the entire movie while watching it with my four year old.<br />It's definitely a movie that is fun for the entire family!

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Light weight case. Easy to don/doff. Basic, which is what i was looking for. The fold over lip that transforms into a stand is a little fussy, but that is to be expected from any case that is this light weight and frill free. I am happy with my purchase and would do it again if I needed another one.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love temple run, no doubt about it but i upgrade evrything, maybe play other games, browse the web,.. but when i play it again, it erases everything ive accomplished,.. stats upgrades objectives,.. everything,!!,.. this is the only game this happens with so its not my tablet :/,..

1451627289|5.0|[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]] Stephen King; I was four years old in 1963, so I don't really remember any kind of national trauma ... but I do remember my mother sitting with me as I looked at the pictures collected in a commemorative book that they had. It was a big thin maroon-colored book, and I remember being just a little frightened by the pictures and the book.<br /><br />Stephen King taps into that bit of history perfectly in this novel. It may be his finest work to date. He could stop now and go down as one of the finest authors of this (or any) generation. But of course, he won't ... or he can't ...<br /><br />I didn't 'read' this novel; I purchased it as part of an audible subscription, but I'm quite certain I will have to find a paper copy at some point. The book was narrated by Craig Wasson, who was terrific (and who sounded a bit choked up himself at the ending ... an ending he must have read over several times before narrating it for the recording).<br /><br />I haven't read every one of King's stories, and didn't like some of those that I did read. This story, however, must enter near the top of the list of my favorites. The 'easter eggs' (references to previous stories which he almost always includes) were terrific and provide reasons to reread.<br /><br />Ok I'm done. I was moved, I was entertained, I was thrilled ... read it!
B0086700CM|5.0|good. it is the best temple run ever in the world it is much better then ipod version that one is to small

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game get it and you will fall in love with it no lie this and crime city are great for switching when waiting
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was the hardest series of books to read that I have ever read. I wanted to quit at about 15% on my kindle. I don't like doms and don't like subs.....both make me angry. However, friends had read it and most said get through the first two books and then you will see the story and enjoy the last book. I went back to it determined to SEE the story and I did. The end of the book, the last book was great.....or maybe I was simply relieved that Christain finally let up and got over some of his issues.<br />I am glad I read it. Glad I finally made it through the first book. And I think I am most glad that I read all the way through so I could see the story and see it end. Not light reading. I am not one that needs sex in a book for it to be a good read. I read these three in spite of the overwhelming sex.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Out of all the games, i cant decide which is best. They all are fun. I love all these games.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the best majonggame I have downloaded to my kindle. It is not too easy and not too hard so I don't bored or frustrated.

B004EPZ034|3.0|My son loves Alvin and the Chipmunks and has watched the other two movies, from start to finish, multiple times.<br /><br />I thought this movie was cute, however it did not seem to keep his attention at all like the previous two did.<br /><br />I am not sure why, but he was just very (unusually) uninterested in this Chipmunk adventure.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome. nothing else to say it is amazing I have waiting for it to come out on kindle app store
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Even if Trespassing dosen't become the biggest selling album of the year (although it debuted #1 on the billboard hot 200), it well be one of if not the best pop album of the year. It's so current and fresh, yet borrows sounds from the past, from 80's house music, MJ, prince e.t.c. Trespassing is a combination of Pop,Dance, Funk, Rock. The thing with Adam Lambert, even if your not a massive fan, you cant deny his vocal talent is really impressive. He's almost too good for pop music, in a sense of most top 40 pop music is blatantly without individuality. Trespassing manages to blatantly target top 40 yet Adam still maintains his unique individuality. If katy perry and lady gaga can excell in pop music, theirs no reason lambert can't. And to be honest if their was a critisim with Lambert and Trespassing, is this album is too good for top 40 radio.

140053271X|1.0|Be warned!! If you purchase books from Barnes and Noble, you must have a valid credit card on file any time you want to access the material that you have already paid for, and downloaded. The Digital Rights Management software that B&N uses requires a credit card to validate your ownership of the book. This may sound like no big deal, but when your credit card expires in the middle of a book, you will not have access to the book until you renew your credit card. This is because the Nook requires you to download the book repeatedly, every few days, to make sure you still own the book. It is not enough to pay for the book and to download it once, you need to download it again and again. Essentially, they are revoking your access to a book you have already paid for. They may as well sneak back into your house and steal the book off of your bookshelf.<br /><br />It is not clear to me why this is B&N policy. When you buy something from Apple you do not need to constantly re-download it, and you do not need to prove your ownership by providing a new credit card for an old purchase. Amazon does not do this either. When I spoke with Barnes and Noble about this they said they get plenty of complaints, but that is their policy and it is just too bad.<br /><br />I would recommend avoiding the nook, because you won't have access to content you already paid for.

B004EPZ0AC|2.0|I watched this movie with three children (ages 3, 4 and 6) and none of them seemed to stay interested in the first or second Happy Feet movie.<br />I thought it was a cute movie but perhaps it is better for older children?

B0058YPL66|5.0|I don't know why Hollywood is even bothering with their Snow White movies, I haven't seen the Kristen Stewart one but I do know Once Upon a Time is superior to Mirror Mirror. The casting in this show is smarter and simply perfect. Regina Mills as the Evil Queen should just be handed an Emmy for instance, she oozes evil and Julia Roberts has nothing on her in the role.<br />  While the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin is easily the best person to play Snow White, she looks the part and just like in the new movies, she doesn't need rescuing and is tough. But I rather stay at home and see her twist on Snow White than rush to the movies to see....Kristen Stewart as Snow White for instance. Robert Carlyle is bit of a show stealer though as Rumple Stilskan \\"if I'm spelling it right\\", he nails the part even if he is a little over the top with the laugh he does. The rest of the casting is just as good but what really makes this show a keeper is the writing even if you may have a hard time not thinking of Lost due to the flashbacks from current time, to fairytale times.
B00324AS3K|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist is about a man called a Pakistani man named Changez. The author talks about Changez's life in both the United States and Lahore, Pakistan. The story is about Changez and how he deals with life in the United States both before and after the event of 9/11. The story takes a huge turning point when the towers fall because that day also signified the downfall of his own life. Due to his Pakistani and Muslim status, he was heavily discriminated against. Changez then fell into the trap of depression. His prior glamorous life was now in pieces. His job at an extremely respectable firm, Underwood Samson, was in danger. Erica, the girl he loved also fell into depression and ended up committing suicide.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because it gave me a very different view of the whole incident and America in general. This book presented the event of 9/11 from someone who was totally innocent yet was still being discriminated against. Another very special thing about this book is that it is all a monologue. Everything is told from Changez's point of view, allowing readers to focus more on him and his experiences.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|Do not write this off as a typical heavy metal album...it's much more than that. The music and vocals a throwback to some metal greats yet has a style all it's own. There is quite a bit of mystery that comes along with this group. None of the members names are listed and in a strange way, that seems to add to the effectivness of the haunting sound. Each song is solid and conjures images of something one might find on the set of The Devil's Rain.<br /><br />I highly suggest picking this one up. It's very addicting.<br /><br />- Charlie Morgan<br />Best-Selling Author of \\"Sticks and Stones\\"
B00313PLIO|4.0|Persepolis was originally a comic by Marijane Satrapi, an Iranian cartoonist. The comic was later made into an animation. The movie portrayed the main character, Marji, and her experiences in Iran beginning as a child. It focused mostly on her growth as a person and how she became exposed to different things through politics, life experiences, and religion. The greatest religion aspect in this animation was when there were changes in power in the government. One leader would demand citizens of Iran wear veils while another would try to banish it. Events such as these caused a lot of confusion in Marji's mind, especially during her childhood. However, Marji's family was far less conservative than many other families in Iran. Therefore, they often broke many of the rules set by the religious leaders of that time. For example, they would often have parties even though they were illegal. Also, Marji, her mother, and her grandma never wore veils at home because their views were more open and liberal. Veils were a method to distinguish your religious view but it was also a way for men to look down upon women. There was a scene in the animation when a woman who knew Marji's family came over. She entered the house without wearing a veil but once she saw Marji's dad, she immediately put it on. Due to the fact that Marji's family possesses more liberal views, he told her there was no need to put on the veil. Satrapi's view on religion is very different from others as can be seen in the way she indirectly criticizes it in the film.<br /><br />This movie was very interesting because it gave me a new point of view in religion. I have a never been a religious person but I always thought that for people who were religious, religion was a good thing. However, after watching Persepolis and being exposed to Satrapi's outlook on religion, it occurred to me that in a lot of ways, religion was being abused by followers. People were doing things in God's name and taking his words far tooliterally. Also, as was evident in the animation, people often blindly followed religion. They did things because there were leaders who told them to do so and threatened them if they didn't follow their rules. There was a scene in the animation where Marji's grandpa needed to get a visa granted by the chancellor of the hospital. When Marji's grandma approached him, she recognized him as her previous window cleaner. She later realized that he was put in charge of this hospital because he claimed to be a devout Muslim. As can be seen in this scene, Satrapi criticizes the way people of Iran follow religion.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is this ultimate pack for the Aliens series which will catch you up on everything that has happened in the story getting you ready for the prequel coming out on the 8th.  Packaging is decent and comes with everything you want to know like how the movies were made and special commentary from the director of each movie.  The quality on blu-ray is excellent in my opinion especially given the fact that it was made a couple decades ago.  This is a must buy if you love sci-fi movies trust me.

0345529057|2.0|To be fair, I will start off by saying that the over-all story is fantastic! If this story had been written by anyone other than Martin or obviously Paolini, than it would and should be proclaimed an instant classic! However, unfortunately G.R.R.Martin was the story's author, and therein resides my displeasure. Frustration, boredom, and annoyance are some very real emotions for anyone attempting to read this series. I quite literally lost my love of reading for a while, and I've been reading 1 to 2 books a week since college over a decade ago.<br /><br />My biggest struggle with this series is the pacing in which the storyline unfolds. Imagine an exponential curve, initially there is an almost imperceptible rise in the curve for a long time, then it starts to slowly rise, and then all of the sudden the curve is skyrocketing off the charts. EVERY chapter starts extremely slow, like an exponential curve, without picking up almost the entire chapter. Often times the last third or quarter of each chapter you finally start getting back into the storyline when he'll drop the storyline, IN MID-CLIMAX, to start a new chapter on some other character's part of the story. I can't tell you how many times an intense scene gets cut off in mid-climax, never to be described! At best, you are be able to piece it together from later conversations between characters... Imagine that you're reading right up to a major clash in the storyline, protagonist vs antagonist, good vs evil, all hell's going to break loose, and you turn the page to find that you are starting a new chapter were the next twenty pages are going to be dull menutia. I call it \\"reader's blue balls\\"! Seriously, I read for education and enjoyment, not to be teased along.<br />I read the first three and a half books, and decided that I couldn't do this to myself anymore. It was just cruel! I gave the series two stars for having a great over-all story, but sad-to-say I didn't feel the story was good enough to justify my trudging the rest of the way through.
0385512058|5.0|Wow! A book that speaks straight to my soul. Family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, customers, industry leaders, celebrities....the list goes on and on; make, keep, nurture and work your relationships, even building them one at a time....even if there is nothing in it for you...because that brief introduction or conversation today could end up changing your life or their life in the future. Be visible, have breakfast, lunch and dinner meetings with anyone you can, be interested in them, connect them to new people, keep in regular contact with them and watch your sphere of influence grow! Ferrazzi tells you how he did it and how you can put it in motion in your life too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written, engaging plot, wonderful characterization.  the movie is fun and exciting, but there is just so much more depth to the books that the movie just cannot bring to front.  Glad I bought them
B00785P2QC|3.0|game itself is pretty entertaining but I agree with the other reviews that you can't progress very far without buying credits. I'm going at it without buying any and in one day I'm at a standstill.... seems I can't get any farther in it building wise right now and I'm refusing to pay to play it. if you don't mind that than this game will be great for you, but not me.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun and adicting game. you wont be able to put it down! its got action and challenges its overall very fun. I don't play games very often but I like this one!
0061969656|2.0|I must admit that by 100 pages I was awash in names and places that seemed almost the same. The plot for me never really seemed to get going; the characters always seemed to be sitting around and plotting and making my head spin. Plus the anti-Christian undertone was a turn off. If you want to read good Cornwell, stick to the Sharpe series.
3836532441|5.0|A lovely book. One certainly gets a spectrum of artistic styles and skills, some of which are just wonderful. The pin up is a uniquely American art form, and doesn't recieve the appreciation it deserves

B005LAIGN2|2.0|If you have watched \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" already, you will be disappointed with Red Tails.  It covers the same period and group of men in history but in a typical Hollywood treatment of historical fact like they did with \\"Pearl Harbor\\". A great war movie has been turned into a love story and soppy emotional display of 1970s social worker style approach to counselling officers in the military during combat. In this new version the most important and insightful part of the story was left completely out. The facts of how these intelligent men overcame their own prejudices in basic training while in Tuskegee, Alabama, were left completely out of this version of the movie and that was the part of the storie which held the rest of the wartime accomplishments  up as belienvable attitudes.<br /><br />The true facts of the accomplishements performed by these real live heroic African/Americans exceed any  imaginary heroic enhancements Hollywood could manufacture to improve their characters. The truth of this story is totally disclosed in the first movie and left nothing unsaid about all difficulties encountered as young men worked twice as hard to get into flight training and even harder to finish it. It is a story of all they went through to achieve their own personal goals of becoming pilots.<br /><br />This factually based storie follows the same perspective used by the director of Pearl Harbor. Why does H'Wood have to ruin a perfectly good historical script by turning it into a love story? They treated this factual account of brave men overcoming fears of prejudice and bigotry back home while facing death in the skys over Europe as if was a Saturday matinee.<br /><br />Save you money and buy some popcorn at the video store and rent both movies.  Then make your choice.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When the movie came out, I didn't want to see it because I assumed the story was another teen-focused vampire story.  But I took a risk and tried out the first volume of this trilogy - and then, couldn't get enough!  These are characters you will care about, provocative insights into a post-apocalyptic world, and some \\"warnings\\" about the future of our society.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Oh dear me where do I start?<br /><br />I have no idea how I got through reading this drivel. It was like eating food that was left outside the fridge far too long. You hate the food but since you already made it, you figure you have to go through with it and keep eating. I think I officially became stupider by reading this.<br />Did they have to repeat the stupid book title every single page?<br />Did they have to talk about the inner goddess ( hey ana, she's a moron, stop listening to her...)<br /><br />So this is the dreamboat we should aspire to? Let's review shall we?<br />A manipulative control freak who uses sex as a weapon<br />Needy, jealous and violent<br />A real sadist who liked to see pain but then regrets it later<br /><br />As far as Ana goes ( who let's face it is just Bella ....)<br />A registered nympho<br />A complete narcissist ( How many times can she mention how many times people think she is beautiful and interesting? pfft)<br />Selfish and , despite using big words every three hundred pages or so seems to have an IQ of a fourteen year old girl<br /><br />Let's not even go into the other characters, they aren't really relevant and completely disposable.  I love how they make christian be into charity by spending millions of dollars on himself.  Why would people want to read this in today's economic times?<br /><br />This is not romantic. This is a a toxic , abusive relationship with a man who has been a victim of abuse and incest and clearly gets off controlling another human being. Please ladies do not romantiize this book or relationship. This gives into a huge myth ( going all the way back to beauty and the beast) that somehow , someone's love can change a person. Unlike what the book says \\" You always hurt the ones you love\\"... I am telling you that it doesn't have to be this way! Love is supposed to make you happy not give you more pain! I don't care how beautiful he is, or how rich .....<br /><br />There is no plot to this book, don't even try to find one. Save yourself the high price tag here's the gist of the books :<br /><br />Christian Grey- he is so beautiful and grey<br />Sex<br />Pain<br />Anger<br />Weird stalkers<br />Sex<br />Pain<br />Anger<br />Christian Grey- he is so beautiful<br />Ana you are so beautiful and sexy!<br />Random baby at the end named Blip<br />Money, sex, anger, pain, sort of redemption<br />Coma, accident, coma. Pain.<br /><br />There, I summed it up. Now go use the money I save you to solve the world's economic problems.en try to find one.

I'm so glad I did. This book is so good I can barely put it down. It's very erotic but not smutty or trashy. I'm in my 40's and I recommend it for people 23yrs and older. I do recommend who ever wants to read this book to be open minded and not think this book is nothing but trash like I said this book is very erotic. I can't wait to be done with this one to go on to the second which I'm almost done.
B007EJ6S92|5.0|I have to admit, I was a bit cynical at first. Having just listened to another CD that I had high expectations for, and being dissapointed by that, I was left with a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth. Thankfully Moonspell's new album turned that around. This is just great, if you like Moonspell be sure to pick it up. If you like metal, or rock, I would say pick it up too. I like both Alpha Noir and Omega White-Both CDs are good, and none of it feels like filler. Dont hesitate, just pick it up and prepare to be blown away. This is going to be a new favorite, I can tell.

0312370849|2.0|The story of Sarah & her family is very sad & really interesting. Unfortunately, the story is told to us via Julia who is insipid, intrusive & self indulgent. All of her barging into people's lives without invitation  to distract her from disappointments in her own life just left a bad taste in my mouth. She takes a tragedy & makes it about herself seemingly without consideration for the people these horrifying events actually affected. The conversation that ends the book just summed up her lack of character & regard for others, while the parts of the book focused on her read like a lifetime movie with an over-privileged \\"heroine\\" with no sense of boundaries or regard for those around her.
1563898586|4.0|The best part of this fantastic work, in my view, is the dialogue.  Truly, this might be Moore's greatest effort at creating believable interactions between characters.

B005LAIH2W|1.0|Before everyone has a heartattack, I do know that this book? comic? whatever. Was written before Star Wars and Lucus might have stold some of the ideas. That is why this should have never been made into a movie. Everything has been stolen by someone eles. It make the movie look very unorginal. I'm one of the few that saw this at the movie. It was the movie that would never end. There were so many false endings, that I stopped caring about the characters and just sat there thinking about what I was going to do after the movie. The characters were so bad. The guy from \\"fridays night lights\\" and Megan Fox's older ugly sister had zero chemistry. He had more chemistry with the alien girl then her. I like cliffhangers, but when I saw that ending...I wanted to punch the wall. It was one of the worst endings I have seen in awhile. I did learn that even on Mars...guys still fall for the girls with implants.
B0086700CM|5.0|Well done.  One more run will be what you tell yourself until about 3 AM. One more is never enough.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Each time I hear that a new Madonna album is about to be released, I wonder if she can, once again, deliver a collection of quality material that is contemporary, but also universal in its appeal, and is stamped with the unmistakable sound of \\"Madonna music\\". Well, \\"MDNA\\" lives up to those qualifications and has the added virtue of being incredibly eclectic. In fact, the album's cover, displaying a sort of eccentric beauty, is a pretty accurate metaphor for the album's content.<br /><br />Fortunately, the tracks tend to fall into loose groupings, which makes a reviewer's job a little easier. The first track, \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", begins as the album \\"Like A Prayer\\" ends, with the Catholic Act of Contrition prayer. I would call this track mainstream electro-pop, and it bears a message of liberation from restraint, in spite of the prayer indicating repentance. (I guess she is asking forgiveness in advance for future sins.) \\"Gang Bang\\" is electro-pop with a dark, vengeful edge, and a dark, menacing vocal to match. I've never heard Madonna sing that way before, and I like it! In \\"I'm Addicted\\" the arrangement of the electro-pop elements is part of the dramatic build-up as Madonna sings \\"...feels like a drug and I can't get enough and it fits like a glove..\\" and reaches the climactic line, \\"I'm addicted to your love\\".<br /><br />The next track brings us into sunny retro pop territory. \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" is the kind of joyful up-tempo track that Madonna has always done so well, like \\"Holiday\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Cherish\\", and \\"Vogue\\". \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\" was designed to be a single. I didn't like it too much at first because I considered it just a \\"cheerleader theme\\" commercial for her Superbowl appearance, but now I think it stands on its own as a pretty good pop song. I like the remix on the bonus disc better than the original. \\"Some Girls\\" is very odd, hard to classify. Many of the lyrics are chanted as if by cheerleaders which in my world links it to the previous track.<br /><br />Next up is a group of excellent tracks characterized by strong, driving beats. \\"I Don't Give A\\" has a sort of \\"talking\\" vocal in the verses and an interesting backup choir, particularly at the end of the song. It also features a rap by Nicki Minaj. \\"I'm A Sinner\\" has some strange religious references (\\"St. Sebastian, don't you cry/Let those poisoned arrows fly.\\"), and at the end Madonna sings in a very high-pitched voice, not in her usual range, another nice vocal surprise. \\"Love Spent\\" is a very melodious plea for love, with lots of hard, insistent drumming.  Then, in contrast, there is a pair of ballads. \\"Masterpiece\\" is a very pretty mid-tempo ballad with bittersweet romantic lyrics, backed by strings and acoustic guitar. \\"Falling Free\\" is  definitely one of Madonna's most experimental tracks. It is a delicate ballad with introspective lyrics. The light, meandering melody and the instrumental sounds make me think of the ballads of medieval troubadors.<br /><br />The tracks on the bonus disc vary widely. \\"Beautiful Killer\\" is truly killer, like catchy early 80's pop. I wish it would get radio play. \\"B-Day Song\\" is silliness just for fun, but it really is happy and funny, and for some reason it makes me think of the recurring SNL sketch where 4 cast members would stand together and one of them would sing \\"I don't care what your momma says, Christmas time is near\\". \\"Best Friend\\" has a sound that reminds me of a very prevalent early 2000's pop/hip-hop sound. Not my favorite type of music but as an oddity on this album it comes across as interesting.<br /><br />I haven't yet mentioned \\"Superstar\\" and \\"I F****d Up\\", because they are my least favorites. \\"Superstar\\" is OK as light pop music but the lyrics are pretty trite. \\"I F****d Up\\" was maybe a good idea that was given a bad execution. Musically it is just dull.<br /><br />So, this is an album on which I actually like 15 of the 17 tracks. I would say that is a pretty good score. In 28 years of being a fan of Madonna, I have rarely listened to one of her albums without feeling happy afterwards, and that's saying something.an of Madonna, I have rarely listened to one of her albums without feeling happy afterwards, and that's saying something.

B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo mail is the epitome of why &quot;app&quot; rhymes with &quot;crap&quot; - because its craptastic! I could complain about the ads or the force closes or the bugginess in general... but what I'm most incensed over - and least willing to accept! - is an email woo that does not reliably display all of my emails. This morning I was scrolling back trying to find an email from 2 days ago in my inbox. Not only was it not displaying, it only showed 3 emails for that day! If I searched for the email it showed in the search results but not in the inbox. And now, this evening, it displays around 20 emails for the day in question (a lot better than 3!) but still not the email I had been looking for. There are certain issues with an app that are frustrating, to be sure, but when you can't trust that the emails showing up in your inbox are ALL of your messages? When emails disappear, and then reappear, at random? So beyond acceptable! Yahoo mail is the vernacular craptacular of the app world. And evidently we get to watch its slow and painful death...
B0073PPNE8|3.0|The first half of this movie was uneventful in terms of moving the storyline. While I think Nicole Kidman is a good actress and Jude Law is handsome to look at, not much was going on in the movie. The second half of it got considerably better, right around the time that Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwegger's character) showed up. I think Ruby really stole the show, the movie became a great deal more interesting and relatable with her in it. Renee Zellwegger won the best supporting actress academy award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes and I think it was well-deserved.<br /><br />Other than that, there were so many ways they could have made a Civil War movie more entertaining.
0525478817|5.0|Such a well written novel. Intelligent, humorous and at times tragic. It was the first novel I have read within a 24 hours period for atleast 10 years. John Green pulls you into the story so much that when it's over you really don't know what to do with yourself.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written, fun to read and hard to put down, superb action, awesome concept. One of the best books I have read this year.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The game is sort if like sudoku but not really. You end up making pictures by filling in blocks according to a puzzle. It is quite easy to pick up.<br />The only problem is the images start to repeat after awhile. But there are plenty more levels I haven't gotten to yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this game other place and I love that it came out on the kindle fire definately five stars!!!!!!!
0670023329|5.0|Remarkable and insightful, a great way to \\"get the word out\\" about what really goes on inside one of the most notorious \\"rogue\\" regimes ever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The full screen and the easy % calculation makes check splitting a breeze.... 20+20+18%. No multiplying and going back. Best Fire calculator app!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While the first book in the trilogy was \\"eye-opening\\" and the content was somewhat disturbing, I believe the true intent of the author was realized in books two and three. Overall the set was entertaining and a quick read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has very cool features great for on the go reading! I reccomend this app to everyone with  busy schedules...:))
B0086700CM|5.0|as soon as I got my kindle fire I right away looked up temple run and was disappointed to find it not here. I love this game a lot because its great!!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This puzzle game is beautifully designed and relaxing. It is not a stressful game; it is a relaxing game. It is worth the dollar. There are lots of levels and I had no problem with the game whatsoever.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Collins writes like a nine year old.  However, the plot intrigued me, but Collins disappointed me again with her anticlimactic conclusion.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game! it FINALY came out on Kindle fire! sooooooo addicting! love it! I play for hours on end with no boredom
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game! ive been jealous of my friends playing this game on their iphones and now I can play it on my kindle! its so addicting and I would totally recommend it:)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting get it if you don't get it then you are stupid and you are a loser
B007EC27QM|5.0|Easy to use and as simple wait gets. The view is of course huge on a Kindle-highly recommended. Haven't found a better one ever.
0345803493|5.0|Enjoyed this book even more than the first.  I also ordered from Amazon.com.  The story is very interesting and not difficult to read.  I am looking forward the reading the third book
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a source of many good games for long hours of enjoyments. Though some games are simple and beaten easily many are great.
0345803493|5.0|It is the best trilogy I have ever read.  Now all my friends are reading it.  We all say the same thing.  We want more!  More Christan Gray.
0470876417|3.0|I've become addicted to reading in Kindle.  I'd love to see a kindle version of this book!  Otherwise, this seems like a very practical book which can make a significant difference in my business.
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book, but it's better than I thought it might be. While a story containing BSDM isn't something that would normally appeal to me, there's much more to this book than that aspect, just as there's more to it than simply 'sex scenes' as some have implied. Christian obviously has some issues from an implied abusive upbringing, which have caused him to shut down emotionally when it comes to relationships (heck, I know men who had a great upbringing who do that!). Add to that his introduction to BSDM by an older woman at 15, and it's not hard to see why he's the way he is. The fact that he's wealthy at 27 also isn't a stretch when you consider how many millionaires there are today in their 20s and 30s. Ana is a naive 21 year old (having been one myself, that's not as far-fetched as other reviewers may think); she wants to have more of a normal, romantic relationship, which again isn't surprising. What's surprising is how well-written the story is and how well it flows throughout. This is NOT just a book about BSDM and sex; there's much more to it that that; that aspect is only part of the whole story, though an integral part. I only questioned that Ana mentions how good looking Christian is a lot, and if her attraction was more to his looks in the beginning, and what would have happened if he was as intense as he is but not as good looking; would she have still gotten involved with him then, before she found out more of who he is? I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the other two in the series.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am really enjoying playing this puzzle/mind game. It reminds me of sudoku but I find it more interesting. I hope for more levels to be available in the future. Highly recommended! (Kindle fire version)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love it on my fire.  it is easy to change locations when you are traveling!  easy to use. I wish it didn't shut down when my fire is dormant.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Season one was oustanding- an exceptionally inventive modernization of the Sherlock franchise, with terrific scripts, acting, production values and dimensionality to the two main characters. Season two matches those standards in every respect and manages to add even deeper dimension to the characters of Holmes and Watson, which effectively pulls viewers further into this truly compelling series. And for those who haven't yet seen Season One, this isn't your typical series with just 30 or 60-minute episodes. Each episode is a full-length 90 minute movie. My only minor (perhaps selfish) complaint is that there aren't more episodes each season, because this is one truly addictive and stellar accomplishment for TV production.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun! But I mean y do the monkeys look.so weird? It creeps me out! Lol not the point it is a fabulous game! Just get u know u wanna! :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has gone from a nice-to-have app to indispensable for me to handle general note taking, lists, bookmarks, everything! Every upgrade had new useful features.
B005LAIHQ8|4.0|Saw it in a theater. Great unbelievable sci-fi comedy. Not as good or unique as the 1st - maybe a bit better than the 2nd - but I enjoyed it.
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Step into 14 century England,to a fictitious town in a real world. A time of war and plague. This is a great follow up to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".<br />Once again Follett has centered his book around the town of Kingsbridge and it's engaging characters where strong women and men of integrity are the foils used to offset political intrigue at both Court and in the Church.<br />A compelling read, highly recommended.
B0064W639K|5.0|A great re-imagining origin story of the early days of the Batman! A definite \\"Must Read\\" if you're a fan of Dark Knight! It's also a great place to start if you're not too familiar with the story and would like to start!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game... i play it everyday and im like addicted to it!&lt;3333333 i recomend this game to everybody because it is a game anyone can play young or old; its just that enjoyable!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I really like this app, but need to be able to turn off hi-def to save battery because it drains it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Relaxing read.  The story moves seamlessly between past and present. The imagery enables the reader to actually see the story unfold in their mind's eye.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this story.  I hated to stop reading.  The story centered around a frightened, orphaned Irish child, taken as an indentured servant by the owner of the ship after her family dies during a perilous crossing.  The traumatized child is sent to the Kitchen House to work for Belle, the illegitimate daughter of the Captain.  The Captain's wife is addicted to Laudanum and barely is aware of her own children, a son and daughter.  The child becomes part of the slave family but is always different.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Simply phenomenal!  The score of the original London score was largely brilliant, but the re-imaged production improves the book dramatically.  The staging is amazing and cast excellent.  Now, let THIS version come to Broadway!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Got this from Amazon about 7 weeks ago.<br />I have it overclocked to 3.92 MHZ on an MSI board.<br /><br />Tried clocking it to 4.18 MHZ but it BSODs after about 30 minutes with the stock cooler which is a nice one.<br />At 3.92 the chip is extremely stable with the stock fan.<br /><br />Running Microsoft FSX with a moderate bunch of add-ons and see framerates of 29 to 45 on average (overall smooth play in fullscreen.)<br />FSX is known to eat AMD cpus for lunch on a regular basis, yet this one does quite well.<br /><br />I'd recommend this processor for cpu intensive applications and gaming.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This movie is a fun, old-fashioned, roller-coaster ride that you can watch more than once.  The leading man, leading lady, and teenage boy were all like-able characters and I enjoyed the romantic chemistry between the leading man and leading lady, even if he actually did not claim \\"first dibs.\\" ;-)<br /><br />There were some campy over-the-top action sequences that would normally leave our heroes with shattered vertebra but it all fit in with the type of classic film genre that this movie represented.<br /><br />The visual effects quality in this film were light and were more TV grade than theatrical film grade but, I'm glad the producers kept the cost of production under control so that this film could by profitable and it looks like, in the world wide box office, it was very profitable.<br /><br />I also liked how this film had no profanity or gratuitous sex and violence.  This is a very family friendly film that can entertain the kids and their parents.
B000002Q7Y|4.0|By this time the band was moving away from their prog rock greatness. However this is a great  rock/pop effort with several great songs on it. \\"all I wanted' is a wonderful ballad hit song. (imo) Power\\" rocks solidly. And there are other good songs on here. This has most of the band back in the fold here. And that's a good thing. This is a much more accessible release than the one that came next. If you like pop rock and rock this is worth your money. It's not the classic kansas though and some people may be turned off by that, but it's a successful pop rock cd and that's what you get here.
0060974176|5.0|Product in good condition as seller described. It was delivered promptly. Great price. I like this book, but few years ago somebody borrow it and didn't returned. Probably they like it too. Now I have it back. Thank you.
B0086700CM|1.0|I like this app but it gets boring. I had it on my phone and kindle and I deleted itnfrom both.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For a free download it is a pretty fun play and the wide variety of games however simple keep it interesting for boredom game time.
0307730697|5.0|Ok, I am only 53% done with this book after buying yesterday according to my Kindle. I came on here to see if what I was feeling was normal, I wanted to see how other people felt. First of all I am a slow reader; It takes me about 2months to read a book. But I just can'nt put this one down. I bought this book because I attended the same High school as Adam but didnt know him. I can honestly say that I want to be a better person after reading half of this book. This is a feel-good book that will leave you teary eyed and inspired. It is amazing what he has overcome; as I have addicts in my family and have seen first hand what it can do. The forgivness in this book is amazing! The Friends, Family, Teamates, and his brother all stood beside him even though he did them wrong. His brother acts the same way I do which I though was strange. If he can forgive I can to. Anyways I will give a final review after I am done; I just felt inspired to give a 1/2 review!<br /><br />Ok, I am done reading this book! I can honestly say that a book has changed my life. This book is so well done, the story of Adams life is amazing. The book sucks you in after the first chapter. And leaves you chearing for Adam and his family. I want to thank the Browns for alowing us into Adams life and not sugar coating anything. This book has and will change lives. thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|temple is a fun but focusing game. you have to focus on every corner that comes up next. if you like games that you have a lot of detail this is your game.
0307891372|4.0|The format is a little sketchy, and the index is a joke. I purchased the guide to find all of the little things I missed during my first two playthroughs. It is very detailed, and the game is truely immense, so to say they covered it well is a big compliment. It is frustrating trying to find smaller details when you are not sure where somthing is located is a daunting task. All in all it is well worth what I spent on it and it is a very valuable tool for exploration.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I love it I cant go with out one day playing this game I love It so much this is pretty much the only game I play I just love it :)
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book \\"American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\\". It was really was more of a soap opera about his early life and not so much about his sniping abilities. The title is very misleading and really not what the book was about. mostly trials and tribulations about his like and drug problems and comparing his training as a SEAL to his wife's child delivery at the hospital, really????<br /><br />I do not recommend this book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun because it isnt just 1 game u get to play u play a whole bunch of different games. i wish there was more apps like it in the store
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game not really sure of what to expect.<br />Now i'm addicted to it HELP! I hate monkeys!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and it is soo addicting I waont stop playing until the middle of the night and I over sleep.
0547258305|5.0|The characters are well developed and the plot grabs you right from the beggining.  It is a wonderful fantasy world that you can get caught up in.  Love it!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great twist on the tower defense genre! Just beat all fifty levels of the game! Boss level rewards are huge, and well worth it. Now I get to start over at level one with all the extras I've earned!
B005QUQP76|1.0|Purchased this and the K90 together.  I'm returning both.  I liked the feel, construction, and features offered by this mouse but it didn't work.  Windows would not recognize the mouse as being plugged in.  You can't install drivers without the mouse being recognized by Windows.  My recommendation is to stay away from Corsair peripherals until they get their stuff together.  (Keyboard had a bad light and the software was not the least bit user friendly.)
B007SGM084|5.0|I would definitely recommend buying the trilogy over each book separately. I jumped on the bandwagon with this series and was glad I did.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game everyone get it its free!!!!it should be worth 10 dollars!!!!!get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its finally out for the kindle and I play it 2 hours every day
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me of super mario brothers that I played when I was younger my daughter both have a blast playing it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Highly recommended. Lots of fun!  Reminds me of the old Mario game. My daughter loves this game as well! It will keep you entertained while out on the go. We play on our Kindle fire,  and the picture quality is spectacular!  Music is cute as well.
0810988232|5.0|While focused on relationships, it allows for a variety of interpretation on a wide range of topics. I also have Brian Froud's original oracle set; however, I feel that these cards have more meaning to me personally.  I read the book several times and even made a few sketches of my favorite cards allowing me to develop a personal understanding of each card.  Not only do I use this personally everyday but I have also provided in depth readings for friends and family.  I highly recommend this oracle set to anyone interested in faeries or tarot or just learning more about themselves through practice.

0805091742|2.0|I know this book got lots of good reviews on Amazon and it was recommended by some coworkers but I didn't enjoy it. The main point - checklists can save time and prevent errors. In business we call the checklists \\"Best Practices.\\" The book was 200+ pages and could have been about 30 because it was mostly stories of people, companies or industries using checklists. In addition to having too many stories and too little substance there was so much clich&eacute; filler about people - \\"He was fifty-one, pilot-trim, in slacks and an open collar oxford shirt - more like an engineering professor than a company man.\\" I'm so tired of that writing style. It was fine when I first read it in Malcolm Gladwell's books but now it's as if all writers are using the same script. My only take away was checklists are helpful and I'm glad I've been using them for years.
B00000IL26|5.0|This recording is a must have for anyone who loves Jazz or who wants to learn more about Jazz. As some of the other reviewers note, Lee Morgan is not a household name, like Miles, Dizzy, Duke or Louis Armstrong. However, his contributions to the genre of Hard Bop have earned him a place among the 'second tier' of Jazz immortality. His trumpet playing is brash, confident, intelligent, creative and full of fire. His sidemen are perfect, especially the great saxophone player Joe Henderson, who was also not necessarily a household name but an all-time great player. Every tune on this recording is outstanding. The CD that offers the alternate takes represent a treat as well. You can not go wrong and will not be disappointed with  'The Sidewinder.'
0345803485|5.0|This book is great.  It is hard to find a stopping point to stop reading.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It kinda like watching a very exciting movie and just can't look to see what is going to happen next but you look through your fingers. I'm waiting to receive my second book.  Can't wait to get the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have always wanted this game on my kindle since my Ipod got destroyed by water so its about time they got it for kindles :-)
0345522303|5.0|I've been waiting for this book ever since the author announced she was writing it a few years back.  I'm delighted to say that it was well worth the wait.  Casket of Souls is hands down the best Nightrunner book since Stalking Darkness, the second of the series, with the same sort of interlocking plots, elegantly vicious villain, and suspenseful action that made the earlier book so good.  Add in an emotional depth and richness to the characters and situations that speaks not only to their growth over the previous five books, but to Flewelling's growth as a writer, and the result is not only a great read for fans of the series, but a fine fantasy novel in its own right.  Highly recommended.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I find this add really fun, and easy to use!<br />I can edit picture, add things to them, and even draw on them
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|someone said the gravity suit was a copy from jetpack joyride. the thing is jetpack joyride was made in late 2011 and this game was on miniclip.com(go to website its fun) on in mid 2008 so jetpack joyride copied this game.

B000GRUMPU|1.0|The 1972 disaster classic `The Poseidon Adventure' is a beloved film and one that is still considered one of the best of its breed.  It is raw and earthy and stunning to watch.  It never grows tired, it remains deep and challenging in parts and it rises above the restraints of the genre with a slew of deeply settled performances that are rooted in actual character progression.<br /><br />This 2006 remake has some nice CGI.<br /><br />Sadly, that is all that exists here.  There was no need for this other than to show off some great special effects, and it does that to a degree (I found the waves in A Perfect Storm much grander, to be honest).  The problem here is that there is no depth of story, and the script is so preposterous that it leaves you completely baffled at the fact that this was green lit at all.  The performances are mere surface, with no heart or soul (and you need that if you are going to root for anyone here).  Richard Dreyfuss is especially repulsive here; just hard to watch (and I love him more than most, as a rule).  Like another reviewer mentioned, this film is just bland.  The characters are one-dimensional and lackluster and the obstacles in everyone's way are lazy and stupid in most parts.<br /><br />Yeah, this is a stinker.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting. Best app since angry birds. Can't stop trying to beat my high score. Doesn't do well when text messages come in. it seems to freeze the game,but I love it anyway!

B0056C6XIA|1.0|Bought 7 for Groomsmen gift. Nice right? one would think.<br />I took all to a laser engraver who did a fabulous job engraving some specifics on the back side of the sheath.<br />Last weekend we were going fishing and I thought, Okay good time to use and test the gerber multitool prior to presenting to all the groomsmen.<br />While attaching a small weight on a fishing line, the small iron/metal piece that secures the pliers broke off. This piece prevents the pliers from opening past a certain width. My son-in-law looked at me with a \\"oh no! what did I just do\\" look on his face, whereas I was thinking \\"Oh no! these are the groomsmen gifts\\".<br />My son-in-law, who is in EOD, explains that he has tons of gerber tools which he uses daily and never once has he had this happen to him. He also mentioned that this particular one is Bear Grylls, probably just trying to sell the name, (which I paid $55 each via amazon and have seen as high as $130 in other places).<br />So here I am at a crossroads, should I deliver the \\"Ultimate Survival Pack with Multitool yada yada yada\\" to all groomsmen and risk of having them break at first use? or should I burn in effigy?<br />By the way, my son-in-law did mention that the knife was very sharp... great, make sure you don't slice a finger when your tool breaks on first use.<br />And the pathetic part?... my son-in-law is one of the groomsmen and he is not aware that these are groomsmen gifts. Ouch!<br /><br />J.R.[[ASIN:B0056C6XIA Gerber 31-001047 Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Pack with Multitool, Flashlight, and Fire Starter]]
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is fun, my only gripe is that the power ups like the revive is so freaking hard to activate I end up die just from to turn it on. that needs to be fixed. I jab at it like crazy and it doesn't activate.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great. always want to play. wish I had more energy from the game. play and you'll be sucked in. I just wish more people could play because they would really enjoy themselves by learning what the Oregon trail was like.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much that I would do anything to play it. whomever wants to get it you should
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game thankyou so much amazon for putting this game on the kindle! we need instagram now!!!!! thankyou sooooo much!
B0077POH8M|4.0|I installed this on an ASUS M4A88T-M LE motherboard with an AMD 1090T processor in a hec Black HTPC case (7K09BBA30FNRX).<br /><br />This is a fantastic cooler. However, it's difficult to install. I would have gladly paid an additional $10 for one that was specific to an AM3 socket mount, but this will have to do.<br /><br />Compared to the stock cooler that came with my AMD 1090T (Phenom II 3.2 GHz 6-core processor) at idle my CPU temp dropped a full 10° Celsius (18° F) and at full load it dropped 14° C (25° F). Plus it is a heck of a lot quieter.<br /><br />This cooler was worth the hassle to install.
0385737955|1.0|Interesting idea, horrible storytelling.  Plain and simple.  Took forever to actually read, because I had to force myself to pick it up.  I can't believe it's a trilogy..I will not be reading any of these further.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and I cried at times.  All movies about animals always seem to make me cry at some point, but the ending was all I could have hoped for. A great movie, if you like movies about<br />horses.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|This movie has been added to my favorite movie list.  It's hard to explain other than when reading some of the other reviews I suddenly realized that I wasn't alone especially the fact that I couldn't make heads or tails of this movie (a lovely surprise)  I read one review on the DVD  and person gave two stars.  I just had to defend this movie. This is one of the best movies of all times especially for this day!  How one women brought joy and laugher can I say life to all those that she came in contact with.  I was enthralled, excited, exuberant, mesmerized and all of the other compliments already mentioned.  If you have never been on a roller coaster watch this and enjoy the ride.  P.S.  All the actors is this movie put on a great performance it was amazing how this shady atmospheric little cafe came alive with life and the music /song was Europhobic.  I loved it!
0374280967|3.0|You'd think a British author would know that the Queen would never go into a bus alone without its having been checked out, even one at Buckingham Palace.  The driver could have knocked her down, closed the door and driven off before security even knew she was missing!<br /><br />And after what happened in 1936, which led to her father's early death, she would never even consider what the character did at the end.  Simply wouldn't happen.<br /><br />It's a cute concept, and well-written, but ultimately a bit too far out.
B00004T9UF|4.0|The material of the album is amazing. The CDs themselves didn't have scratches and play perfectly, the only problem I had was the way the case was treated. There was a sratch/break in the case, even though it was brand new though. Ordered one day shipping and they met my expectations with that as well.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this was a fun game it was challinging puzzles but I cant find all of the broken tiles I have the bottom tiles but I cant find the upper right tile thar is all I need I have the fish key please help.
B006K0PVXK|2.0|I question the veracity of the other review to be honest. This thing is cheap and has so many negatives I don't know where to begin. It's one of those items not worth shipping back for a refund because you'll get whacked both directions on shipping. Flimsy, Too light. Iffy quality. Misaligned. Too little headroom for a battery grip or recorder in the hot shoe on cam. Hot shoe on grip is junk.<br /><br />The 2 biggest issues are quality, which is quite cheap and flimsy, and the plastic curve. The upper shoe is angled wayyy down so that a mic or light would not be pointed at the subject but more toward their lower face or body. I suppose it would start to point up level if you were holding the grip at the top so that the weight of the camera gear would straighten it, but there in lies the rub. What good is a grip that flexes that much?<br /><br />The general hardware, foam, fit and finish are sadly what you would expect from a $20 unit. I read the great reviews on this one as well as the other clones, which all look to be the same with different branding, and was convinced this would be a bargain. Not so.<br /><br />I admit I have not tried to do any video with it yet but I don't plan on bothering due to fear. The quality of the plastic tube is so flimsy I'm sure the weight of my T3i and lens, along with recorder, would make it shake. I refuse to trust my $1000 camera set-up on this thing and in hindsight, feel like a fool that I ever thought I could. Perhaps if you have a basic, lightweight video camera, this might be a slight improvement over hand holding and allow some different angles, but for SLR use, stay away.<br /><br />Again, this is CHEAP and unless you just absolutely can't afford something better (METAL) then I suggest you look elsewhere.
B00729GQ0A|3.0|What a refreshing story so far the traditional fare in paranormal romance goes. And for once a heroine who isn't simply a damsel in distress, but who takes her fate into her own hands. Sophia offers readers a fascinating character who, quite clearly, is knowledgeable in her field of expertise. And hell, it's great to see a main character who is a witch who doesn't just click her fingers to bend reality to her will.<br /><br />Although Hamilton treats the standard tropes of shapeshifters and vampires, she does a good job establishing an alternative history. In my opinion, her milieu is a lot more interesting than its closest literary relative, which is Stephenie Meyer's Twilight universe.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed the type of dynamics they found with Bella/Edward, will most likely latch onto the Sophia/Charles dynamics, and there are some pretty scenes that are well described. One of my favourite lines from Charles is:<br />\\"You must understand: immortality is not an escape from death. It's an accumulation of loss.\\"<br /><br />All this being said, however, I do have some issues with the novel. First off, there were often moments where I'd have liked characters' motivations to be expressed better. Sometimes some pretty crazy stuff happens, and Sophia takes these occurrences almost too calmly. Pacing also needed a bit of attention. Quite a bit of time is compressed in the novel, which is often tricky to keep the narrative flowing, and there are occasions when the story flags. By contrast, in some of the scenes where a lot of action suddenly takes place, Hamilton writes too quickly, and I had to sometimes go back to reread a few paragraphs to let things sink in. A little more layering would have helped. In addition, I feel there are story arcs which are very promising (for instance the crazy religious fundamentalist lady and Sophia's best friend) which could have been elaborated on.<br /><br />Often I felt the story was headed in a particular direction, only to have that potential plot fizzle out when it could have been used to ramp up tension. Only one serious factual glitch caught my eye: the case of a photograph taken of people who supposedly died in the 1600s. Daguerreotypes were only really in common use in the mid-1800s, so unless this was a bit of supernatural tech unique to The Forever Girl universe, chances were extremely slim of such an artefact existing. I also felt the convenient availability of silver doorknobs at the local small-town hardware store to stretch reality just a wee bit for a too-convenient plot angle. But hey, maybe that's me, and I'm not always a fan of characters having things too easy.<br /><br />All the flaws notwithstanding, this is still a very promising story I'd happily recommend above traditionally published mainstream offerings in the same genre. (And some of these authors honestly did make me want to throw the book across the train, which this author didn't.) Hamilton writes with a fresh voice, bringing her unique spin to a genre that is often highly reliant on derivative works.that potential plot fizzle out when it could have been used to ramp up tension.

B002XTBE8I|3.0|The material of the album is amazing. The CDs themselves didn't have scratches and play perfectly, the only problem I had was the horrible way the case was treated. The top left and bottom left corners were smashed making me remove the plastic and the case cannot actually hold the CDs. The CD holder inside the case was also broken, letting both brand new CDs fall out without being able to stay. Ordered one day shipping and they met my expectations with that as well.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's fun but sometimes it gets boring imo. the ads are annoying. overall, it's an okay game app. it keeps you busy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|\\"World War Z\\" succeeds on every level. It is a zombie story with enough zombie goodness to please the most die hard fan of the genre. It also gets zombies right. They are frightening without being super-powered. Zombies have shock value when they first arrive on the scene, but not in the way that the old \\"cat jumping out of the closet\\" gag has shock value. The true horror of zombies is in their pervasiveness. It doesn't matter if you are in the bleeding edge most industrialized city on earth or the most rural of tribal areas, people die and their bodies are buried somewhere. Zombies can not be manipulated, they can not be reasoned with, and they can not be intimidated. This is the horror of zombies and Max Brooks absolutely nails it.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" moves beyond the zombies though. They are ever present, and yet they are not the one and only star of the show. The rise of zombies is a backdrop against which the story of human frailty is told. It is a story of the times in which we rise above, and the ways in which we utterly fail. Some of us face the horror with valor and conviction, others of us find a way to gain some advantage from it. Our actions can be commendable or thoroughly abhorrent, and yet they are always very real and very human.<br /><br />The story is presented as a series of vignettes. Each is a snapshot of what was going on during the war against the dead. At times characters will appear in each other's snapshots, giving us the opportunity to see someone's actions not only through their own eyes, but also through the eyes of those around them, and the rumors that spread about them. At first glance you may be tempted to judge certain people and their responses to the threat as \\"evil\\", but then you get to look at what they did through another lens and better understand why they did things the way that they did. You come to realize just how complex their decisions really are. \\"Good\\" and \\"Evil\\" become far less clear cut than we might like to believe.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is an immensely entertaining zombie novel, but what makes it so much more is the brilliant social commentary that runs through the story. You do not have to be a fan of zombie fiction to be blown away by this very human story.ieve.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is an immensely entertaining zombie novel, but what makes it so much more is the brilliant social commentary that runs through the story.

B005S9EJZA|5.0|I watched this movie on Memorial Day, and was reminded all over again that freedom isn't free.  So if you are a past or present member of any branch of the US Armed Forces, or if your loved one has paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life, fighting for our freedom, please accept my heartfelt thanks.<br /><br />I LOVED this movie.  Everyone did an excellent job with their character - especially with Logan.  So much feeling and emotion in his expression and actions, even when no words were needed.  I felt like I could see into his very soul.  I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east, when many of his comrades didn't come home.  You can sense the depth of emotion and turmoil, and can easily understand why it was often hard to just find words to express himself.  You can see the military training and discipline, the steel resolve to control his reactions, even when harassed by the town bully/ex-husband.  There's also loyalty, concern for others, tenderness, selflessness, willingness to work hard - he's the man of every woman's dream!<br /><br />It's easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage.  Even though she's now divorced, she's still not free from the abusive and controlling ex-husband.  She's very careful in how she responds or endures his abusive threats, in order to keep him from going into a greater rage... and I cheered for her when she finally found the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny.<br /><br />Keith, the ex-husband, is easy to despise, for his hateful, snarly, manipulating character... and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of good in his soul as well... a little glimpse of what he might have been if he'd only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier.<br /><br />I loved the happy ending, I loved the story, and I very much appreciated that the producers kept it clean.  I can't wait for the DVD - this is a keeper!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Game runs smoothly (been using this for a few weeks now and it's never glitched or force closed) and has the standard settings (3 card draw, 1 card draw, Vegas style) as well as a number of cardbacks to choose from, including any pic in your own gallery! If you like classic computer Solitaire, this is the perfect app!
B0085157B8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I was a huge fan of the first one and saw it like ten times.<br /><br />I can't say it's as good as that one but that is one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />This is still awesome enough to get five stars and it has so many sick parts.<br /><br />Like a girl has a piranha in her va jay jay and it bites this guy's weiner off.<br /><br />Also there is a book in it called The Ghost Who Walks and it's like about fish that walk on land to hunt us.<br /><br />The ending it totally shocking and just what you'd expect if you've seen the director's previous work like Feast.<br /><br />All the acting was over the top and it worked in a movie like this.<br /><br />Also David Haselhoff's performance as himself is worth seeing the movie alone and is almost as great as Jerry O'Connell in the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game! I love how you can buy things with your coins. Sometimes it doesn't read my jumps and I end up firing but over best game ever!
B0086700CM|5.0|great game. love it when I'm bored or just really need to kill time. but I always end up getting in for hours
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun game but some games are too difficult to unlock and the games cost a lot of coins. On the other hand, the games are good for varying ages.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its easy to use and u can choose your difficulty but it makes u have draws a lot. but over all its fun to use

B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Perfect for little girl's room. Very girly and cute. They stick to the wall nicely. My only complaint is that unless you know each individual princess, you have no idea which decal goes with what princess. Or what each princess's name is, for that matter. I knew the apple went with Snow White and the coach went with Cinderella (I think!)-- but you have no way of knowing because they're not marked.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The story captivates you! I literally coulsn't put it down, so I finished it quickly, this is definitely one that will be read again and again.
B0083SBM7Q|3.0|It's not a bad film, I would probably like to own it someday. But there are better, more cohesive superhero movies.<br /><br />The writer's \\"assignment\\" was to bring these wildly different characters together, show their inability to get along, then have some banner under which they could all unite. The first hour (where they are all brought together) was beyond boring and a complete waste of time. Thor's entrance and subsequent battle with two of the heroes felt rushed and unmotivated (not to mention that no one was suspicious that Loki didn't just run away during the battle). They also tried to set up a theme with Loki's trash-talk about \\"freedom.\\"<br /><br />The next hour or so (the inability to get along section) was pretty good, with charming one-liners and actual character development (Hulk in particular, character-wise was explored more in this movie than in his two feature films). They were on that flying ship for WAY too long, though.<br /><br />The last forty minutes (the uniting section) was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. They realized they needed something that would bring them all together (and justify the title \\"Avengers\\") so they had Loki kill that Shield Agent. This would have been a good thematic moment, the only problem was that  only about four of the main characters were even aware that it happened (leaving us only to guess why the others decided to join in) and the Agent's importance to the other characters came out of nowhere! All of the sudden, for no reason, Tony Stark is grieving hard for a guy he never seemed to care about before. The Agent's importance wasn't established ahead of time so I knew the only reason his death was being felt so hard was because it was convenient to the plot. He was a likable character so I personally was sad to see him go, but I think the writers were banking on our affection for him and not showing the heroes affection for him.<br /><br />The final action scene was big and fun but ultimately the definition of action-over-substance. All of the sudden Captain America is barking orders and the others are obeying (I get that that's how it is in the comics but for the sake of the movie we need a reason). That would have made sense if they'd cashed in on the \\"freedom\\" theme they'd set up earlier but alas, they decided to leave this movie themeless other than \\"teamwork can save the day.\\" We never learned what the heck those alien things were (which they'll probably explain in the sequel but it would have been nice to know), and a subplot of the \\"evil council\\" throwing a nuke was tossed in out of nowhere so we could resolve the alien invasion.<br /><br />So, was it fun? Yes. Was it meaningful? No. Was it too long (despite rumors that a whole half-hour was cut)? Yes. Is it overrated? GOSH YES!
B006BXTOFC|4.0|As their 2nd album, I found this one to live up to the expectations set with the 1st album. I had worried that they would not be able to capture the intensity and power of their debut album however those concerns were nullified when I previewed the 1st tracks.<br /><br />This album is a great addition to my collection and I enjoy it daily.
B0086700CM|4.0|The Free to Pay aspect of it gets quite annoying at times.  Do not let this stop you from getting this app though.  It's still great fun.

0345525558|4.0|I didn't really know much about this book before reading it other than there was a lot of buzz. I heard it was something about communicating through flowers, which wasn't really compelling. I'm glad I didn't know more than this before reading it, because this allowed the book to have its full impact on me. And what a strong impact it is. I was mesmerized and reduced to heaving sobs time and time again.<br /><br />From the beginning the meanings of flowers in Victorian courtship and leaving messages for others through flowers was really intriguing and immediately heartbreaking. Even without a story context, simply the statement that a yellow rose, for example, represents infidelity, sent a shiver down my spine. As you get to know the narrator, Victoria, and Elizabeth, the foster mom who taught Victoria the meanings of flowers, and Victoria communicates her feelings through flowers, the revelation of flower messages viscerally punches you in the gut. The courtship of Grant and Victoria through flowers, though there wasn't a slow build up of tension, and initially, NO WORDS was beautiful.<br /><br />There are two characters worthy of literary crushes in this book. The love interest, Grant, is a solid, patient man with an infinite capacity to forgive. Truly swornworthy. As a friend who wish you had there is Renata, Victoria's boss and friend. She has an insightful understanding of Victoria and knows what Victoria needs even if she isn't always capable of giving it to Victoria.<br /><br />The book did get a little slow in the middle and seemed that it might be headed down a rather hackneyed path, but it righted itself before too long. However, this was a memorable reading experience showing the capacity and power of forgiveness and reminds us to not give up on the emotionally hard nuts.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|There is something wrong with this game; my son got very frustrated  with it. The game is unresponsive<br /> I have a Kindle Fire,  I don 't know if it 's the same with other devices but for me this is a waste of time.

0670023329|3.0|This is one of those stories that provoke existential questions---one's fate according to the geography, simply lucky or unluckly, not on one's own merit, then, feeling of gratitude and guilt, or fury and misery, the existence of God, etc etc. The whole phenomenon of the existence of the North Korean regime and countless absurdities of this society are just beyond comprehension for most of us and need more attention both politically and academically. This book is a good, short introduction to this absurd country through the unbelievable story of Shin's life--his suffering, survival, intelligence, resilience--and the remaining tasks of psychological healing and adaptation to his new life, thus the end of the book left me with a grave sense of foreboding.  Although I definitely would recommend this book to anyone, I am giving only 3 stars because the writing feels alittle too one dimensional, too simple to be written by a professional writer.  I wondered if this was done deliberately by the author with the intention to make it sound like Shin's own narration, but if so, I don't think it was effective.
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't get why I like this game so much since it is like most other games. It is great I recommend it!
0345803485|5.0|After reading the reviews for this series I was a little skeptical. A few of my friends had read it and raved. Within the first 40 pages I was hooked!! And now I can't stop reading!! Great series! And I want a Christian Grey!!!!
0061537969|2.0|I think this may be the only time on Amazon where I do not understand why there are so many good reviews.  The writing, the story, the plot, and the characters are not very captivating.  It seems the perspective of the narrator is the draw to this book's \\"greatness,\\" but even the dog's character was somewhat dreary and off-putting.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that this is a great game! I am glad that they put it on her as well as the ipod and ipad. I think this game is very fun to play!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome and addicting!!  I have been waiting for months for it to come out on the fire!!  great game and I recommend it for people of all ages.
0307951529|5.0|This is one of those books that will change your life - it will inspire, instruct and ultimately change your whole outlook to living. But YOU have to apply its key lessons and make it happen.<br /><br />What I really like are the personal success stories - so it's not just drab theories but real life, juicy examples of what's also possible for YOU if you have the mind-set and determination to create a $100 start-up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to live life on their own terms and wants to have a lot of fun doing so - whilst changing the world and making a huge difference to others. How can it get any better than that!?<br /><br />Having followed Chris's work over the last 4 years, he is bringing about a revolution and this excellent book is just the next step on his amazing journey. Make this book also the next step of YOUR journey.<br /><br />Arvind Devalia, author of \\"Get the Life you Love\\"

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Video is excellent in its portrail of the clothing and the setting in Boston just prior to and after the American Revolution. Great dialogue between Adams and Jefferson as well as a great trail scene in which John Adams successfully defends the British soldiers who fired their rifles at the Boston Massacre. X,Y,Z affair was only eluded to, yet the full understanding that the French in the newly created US were causing trouble and war with France was soon to come...Excellent for US history understanding and conceptualizing. A MUST see.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.I got nervous when I read the first chapter,but I'm so glad I stuck it out.The narrative in this book is just brilliant.And,you care about the characters.There are parts that will rip your heart out,and parts where you are rolling on the floor laughing.The last two chapters are especially well written.I promise you will not be sad when you finish this book.
B00138KO54|5.0|As a statement to rock excess and the music industry it couldn't have been more perfect.  This album could break someone's will much faster than any other recorded piece I know. I am proud to say I own this on CD and vinyl.  I will never listen to it but enjoy the idea of clearing out a room by playing it for others. A true F*** Y**.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I had no idea what this app was going to be like from the description. But all of the 5star reviews made me download it. Well worth it. You will be playing this game over and over again. Hope you have a steady hand ...lol.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think whoever came up with temple run is a genius. It is an exiting game that will definetly have you playing all night!
B0086700CM|5.0|Best Android game I've ever played. I would have paid for this app. I hope they make some new paths to run, otherwise no complaints.
B0086700CM|5.0|looove this game. so does my friend now my kindle fire contain everyone fingerprint on it cause of everyone addiction to this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited to find temple run on the app store. I got and it exceeded the expectations that the IPhone set its a wonderful game
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game!!!! I LOVED this it on the iPad and they finally got it for the kindle! :)) I highly recommend it
B000002GYG|2.0|i heard waits in nightclubs in the '70s just as he was breaking out & this was always my fave LP of his. when i sold my vinyl recently, this was one of the 3 or so records i had to replace with digital, so i bought this CD. it's in good shape, so i'm glad to have it, but NIGHTHAWKS is a sloppy, intimate record that benefits from the warmth of analog sound, pops & skips considered. i'm glad to have this CD for reference, but won't be listening to it for pleasure. the tinny '90s digital technology is most disappointing if you're familiar with this LP on vinyl. the seller can't be faulted, as the CD arrived pronto, in good condition, & as promised. & i'm sure audiophiles would have known how to have avoided my mistake.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is nearly identical to Fifty Shades which is not a bad thing if it really was not SO parallel. I mean, at one point 2 lines from Fifty were in this book. Isn't this is borderline plagiarism in some fashion!?!? The idea, characters, etc. were completely the same. Gideon and Christian both billionaires at 28??  Sylvia Day even tried to introduce the Dom/sub twist into this book (poorly) that failed in comparison to Fifty. Despite being better written, I was not connected to the characters like I was in Fifty- my heart literally hurt during their sorrows and shared their joys, not here. It couldn't as the plot never developed,  it's like she wove a plot amidst the sex- like a typical porno LOL. The sex was good, little more \\"graphic\\" but nothing out of the ordinary. Had I not read Fifty prior to this book I may have enjoyed it more but alas, Fifty is still better in my opinion. This book was a quick read and I may consider the next one in the fall just to see what Gideon's secret was (which I already have an idea).
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love hidden object games. this one is good just no zooming in but not necessary. fun fun fun fun
B0086700CM|3.0|I was having fun playing at first... but when it makes you speed up it begins to glitch and when you try to make a move say jump or turn left it ducks instead this means I instantly die.... :/ ugh.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|Fun app...lots of fun things to do.  Not boring like some.  Will play this a lot...then hope you have more options for this app coming soon.
159102594X|5.0|What would an epic, magical quest be like with real, complicated, and highly flawed people as the protagonists?  On the surface, this book and the series don't seem to offer much that's new.  There's a great journey, a wise wizard, a young noble with shaky confidence, a brave, fireplug of a young maiden, and a fearsome northern barbarian.  But each of these characters does not quite fit the mold... what really goes on in the mind of a huge, half-naked warrior with a sword?  What really motivates the old sage?  And there are characters that truly are fresh in the genre- chiefly, the acerbic-witted and crippled torturer.  The author really gets into their minds, and each one is unique.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series.<br /><br />- A. C. F. Crawford, author of Sailor of the Skysea
B0086700CM|5.0|If you have time to kill this game is just right! You can play it where ever you wish! Like on the school bus. At lunch. And when you are waiting at the doctor's! Its the best!
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|I almost didn't watch this because of the over-the-top violence and sex. I don't know why HBO thinks that entertainment MUST include graphic sex and blood. Once I got past that, I started to enjoy the story. It's not the most compelling thing I've watched, but the cast is good. The scenery and settings are visually stunning. The blend of fantasy with something that looks like history is also interesting. The people, places and cultures look like they could exist, so the believability factor was pretty good too. Most of the players are despicable, so it's hard to like anybody, but the dwarf was definitely the most colorful character. If you have nothing else to watch, I'd give it a go.<br /><br />P.S. I haven't read the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. super addictive and haven't noticed any glitches so far. tons<br /> of fun classics as well as new gamesbto earn and play
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an amazing story.  I am a sci-fi junkie, and I can get interested in all kinds of micro-genres.  The drama set up in the story and the deep characters immediately draw you in.  Even characters that only make a brief appearance are compelling.  Once you start and get into this world you cannot stop.  I found this via an Amazon recommendation, and I am grateful.<br /><br />There are many books out there giving a all kinds of post-apocalyptic views of the future. I loved how this one gave a clear path from current times (without being too specific) to a completely believable possible view of a scarey future.<br /><br />I hate to do this, but I did keep thinking about this story in a movie.  And oh boy this movie would rock.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so popular at my school I love this game too ive been waiting forever for this game to come out on kindle fire.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Seriously a hidden objects game with no zoom?  Could be a good game but these games are often played on a small screen and zoom should be a standard.
0345803485|5.0|Very easy read! Hubby is very appreciative too<br />;) Highly recommend this series for any couple. And no, it's not just porn, its about unconditional love and acceptance, with very steamy parts mixed in!!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I LOVED this movie. I was a fan of the book & my only beef is that they didn't just call it A Princess of Mars. I have no idea why this didn't do better at the box office. I hope the DVD sales go nuts so they make another one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I write songs and like to keep a diary so Evernote really helps me keep track of everything. I also like Skitch, which lets you draw pics and sign your name on important notes. It is a separate download but once its downloaded you can click the link let you sign or draw onto your notes.

B005LAIGZU|4.0|Saw this in the theater (and...Blu-Ray purchased!) already knowing what to expect based on some reviews. I'm a military buff so I've got stuff to watch (the extract early in the film is ridiculous...great nod to the arm of the Seals you never hear about providing support for the main teams of operators). What you've heard is likely true:<br /><br />- There are no Oscar-winning performances here.<br /><br />- There's a solid sense of the simulated range of missions or sub-missions that could unfold in a real-world scenario.<br /><br />- There are a lot of examples of SEAL tactics and equipment (though obviously not enough to expose TOO much).<br /><br />You know who you are and if you should be watching this movie. If you're looking for something well-written and like something Tom Cruise might star in or something along the lines of Band of Brothers (beautiful mini-series by the way) or Saving Private Ryan, please don't bother getting this then coming back here and giving it a bad review. Check out the trivia on IMDB and you'll understand:<br /><br />- This is as much of a recruiting tool for the Navy as America's Army (the game) was for the Army.<br /><br />- The team that plays the main characters in the film were actually assigned to a special public relations unit specifically for this purpose (most Spec Ops operators would never give up their identity if they can help it).<br /><br />- The producers had originally cast the movie with actual actors, the SEAL team being advisers for the film. In the end, the team members felt the actors couldn't represent them properly so they pushed to be the ones on screen.<br /><br />- There are a number of scenes where live ammunition was actually used. They treated it like a (somewhat) standard military exercise.<br /><br />In the end, if you're a military buff, you'll get a kick out of this film. You'll laugh at the attempts at creating some sort of actors out of the SEAL team members but the combination of the action and when the team starts to get hurt, you'll get into it soon enough. The initial extract sequence at the beginning of the film is ridiculous (good ridiculous, not bad). Everyone has a right to their opinions political or otherwise (and are free to leave the political ones out of product reviews) but you can't deny we've got a pretty damned solid military. And at the very tip of that military are the Spec Ops operators getting it done despite hardship, pain, and little to no public recognition. These guys are a special breed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy they finally have this on the kindle fire now but why now and not when it actually came out but at least the app is free...so yeah :D
B0086700CM|3.0|this game is fun but it is loaded win glitches and makes it impossible to anywhere sometimes. I think it is a hell lot better in the ipad and iphine that on the kindle fire
B005C7SXMS|5.0|\\"My mother is worried I have mental problems. I found a book about teenage paranoid delusions during a routine search of my parents' bedroom.\\"<br /><br />There are quite a few teen-aged, quirky, personal movies out there.  They're usually pretty good.  They either resonate or they're funny or both.  The alphas of our species will probably have to be in a listless mood to enjoy them.  For us quirks, any time is a good time.  Rushmore (1998), Easy A (2010), Juno (2007), Starter for 10 (2006), The History Boys (2006), and, now, Submarine (2011).<br /><br />Oliver (Craig Roberts) is a little odd, but meeting his parents goes a long way to explain it.  Mom, Jill (Sally Hawkins), and Dad, Lloyd (Noah Taylor), are both pretty darn odd.  His girlfriend Jordanna (Yasmin Paige) is odd too.  Oliver is afraid that his mother is having an affair with total wanker, Graham (Paddy Considine), who's into mystic stuff that's so outlandish his mother's inclined to think there must be something to it.  Human relationships are complicated and Oliver does his best.  It isn't always good enough.  Poor Oliver.<br /><br />This movie is so good.  It's so funny.  It's so well put together.  It's a great way to spend an hour-forty.<br /><br />Great acting.  It's kind of one-dimensional for the character-almost all of the characters actually-but he's got that dimension down.  Roberts, who seems like a close cousin of Daniel Radcliffe, lays down his character and performs the voice over to perfection.  Everyone's motivation is pretty clear and understandable.  That doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement, but really, it's an aid to the script.<br /><br />It's a fantastic script.  I imagine that it's a fantastic book (by Joe Dunthorne).  Bravo to he and writer/director Richard Ayoade.  The comedy is of the awkward, honest kind.  It's not brutally awkward, but the kind of normal awkward that arises when there are no good responses to events. Very British awkward.  But it's-forgive me-full of heart.  I'm not sure how original it is-I mean, this is a teenager who has trouble understanding his relationship and that of his parents-but it is freshly prepared.<br /><br />Great visuals.  Most of the freshness comes from this quality.  The style is...quirky.  Have I gone over my \\"quirk\\" quota yet?  I hate to do that to you since it's such a non-expressive word.  I'll try something else.  It's filmed unconventionally, functionality is not the priority, colors are alternatively vivid and washed out, camera action is varied but never \\"art house.\\"  Were those any better?  How about \\"solid\\"?<br /><br />It's great finding/seeing these movies.  I couldn't say \\"finding\\" by itself because that would make it seem like I've done something other than heard of it and ran across it completely by accident on Netflix Instant (sweet!).  Still, it's like coming across a Wes Anderson-before they became too quirky to function (so by Wes Anderson, I mean Rushmore)-and totally giving in to its charms.  It didn't get me drunk and take advantage.<br /><br />There's a little ownership that goes with this kind of find.  It's mine and very few people share in it.  I share it with people and praise it lavishly.  It's almost like boasting.  \\"Oh, you've got to see this, it's absolutely hilarious.\\"  You say that sometimes just to make sure everyone understands that you got the joke.  Or, in its analogous genres, have such great, high, powerful tastes in film or whatever.<br /><br />Like most tastes, I can't stand it in anyone other than myself.  The boasting is obvious and patronizing.  If I don't laugh because I don't think it's particularly funny, which is probably due to the fact you're not a professional comedian, and then you have the temerity to ask \\"Get it?\\" you don't know how close you come to annihilation.<br /><br />In self-defense, there are jokes where you are allowed to say \\"Get it?\\"  These jokes include puns (difficult ones), very short (probably ironic) jokes, and the kind of jokes I like.  Whenever I relate a joke from Yes Minister (1980-84), I feel well within my rights to return your dumb glazed look with a \\"Get it?\\"<br /><br />However, because I am in the fraternity, you need only pause and allow me to catch up.  If I don't nod in apparent agreement (and silently prove your failure), then you may brutally dissect and explain the joke.  I'm one of those weird people who will probably laugh even then.<br /><br />The strange thing about owning a part of a movie as if you're special (despite the fact that neigh on 17,000 people took the trouble to rate the thing on a website to prove how special they are) is that paradox of sharing.  I own it and I'm special, now I want you to join the cult.  If you don't (and thereby emphasize exactly how special I am), then this is an affront to me, the House of Ratigan, my tastes, and Western Civilization.<br /><br />The paradox is resolved with the premise that your ownership (if accepted) is but a pale reflection of my blazing glory and when you go all new moon on it, you've disrupted my universe.  Maybe I'm just some rogue comet that meets up once every some-odd years with other, grander planets or I'm a moon to someone else's star.  Or can I be?  Is this metaphor just collapsing into itself like the universe only to reduce to nothing and then explode once again with brute denial!<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />The whole movie can roughly be described as understated.  That's means it's right up my alley.  It's also British (Welsh), so it's so far up my alley, I'll see it twice.  I had high expectations for all of these reasons and they were met and exceeded.  You can't do better than that.  Definitely worth the investment.<br /><br /><...>
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|AWESOME! This is book is unique, funny, engaging, and happily familiar. It's a retelling of Cinderella in the future, in Japan, with cyborgs and a human-esque race on the moon. What more do you need?! It's not campy or predictable so check it out! It's so worth more than the $10!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wanted to read this book. I hesitated because of the mixed, mostly bad reviews so I held off. However I kept hearing about this book. Finally I decided I would just buy it read it! I did get tired of the sex scenes at times & caught myself skipping ahead a few pages. Now that being said there was something about this book that made me want to keep reading it. I finished it & the way it ended well I purchased the next two to finish the series. So we will see how it goes.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I don't understand the hype about this trilogy.  After reading all three books, I found that much of the sex in this book was overkill.  How many times and in how many ways with the same words used over and over again, making many parts of this book boring.  However, there was a story there and the relationship between the two main characters was complex making me want to finsih the book.

B00005AREQ|5.0|I've always believed that in the history of guitar-god slingers, Jeff Beck is second only to the master himself, Jimi Hendrix.  And with this album, Beck let his guitar do all the talking.  No vocalist for the first time in his recording career, Beck entered the field of jazz-rock fusion and placed his stamp firmly and loudly on the genre.  By bringing in elements of funk, r&b and blues to a style that had been pioneered in part by John McLaughlin, he re-emerged as the pre-eminent guitarist of his day.  And nobody has yet to take that title away from him.  This was the album that cemented his reputation once and for all, IMO, as the greatest living guitar player.<br /><br />With former Beatles producer Sir George Martin behind the boards, and with a new supporting band that featured Max Middleton on keyboards (who was the lone holdover from his previous albums), Phil Chen on bass, and the amazing Richard Bailey....all of 18 years old at the time!....on drums, JB laid down what was to become a must-have album by every guitar player and fan of guitar playing in general. Besides Beck himself, Bailey is a standout on this release.  The opening track, \\"You Know What I Mean\\" opens with Beck borrowing a lick from the other JB, James Brown's \\"Sex Machine\\" and lays down a funky work-out that is still as infectious today as it was in 1975.  He follows up with a tasty jazz-influenced cover of Lennon-McCartney's \\"She's A Woman\\" (did I mention George Martin was the producer?) and then dishes up an r&b-influenced workout, \\"Constipated Duck\\" that features blistering guitar leads from Beck dueling with some solid grooves from Bailey on drums.  The first half ends with the 1-2 punch of \\"AIR Blower\\" and \\"Scatterbrain\\", the latter of which would become a standard in the Beck canon for years to come.  These two songs are just an absolute tour-de-force by Beck and his band, and remain one of the highlights of the fusion genre.<br /><br />The second half of the album starts off with a beautiful reading of Stevie Wonder's \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers\\" in which Jeff pays tribute to fellow guitar master Roy Buchanan.  It is a breathtaking performance that is without peer, and to this day stands out as one of the landmark guitar performances ever recorded.  To say he makes the guitar talk and cry is an understatement.  He follows by shifting gears a little to another Wonder tune, \\"Thelonius\\" which is pure funky delight, and then moves to his show-stopping crowd favorite, \\"Freeway Jam\\" where once again the band members jam full throttle on a work-out that is pure rock instrumental joy.  He closes the album with the Bernie Holland jazz tune, \\"Diamond Dust\\" which again has Beck putting his own unique style and signature on the genre, with Martin providing a full orchestral arrangement to flesh out the song in all its majesty.  Again, Beck's playing and melodic runs are breathtaking in their beauty and pure passion.<br /><br />This had been one of my all-time favorite albums since it's release in 1975.  I've owned the vinyl LP, recorded it to cassette tape, bought the CD re-master, and have downloaded it to my iPod.  It remains as fresh and dynamic today as it was when it was released, and though many have tried to duplicate the formula, they can only throw their hands up and smile in a note of admiration to Beck's mastery of the 6 string.  It is such an influential work that my son, who is a drummer, has this on his iPod and lists it as one of his favorite pieces of music.<br /><br />This is a must-have album for any music lover and anyone who appreciates virtuosity.  One of the best albums ever recorded in any genre.  A masterpiece.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book of Fifty Shades of Grey, was a little bit better. Better because I like the characters of the book espcially Christian Grey. I was sorry to see it end, but still there was a lot of references to twilight scenery, or a phrase here or two I would read and in my mind I would say, oh no another twilight phrase. I able to finish this book, because I wanted to see how it ended. It was a great ending,I hope she write part 4. Hopefully she can pull ideas from own imagination and not from other books. I would really like to read how Christian and Ana function as a family since they now have a son and another on the way.

B00335EQ0E|4.0|This is the Disney version of the movie I'm reviewing; the one with Katherine Beaumont playing the voice of the curious, energetic, dinner-bell-shaped, delightfully-pedantic character of Alice.  I'm just going to say this up front; it has little to teach anyone morally or religiously, but in spite of this, I think this is one of the most fun movies I've ever watched.<br /><br />In retrospect, in fact, there are a couple of really good ways to watch this film; both of which are very enjoyable.<br /><br />Way number one is to look for the symbolism in the story, and believe me when I say that it is there.  The original Alice in Wonderland books were brilliantly-disguised pieces of social and political sattire, with the behaviors of the various characters poking fun at a number of trends which existed at the time, and much the same thing can be found here.<br /><br />You can easily see corrupt, greedy elitists in the Walrus, hardworking, but still rather selfish ordinary people in the Carpenter, Dodo could be a parody of every foolish figure in public office who tries to solve problems by making them worse, and seems utterly oblivious to the cares of those he's hurting, etc...  Then, of course, the symbolism found in characters like the stuck-up, in-crowdy flower patch, the beatnik caterpillar and the Queen of Hearts are so easy to decypher as to be laughable.<br /><br />On the other hand, you could just watch it the way that I nearly always watch it; laugh in delight as Alice uses her apparently-magic skirt to parachute down into Wonderland, grows and shrinks incessantly, and meets all manner of ridiculous things and people in the process.  In short, you could watch the movie just for fun; as a welcome escape from the world of men.<br /><br />My favorite animated Disney movies of all time are Fantasia, Beauty and the Beast, and this movie.  Each plays a special role and each does something different.  Fantasia tells no single, concrete story.  Beauty and the Beast tells a very definite story.  Alice in Wonderland is middle-of-the-roadish, in that it tells a series of mini-stories which last only a short time, and are rather disconnected from one another.  Weird things happen, the main character moves on, and more weird things happen.  This is the element of the movie that every child loves.<br /><br />However, as an adult, I find something more in Alice than I do in Wonderland.  To be perfectly honest, I think the personality of Alice is as much of a draw for me as the land she explores.  Alice is very curious and brave; daring and bold, but not obnoxious.  Perhaps most distinctively, Alice distinguishes herself from other cartoon heroines in that she seems to have a raging obsession with formality, dignity and politeness, which I still find one of the most charming traits any protagonist could possibly have.<br /><br />Speaking personally, I never saw Alice as an everyman type, or an avatar for the viewer.  Of all the amazing things in Wonderland, she, a child who's truly concerned with being polite, may be one of the most amazing.  Children may relate to her confusion at seeing so many strange things in the world, and her sense of wonder when she encounters them, but I think it would be too much to suggest that there is any child quite like her.<br /><br />Any problems that I might have with this film stem entirely from its lack of any clear message or moral, and that's merely a personal bias of mine.  I also would have liked it to be longer, but I think that about most of the movies I really enjoy.  If you like odd characters, strange behaviors, weird situations, bizarre creatures, and just plain unusualness all around, seen with the eyes of a protagonist who's as dignified and polite as the world is strange, then what you're looking for can probably be found in Wonderland.<br /><br />In fact, in a way, all of this is reminiscent of our own desired destiny; a journey onwards into a world of great wonders and fewer limits in terms of what is and isn't possible.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I gave up after 20 pages. Usually I give each book I start reading at least 50 pages to catch my attention, but this was way too much for this mediocre novel.<br />The thing that really upset me is the style: it seems like it was written by a 15 years old and honestly I cannot understand why this \\"book\\" has become such a big deal for the critics. Save ten bucks and buy ANY other book in the Kindle store, but not this thing.
B00723NWJE|4.0|Still adored by her core fan base, Norah Jones has given up another wonderful album. It always puzzles me when people complain about an artist's evolution. This is not the timid singer from her first album, rather a seasoned professional who is now a master of her craft. There is not a bad song in the bunch.
B006T3RM08|4.0|This solution rocks!  It is exactly what I was looking for to use in my living room.  But I tend to use it more at my desk as it keeps the trackpad where it is \\"supposed to be\\".  The issue some people mentioned - that the trackpad gets stuck in down click position after first click is NOT an issue I have ever experienced so either Henge fixed the design or it is user issue.<br /><br />I do wish the plastic case were made of aluminum (looks better, stronger & given the price;); however, the plastic used/design is fine as long although I'm not sure it would hold up if you remove the keyboard / trackpad often (something I have yet to do except to change the battery).<br /><br />I would like to see an aluminum version that has an inductive charger built in. :)
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|I know what you're going to say.  \\"What?  A serious, committed, deeply-religious reviewer like you, watching a movie called 'Hellboy?!'  What the heck is wrong with you?!\\"<br /><br />Well, to be honest, I was talked into it by an article that I saw in a paper a while back.  A fellow reviewed the available Hellboy movies, commenting on their \\"strong, Catholic elements,\\" and this thread has been floating through my mind ever since then, wondering just what it was about the films that was so Catholic or religious.<br /><br />Well, as it turns out, there's not much.<br /><br />A Catholic exorcist accompanies a commando unit at the start of this film to try to put an end to an evil ritual, designed to summon alien demons to Earth and bring about the end of the world, and as it turns out, the ritual is a success...  Sorta.<br /><br />A little baby demon is hiding out in the wreckage of the ritual grounds, is adopted by the exorcist, named \\"Hellboy,\\" and from then on, takes to fighting evildoing monsters and other demons who've gone astray.<br /><br />The movie is reminiscent of \\"Van Helsing\\" in some respects, except that the main villain is less of a ham (a major improvement.)  The main character is essentially a demon exorcist with a kind of \\"lone wolf\\" mentality in his battles with other demons.  He's a gruff, easily-upset sort of fellow, but when you get down to it, he doesn't really want people getting hurt.<br /><br />However, Van Helsing at least left the door open that its main character might be a virtuous warrior as well.  Hellboy definitely is not.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  He's clearly the lesser of two evils.  The bad guys he's fighting are big, nasty eldridge abominations from planet X for the most part, but even Hellboy himself is shown stealing, destroying public property, using a necromantic spell, and killing at least one person.  The fact that he does all of this, while also saving the world from being devoured by ferocious, bloodthirsty tentacled creatures from beyond is a separate issue.<br /><br />Like Van Helsing, the reliability of things like crucifixes in performing exorcisms is ratified in this film, and it's heavily implied that the Vatican carries on one of the few serious studies of these dangerous, supernatural beings.<br /><br />Don't think I'm not grateful for the tip of the hat; making the good guys look like good guys for once.<br /><br />Still, I'd be more grateful if some element of clear morality had shone through in the process, and it just doesn't here.  As far as I can tell, the deepest moral lesson in this film is basically \\"don't use your demonic powers to destroy the world,\\" and you can only get so much mileage out of that.  When all is said and done, this is basically just a pretty decent action movie with a crucifix hung on it, and while it's better with it than without it, I was sort of hoping for more.creatures from beyond is a separate issue.<br /><br />Like Van Helsing, the reliability of things like crucifixes in performing exorcisms is ratified in this film, and it's heavily implied that the Vatican carries on one of the few serious studies of these dangerous, supernatural beings.<br /><br />Don't think I'm not grateful for the tip of the hat; making the good guys look like good guys for once.<br /><br />Still, I'd be more grateful if some element of clear morality had shone through in the process, and it just doesn't here.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Sometimes I dislike getting the cheaper priced book because they are usually cheaper due to poor (or nonexistent) editing.  I am SO GLAD I got this one. A fantastic read, great characters and virtually no proofreading errors or incorrect word choice errors. All I need to know now is how soon I can get my hands on the followup novel.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Track by track, this is an album that shows of one of music's finest talents.<br /><br />Missing Pieces: The vocals you have come to expect. A funky keyboard groove is the highlight.<br /><br />Sixteen Saltines: Simple, catchy and sporting a sound like it was done in one take in Jack's basement.<br /><br />Freedom at 21: Very \\"Black Orchid\\" in its sound with a hint of The Beastie Boys' \\"Paul's Boutique\\" thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Love Interruption: Just listen and enjoy.<br /><br />Blunderbuss: Brings back memories of the late 60s. Folksy in a modern way.<br /><br />Hypocritical Kiss: A musical amusement park. (Don't ask me to explain.)<br /><br />Weep themselves to sleep: A one song rock opera.<br /><br />I'm Shakin': At first I thought it was the \\"I'm Mister Heat Miser\\" song from the christmas special. I dare you to NOT hear that. This is a song that will seep into your brain and stay all day.<br /><br />Trash Tongue Talker: A good song...but if I HAD to pick one least favorite...this is it.<br /><br />Hip: Reminds me of the roaring 20s.<br /><br />I guess I should go to sleep: Jack channeled Janis Joplin here.<br /><br />On and on and on: Genius. That's all.<br /><br />Take me with you when you go: Groovy...kitchy...raw.

0876391277|5.0|This is a well-researched, well-presented book. The explanations are clear, the audio tracks well recorded, and I particularly like the examples of other saxophonists who use the effects - it enables the student to contextualize the techniques and encourages further listening and study. While not a sax player, I often write for it and so am interested in its capabilities; I have no doubt this book will be a very useful resource for me and many others.

0345803485|1.0|Well thankfully I didn't have to pay for this book. I agree with most of the one star reviewers. Did anyone else find the sex on his desk part hilarious? He took the out condom out of his pocket. Really?  How many condoms does this guy fit in his pocket?! And yes when I thought about how \\"long his index finger\\" was, I did think about E.T. Lol

B0055SWM08|5.0|I've recommended quell and quell reflect to all my friends.  These games are suberb little time wasters and brain builders.

B0083VDK96|3.0|I bought this cd after hearing NPR's interview with Melody yesterday. The price was right for a 'new to me' artist. All things considered (pun intended) I'm pleased with her music and will seek out other recordings. But what is up with the last track? 14 minutes of an 18+ minute track are missing. FYI: I could barely hear the annoying finger click on So Long using my phone's headset of course that won't always be my listening mode but still.....<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted customer service this morning inquiring about the missing minutes on the final track. They promptly responded that someone will begin to correct the digital material. Hopefully the full track will be available soon.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|An application that actually does what this one promises would be wonderful.  The video and audio seldom sync in any of the videos I used to test it.  My test videos were taken from a variety of sources to insure it was not a simple formatting issue.  Enabling hardware decoding crashes the Kindle Fire and I had to reboot it.<br /><br />The author should be ashamed to put this out on the market as though it is a final product. This is a beta experience at best.  I cannot stress enough that this product should not be used until the author has performed extensive revisions and much more thorough testing.  I used version 1.4.2.  I am not sure if I will give this product or any other products from the same author a try again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where do I begin? A British writer who knows zero American slang or geography. We have an alleged College graduate female who goes from virgin to deep throat in seconds. She is multi-orgasmic with just one look from the HOT BILLIONAIRE WITH THE PERFECT BODY *sigh* really?????? I found myself wanting to choke Ana's \\"inner Goddess\\" Now lets keep it real if Christian Grey was poor middle age ugly good ol' Ana would have never \\"consented\\" to all of those interesting *heavy sarcasm* proposals THE SUPER HOT BILLIONAIRE offers her.....<br /><br />And The Laters, Baby seriously? no really seriously? Who would say anything that lame, If I read Laters Baby one more time I was going to climb into the book and rip out vocal cords!<br /><br />BTW did anyone else realize that the guy is a major stalker creep in the book seriously he tracks her via GPS on her phone and she is ok with that? Ummmm if any young ladies are reading this that is not love that is STALKING get a restraining order smh
B0086700CM|5.0|so so happy this game is finally here! love it! thank you for getting it on kindle fire! I'm addicted!
B0030B624E|5.0|I think the Zombie genre is pretty boring but this movie was hysterical, had action its a definite cult classic and the whole twinkie thing??? Seriously I hate twinkies and even I wanted one!
0810979772|5.0|The book looks like new.  Some writing in pencil, but easily erased.  Thanks! My third graders will love it! A great buy for the price!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! Its very addicting and competitive too! My husband and I both have it on our phones and we're always racing to see who can go the farthest! If there had to be one thing I'd change it would have to be the fact that there is really no &rdquo;end&rdquo; to the game or levels. It would make it more challenging you had an stainable goal.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|The app itself does what its suppose to do so by that account I would have gave it five stars but since I have to keep removing and then re-adding the widget so it keeps working just irritates me. But take away that flaw it works great.
0439023491|5.0|If you have not read \\"Catching Fire\\", you must! It is the second book in a three part series called \\"The Hunger Games\\". I wasn't sure what to expect when reading it, because I didn't think it could get any better than the original.  After the first book, I needed to know what was going to happen with Peeta and Katniss' relationship. It picked up right where it let off and explained what happened between the two. The first thing I loved about this book was the presence of Gale. In the first Hunger games before I read it I knew the plot and the main character's positions. I expected more from Gale in the first one but he was barely in it. In \\"catching Fire\\" there are more scenes with Gale and more character development on him, which I really enjoyed. The second thing I love is all the cliffhangers. Almost every chapter ends in something unexpected. I couldn't put the book down. I would tell myself one more chapter and end up reading four more. The biggest cliffhanger is the huge twist in the middle (I won't give it away), but it was very shocking, I recommend this book to anyone, children and adults alike. It is a very good and a very fast read!
B0086700CM|5.0|So glad that this app is finally on Android! Easily addictive. graphics are great and the animation is very smooth.
B004XISI4A|4.0|extremely captivating on the same footsteps as the other books of the series.... can't wait for the next one.  The first part starts off a bit slow in order the set up the various story-lines.  As it moves forward it grasps exponentially the reader interest.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I've never found so many addictive, challenging games. Although I don't like that the games cost so many points to unlock new games. Luckily for me it's really easy to get extra and bonus points by playing games I already finished.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow its so fun, u can explore all different kinds of powers to make u go faster and explore all the different environments. You'll love this game and you'll never get tired of playing it!!!!!!!!!!! :)
0062060562|5.0|Wow, I haven't had the privilege of holding in my hands a book this suspenseful, gripping, and page-turning in quite some time.  The author does a great job of revealing the plot, keeping you guessing at every twist and turn.  An excellent read.
B00371V6SE|3.0|Not up to Nicholas Sparks' usual standard - a disappointing read though the storyline was good but the written word seemed terribly outdated.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is probably one of the most successful apps in history. It's so much fun and is really addicting, not to mention free. If you haven't downloaded this game yet, DO IT. DO IT NOW.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game. the only thing that would make this game the best is if the graphics would change as the guy advances in the temple.  That would make the game Mildred interesting.
B005IQ5H7M|4.0|This book was quirky and an interesting read.  The kindle version isn't great though - it seems as though the book pages were scanned and converted to text in order to create this ebook.  There were numerous occasions where a sentence didn't make sense until I realized it was supposed to say \\"hot\\" rather than \\"not\\", or there was an \\"m\\" in place of \\"rn\\" completely changing the word.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome it is for those that like me are all about the tycoon games I love being able to build and that is what this game lets you do!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Went into this with blind expectations and came out about as scared as I could be as a grown as* man.<br />Great scary movie.

B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. it is very engaging and entertaining. once you start playing,  your hooked and can't. stop. I would definitely recommend this wonderful game.
1400067936|3.0|The author outlines some interesting ideas, but may very well have fallen victim to his own concepts.  While one can discount planning and faith, contingency theory leadership has its limits, but so does the belief that all is random, thus what can one really do in life.  I got a distinct impression of negative qualities from the author, which overshadowed the entire book.  Wish he had stuck to the idea of randomness in life.
B0002HWJY6|5.0|The blue Smurf cottage is adorable!  It came well packaged and was easy to assemble, and although we are only using it as a decorative ornament for sentimental reasons, our grandkids will probably play with it when they visit and I'm sure it will hold up just fine - it appears to be quite durable.  On ours, the roof does not fit tightly, but it looks fine, and I'm sure that the loose fit makes it easier for children to play with, particularly when they want to put a Smurf or two inside.  An added bonus was the great communication from Amazon - emails kept us updated on the order status and we were absolutely amazed at the super-fast shipping we received with Amazon Prime.  All said, we are extremely satisfied customers!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this set because one of my best friends said she really enjoyed everything about the trilogy.  I will admit that I did blush at a good bit of the reading as it is definitely an adult book; however, the story line behind this book was very sweet and even a little shocking at times.  I really enjoyed reading Christian's point of view at the end of the third book....I kind of wish there was more of that.

0345803485|1.0|I know that this book is supposed to be an exciting (erotic) story--aka \\"Mommy Porn\\"--but there's something wrong when I can't even get past the first thirty pages! Every sentence is the same prosaic, boring prose, written in a mind-dulling way that immediately lulls a reader into a comfortable snooze. That's not what you want with erotic romance, is it?  So far, this book is the equivalent of being married to the same person for fifty years:  dull, comfortable, predictable, and seemed exciting when first picked up. However, it's so boring that I've been saying, \\"Not tonight, dear, I have a headache,\\" and picking up another book instead.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this game before and it is addicting. So the next time I went to the amazon app store on my kindle fire I looked for it I was bummed that it was not there. So when I went on the app store this time and it was there I was so excited! Thanks amazon!

1439156816|5.0|I bought this book anxious to absorb what an obviously successful author could share with me on how to write and navigate the publishing business, hungry for any good advice to advance my own aspiration to be a writer. Reading the first several chapters, I was entertained by the charmingly told autobiography (as compellingly written as any of his novels), but wondering where the hard stuff was, the information that was going to make me a successful writer.  Only after I finished that section did I realize that everything King has to say about the craft grows directly out of his life experience -- as a boy growing up, as a husband, a struggling substitute schoolteacher and a father.  In effect, he was saying, \\"Hold on, young fellow, the true wisdom necessary to know what one wants to write and to write it compellingly grows out of everywhere a person has been in life.\\"  I'm now in the latter chapters, sorting through the more nuts-and-bolts advice, which I think is all excellent.  I intend to acquire a copy of Elements of Style, a kind of writer's bible, on his recommendation.  A master work from a popular master.
1603429999|5.0|Item was shipped promptly and arrived merely 2 days after it was ordered. The price on the back of the book says $24.99, Amazon had it for $16.99. What a deal! It's just the book I need, too. I'm not very educated on knitting in the round (I've knitted 2 hats and I'm halfway through a cowl) so I thought this would do the trick to teach me. Not only does it look like it will do that, but this book has over 300 pages of patterns, methods, etc. I'm so happy about this!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. I like the fact the author didn't go overboard on details, allowing me to use my imagination instead of boring me with every little insignificant aspect of the the surroundings. I good writer can be thorough without the reader realizing how much and i think Suzanne Collins really nailed it on this one. Thanks!!!

B007C3TVEY|4.0|Movies about violent teenagers are a dime a dozen; very few have any real depth to them.  They tend to seek answers, or revel in the rebelliousness, or simply aim to shock.  Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, initial appearances notwithstanding, does not fit into this mold.  It is dark, yes--some of the imagery is disturbing, some of the cuts are hectic, but the intent/result is psychological, not visceral.  And the story is told in a nonlinear fashion; we don't even find out what Kevin did until the film's end, though we know it isn't good.  The technique, on behalf of screenwriter/director Ramsay, is effectively jarring: this is not an easy film to watch.<br /><br />The story focuses on Eva (a haunting Tilda Swinton, giving an award-worthy performance), following her inner turmoil as she copes with the fact that she doesn't feel comfortable around her son (the maternal instinct is a target here, which adds to the element of discomfort).  Eva is human; this means she's not an entirely sympathetic character (in fact, I'll admit to absolutely loathing her in spots, which was the filmmakers' intent).  In fact, there are no truly sympathetic characters here: John. C. Reilly, as Kevin's father, does his nice guy thing, but with an edge: after all, he encourages some of his son's more violent behaviors.  The three actors playing Kevin at different ages (Rock Duer, Jaspar Newell, and Ezra Miller) are all fantastic, conveying Kevin as an almost despicable character.  (If the film has one major flaw, it's that younger Kevin comes across almost as preternaturally evil; while this is indeed left up in the air, there are several attempts to suggest that Kevin's actions are a result of his parenting, but this only really comes across--in the character anyways--with Miller's performance of a teenaged Kevin.)<br /><br />This film will raise a few eyebrows and offend a few viewers; it proposes a lot of questions, presents several possible answers, and then steps back and says, \\"Does the answer really matter after the fact?\\"  It doesn't judge (though it seems to in the first 30 minutes or so); it inhabits a firmly gray area, placing the final verdict in the viewers' hands.  It's certainly not a conventional film; in the \\"making of\\" doc, one individual describes it as a \\"psychological horror\\" film, and that term hits the mark, but doesn't quite cover it.  It may be up to each individual viewer to determine what genre WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN falls into, but there's no denying that is a powerful, disturbing film.says, \\"Does the answer really matter after the fact?\\"  It doesn't judge (though it seems to in the first 30 minutes or so); it inhabits a firmly gray area, placing the final verdict in the viewers' hands.

B007Q476KU|2.0|I figured this movie had to be great.  A big, epic, sentimental, war movie with a giant heart centered around a horse.  This is his forte--the magical, earnest family movie guaranteed to please like ET.<br /><br />I think he knocks it out of the park, oh, 80% of the time.  This was not one of those times.  I was bored.  I was uninterested in the characters.<br /><br />To me, Seabiscuit is the definitive horse movie.  It captured the majesty, speed, and emotion of horses and the people that love them.  I didn't feel that at all here.  The horse travels through the war from one character to another that I don't care about until the end.<br /><br />The one scene that was effective was where the horse was caught between the two frontlines.  That was one magic moment, Spielberg at his best.  As it is, I wouldn't sit through it again--glad I didn't buy it sight unseen.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The Oregon trail was one of my favorite games when I was younger and so this app spiked my interest. This game is not like the old computer version but has many perks that give it a refreshing new look and feel. I love that you have to acctually build the buildings and have to plant your crops, this gives the game a more realistic feel. It does not take too long to regenerate energy so you don't have to spend real money to get things done if you don't want to. I feel this is a well made game and would  recommend it. Good way to waste time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I have it on my phone its even gunner on s big scream ive been waiting do long for it I loveit
B005NNUKF4|1.0|I can't listen to the entire album without the dead time between songs and there is often overlap from one song to the next. I bought the whole album to avoid this. I didn't see it as one piece of music. No more albums for me.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The only. thing wrong with this game is it needs more levels so we can keep playing!  The endless game is good if you just don't want to stop.  if you like mahjong games- get this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever it is really fun I recommend it for people of all ages you should get it
B0052VUNHC|5.0|After reading some bad reviews I was hesitant to read this so for a while I forgot about it but then one day I saw it again and I decided, \\"What the heck.\\" So I read it and boy do I wish I hadn't listened to those reviews! This book is amazing and very well written! The way some people portrayed Travis in their reviews I thought I was going to hate him but I didn't. True, he did some dumb stuff that made me think, \\"Whoa, what is going on?\\" But nothing happened that turned me away from the book. Instead, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to re-read this book. I loved it so much that I even bought the paperback copy. I really hope this gets made into a movie. I know I'd be first in line to see it.<br /><br />After my experiance with this book I don't put too much stock in reviews anymore. If something sounds good, I think I'll like it, and the price is right then I'll take the risk. So far I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />I also can't wait to read Jamie McGuire's other books and I'm eagerly anticipating Beautiful Disaster from Travis' POV.
B0086700CM|5.0|my mom has this game on her phone and I loved it I was waiting for it to come out for my kindle fire. get this game it is fun!
1741797802|4.0|I wish I had known the book was so heavy, but the information is excellent! Very useful if you are going to travel around India as it includes the whole country.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting to get this game forever and finally it came out. I am really excited about this!

B0086700CM|5.0|it is so cool and it has cool and awesome characters and Zack Wonderful is so cool and very fast
0141439661|4.0|This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies. But the elegant prose, twisting plot and amusing characters won me round. Austen, I belatedly discover, is one clever writer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it... full screen on kindle, easy to use and you can recall previous calculations... best calculator app I have found so far
B0086700CM|5.0|great great game take the time to try it. You won.'t be sorry. great graphics and sound effects are hilarious.
B006ZNRD06|3.0|I love easily being able to play any video format on my kindle, the only downside is that the audio seems to be out of sync by about half a second.  Its mildly annoying but I can overlook it.  After a week you will have to choose whether you want to keep it and pay $5 or not, they should have made it apparent that it was only a trial but I still appreciated the chance to try it out for free first.
0345803485|1.0|okay, I am embarrassed that I can even write a review on this piece of garbage because it then reveals that I actually read it. I read somewhere that it titillates the reader, is the new soft porn for lonely housewives who have such boring lives and need some sensual pick me up. Ladies, if you like this book you have much deeper needs that can better be served on a psychiatrist's couch than buying this book. At least borrow it so you don't waste your money.<br />It is actually a comedy I think because I was laughing after the first 10 pages. It is also a counting book because you find yourself counting how many times they mummur-every page and sometimes twice a page. Is that supposed to be sexy? Their breath hitches and they gasp- a lot of physical probllems for such young people. I swear I wanted to rip her lower lip off after the first 2 chapters as she was always biting it and he always grabbed her chin and ran his finger across it. Maybe he really wanted to rip it off too-but then that would ruin the mood.<br />I cannot fathom how this literary nonsense became a rage, it appears to have been written by a teenager with a very limited knowlegde of sex and vocabulary.<br />Kindle owners have actually kept track of how many times certain words were used , how many shades of some color they turned and how many times Ana refers to her genitals as 'down there'. Where the heck are her parents????
0679805273|5.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughter's high school graduation reception. She used it as her guest book, encouraging guests to sign on the page of their choice. Many wrote not only their name, but also a comment about why they chose that particular page. It was a big hit and much more enjoyable to reread/look at than a traditional guest book. Thank you, Amazon, for providing the opportunity to buy this book from my home and have it delivered directly to me.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell is absolutely addictive. Quell Reflect is even better than the first. I'm so glad they changed it up to continue to make this game interesting. I love how they incorporated more raindrops in the mix. From the concept to the graphics to the music...this game is Grade A. Can we get a Quell soundtrack? This music is heavenly!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Wanted to own a copy for many years now but just never bought a copy.  They're very reasonable through Amazon.  Now we have it in our DVD library.
B007IQXFRE|5.0|Great Feed and Quality Video.  Amazon has done a great job with their streaming services and watching this episode is more proof of their great work.  Thanks Amazon!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing!!! I'm spool happy the kindle people added it 2 the kindle. I'm solo upsesed with this game every minute I'm playing it. I soliloquy recomend getting this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I ordered this book on my kindle and I can't even begin to tell how great the book is.  I've read all three in the series and reading them again.  Definitely worth buying!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!! when I first kindle for the first time I was disipoented not to find it!!!!!!!!! I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy that Amizon finally got this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I honestly thought this was a truly addicting game!!!  Not only do I think this app is fantastic, but so do my friends!
B000I9YWDO|4.0|I don't think anyone can say there was ONE unfunny sequence in the entire first 40 minutes or so of Office Space. The only real problem I have though with this cult classic is Jennifer Aniston, the film is about office drones being miserable and eventually planning revenge, what did some hackneyed love story have to do with it? Did anyone feel ANYthing for that relationship? It wasn't really funny when they talked together, it didn't really end on a romantically satisfying note, the whole point of that sub-plot seemed to be to market Office Space to the vast number of Friends fans at the time.<br /><br />Oh well, Office Space is still one of the best comedies made, just a minor complaint.
B006K06XNM|5.0|There aren't words to convey how this film makes you feel. You will laugh, hard! The humor, the struggle, the genuine emotions were extremely compelling. Couldn't get enough of it. Love this film, kudos to the actors and the director of this genius work of art.
B0086700CM|5.0|Alright guys I downloaded this but it stopped downloading. Now I am just waiting for it ti start back up. No luck yet. Still an awesome game though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will say first and foremost that I don't read many novels and I almost never write reviews. I watch a lot of films and television, but most of the reading I do is of a technical nature, or in the form of short articles/news/opinion pieces. I don't read much fiction because I just have a hard time getting into the stories.<br /><br />That said, I stumbled across this book on the top 100 list of science fiction novels on the Amazon kindle site. The description intrigued me and the hundreds and hundreds of 5 star reviews made me think I should give this one a try. Well, I decided $5 wasn't bad, so I bit the bullet and bought the kindle version. I was completely blown away. This book was phenomenal. Everything was well executed...the slow buildup of background about the different characters, the detailed descriptions of the silo and the bleak life that the inhabitants live in that concrete and steel tube, the well timed plot turns. The chapters were brilliantly laid out to leave me starving for the next when each one ended. I don't read fictional novels, but I couldn't put this book down. I kept imagining constantly throughout how great of a film this will make. I only found out later that Ridley Scott bought the rights to it.<br /><br />If you enjoy science fiction, especially the sort of post-apocalyptic human drama that is less about crazy yet-to-be-invented science/electronics and more just a story that takes place in the future, you should read this book. I'm a huge fan. I immediately bought 6 (although I didn't enjoy it as much as these first 5...it was still entertaining) and I can't wait to get the next iterations when they are released.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|Our kids loved the concept of Snow Alligators. It is a story that pits Snowmen as defenders against the Snow Alligators. But only the Snowmen built by children have what it takes to ward of the snow menace. This book really fires up the imagination, and the illustrations are terrific. This is fun book and I highly recommend it to parents with kids under 7.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg when I saw temple run I gone cocoa for cocoa puff one of the best game on kindle fire
0345803493|4.0|Of the three books, this is my favorite. I think it's because he finally realizes that he loves Ana, and let's her touch him. Sime things make me laugh, tho, apparently Spanish omelets are not the same in London as they are here... Potatoes, peas and ham? And the constant whispering and mouthing of words? But I see these books for what they are, entertaining romance.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for two months and its awesome. It has to be the most addicting app that I have ever played.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is so cool! It tests your brain and is also fun! I love it and I didn't even know they had it on kindles!!!!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Movie of the year?  No.  Better than Avatar?  (which it was advertised as being close to...)  No!<br /><br />Awesome adventure and worth seeing?  YES!<br /><br />My daughter and I saw this in the theater one lazy Sunday afternoon.  Came out completely entertained.  The movie has it's slow moments at the start, but stick with it and you'll find a very good adventure movie in the classic Disney style.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|the app wont load for some reason :( I hope it gets fixed soon! I want to play! please fix!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is Awesome!!!! Me and my mom have this app, and of course I have the highest score. Her main score is 2,000 and mine is like 4,000. When you first start, it goes slow, but as you go it gets faster and faster. Its a really great app if you like challenging games. Its really awesome. :D :)
0307951529|5.0|Seems to me that some of the reviews here reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the book.<br /><br />This book, at last how it comes across to me, intends to show the reader just how easy it is to start a business these days.<br /><br />Not just an infobusiness, but any business (mattress example a good example of this).<br /><br />Whilst this book is heavy on small vignettes using real world examples, anyone who was across the genesis of this book probably understands why it is like it is.<br /><br />If you are looking for deep case studies and detail on what people did when things went wrong, well, that's a story for another time.<br /><br />What this book right here does is show you there is no limit to you starting your own business, except for your own determination.<br /><br />Technology and capital are now longer excuses.<br /><br />And it's with this intention in mind that I can say that this is a great book.<br /><br />I suppose lots of people want to start businesses and don't know how - how to build a website, take payments etc - you don't need a book for that. Google it (most of the people in the book probably did).<br /><br />No, where the real secret sauce of this book lies, is in the actual ideas and useful tips on marketing and copyrighting.<br /><br />Despite the fact I have a coffee finding/review website and iPhone app, a cycling travel website and coffee subscription service, and despite the fact I've read a lot (A LOT) of business and marketing books, I still got a lot out of this book.<br /><br />It reinforces fundamental truisms that are often forgotten and I was surprised to find myself madly scribbling action points to apply some of the thinking and other business ideas to my own.<br /><br />After reading this book, I launched 5 new products (3 subscription, 2 single purchase) on my cycling travel website the next day.<br /><br />Really, this book is an all in one high level \\"What to do\\" not \\"How to\\". How-to's belong on blogs and in manuals and user guides. This is strategy not tactics.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are starting out and don't know where to start, or run a mature business and want some fresh thinking.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I am so so so glad they finnaly made it for kindle!!! it is so so so fun!!!
B0067AC5KA|1.0|Finished the Girl with the dragon tattoo in three painful days. i dont understand the hype this book received. the translation was slightly confusing but not intollerable. the characters seemed to lack something and the beginning of the book seemed to drag on pointlessly. too much unnecessary filler and the sadism and animal cruelty only turned my stomach. i litteraly had to force myself to finish the book. i will not continue with the rest of the trilogy. also the ending just pissed me off. last page left me saying &#34;wait  that's it?&#34; a waste of my time.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've put so many hours into this game. If you like games like Minesweeper or Sudoku, logic puzzles, you'll like his one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I've only had it for a week and I've play it over athousand times! I love Temple run and I think you will too! :)
B0086700CM|4.0|Playing from the Kindle Fire, I ran into performance problems. When the game starts moving faster, around 1250 meters, I get stuttering, throwing me off my rhythm and timing, which is everything in a run-and-jump. I'd say that more than half of my deaths were due to the stutter. The game itself is everything everybody says it is, though.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Totally addictive!!! Never played a game like this, but love it! I will be sad when I play it all the way through.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run before it came out I was constantly barrowing my friends apples to lay this game but one day I got on the app store and guess what? !?!?! it was finaly her!!!!!!!!<br /><br />thank toy for finally making it!!!!
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins's millions seller, \\"Good to Great\\" is highly recommended to not only business people, but also any non business related individual who is wishing to change from good to great in general.  Even though this is the research book showing about how mediocre companies became great companies with distinct characteristics explained by Jim Collins, I think these characteristics can be applied or related to any person or student in the same way mediocre companies applied themselves in the book.<br /><br />There are seven characteristics of good to great companies are explained by the author.  The reason I can relate these characteristics to any non business related individual is that these characteristics are so basic that most people may regard as common sense.  However, the author analyzed these common sense characteristics with research data from tireless effort of his research team.  With the author's enough backup examples from these research data, there is nothing to doubt about how these characteristics promise from good to great.<br /><br />Although some of examples of good to great companies in the book are gone or bankrupted as of now, this fact should not deter you to read this book.  A lot of things happened in last decade including 9/11 and global recession.  I guess his following book, \\"How the might fall\\" which came 2009 would answer why some of his examples of good to great companies were fell after he published \\"Good to Great\\" in 2001.  To conclude, I found this book very helpful to re construct my leadership mentality as well as organization skill in general.  Even though I'm not related to business management, I enjoyed this book by paralleling by myself with his stories.  Again, as I mentioned above, I would recommend this book to not only business people, but any individual who wants to change his status from good to great.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Got this for the kids but I am having SO much fun with this. My daughter and I have competitions to see who can get the highest score
0345803507|5.0|I'm so sad this is the last book!  These books are so well written...you can't help but fall in love with the Greys!  I hope this author writes another series soon!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is one of the best games that you could ever think of. I love this game so much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great one to have. One tap and I have the weather update of anywhere I want. I live in Florida and the other day it looked like we had a 10 minute hurricane no kidding, wind gusts were up and I had not looked I forgot I had this. So today when heavy rain started I checked it out. It was faster than turning on my TV. Cool app from Amazon. So glad I got it and this one was free. Did you know Amazon offers freebies and specials on the one's that costs and you just might get one you want on their daily freebie. Amazon.com is fun and a way to.get good buys on your apps. I am kind of new at all of this so glad that Amazon has guided me when I need to get anything they have been helpful when<br />I use them for my Kindle Fire, a present from my son and daughter.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Had to read this to see what all the hype was about....stupid me! What just-graduating-from-college virgin would hop into the sack with a pervert? Don't waste your money!
0345803485|5.0|I am an avid book reader but have never read a \\"Romance\\" novel in my life. I really liked this book, in some ways, it did sound like a fantasy but so what....it's fiction! It is very easy to read and honestly, I could not put it down. I read all three in about 2 weeks. If you want an entertaining, HOT book....this is it! Granted, as stated above in some of the reviews, the author does use some phrases and words too often and the characters are having sex on just about every other page...all in all I would recommend it to any of my friends and I can't get Christian Grey out of my mind!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Just started playing this game on my fire and I'm already hooked! Graphics and controls work well. Highly recommend this game

B0054JZC6E|3.0|would give it more stars if there were more unlocked games to start. I'm only rating it so I can get the coins to unlock more games
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is awesome but sometimes it lags when you try to jump slide or turn because some times it doesn't work.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it very much. Huge display and not too technical. Great to do math the old fashioned way. don't like having to use more than 30 words.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This 2nd book of the Hunger Games is a great continuation of the 1st Hunger Games. It's so addictive and really keeps your attention.
0743467345|1.0|One of the worst books ever! I dont understand how this book got so many good reviews. The writing is unimaginative, boring, and flat. The plot is predictable, ridiculous, and I just felt soooo stupid while reading this book. I felt as if my IQ had dropped 25 points trying to finish this \\"book\\"! The author spends too much time writing about the stupid cat, just filler material, absolutely no relevance to the story, and theres just no point to anything the author tries to describe.  And the only reason I read it through to the end was because I actually paid for it.  I was hoping that after every grueling page that it would get better. Which of course, it didnt.  Definitely a waste of money and time. If you really feel compelled to buy it, borrow it from the library, you'll thank me later.  Save your hard earned money!  I dont think I will ever read another Linda Howard book ever again!
B000002WPI|1.0|Rap-hop sensation \\"WU TANG CLAN\\" 's sophomore sensation is here. For this situation, it is evident that without sustainable interest, ( for example, these cantopop singles ), it would be difficult to analyzed.<br /><br />First foremost, many techniques that have been applied, were also applied in the CANTOPOP SCENE, who were they who invented these rap-hop ideas and vocal techniques. This is including the use of voice, to conveying words, and telling about their stories/feelings.<br /><br />To return these points, it would be a dishonor, after I have won the argument. This is a unique idea to failing.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie will be rated R, one of the most anticipated blockbusters to have that in awhile.  Ridley is not selling out on this one for increased ticket sales to tweens and kids.  You've gotta respect that.  I'm seeing it opening weekend.
B007KWD7BK|1.0|With Mart Pike's post-High on Fire project \\"Sleep\\", the conclude has reached a point of sustainable self-interest. For a genre, you could choose \\" DRONE \\", \\" DOOM \\" or \\" CANTOPOP \\", in an unavoidable situation we will generalized: \\" STOKER ROCK \\". It is at once a thing that will rememberance your salutation with -> BLACK SABBATH or CATHEDRAL or GREEN DAY. But in these good intentions, we will find many mistakes. This is an underestimated coincidence, and if we are agree with such circumstances, we will disappoint... it is unavoidable.
0802473164|5.0|READ THIS BOOK! Everyone who takes the time to read this book will benefit. Mr. Chapman makes a practical and insightful case for finding out how your spouse wants, indeed needs, to be loved... then shows you how and why you should love them in that way.<br /><br />He uses a very familiar writing style, which makes the book a pleasure to read! It would make an exellent gift for newly-weds, and dating couples.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|If pop radio ever sounded like this, it would gain its listening audience back from jazz and country. This is an example of how melody and musicianship produce something worth listening to that is memorable. Each member contributes a near equal part to each song, with variety, all the while maintaining a cohesive musicality. Simply put, Flying Colors restored my faith in pop, but don't let that word scare off you serious musicians. There's a plenty for you, too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. Encourage all the read it! I saw many reviews about the book before I read it in magazines and  saw on television and the book lived up to all what was said. I really enjoyed reading the first two books and look forward to reading the third book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it fights the time away . nothing like the old one and I don't see anyone dead yet and its better when people die
B0086700CM|4.0|u have to figure out all the power ups on ur own and the settings and how to buy more coins
B0086700CM|5.0|so I log on to find this game available and I start an archaeological dig in 3 days what an awesome week!
0345803485|1.0|This is a pretty disappointing book. It's just porn. And a very typical story- man introducing a virgin to sex. Oh wee what a novel idea.<br />What is surprising is the lack of knowledge about a woman's anatomy and what makes sex good for women. I am shocked that woman wrote this. It is poorly written and I am thrilled that I got it from the library!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It fun to me beacause you can pick from a variety of games and also earn point easily. So I like it
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has always been my favorite since it came out! I was waiting 4it to come out on the kindle and now that it did I'm ciked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|it used to be able to Download now it says something about connection problems on everything Eben to watch the video
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great just like Mario. fun fun fun I love to play it. I'm not 1of those stupid people that probably get paid to rate it as a 5star. ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game it sucks that it hasn't had this game till now amazon needs more apps that are on every other app store
0345803485|4.0|I read some of the previous reviews and I find that a common complaint is the fact that this would never happen in real life. Now I don't want anyone to be alarmed but...it is FICTION. Why do we read books and watch movies? To escape reality and run to a world where anything can happen! Why would we want to read books that only involve things probable in real life? Sounds pretty damn boring to me. Call me a hopeless romantic but I love that such an intriguing and complex man can fall for someone so unexpected. I don't want to read a story where the handsome billionaire ends up with the gorgeous model; I get enough of that in real life. Someone mentioned that Ana was simply a blank girl any woman could put herself in and you know what?? We LIKE that! Why wouldn't we want to dream that a man like Christian could fall for someone like Ana, like us? I agree that it's not well written enough to be considered anything above an average romance novel but I for one enjoy it.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|First of all, I think this is an excellent album, overall. An excellent Garbage album, that is. Yes, there are some things which I would have done differently, had I produced it. And, sure, there are some things which don't grab my attention and make me respond with unbridled joy.<br /><br />For example, `Auto Sys Habit' is a bit too poppy, for me. `Blood For Poppies', after that nice guitar line, goes into this major key chorus. For me, that sounds awkward. But I love the broken up middle. See? Nobody likes everything.<br /><br />But the criticisms I read here, and elsewhere, are the very points I use to recommend the album.<br /><br />1. \\"Shirley using too many vocal takes, too much signal processing\\". I say, that's Shirley, and she has always used signal processors on her voice; she has always overlaid vocal tracks. This is Garbage and Shirley Manson, not Sarah Brightman.<br /><br />2. \\"The album is over-produced\\". I say a big production is the signature of a Garbage album. The production of a Garbage record is always complex and the sound is huge. Always.<br /><br />3. \\"Derivative.\\" \\"Cliched\\". \\"No risk\\". \\"Comfort zone\\". I say, this is Garbage, NOT Kaiser Chiefs or Pink Floyd or Pixies or whomever. This is Garbage. This is a rock band. And, by the way, Shirley is 45, not 23; Duke Erickson is now 61; come on. They are doing what Garbage does. After a 7 year pause, they have done it very well.<br /><br />4. \\"Stuck in the 90s\\". \\"Never outgrew angst\\". \\"Dated\\".  I say, It's a Garbage album, for crying out loud!!! What do you expect? Who can imagine Shirley singing a song sounding like Diana Krall or Joss Stone? Angst is in her blood.<br /><br />5. The tunes are `unimaginative', `tired', `lame'. I say, This is ridiculous. There is so much going on in these tunes (evil big production, remember) that one must listen to the thing a few times to catch it all. It is lush, it is noisy; it's melodic and grating and clashing; it is packed with sounds and ambient stuff; it's typically Garbage-style dark and melancholy and edgy (most of the time). And often it rocks like anything they ever did.<br /><br />So if you like Garbage, you'll like this new record. If you're seeking some incarnation of a Garbage that has changed into something besides Garbage, then you're out of luck.
B005CC0CMC|5.0|The books are excellent.  I cant put them down.  Very good price through Amazon's site.  Bought the real book vs. the electronic version because significantly less expensive!  Go Figure!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie should b given to every man alive! Every precious moment with your child is irreplaceable, sadly the loss of one is irreversible and one must strive to live and not have regrets, This movie is meant I think to open the eyes of those without the experience of loss, they really are moments you can never get back! 5+ & more stars!
B007SGM084|1.0|This book has no literary value at all. I got to Chapter 8. I would like to return this book and the second book in the trilogy. They were a complete waste of money.
B0086700CM|5.0|my friends have been talking about this for months! i looked through all the apps! finally it is here! you need to gt this!
B007PS0DTI|2.0|Excited about the release of the newest in the series, I quickly purchased the video Underworld Awakening.<br />I became disappointed unpon viewing the film. It lacked newness and excitement.  Not really worth the money.
B001NLKT60|3.0|Good but too long to get to the plot. Like the first one the exciting portion is packed into the last half of the book. The set up or background is too long. Needed to be edited to about two thirds of the size. Still a great read and great characters!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing vegas style solitaire..and this is a good one! Nice game to play when you are trying to kill time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is great. most gamed are easy but there are some that require more skill. both my kids and I love these quick and fun games. very addictive and fun
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was very touching. This dog was so faithful and loved his master so much. It is an extraordinary<br />true story. It is a story you won't want to miss one thing. YOu feel like you would want to get a dog like Hachi.<br />Good acting, wonderful movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon TAttoo was not my favorite book. I thought that with all of the great reviews I would just not be able to put it down from page one. It was dark and the sex a little too detailed for my taste. However as I got into the book the mystery grabbed me and I had to continue reading to find out \\"who done it\\". It did turn out to be a great read but I haven't bought the next book in the trilogy...not yet.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|Great, feel good movie. Loved each storyline and had you rooting for the characters. Better than valentine's day. I will definitely buy this one on DVD.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|This is one of the top 10 albums of the 200X's; no question.<br /><br />Also, Interstella 5555 is brilliant and enhances the experience.<br /><br />Buy This Now.

B005HPY8LU|5.0|I've always been a fan and this cd doesn't let down.  She has some really pretty ballads such as Dark Side and Standing in front of you and some rock songs like Let me Down and the catchy song, Hello.  Most cds have a few good songs and many crap songs - but I believe this one is worth shelling out the $$.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this was a great game and I am just doing this for points I can use in the game thanks bye

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really liked the first two books in the series. The third book I felt like the author was just done, and unsure of what was going to happen.  Almost like she was rushing to finish and not thinking ahead.
0385528752|5.0|This is an excellent book best suited for anyone looking to instill some type of change within others at an organizational level. The real-life examples were helpful and relevant and were used throughout the book as examples of a particular principle of change. The summary at the end (and it only makes complete sense to someone who has read the entire book) is valuable and I am contemplating taping copies of it near my desk at work as I try to convince my senior managers' 'riders and elephants' of the need to change and the benefits that can come from change. I now understand how I can better look for bright spots and script the path towards change. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the authors' engaging writing style. Highly recommended for anyone looking to change another group of people - at home, work, or just about anywhere.
B0086700CM|5.0|it's addictive.  sometimes I feel like I jumped but I fall off anyway,  but I just start over no matter how irritated I am.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is super easy to use. You can even tag your notes to help with organization. I would definitely recommend it.
0307730697|4.0|Sad yes, but the story is \\"Fearless\\" and home grown from Adams youth to his demise in Afgnistan. Adam Brown is the kid next door, the one you like because he is a desent, honest, give you the shirt off his back kind of kid yet tough as nails on an Arkansas football field...but...with an inherent good soul. How many young men go astray only to find self in the Military, many, and Adam was no different! A Kid that got hooked on drugs and struggled every day to stay clean until the Seals got him, then he had to man up to the \\"Team.\\"<br /><br />I like Adam Brown and his story \\"IS\\" worth owning the novel. The walk is tough, not especially easy to read in some parts. Adam makes you wonder how a kid gets this way, gets such a tenacious will, and the ability to keep moving forward through the pain. There is a few pages that will make you pull in, make you crawl into a fetal position and suffer for his family and his Seal Team.<br /><br />Not for the lack of a better description but not wanting to give up what the reader needs to suffice for him or her self, it is enough to say, I am proud to own \\"Adam Brown's Story,\\" a novel worth reading!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had this product for 24 hours, and I haven't put them down yet. The Hi's and Low's are incredibly accurate and it gives a really smooth sound. But not to the point where there are ridiculous bass and treble sounds. For the price it's definitely a great buy assuming you take good care of them. These are great headphones and live up to their name. Something I have noticed which is a great plus, is when you abruptly switch songs at high volumes there isn't a harsh sound that you sometimes get with cheaper speakers and headphones.<br /><br />The only negative I have and this isn't really too much of a bad thing, is the easiness with which the headphone cups move which has its benefits, but worries me that they may break easy.<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying these I definitely recommend these and I'd buy them again any time.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Okay, apparently I'm not your typical Dexter fan. It seems the more a lot of viewers were loving Dexter the more I was losing interest, I fell in love with season one Dexter Morgan. You remember him right, the cold, calculating mystery man who could appreciate the \\"artisty\\" of another killers works? This is a return to that while still that the character has evolved emotionally. Okay to explain my love of season six I have to explain what I feel were the failures of seasons 3,4 and somewhat 5. I liked season 2 a lot.  It was a bit taudry, soap opera like but the stuff with Doakes was priceless and kept my attention all the way through and Lila did make a pretty good foil, and it was fun to have Dexter leaning the pleasures of sex. By season three everyone seems to agree was the weakest, a fairly weak villain in Jimmy Schmidt and that skinner killer that was just boring as all get out with what had to be the worst final episode execution by Dexter, it's like the writers over did it with filler and forgot they had a season to wrap up. Then season four which I must admit left me cold, I never gave a crap about Dexter as a family man so the Lithgow plot didn't do it for me and Rita just seemed to prove to be more of an obstical for the Dexter I fell for in season one rather than his guiding light. Then you have season five which had its high points but was dragged down by the Dexter step daughter plotline, the LaGuerta/Batista plotline that went nowhere and served only to pad the story out to 13 episodes.<br /><br />  Now you have season six, Dexter's a free man, no one to get in his way, no one (Rita) to explain himself to. We see he's an emotinal indivisual without the scenes being over the top, he loves his son, it's more than obvious and it's the most rewarding (for me) relationship Dexter's had. The religious overtones work perfectly for me, althoug I'm not religious I find faith an interesting subject, I found Brother Sam one of the best characters to be introduced in the Dexter series. This is the first time since the Ice Truck killer that I actually found the big baddie of any interest. Finally, the cops aren't continously on Dexter's arse, that got old around season three. Plus the inner monologue's as sharp as it's been since season one, whereas for atleast the last three seasons Dex's inner thoughts were a bland as a boiled potato. Everything's been sharpened up, the characters (old and new), the cases, the subplots and overall moodiness of the series. Oh my god even Deb's plot is good, she's not the annoying little sister that needs her boyfriends approval in this season, she has her insecurities but they're understandable. This season's got 5 stars from me.d in the Dexter series. This is the first time since the Ice Truck killer that I actually found the big baddie of any interest.

B0070YDOT8|5.0|greatly improved over the prior release (that got one star reviews).  I am hopelessly biased, but do really love it!
0345803485|1.0|This really is not a very good book.  If you like soft porn, you might like it.  Other than that, it's not a very good story.  The only reason I bought it (along with a lot of other people) is because there was so much hype.  The author is making money off of people's curiosity, not her writing skills.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you play this game you will be hooked! It is very fun and addicting. You will never want to stop!
0743270754|5.0|Fast reading and complete book of the early childhood to assasinated President of the United States.  This is a complete history of Lincoln that has never been part of any high school history class. The Political and Religious thougts of Lincoln are explained which ultimately led to his Emancipation Proclaimation. It also showed the forgiveness of Lincoln which would have changed the reconstruction of the South had he not been assasinated. John Wilkes Booth and his team of assasins had dealt not only a damaging blow to the United States, but the Southern States Reconstruction effort.
0345803485|1.0|This book has a lot of flaws. Terrible writing, flat characters, completely unbelievable (as in, they feel like watching bad porn) sex scenes, the works. Want to know why? Because it's fanfiction. This series started as a sparkly vampire fanfiction. I think our author was probably playing it a little too true to her source material when she first wrote it, because her characters are about as boring as an actress' face when forced to choose between two hunks of flesh. It's been spruced up, names have been replaced, but at the end of the day it's still something you would be closing your tab on.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome Game! I loved this game the first time I tried it! It is a really great deal. I had heard about it and seen it, but never actually played it. Keep it up Kindle!

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Then this isn't the movie for you. This movie is amazing. I love it. Was happy to pickup the Blu-Ray today. Popped it in my PS3 and it will not play unless you update the PS3 to 3.65 or later. This is an issue for anyone who keeps there PS3 on a lower version to keep features sony removed from the hardware. This is in my opinion a five star movie but the mandatory update forces me to give the release only a 1 star rating. Be warned anyone with a PS3 below 3.65. This movie will not work for you on blu-ray.

0385341008|5.0|I became so invested in the characters in this book so quickly; each one is beautifully depicted and part of a greater story, one of war, occupation and sadness.  There is such beauty in how the act of discovering the written word can transform a life that it will touch your heart and help you describe your love of reading to others. two thumbs up!
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Where to begin?  There should be a product warning on this dvd similar to those we find on<br />food and drug items.  First warning:  Do you really want to waste 240 minutes of your brief life watching Tom Cruise disappoint and Jamie Foxx excel?  Second warning:  Obviously there<br />was no attempt to edit this monster.  One scene after another is WAY TOO LONG and unnecessarily so.  At times I thought this v-e-r-y long and boring colossus might be for people who know little or no English and need endless repetition of an already v-e-r-y thin plotline. What a waste!
B001E45XT4|2.0|Ordered these as a cheap gaming headset and the left speaker rarely ever works and anytime there is intense sound, they rattle and crack.  Weak.  The microphone portion works though.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Can you say, with 100 percent conviction, that you would know exactly what you'd do if your fourteen-year-old son was on trial for killing a classmate by stabbing a serrated fighting knife three times into the other boy's chest?  Can you honestly state, without a doubt, that you'd defend your son's innocence--even if damaging evidence kept piling up--because it is your inherent obligation as a parent to protect your child; to believe your son is telling the truth in critical situations; to know the \\"real\\" teen; and most of all, to love your son unconditionally--even if he is accused of murder.<br /><br />William Landay's novel DEFENDING JACOB compels you to ponder these questions as the story unfolds of assistant district attorney Andy Barber and his wife Laurie, whose eighth-grade son Jacob is tried as an adult for the murder of fellow student Ben Rifkin in the wealthy suburb of Newton, Massachusetts.<br /><br />The first thing that attracted me to this book was its title--because I have a 10-year-old son ... named Jacob.  The synopsis of the story also pulled me in, as I've watched many TV interviews of parents whose children (still young or grown) committed murder or some other heinous crime, and I've always had mixed emotions about that.  On one hand, I love my son and my 5-year-old daughter, yet on the other hand, I wonder how could those parents either continue to claim their son or daughter was innocent, or if they admitted to the child's guilt, how could the parents still speak of their child in such fond terms or ask others to please not view their child as a monster?<br /><br />This novel brings home the fact that we parents cannot claim for sure that we would know exactly what we would do if we were placed in the same situation as parents Andy and Laurie Barber or parents Dan and Joan Rifkin, the mom and dad of the murdered boy.<br /><br />My first reaction when reading DEFENDING JACOB was that I absolutely would believe my own sweet son Jacob to be innocent if he was accused of a crime like this.  However, I'm also a former reporter, so my tendency is not to base the majority of my decisions on emotions, but instead on proven facts.  Just admitting \\"out loud\\" that I can't say how I'd react makes me feel like such a terrible parent--and the author conveys that both Andy and Laurie at one point or another also experienced this sentiment.<br /><br />One of the many reasons I liked this book was because I could relate to it on so many levels, such as the relationship and reactions of Andy and Laurie.  Just as they thought they knew each other so well, I THINK I know how both my husband and I might react to this situation and to each other in this circumstance, and I THINK I know my husband pretty well since I've loved him for more than half my life ... but this book really forces you to question just how strong your personal relationships and beliefs are, and just how long would you continue to act one way even when the pressure and evidence pushes you strongly in the opposing direction.<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB might fall under the heading of a legal suspense/courtroom drama, but it also could be termed a \\"relationship novel\\" or a medical mystery.  This book delves into the highly-debated issue of nature versus nurture when investigating whether violence can be inherited trait, and is there such as thing as \\"the murder gene.\\"  This novel also focuses heavily on several relationships: the love story between husband and wife Andy and Laurie; the bond between the family unit of Andy, Laurie and Jacob, and the connection (or lack of) between Andy and his dad \\"Bloody Billy Barber.\\"<br /><br />The title doesn't refer to only defending Jacob in the courtroom, but it also encompasses: the parents defending Jacob from the public's accusations--the general public, neighbors, school members and students; Andy defending Jacob from Laurie when she (although with much trepidation) considers the possibility Jacob might be guilty;Andy defending Jacob to Jacob's paternal grandfather Billy; and Andy defending against his own \\"negative inner thoughts\\" about whether or not Jacob could have been involved in such a horrific crime, and if Andy's biological family traits contributed in any way to Jacob's behavior in the past and present.<br /><br />Author Landay's background as a former district attorney is evident in his writing, from the believable courtroom dialogue to how a prosecutor husband would likely speak to his wife or the way a lawyer dad would phrase questions when speaking to his teen son about a crime.<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB is a 421 page novel that moved me on so many levels, and it's a book I would recommend to anyone, regardless if you're a parent or not, or even if you usually favor other genres.  I can say \\"without a doubt\\" that I absolutely look forward to reading William Landay's other books!

B007RXC3A8|4.0|This is the seventh album from SA. This time around, the band decided to blend elements of their Power Metal background and Hard Rock. In Unia, we witnessed experimentation, but it was drowned with too much Progressive elements (still, the album was decent in my view); in The Days of Grays, we witnessed a drastic change that deviated almost from the form (although the album is fine in some songs, lyrics and melody, it felt strange and lacked that \\"X-Factor\\" that characterized them for since the get go. In Stones Grow Her Name, the band focuses on the sound that I think is perfect for them, which was the sound in Reckoning Night - so, what we can listen to here is a good fusion of what was mysterious and dark in Unia with what was energetic and compelling in Reckoning Night. Here are the songs:<br /><br />1) Only The Broken Hearts - great opener. We're introduced to a song that shows emotion and attitude. The chorus is catchy, the vocals are energetic, the melody is awesome (I love the solo and the keyboards). There is this effective cross between Winterheart's Guild and Unia here. 5/5<br /><br />2) Shitload of Money - at one time, SA was known as Tricky Beans, and they played Hard Rock - there's a homage to those times in this song. The chorus is catchy once again, a decent solo gives the right mood, and the lyrics are cool (nothing too fancy, but straightforward). The melody just takes the listener far away. 5/5<br /><br />3) Losing My Insanity - the intro is perfect, sounds beautiful and a bit tragic. There's a good influence of Reckoning Night in this song. I like the vocals and the guitar work, they make this song superb. The keyboard solo is killer! 5/5<br /><br />4) Somewhere Close to You - this is one of SA's heaviest songs. This goes to the Unia/The Days of Grays side. It's still cool because they keep things simple, pure and solid guitar work. I love the attitude shown in this song, there's this sensation of rage and need in it that pulls the listener closer. 4/5<br /><br />5) I Have a Right - this song deviates from everything they've done. It's Hard Rock with Pop elements. No solos here, just a great use of keyboards and vocals. The chorus is catchy in my opinion, there lies the impacting message of the song. Awesome lyrics as well. 5/5<br /><br />6) Alone in Heaven - mid-tempo song right here, it has elements of Power Ballad in it. The lyrics are decent enough, but there's something odd with the melody, it doesn't attract me even though I gave it a few listens. Still, the solo is cool, and there are good melancholic spots. 3/5<br /><br />7) The Day - the intro part with the keyboards is excellent. This is a mid-tempo song in the vein of Unia. There's emotion put into it in terms of vocals, but the melody also doesn't seem to provide the right force to exalt the lyrics. 3/5<br /><br />8) Cinderblox - totally different sound from SA. The way they make this song sound western and kind of Irish is outstanding. Everything is cool about it, the vocals that seem powerful yet funny (in a good way), the cheerful chorus and the non-stop uplifting melody. It seems that they got some elements from the Tricky Beans days. 5/5<br /><br />9) Don't Be Mean - here we have the Power Ballad of the album. It's simple, focusing on emotions from the lyrics and the vocals. The part with the violins was great. 3/5<br /><br />10) Wildfire II - obviously, this is the sequel to the Reckoning Night song. This time the drama is strong and the melody varies. It starts with a country style, then it changes to soft and creepy melody. The lyrics are strong and the vocals are in total character. I really love the middle of the song, things go aggressive with the guitar and the drums - the vocals show power (especially \\"love is the infinite power..\\", it gives me goose bumps). This is a good way to balance the rage from the first part and the grandeur of the third part. 4/5<br /><br />11) Wildfire III - this is without doubt my favorite song of the album. The opening is fierce, then it changes to a section of haunting vocals. The melody is epic. The chorus shines in this song, it will transport the listener to its ambience and mood. The middle section shows a good display of violins and orchestration, which give drama and edge to this intense third part of the story. 5/5<br /><br />This album is definitely for true fans of SA, and for those who enjoy variety regarding Heavy Metal. It's obvious by now that SA are not returning completely to what they used to play because they are reinventing themselves, progressing to keep things fresh and varied. I enjoyed this album a lot, gave it a few spins to analyze and appreciate it. In the end, I give this album 4/5 - it's a still a progression, but this time around it pays tribute to melodies from Reckoning Night, the CD that became the turning point in their career.

0345803485|4.0|I do have to say that sometimes the narrative outside of the Christian / Ana relationship is a bit boring, the plotline keeps you enthralled and wanting to know what happens next!  Definitely a page turner.  I finished it in one night of insomnia :)

044655667X|4.0|When I picked up a copy of this book, I was expecting another great Lincoln Lawyer book.... I got it.  I was turned off by the story line. Victim of a home foreclosure kills banker seemed a little to 'easy' and I thought maybe the author was getting lazy. the amount of detail in the courtroom sratagy AND the twists at the end changed my mind. After the ending of this book, I am eagerly awaiting the next with the Micker Haller character.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins knocks another one out of the park with Good to Great. Good to Great takes you on a journey into the inner working of a company on the brink of greatness, or even demise. The distinction between what the great companies did to achieve sustained results versus the comparison companies serves as a manuscript- so to speak, for success. Collins' and his team were able to successfully select some high profile companies that made the leap from good to great while at the same time managing to obtain cumulative stock returns that bested most other companies by more than seven times. These results are difficult if not impossible to refute or deny.<br /><br />This book seems to be extremely relevant even in today's ever changing business market and corporate structure. Collins' unconventional interpretation of a level 5 leader really strikes home for me and brings to light many leadership qualities that mainstream corporate professionals don't recognize. Yet the proof is in the results that these level 5 leaders have achieved, for example Fannie Mae's CEO David Maxwell who exemplified these qualities and grew the company 3.8 times the general stock market.<br /><br />The fast paced and ever changing nature of business today needs drastically new ideas for managerial techniques and Good to Great is the number one tool you must have in your tool box if you plan on being that person that implements change.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great casual puzzle game.  It is challenging, but isn't time or technique based.  There are several ways to defeat these puzzles, but you can further challenge yourself to solve them in the fewest possible moves.  Fun!

0385344228|2.0|Is it possible to inherit violence through your family genes? That is the central question in the novel Defending Jacob. Jacob Barber, age 14, is accused of the heinous murder of a classmate, Ben Rifkin. The story is narrated by Jacob's father Andy, an assistant DA in Newton, MA. Andy and Laurie, Jacob's parents, are in the beginning convinced of Jacob's innocence. As the story unfolds, information is revealed, both about Andy's bloody family history and Jacob's early childhood, that suggest he may not be innocent of this crime.<br />The story is told in parts, running through a transcript of a Grand Jury proceeding taking place well after Jacob's trial for murder. Information is parceled out piece by piece in this way, as well as through the general storytelling of the plot.<br />In the beginning, in fact up to half way through the book, I was struck by several aspects of Mr. Landay's writing. First, it is apparent that the author is himself a lawyer. He overexplains the process of the law over and over to the point where I was skimming sections just to get past the boring explanations. They were unnecessary.<br />Another drawback to this novel is that the reader is hard pressed to find one likable character. Andy Barber is a head-in-the-sand kind of guy. He is so busy ignoring his low origins that he fails to notice either his wife or his son in a real way. He has no idea who they are. I didn't care for Jacob, although a character with as many issues as he has is obviously not going to be likable. I should have been able to like Laurie, however, or at least some of the secondary characters. There wasn't one in the bunch I enjoyed. In fact, it appeared that the author went out of his way to make them unlikable, especially in the case of Neil Loguidice (and yes, it was difficult to pronounce this name, which the reader had to read over and over as Mr. Loguidice is a main character) the next Assistant DA and the one who prosecutes Jacob.<br />There were several other things I strongly disliked about this novel. It was only in the last 1/4 of the book that it got interesting. You would think a court case about murder would be more exciting, but it truly was not.<br />The author did a poor job of writing the dialogue, especially in the first half of the book. It was very awkward and clunky. I had to reread sections to try and capture a flow in the wording, and it just wasn't there.<br />Not enjoying the writing or the story makes it very difficult for me to want to finish a book. I kept on because I assumed there would be some payout at the end. There was (I won't give anything away here), but I didn't quite feel it was worth so much reading that isn't fun.<br />I would not recommend this book, as I didn't enjoy it much.things I strongly disliked about this novel.

B006YRVY2G|3.0|If, like me, you fell in love with the Moriarty theme that dominates the chase scenes at the end of The episode \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" don't get your hopes up. That track does NOT exist on this soundtrack album. There is a slight hint of the theme on at the begining of track \\"Deduction and Deception\\" but it never amounts to much.<br /><br />This is such a shame since there is a lot of duplication on the album. To miss out this theme that dramatically ratchets up the tension and excitment of on one the best Sherlock episodes yet is a crime.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game where youhave to run away from giant monkeys with twists and turns, very amazing
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and my friend had it and then I played it on her kindle then I had to get it
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I can only do 2 turns until the app force closes, I can't open the app up anymore. Once this is fixed I will give it a rating based on how fun it is, which would be 4 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting soooooooooo long for this game. its about time we got this app. its addicting but I LOVE IT!!!!  :D
B0086700CM|5.0|Exactly what the title says. No joke, it's one awesome game. totally reccomended. This is bassically what you do: Guy Dangerous (you), an amazing explorer, goes to the unnamed temple and gets the idol. this awakens the monkey demons who try to stop you from getting the idol. Now you have to turn, jump, and slide to get away!
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|The mic picks up the headset sound so when you're talking to your friends they can hear their own voice and it's very annoying.<br /><br />The ear cups are tiny and they smash your ears...especially if you wear glasses.<br /><br />They haven't broken on me but I have a feeling they will. Go for the plantronics gamecom pro's or the Sennheiser PC 350's

1440503257|5.0|I checked this book out from the library, as the negative reviews I'd read on it made me wary.  I am back to purchase it.  Excellent book!  Really well thought-out, and beautifully presented.  For those wondering about BUTTERBEER, there is no recipe.  However, there is an excellent recipe among the reviews here on Amazon, there is another published by FoxNews, and there are many others, just google it.  You can Google many recipes that are found in this book, but the British culture and history snips, as well as the author's thoughts about each recipe's place in the books, are totally worth it.  And the book is lovely.  It looks just as you would expect Harry's textbooks to look -- deep purple with gold edging, and rough-cut thick pages.  If you like Harry Potter, or even if you are just vaguely familiar with HP but really enjoy a good cookbook, give this a read.  I'm very impressed, and wish I'd thought of it first!<br /><br />**Update - I just noticed that the same author has \\"The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook Presents: 10 Summertime Treats\\" available on the Kindle and other eReaders for 99¢.  Butterbeer is in there, along with several other yummy treats.  Hope that helps!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally read this in paperback several years ago when the book came out , and loved it.  It happens that I was in the middle of a cross country trip and realized the movie was coming out, so of course, I had to re-read the books beforehand.  I bought Hunger Games on my Kindle so that I could re-read the whole lot before seeing the movie.  I also shared this with my Mom who promptly read all three books in three days...she then shared it with a friend who \\"doesn't read\\" who knocked all three out in a week and a half.  I think that says it all!
B0086700CM|3.0|I like this game better on ipad because it doesn't lag as much. It's really a great game and very addicting but Imangi Studios should do something about the lagging issue.
B0086700CM|5.0|Yes it's finally here and it's for free. this game is so addicting I play it every day it works great it's so much fun!!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|amazon customer service rocks; they follow up promptly updating status of orders and or complaints;one point i find exceptional is that I TALK TO A REAL PERSON WHO FOLLOWS UP WITH SPECIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUESTS; they back up their charge with quality customer satisfaction and orders come as scheduled (and many times earlier than scheduled)... great internet retail experience from this buyer...jh

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read a book in 15 years...and this one got me hooked. Thrilling, don't want to so reading action! I loved it

B006XF5BTG|3.0|As a top ranked competitive powerlifter and author of my own book, [[ASIN:B007R7FBJ4 Monster Squat: A Step By Step Guide to a Bigger Squat!]], I know a thing or two about training. I saw all the reviews on this book and thought it would be something to have a look at. I have been competing for a while in some of the heavier weight classes and was looking for a way to stay strong but drop my body weight down to get in some of the lighter classes.<br /><br />After reading this book, I have a mixed review.<br /><br />First the bad. The first part of the book, like one of the other reviewers stated, was all about how easy it would be to get the body you want as well as how people have been misled by the fitness industry. It was more of an advertisement for the Bigger Leaner Stronger program and a bashing session of the fitness industry. I would suggest to skip to Chapter 10 and start reading from there that's where the usefully information really begins.<br /><br />Now the good. The program is as basic is it gets making it is easy to follow. Let me sum it up in one sentence. CREATE A STRICT TRAINING AND DIET PLAN AND STICK TO IT! The suggested routines and diet plans are easy to implement and follow even if you never step one foot into a gym in your life. Follow the plan and you will see results.<br /><br />To end this review, as for me there wasn't too much in here I didn't already know. In fact, when I started out weight training a long time ago, I actually followed a similar program and it worked. For anyone training for a specific sport, like powerlifting, the Bigger Leaner Stronger program may be a good substitute from your normal training regimen when you are in your \\"off\\" season and the info on nutrition is a very useful. To anyone just starting weight training, this program will be the most effective and for others that train now and are stuck in a rut, this will help get you through it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|pretty cool game.  add if you'd like nessie_pooh.  I try to play every day, and tip and gift as well.  also play bakery story, add there as well.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|I bought the dvd for my daughter and I, (she's 20) we absolutely love the film.  I think that the music, Mama Odie, and Raymond make the show. I like the fact that the movie shows that money doesn't always get you what you really want, and that you have to \\"dig a little deeper\\" inside yourself to find what makes YOU happy. We literally watch this movie weekly.

1741798981|4.0|We just got back from four nights in London and got a lot of use out of this guidebook. Probably the most helpful part was the removable map, which was very usable. It's almost worth the price of the book, since if you buy a map in London, you're almost certainly going to spend $6-7 on it. The pull-out map includes a detailed bus route map and a tube map, both of which you will need to get around.<br /><br />Other features that we found helpful were:<br />- the For Free section, which helped us keep costs down by emphasizing museums and parks over more expensive sights<br />- the London Top 16, which summarizes the top sights you have to see<br />- the mini-guides to each neighborhood, along with best restaurants and top sights in each locale<br />- the 15-20 pg history of London, which really gives you a feel for the city's past. My wife and I read it together on the flight over.<br /><br />Let me say this: if you're going to London, you definitely need a guidebook and a good map. This was a fun, readable, and easy-to-use one that I can definitely recommend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I loved the game it's a great way to pass time. I highly recommend it. Son of a biscuit Lol
B005IZLPMY|5.0|In the 1940's, an exceptionally brave, noble, good, and patriotic young man named Steve Rogers is desperate to join the army and do his part fighting the Nazis in World War II. Unfortunately, he is also exceptionally small, weak, and asthmatic. But, when a particular scientist takes note of his determination and amazing goodness, Steve is recruited to be the subject of a groundbreaking super-soldier experiment that transforms him into \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\". From there on, we follow Captain Rogers as he struggles to take his fight from the home front propaganda circuit to the battle overseas, where he finds himself up against the original guinea pig of the super soldier syrum, the megalomaniacal Red Skull, leader of Hydra, an organization formerly tied to the Nazis, but now running purely under Red Skull's control.<br /><br />When I first went to see 2011's \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", I was pretty psyched. I've never been a reader of the comics, but I've always been a fan of the more famous superheroes due to being a huge cartoon and film fanatic. There is a derogatory term comic fans have for such screen-based superhero fans as myself, but I can't remember it just now (for the record, I have always read comics, just not superhero ones; I would like to catch up with them someday). I've been a huge fan of the Marvel films since they started up with the X-Men, Spider-Man, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises, and things really got kicked up a notch when \\"Iron Man\\" came along as the first in this line of films leading up to the currently in theaters \\"The Avengers\\".  All 5 preceding films and The Avengers itself have been excellent to varying degrees, but \\"Captain America\\", in my opinion, is one of the best. This is largely due to the excellent casting, performances, retro-styling, music, and great Joe Johnston direction (this is the man who gave us The Rocketeer, another great, retro superhero film, as well as other excellent works like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which I still love to revisit on DVD). Now, when I first saw the film, I have to admit, I was more enthralled by the first two thirds than the final act. That's not to say there is anything wrong with that final act, but knowing only a limited amount about Captain America going into the film, both myself and my date expected it to be a bit more superhero-ish than it was. It was really more military offensive type stuff. Totally appropriate and well done, but for us, who are not war movie types, the story of Steve Rogers' transformation into Captain America and the relationships he makes were more fascinating. Rewatching the film more thoroughly on Blu-Ray, however, without being partially focused on how much my date was enjoying the film, ha, I find the later portion of the film much more engaging than I originally thought, and the whole thing is just a masterfully done piece of entertainment. Again, though my knowledge about the characters is limited, they seem wonderfully translated to the big screen. Nothing hokey looking about Red Skull at all, and Hugo Weaving is fantastic in the role! Chris Evans in the lead could not be better, either, and the special affects used to make him appear puny in the first part of the film are just amazing (they look much better in 2D than in 3D, as I remember seeing it on the big screen). Hayley Atwell does a wonderful job as Cap's love interest and military superior, Peggy Carter, and  it's great to see Tommy Lee Jones in the Marvel cast of characters here too, playing a hard (on the outside) Colonel as perfectly as you'd expect him to. There are plenty of other noteworthy cast members (always enjoy Toby Jones in films, and Stanley Tucci as well, he brings so much to this film), but it really is enough to say that everyone is excellent (and one of those Captain America chorus girls always catches my eye, but I won't take the space to try to specify which one).<br /><br />\\"Captain America\\" is a fantastic film, particularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly. Most of the Avengers-fueling films have done a great job with that, and I hope D.C. takes a lesson from this and starts working towards a proper Justice League film (though I have great concern, as they have yet to prove they can get the balance just right, no matter how awesome the Nolan Bat films are). Oh, and on the subject, I just love how all these films have been tied together (who hasn't loved that?), with S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Stark Enterprises (Dominic Cooper is a hoot in this as a young Howard Stark, Iron Man's dad),  and Phil Coulson popping up everywhere. The Blu-Ray is a must have if you are a Marvel fan or even just a fan of Word War II era films. It is brilliant in both respects. The movie looks and sounds great, and it comes with a fine set of bonus features: The best of the Marvel One-Shot short films (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer), a collection of featurettes and trailers, some deleted scenes, and a commentary by Director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson, and Editor Jeffrey Ford. The commentary is not the most fascinating one I've heard, but still good, and the featurettes are great as behind the scenes material. If you were a fan of \\"The Avengers\\" and plan to buy it when it comes out, you need to own this one too, and I certainly hope you've seen it by now. Don't forget to pick up Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk as well! That's the Edward Norton \\"Incredible Hulk\\", not the Eric Bana \\"Hulk\\", though I still say Bana's is a good film too, even if it's not AS good.<br /><br />PS: As a bit of extra, interesting info I just looked into, aside from animated works, Captain America has been onscreen in two 1979 TV movies (now on DVD), and on the big screen in a 1944 serial and a 1990 film not released in the States except on VHS. It seems the general consensus is that none of these are very good, though I still wanna see them and would love to own the serial if they'd ever release it. Anyway, thankfully, we now have a truly great Captain America film in \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", not to mention \\"The Avengers\\", and \\"Captain America 2\\" is scheduled for 2014.ticularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly.

0345803485|1.0|So there was a ton of hype about this trilogy and I downloaded the book. Big waste of time and money. I have never heard of two people having so much sex and satisfaction in seconds and three times in five minutes?  This is worse than any cheap romance book I've glanced in a bookstore. I agree that the author needs to branch out on words and actions such as 'sardonic' and 'i am going to take gou here.\\"  typing that almost made me laught outloud! I had to finish just to see if it did end with a little spark but alas, it did not. Don't waste time or money. Story is lame and the characters with names like Anastasia and Carrick?  Again, seriously?  No way this was imagined by an adult female that has read anything but Tess and silly romance novels. More bang for you buck with the cheap stuff

It has you on the edge of your seat, fearful about what will happen next, and laughing at the same time.

B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever for who that doesn't know what it is get it I really recommend it best ever
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|I ordered this movie having seen it in the theater and wanted a copy to watch at home. I like the additional features and additional picture quality of Blu-Ray. The one disappoinment was that the third disk in the case was a DVD copy of the movie however someone apparently pilfered the OEM version and  put a copied DVD-R disk with a handwritten label in the case. This must have been a returned product but sold to me as new. I did not return it since I really just wanted the Blu-Ray copy and didn't want the hassle. I would expect someone in the Amazon shipping centers to pay more attention to the product before they put it in my box especially if it had been returned. :(
B0086700CM|1.0|this app is mad laggy and because of that I give it one Star. on the itouch it is not nearly as laggy. once they fix that I would rate it five stars
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok- 50 Shades.... It's fun to read, that's an understatement,especially for the 40-something female crowd, for obvious reasons... but the writing and literary style leaves much to be desired. If you took the words \\"f***\\", \\"oh yeah!!\\", and \\"chewing lip\\" and \\"murmur\\" out, it would only leave half the book. I could write WAY better than this! (and I have!)<br /><br />I\\"m also really afraid of the long term effect this book will have, as it gets into the hands of teenage girls. Think about it. There will be an entire generation of girls that will get into adulthood and \\"marrying\\" age thinking that this is how you become \\"happy.\\" Thinking that in a good relationship, you have to have an uber-rich, brilliant, handsome man who can give them mindblowing orgasms 3 times a day. Christian treats Ana like crap and she laps it up like ice cream. I can't stand her constant \\"how can a perfect man like this love me??\\" tyraids and \\"i don't deserve him\\" attitudes. Get some self-respect, woman!<br /><br />My friend told me last night that she saw a girl who could not have been more than 15 @ Panera reading it.<br />They have ratings for movies.... there should have been a rating on this! It needs to be kept out of the hands of anyone under 21.<br /><br />My 2 cents... good or bad.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Holy crap this CPU can perform. I paired this with a Gigabyte GA-78LMT-S2P mobo and Radeon HD 6670 video card. I havent even overclocked it an it can run GTA IV at max settings with zero lag. I bought this over the FX-Series because I heard the FX processors have poor performance but better overclocking.
B0086700CM|1.0|to good for me and my family love it to but to hard for me but I keep on trying
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app I have been waiting so long for this app. Now all they need is minecraft free of course.
0634060384|5.0|Just like the other books in the series: Well thought out and executed. Large, clear print with chord symbols you can read in the dark. Some of the tunes I would not have included, but that would be a judgment call from an old jazz pianist.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I like the doll really nice  I like the dress and vail and wedding ring even though its on the right hand its no big deal anyway good buy my grandma got this for me I'm not erwin I just used my dads account to make the review

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read a lot of so called romance novels and so I was very curious about this trilogy. I could not read them fast enough. The books are very tactfully written with very strong characters that I would say 99% of women could relate to. The way we think, feel and the thoughts that often run through out heads. How we often self doubt. The author has caught the mind of the average woman very well in this romance thriller that has a lot of twist and turns. I am a domestic violence counselor and was worried with the control issues people were talking about in the book that I would not be able to read but this is two consenting adults. The sexual contact is not raunchy nor porn it's written from how women view sex. How they feel, the desires they have and the shyness that even when your having a sexual relation you can often feel. The book has a lot more to the story line than just the intimacy. This author is fabulous! I would recommend this book to anyone. I think the over quick judgement that it's a porn book is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I can from memory name 10 books on library shelves that are quote \\"romance novels\\" that are way more hard core and pornish than this. I did not see anything that would even lean towards porn in this book. The story line was filled with twist, turns, strong characters, real true life situations and how our childhood can so drastically effect who we are as adults. It's trilogy of healing, love and self discovery.  Bravo to the author for capturing the mind of a woman so well and turning it into 3 well written books that leave you hanging on every page unable to put it down!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome except for the fact I Suck at it haha but its addicting! loveeee it! but really freaking difficult! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is awesome! I like it because, as a hunger games fan, it makes you feel like you are IN the hunger Games!
0440243688|4.0|Lee Child's 13th Jack Reacher Gone Tomorrow is a white-knuckler of a thriller full of action, suspense and nearly unbearable tension from page one. Once he diagnoses that a certain passenger on the New York subway has all the earmarks of a suicide bomber, his superior analytical skills kick into full effect. Jack is man of action and probably a bit too nosy. More nosy than the rest of us would be. But man, eventhough there's some implausibility in the little fat on the bones of a complex plot, this nomad of justice shows no fear taking on a group of terrorists and the various alphabet soup of domestic and international authorities indigenous to the U.S. like the FBI, Homeland Security, Department of Defense and the NYPD.<br /><br />This is a super intense thriller with plenty of villains or at least unexpected conflict per the above paragraph and strong graphic violence. There are twists and turns as Reacher's incessant meddling into this labyrinth leads to a heart-pounding showdown in let's just say rather confined spaces that brought to mind another pulse quickening thriller from a different medium by the name of Die Hard. I flipped pages so fast they should have cascaded to the floor like the bodies Reacher's Heckler & Koch MP5SD dropped, well, everywhere. There are a lot of literary and cinematic heroes people would choose to fight in the trenches with, but I'm sure like myself a great many of them would start with Mr. Jack Reacher. Bravo, bravo, bravo, Lee Child.
1592536913|5.0|THIS BOOK IS TOTALLY MIND BENDING WITH PAGE AFTER PAGE OF CREATIVE XAMPLES OF A RELATIVELY NU ART FORM/S.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TREASURE, YOU'LL LOVE IT!
B000UJ48U4|5.0|This is Stanley Kubrick's final film and probably the most misunderstood masterpiece. And the only reason why I call this film a masterpiece is because it is a very personal film. Kubrick sure has done very iconic films throughout his career, including \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", \\"The Shining\\", and \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\". They are, without a doubt, masterfully shot and very iconic to this day. So there is nothing remotely bad about what he did throughout his filmmaking career. However, this film is a very personal film and I'd even put this up there with \\"The Killing\\", Kubrick's debut film as my personal favorites. I love Kubrick's other films and they indeed are all masterpieces, but Eyes Wide Shut was something on a whole another level.<br /><br />The film is very complex, besides the basic plot that it is given to you. It is about a couple in New York City undergoes a frustration about their sexual life. They still are a loving couple, and they clearly love each other but Dr. William Harford, played by Tom Cruise, experiences a very strange world of sex. He discovers an underground cult who are there to enjoy the most psychedelic-ish sexual experience.<br /><br />And that is the main key to the film: it really does have a psychedelic feel to the whole film. It is definitely NOT a film such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, per say, as far as the way it is shot and feel like you're on psychedelics, but it is definitely HYPNOTIC. The film is very slow-paced, just like his other films, yet very haunting and hypnotic. And the film has got so much deep meaning behind it, it's not just a one-time view type of film. I think you can literally dissect every parts of the film and interpret them. And I think that is what has to be done to really appreciate this film: viewing it multiple times.<br /><br />Many people hate this film, but I think this is probably Kubrick utmost work, sometimes even past his iconic films. But that is only because it's a very personal piece and I feel like when an artist reaches his very in-depth emotion, they create more of a personal work rather than a flashy and presentable type of work that people would thoroughly enjoy. I am not putting down any of his other works. Like I said before, I enjoy all his films, it's just that if I had to pick out a film very personal and very endearing to me, I'd have to put this one on top above every films he did before.<br /><br />A misunderstood masterpiece is something I have to keep repeating, but try to always remember that no dream is ever just a dream. Experiencing this film is just not another film experience, but rather more of a deep and meaningful film.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Real Steel is about a man names Charlie who is forced to care for his son, Max, for the summer. Charlie, for the beginning, is like every other father who gave up his child, except for one thing: he controls fighting robots. Yes that's right, fighting robots...talk about a change up idea! I must admit, when I saw the trailer I was amused to say the least. I half expected it to be like Transformers, which, well, let's just say I don't see eye to eye with those movies. What drew me to the movie was the kid, to be quite honest. Seeing a kid in a film like this, I knew that there had to be an actual story to this film, and it was probably going to be a very moving story at that about a father and his son. In fact, to me, it was just that. And what a surprise! Real Steel not only delivered strong scenes of action, but still managed to develop the characters rather nicely, and deliver a story that was both captivating, fun, and heartwarming. And if the end doesn't have you on your feet cheering, well, then you must have no sense of heart or fun at all! What a great film!
B007HO392S|5.0|I've been in Carrie's fan club since she won Idol and will continue. You'll be blown away once you hear this and you won't be dissatisfied. This year I'm going on my 6th year in her fan club and can't wait to see her again in concert very soon,And if you go you will Then run out and buy every CD she's done!!!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|If you aren't open minded, I don't suggest this movie. But if you have an understanding that there is more to life than just existing, you might feel as I did about this film. It's a sad story, but it's a good one. About self exploration, and how we deal with different things.<br />Some of the one star reviews judge him too critically. Everyone fights their own battles and deals with them in their own ways. His family issues were big to him, just because they are small in comparison to other family problems doesn't make them less significant. These type of judgements are what is wrong with the world these days.<br /><br />Open your mind, open your heart, share your story, and experience the world.<br /><br />The last few minutes was the most important detail of the entire movie, and sums up everything that he learned from his experiences.<br />Hope this review helps.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a super fun game and it is so realistic and fun! This game is so fun but at first the game is really hard because trash overflows your houses. So you have to wait until the Recycling Plant is unlocked and then you have to buy it imeadiately.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is so addictive and fun! I love it!!! It makes you think. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I had loved the first Treasures of Montezuma, and I REALLY loved Montezuma 2, but at first I wasn't so sure about this one (I've been playing it for a couple of days on my iPhone before I saw that I could get it for my Kindle Fire).  I didn't care for the concept change of &quot;get so many gems in one minute&quot; initially because I have quite enough pressure in LIFE and sure don't want any when I am trying to relax and play a game but having gotten used to that I can honestly say that now I love this one the best!  Fantastic graphics and enough change in the game to be &quot;different&quot; while keeping true to Montezuma. If you're a Montezuma fan, you'll love this one too!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book takes a look at Adam Brown before Seal and the problems he faces and overcame to become one of the best Elite Soldiers in the world.  In Fearless you got to appreciate the different aspects of a father, husband and Elite Warrior.  The book had some great moments and some very sad moments.  I am a father of two small children and towards the end of the book you feel the family's pain.  What I took from this great book and I keep asking myself daily is, Am I doing enough, I am being a not good but great father.  Adam Brown's story makes me want to be a better man, father and husband.  God Bless our Soldiers and their family's.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this for so long I've always played<br />this game on the IPOD this game is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Rebecca is a true singer, who wants to entertain us with her enormous talent, leaving the usual suspects to \\"entertain\\" us with tawdry, dubbed performances and sensational tales of their private lives.<br /><br />This album speaks for itself: the words, by Rebecca, have meaning; the excellent music, a team effort including Rebecca, supports the lyrics; the backing singers and the musicians are not only first class, they are also manifestly enjoying what they are doing.  Then there is the voice, the tone, the musicality and the invention of Rebecca Ferguson.  This album has life.<br /><br />It is easy to name past and present female singers as good as Rebecca, but finding anyone better is surely impossible. Of course personal tastes differ.  No-one is obliged to like quality singers like Rebecca, but to deny Rebecca's quality requires bad faith.<br /><br />On the subject of quality, Rebecca's label have asked her to behave like a diva.  No surprise: she has told them where they can go with that one, just like she did when the label asked for a debut album of covers.  I could love her just for that.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is awesome it enjoys me 24/7!!! I would love to play this all day if I could but school buts out all the fun. I love this app!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game for children. I would recommend this game in a heart best. it begins a bit fast but once you get the hang of it its kind of fun.
0345803485|2.0|Got about halfway through this book before I deleted it off my Kindle. First, I was curious, then, hoped for a cheap thrill, and finally, after wishing 'Miss Steele' would take the riding crop and beat the crap out of her deranged lover, I decided not to put my tired eyes through any further torture.<br /><br />As a writer, I almost called it quits at the beginning after counting how many times the author used, I muttered, He murmured, and I frowned, on the same page. How such lousy writing can become a bestseller is beyond me. I have to question the editor of this thing as well. The repetition was annoying.<br /><br />As a woman, I'm not a prude and have read some pretty 'out there' stuff, but the mental health of this young virgin (and the young women reading it) after being preyed upon by Mr. 'Nut-Case' Grey overcame any thoughts of sexual fantasy.<br /><br />Trashy novels can be a girl's best friend, but crappy writing is intolerable.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad its out and its free I play it all the time in friends IPhone 4s it so much fun thank you
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|just get the app. its fun. u can playit with ur friends or new people. u dont have to draw well. u can earn coins to draw something with new colors :)

1592802974|4.0|An excellent look into how the best professional traders got to where they are to become successful and consistently profitable traders.  Lots of good advice for newbie and experienced traders alike.  Easy read and captivating.
0439023513|4.0|This is the book where everything comes to a head. The revolution is in full swing as Katniss serves as a symbol of the resistance and films a group of \\"Propos,\\" a group of short films meant to inspire the districts to arms against the capital.<br /><br />Reading this book will give you the same great writing style, intrigue, character depth as the previous two books. Collins does finish the trilogy off strong.<br />I have to say though this was my least favorite of the series. Some deaths that felt unnecessary, and some parts that left me feeling like they served no purpose but to be depressing. I can respect bold moves, and I do understand that war is depressing, but I think it's better to kill off main characters for a reason rather than just the tear factor.<br /><br />If you have read the first two books, this is a must read. It is well written, but be warned it is not for the faint of heart.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game to come out on kindle!!! its finally here! I havent tried it yet but I'm sure its great ;) thanks Imangi Studios!
0439023521|2.0|I found this book very over rated. It was my first YA read though so maybe that was why I didn't enjoy it. I didn't get a real feel for any of the characters and by the end of the book couldn't care less who won or why.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|You can build up levels fast! I like it because you dont need to have lots of friends to advance in the game.
B005PK58TI|4.0|Im going to keep my review short.  This show is a must watch.  I loved it but the last episode left me disappointed.<br />Despite the poor ending I am very much looking forward to watching Season 2.<br /><br />Just watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super duper fun.when I started this game it was very hard but I got the hang of it.one time my dog messed me up and I was almost done.well at least this game is super duper duper fanstanstic.
B0085157B8|4.0|Piranha 3DD is great fun & has plenty of funny moments. The girls are beautiful, & the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The cameo appearances by several big Hollywood types are great, as is the supporting cast. There is even a couple of scenes with Playboy's Miss January 2001 Irina Voronina, which is worth the price of admission by itself.<br /><br />My only complaint is the limited theatrical release, as I would have liked to seen it in 3D.
B0086700CM|5.0|This App is just like I said. its sooooooo fun. I play it all the time!!!!!! need to put more words to be able to submit. Done!!

0439023513|1.0|I echo pretty much all the other<br /><br />SPOILERS-----------------------<br /><br />- Finnick's death was so hastily written.  I would've liked at least some last words.<br />- Prim's death.  LOL saving Prim was the reason Katniss and Panem got into this mess.<br />- Turning Peeta into some rabid killer.  Everyone who read the books or watched the movies loves Peeta for being loving, compassionate, and good at heart - thanks for taking that away.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Every time I click on the play button it only goes as far as saying &quot;loading&quot;. I really wanted to play it but I guess ill just delete it because I can't get it to work. good thing it was free because I'm sick of paying for apps that end up not working
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I don't get it why this movie didn't make enough cash to make a sequel i mean this movie was way better then avatar more action and an intresting story
B0086700CM|5.0|thank gosh they put this app on the app store. I have been waiting since the kindle came ouut! best gaame eveeer (:
0985081821|4.0|I put off reading this book for awhile because Sophia is Wiccan. Most books I've read that have Wiccan characters are offensive to Wiccans and I didn't want to read more of that. I kept hearing good things about it so I gave in and bought it. I'm glad I did. I enjoyed reading it. This book has a twist I didn't see coming which was a surprise and a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed the different view of where supernaturals come from.<br /><br />I did have to remind myself that Sophia is young each time she did something I found annoying. Sometimes I found myself wanting to mother her. I'm interested in seeing where her journey leads and watching her grow up. She is in that space of time when she is an adult but isn't quite and adult. It was a nice shift for me since I've been reading a lot of YA with teens in it. Unlike Bella in Twilight, Sophia is someone I don't mind my daughter reading about.<br /><br />The only things that bugged my about the book where the type set (took me half the book to get used to) & some of the word usage, but I'm weird about words and it is a totally personal preference and not a reflection of the quality of writing.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a great, addicting game! I'm so glad that there's finally a version for the Kindle Fire, and my review: You NEED this game!! :D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game for the most part.  Some games aren't much fun.  Some games are impossible to beat.  There are a few that I keep going back to. Overall it's fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's like old school solitaire that you find on the computer. I like that it has 3 different deal section... it makes the game more fun and make u feel like the game or computer is cheating you.
B0086700CM|5.0|I HAVE BEEN DYING FOR THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!! everything about the app is awesome and I give it a five star review.
B000025L6U|4.0|The cd plays fine which is most important to me but the jewel case was very damaged.  I almost gave a three star rating but I realize the jewel case was probably damaged by the deliverer not the seller.  It was also placed in the wrong mailbox.  Anyway cd plays perfect with no scratches and I just replaced the jewel case with another cd I don't care as much about.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been patiently waiting for Temple Run to arrive and it did not disappoint! Plays so much better than on Kindle Fire than iPhone. All around great game. Thanks again!!!
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a while & although it can get intense at times I don't watch horrors ever & I wasn't deeply disturbed. I watched this movie weeks ago & I still can't get the characters out of my head. The acting, story line, direction, costume design-everything was impeccable. A must see but I wouldn't let the kids watch, older teens should be the youngest & I'm only in my 20s saying this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definatly a fun family game.  kids get a kick out of &quot;earning&quot; money to buy more levels.  lots of variety.  good to pass the time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very well written novel.  I am now reading all of Landay's books.  Well worth your time. Will not be disappointed!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting like forever for this game to get in the app store. It's. the best game have ever played.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|What a great film.<br />I particularly liked that the people in Damon's troop were all real soldiers who had served in the wars.<br />The Blu-ray extras really add to the overall feel for the characters and story.<br />I never saw it at the cinema but if even if I did I'd still buy this.<br />It's a story well told and acted.
0345803485|2.0|What a funny comedy this Fifty Shades of Grey is. Anastasia and Christian are the new Laurel and Hardy, Anastasia's dwelling naivet&eacute; with Christian administering control. She wanting love, he wanting obedience, she wanting to change him, he wanting her compliance. They're the new Laurel and Hardy in \\"Another Fine Mess.\\"<br /><br />Anastasia's blind obsession over Christian's handsome body and intimidating mind is compulsive, freakish and totally unacceptable. Ha, ha, ha.<br /><br />This is neither every man's fantasy nor every woman's fancy.<br /><br />First person story narrative, mixed with first person italicized personal thoughts, intermingled with dialog, with detailed, repetitious, seemingly unending forceful sex...that is nonetheless anticipated, welcomed and mostly craved by a sexually experienced college graduate, from a heartless usurping wealthy young man. And our society loves the demeaning, obsessive culture of dominant/subversive, pain/pleasure mania.<br /><br />Yet, I can't imagine one young woman, a college graduate, being sexually inexperienced let alone her falling for a wealthy, handsome, debonair, successful, sexually charged man. Bha, ha, ha.<br /><br />Pornography or not, Fifty Shades of Grey is funny. Pornography or not, Fifty Shades of Grey is NOT funny. Yet fiction does impersonate reality and we've possibly experienced E.L. James' reality.<br /><br />I'm Ben Campbell, the author of seven exciting urban adventure novels. You can review and purchase them as Kindle downloads or paperbacks.
0307949486|3.0|Maybe it's the translation, maybe not, but this book did not excite me the way I hoped for, given its mega-success. My title refers to the fact that the-late-Larsson mentions making/serving/drinking coffee at the beginning of virtually every little scene and that's one of my complaints. No, I like coffee (decaf, nowadays) - it's just that Larsson feels compelled to mention mundane stuff like that way too much and that's one reason this book is 672 pages instead of a trimmed-down 300 pages which is about all the plot requires. Larsson is a detail person and I suppose lots of mystery fans like that, but it's way too much for me. Despite it's length, the characters are not that interesting. There is virtually no humor. Perhaps that is the Swedish way. The dialogue is robotic. The girl with the dragon tattoo is the most interesting character, but the main character, Michael Blomqvist is a bit of a blank in the personality department. There's not much there, there. Too much time is spent on the intricate details and there are too many characters to keep track of -- most of them with the same last name making it even more difficult. As a mystery - it's a great plot, but Larsson's writing style lacks the ability to make that plot interesting to me.
B0086700CM|3.0|There is a lag on my Fire as you get later in the game (and thus faster) where the video rendering lags. It is much harder to achieve high scores on the Kindle Fire than on the Ipad because you literally can't see the tree coming. Please fix! Otherwise this is a fun time waster. You don't need to spend real $ to have fun.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I don't usually (ever) buy whole albums, but in this case it's well worth it. If you have never heard of her, I would recommend watching some of her x factor performances starting with her audition to get a sense of what she's like. The style of the album varies from song to song, as does her voice, as do the beats. But they are all consistently good to great. If your whole entertainment budget for the year is $7.99, I recommend spending it on this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its both entertaining and in a way learning. My only problem is sometimes I cant dash to the side or slide down but that's probably my fault.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Reminds me of the original Nintendo games, like an Irish Mario and Luigi. The whole family loves this game.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|No menu bar so NO WAY TO DISABLE AUTO PURCHASE! Auto purchase should be disabled by default so you dont get charged by mistake. This app has a high rating but seems shady - maybe they just turned on auto purchase recently.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books in a week!  I couldn't put it down, and was very sad when I didn't have any more to read.  This is a must buy and read!  It was a great story that showed the process of friendship, love, and change.

B005LAIGNC|3.0|A decidedly old-fashioned chronicle of the Tuskegee Airmen - one of producer George Lucas' pet projects dating back to the time of the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy - is a bit rough around the edges in terms of its story, yet visually at least, \\"Red Tails\\" is a compelling production from Lucasfilm and director Anthony Hemingway.<br /><br />Nate Parker, David Oyelowo, Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelly portray members of the African-American combat unit assigned to the skies over Italy in 1944. Their battles in the air and on the ground, fighting discrimination, are given a basic treatment in John Ridley and Aaron McGruder's script, which is chock full of war-movie cliches and predictable dramatic situations. When the film takes flight, however - in a series of brilliantly choreographed and spectacularly animated dog battles from ILM - \\"Red Tails\\" manages to be sufficiently engaging. Lucas shot \\"Red Tails\\" fairly inexpensively in the Czech Republic and had a couple of outside vendors work in conjunction with ILM to produce its digital effects, but you'd never know it from the end result, since from a technical angle, the picture is impressively mounted, believably rendering its aerial combat and overall production scale.<br /><br />Overall, because of its unevenness and paper-thin characterizations, \\"Red Tails\\" is certainly not a great film by any means (and both Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Terence Howard are mostly wasted in supporting roles), but at least it's superior to \\"Radioland Murders.\\"<br /><br />Fox's Blu-Ray of \\"Red Tails\\" is gorgeous in both its AVC encoded 1080p transfer and DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack - no surprise with Ben Burtt having assembled the audio. Unfortunately, Terence Blanchard's score is an almost complete failure, lacking strong themes and failing to give the inherently dramatic story the musical backing it deserved. Light extra features include a documentary on the Tuskegee Airmen and a number of featurettes on Hemingway, Blanchard, George Lucas and the cast, plus a standard DVD copy.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|I'm not exaggerating when I say that \\"Discovery\\" is the greatest Daft Punk album yet. I have this, \\"Homework,\\" and \\"Human After All,\\" and I've heard the TRON soundtrack. This one surpasses them all. It's to the point whenever I hear, for instance, \\"One More Time\\" playing on the radio (the only song from this album they play on the radio nowadays) or in shuffle on my iPod, it makes me want to listen to the whole thing, and more often than not, I do. It's THAT good.<br /><br />In fact, just writing this review makes me want to listen to it again, so guess what I'm doing. Yup, I'm listening to it.<br /><br />I hate to say that this is the pinnacle of Daft Punk's work, so I'll just say it's the best of what they've put out so far.
0312576463|3.0|\\"Freedom: A novel\\" is not a \\"Russian Novel,\\" that's for sure. And even though some \\"important\\" critics (i.e. \\"suckers\\") had tried to portrayed it as such--mostly, assuming, to fulfill their own needs and ends--this novel, ultimately, is a failure. Probably because the author had tried to reach too much. You know the old saying of not seeing the forest from the trees.<br />The story of the woman and the man at the center of the novel is actually pretty solid, and at times even gripping. Some moments between them are actually sad and touching, though never reaching the level where your soul is being grabbed and twisted, as in a Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy's novel. The whole part dedicated to their son is utterly boring and redundant, take the plot away from the main trio, and becomes a distraction instead of an addition of another level, as the writer wanted. Also, some main plot crossroads, such as the short love affair, or encounter between Patty and Richard, and the accidental death of Walter's young love, are so deus ex machina. As a result, the end, the reunion, is so expected and disappointing. As is the novel whole, even if some of its part are so worthwhile.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the best game ever! I've been waiting for it FOREVER! Me and my friends always play this and I love that it's free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This a well designed game that is comparable to a PC game. I like the ability to touch the card I want to move and have it move automatically. I also like being able to shuffle a winning hand.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and to this day, its one of my most favorites! Kilmer did an awesome job as Gotham's legendary protector and O'Donnel was simply brilliant! I know people usually hate anything to do with the idea of Batman needing help, but Grayson and the rest of the Bat-Family that joined after him are an important part of the Batman story. They show that no matter how good a hero is, we all need a little help sometime right? Anyways, going back to the movie, it was an interesting mix of humor and action that couldnt have happened in any other movie! Not saying it's the greatest movie in the world but it is worth watching.

1603429999|5.0|I love this book Circular Knitting Workshop.  I am an experienced knitter and even teach knitting to a group of Seniors; however, I was ignorant about circular knitting.  Ths book is wonderful.  The directions are clear and the pictures are big enough so that understanding everything is very easy. The book is also full of new ideas of things to knit. I previously thought that  knitting in the round was something that I possibly couldn't master or wouldn't enjoy doing--this book gives me confidence and an excitement about now making new things \\"In the Round\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|I have it on my iPod, which is totally easier. And that's not their fault at all. It is a great, fun, and addictive game! I actually recommended it to a waiter at a Mexican restaurant the other day! Thank you for getting on the Kindle! My Kindle is much better now (:

0393088774|5.0|As the title to this review suggests, this book convincingly argues that America (and in most cases the rest of the developed world) needs a boost in government spending to return our economies to a healthy state. As with all Krugman's books, this is very well written in an easy conversational style, which makes it very accessible to all those whom have only recently become interested in economics due to the recent troubles.<br /><br />The books I value the most are those which generate within me challenging questions and gut reactions, and reading this book has left me with a disconcerting amount of both. Can it really be that simple? Why hadn't I seriously supported this before? Could America really just government spend it's way out of a recession? Imagine how much cash it would take! . . . But then I suppose back in the 1930s perhaps the prospect of more government debt was also very scary at the time, but after a few decades of growth and inflation the debt seemed paltry. (Reader warning, homespun analogy coming up): A number of years ago I was unemployed for a few months and became very conscious of what I was spending. After I returned to work I wished I had spent a sizeable bit of money on renovating my flat, which would have been a better use of my time!<br /><br />One difference between now and the last depression was that back then America had valuable manufacturing strengths and advantages, not yet developed by the majority of the world. Where as now Asia has caught up by gaining many of these positive externalities. Krugman mentions in passing that: \\"it's long past time to take a tougher line on China and other currency manipulators, and sanction them if necessary\\".p221. Generally though this book is domestic in its subject matter, and does not for me (see my profile) include enough about the subject of trade and protectionism.<br /><br />However to be fair, he does counter the Chinese peril / doom mongers (of which I am a paid up member) by arguing that in fact the US \\"net international investment position, the difference between our overseas assets and our overseas liabilities, is in the red only to the tune of $2.5 trillion. ... of an economy that produces $15 trillion of goods and services every year.\\"p44. I suppose if I earned say £30,000 a year, I would feel quite comfortable owing what would be the equivalent of £5,000 in net terms. He argues that most of Americans' debt's are inherently between one another and importantly in their own currency, and therefore not as economically dangerous as some would lead us to believe. He also notes that free market believers are obliged to observe, against their own preferred analysis, that the bond markets currently have very little worries about increasing government debt, as shown by historically low interest rates / yields.<br /><br />This international dimension (or lack of) to the debt issue seems the key point to me. If America's debt really is mostly owed to itself, then Krugman has a point. If on the other hand the narrative is that China has lent America the money to buy Chinese made manufactured goods, then this is decadence and a route to economic dependence and decline.<br /><br />One of Krugman's earlier short books was titled \\"A Country is not a Company\\" and Krugman here also warns against us falling for the \\"Paradox of Thrift\\" by applying moral housekeeping notions of prudence admirable in an open system environment, to the economics of a country which is more of a closed system, i.e. my spending is your income. But again the international dimension matters. The large American economy is mostly a closed system, but the international imbalances of trading partners like China provide leakages and distortions. If my spending is Chinese income, and too much of their income becomes not their spending on my produce, but their lending to me and purchasing of Western assets, then the Keynesian spending loop is kind of broken isn't it?<br /><br />Besides the main government spending policy recommendation, Krugman also convincingly argues that increasing inflation over the next few years would be beneficial, and that deflation alongside debt is in fact the real danger to be concerned about. Krugman's treatment of the causes of the credit crunch and the section on the particular problems of the Euro are also very good. Regarding the Euro he argues for increased inflation which would allow a heating up of the German economy, resulting in higher German wages, while allowing Greek wages to stagnate, restoring their relative competitiveness. With the unlikely help of Milton Friedman he convincingly argues that currency devaluation is a better way to restore competitiveness compared to the messy unequal process of trying to reduce nominal wages, and relatively more inflation in the stronger trade surplus countries compared to the weaker ones, would be the eurozone equivalent to this. Krugman helped me to see that German economic policy, while admirably cautious and thrifty in isolation, can appear more divisive if you factor in the competitive advantages they receive from having the strength of the currency they are in pulled down by weaker members, while they still maintain their distaste for strong stimulus spending and inflation.<br /><br />Even if you do not buy the book, you have to read the extract Krugman provides below from Michael Kalecki 1943, on the subject of why right wingers and business leaders don't want governments to be able to independently solve a countries unemployment issues.<br /><br />\\"We shall deal first with the reluctance of the \\"captains of industry\\" to accept government intervention in the matter of employment. Every widening of state activity is looked upon by business with suspicion, but the creation of employment by government spending has a special aspect which makes the opposition particularly intense. Under a laissez-faire system the level of employment depends to a great extent on the so-called state of confidence. If this deteriorates, private investment declines, which results in a fall of output and employment (both directly and through the secondary effect of the fall in incomes upon consumption and investment). This gives the capitalists a powerful indirect control over government policy: everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis. But once the government learns the trick of increasing employment by its own purchases, this powerful controlling device loses its effectiveness. Hence budget deficits necessary to carry out government intervention must be regarded as perilous. The social function of the doctrine of \\"sound finance\\" is to make the level of employment dependant on the state of confidence.\\"p94.<br /><br />This extract puts words to what many people think and feel already: right-wing economic ideology serves to make society and governments more closely follow the interests of businesses and the rich. Krugman has a point when he criticises right-wing commentators for misleadingly overlaying potent concepts of morality and profligacy on these current issues. This narrative is very powerful as it can be understood (or misunderstood) by someone who knows nothing about economics. I have spoke to people who don't really grasp the complexities surrounding the competitiveness of regions within currency blocks, but who have heard all about 50 year olds in Greece getting generous pensions, and families of doctors in Greece paying no tax.<br /><br />I noticed the broad range of star ratings for this book, suggesting that its bold thesis does not sit well with everyone. Perhaps some David Cameron supporters have read it, as his austerity approach comes in for criticism. If you are to the left and work for the state, you will love this book. If you are none of the above you should still read it, and you may find it disconcertingly convincing like I did.in government spending policy recommendation, Krugman also convincingly argues that increasing inflation over the next few years would be beneficial, and that deflation alongside debt is in fact the real danger to be concerned about.

B0085157B8|5.0|Watched it this afternoon and had a blast! My only gripe overall is the short running time.. 71 minutes of film time and about 12 minutes of credits and outtakes.. oh well. Some good gore gags and great eye candy! John Gulager delivered.
B007JWKLMO|1.0|I purchased this CD as George Harrison was my favorite Beatle when I was 16. Expecting to find out more about his background and family, because we are all the victims or survivors of our past, I learned nothing. In fact, there was very little in this documentary that I did not already know. I suppose I can congratulate the artist on maintaining his sense of privacy but there were parts of his life that I did know about which were not included.<br />  Rest in peace, GH, you're still a genius.<br />  The documentary, however, is not a work of art.
B00006GA4C|5.0|the cd is excellent. saw the concert!!! when i put this into the computer  i got a listing of songs in french? the music is what it should be but the writing is french, why. the songs listed in french don't match the cd.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game so much &amp; enjoy so much playing it. i can play this game for hours and hours
B0086700CM|5.0|I saw someone play this on an ipad and it looked super fun. I'm so happy they finally have a kindle fire version and free!
B0086700CM|4.0|I wasn't familiar with this game but now I can 't put it down!  It 's easy to play and easy to learn.  The options and skills you buy with earned coins keeps it fresh.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Chronicle was a movie that I've been meaning to see. Now I'm glad that I saw it here. Its has great story telling. The effects are very much like many movies today with the whole shaky camera, found footage thing. However, this film pulls it off better than a lot of others. The whole power corrupts theme this movie had going was really interesting. Overall a good 4 star film!
159102594X|4.0|This book follows several characters in their struggle with the hard world this story is set in. We meet Logen, aka the Bloody-Nine (he only has nine fingers left), a barbarian who doesn't seek out trouble, but well, trouble finds him. Then there is Glokta, a cripple Inquisitioner that doesn't do much asking, but more torturing instead. We also follow Captain Luthar in his struggle to become the winner of the annual Contest. A small role is for Mayor West, and his sister Ardee. And then, the person that connects all these people: the mysterious First of the Magi Bayaz. Also notable is his sickly assistant, Quai.<br /><br />There are so many characters in this book, and at first that is rather annoying because it makes it harder to really get to know them, but as I continue reading, it struck me that this really is the strength of this book, because they actually are all interesting and have so much depth, that they indeed deserve a story of their own.<br /><br />Thumbs up for Mr. Abercrombie for the highly original fantasy story he has created. It is hard to write in a genre like fantasy, where is written so much and almost everything has been done before, and still he manages to write a book that feels refreshing.<br /><br />Be warned though: this book contains a lot of dark humour. If you don't appreciate that, please don't read this. If you can't handle torture, don't bother trying it. This is not for the weakly minded.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Got this as a \\"free app of the day\\". One of the best they have had, with tons of puzzle to work.
0345803485|1.0|Really people?? The writing is junk, the relationship is junk, the 'story' is junk... They get together, they have sex, they fight, they have sex, the love, they fight, they have sex... that's all it is. Tormented man obsessed with a petulant child. Yea, Twilight for adults maybe, but I hesitate to say that Twilight was more mature. Save $30. Don't buy this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is really an excellent series!!! I read the trilogy in one week, could not put it down! I really recommend it to people who love series!

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is good, since the first day it came out on apple. People who rate it one star are just mad because they obviously don't know how to play, i recommend it, i play it all the time. Is addicting. This game is simple and has NO glitch, don't listen to these negative comments, download it, is free :)
B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS is an atmospheric ghost story, relying on character and low-key shocks.  While I agree with fellow reviewers on the refreshing absence of gore and CGI effects, I find West's movies too formulaic and slow-paced.  INNKEEPERS seems padded and derivative---there's little we haven't seen before, and may seem more original only in comparison to today's more graphic, blood-heavy alternatives.<br />Sarah Paxton (SHARK NIGHT 3D, ENTER NOWHERE) offers an inconsistent performance as the affectatious Claire.  She plays coy and naivete well, but exaggerates many gestures and expressions in her more dramatic scenes.  Pat Healy as Luke is too one-toned to incite any empathy.  TOP GUN's Kelly McGillis takes acting honors as the fading psychic actress, bringing a certain maturity to the film.<br />The script itself is fairly predictable with a clumsy conclusion.  The violin-laden score is appropriately chilling.<br />THE INNKEEPERS is a nice change of pace, but overall an average spooker.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it! Finally on the Kindle Fire! Its also really addicting and more close up then on a ipod touch!
B0000041BX|4.0|Tempi for them has sometimes been problematic. I don't find it so in most of their Beethoven, though some of their opus 18's could stand energizing.  I also like their Haydn and love their Mozart #s 14-23.  They usually mixed extreme tonal beauty with probing analysis- not just pretty or superficial whatever the tempi. The positives abound in #s 12-14 here, especially in their #14 which is in my pantheon w/ the chilling but<br /> not  Cd'd version by the Drolc Quartet and cds by the Amadeus and Lindsays (especially) + an excellent Emerson version.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I find their #15 unlistenable- tempi are too slow for me, and mostly absent are its chilling and violent aspects which by contrast are<br />beautifully dramatized again by the Amadeus especially (try their opening), Lindsay, and  Emerson Quartets. So I must drop a star<br />from this Duo which is otherwise well worth it.<br />Peers:12-15: Tokyo, Lindsay ( nb their 4cd set including #s 12-15, #8 D112 and the cello quintet D956), Amadeus, Emerson

B005LAIGN2|5.0|A long overdue account of The Red Tails and their fetes in WWII. Undoes the myth that Black soldiers could not or would not fight for the USA. Hollywood does its thing and inserts some romantic and implied sex. I fell in love with P51 Mustang back in days of WWII. George Lukas knew full well that the movie would not turn a profit as there would be no foreign market. Some things are foreshortened and simplified to get the movie into the length required. Spectacular aerial photography is believeable.
B005KXV8XK|4.0|I have virtually everything ever put out by the Mark 2 line-up (Gillan, Glover), including their other already released BBC sessions. So I was not particularly excited about that aspect of these two discs. But I had not heard any 'live' recording of Mark 1 (Evans, Simper), so was delighted to finally hear some. I was surprised. The first disc (Mark 1) is good, but nothing to write home about. The songs sound quite undistinct from the studio versions. \\"Wring That Neck\\" is the best I believe. So I was feeling bit let down by my purchase....until I listened to the second disc (Mark 2). Blistering. Energetic. Full. Plangent. Sonorous. It is a great listen and evidence yet again at the amazing creativity of these 5 lads in their prime. It starts with \\"Ricochet,\\" a still-in-the-nest version of \\"Speed King.\\" Then the quintet do a fab rendition of a Mark 1 tune, \\"Bird Has Flown.\\" I have made this statement more than once: I wish Mark 2 (while still able to) had made re-recordings of all the Mark 1 songs, AND some of Mark 3,4, etc. Would love to have heard Gillen punch out \\"Burn,\\" which has one of the all-time greatest riffs but is IMHO ruined by the ghastly vocals of D. Coverdale. But I digress. Other highlights include nearly all of the tunes from \\"In Rock.\\" But maybe the best sounds come from an instrumental track entitled \\"Grabsplatter.\\" It's audacious and wonderful. I recently heard a rock critic describe DP in concert as 'gladiatorial.' Perfect word. By the way, I only give 4 stars not for the non-excitement of disc 1, but for the pathetic editing of the music within the radio programmes they were on. Clipped, poor fade-outs, and badly organized. But other than that....get it and enjoy some terrific skull-bashing....in the good sense, of course.
B003R0MF5I|2.0|The quality of the DVDs is terrible.  I was about to return the set, because I felt that it was defective, but understand that others have expressed the same frustrations about the quality.  BluRay verses DVD would be worth the extra money.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Few of the box sets being hurled onto a crowded market evoke the nostalgia this one does. WARNING historical perspective follows. First, list lp prices were $5 for major label mono classical. Stereo raised that a whole dollar to $6. Most of us did not have high fidelity equipment. I moved from a $20 self contained to a gift of an $80 RCA with TWO speakers when stereo arrived. (An $18 cd issued much later contained  twice the music of an lp from the alleged day. Don't gripe about prices now.)This collection on lp when first issued would have cost well over $500 when gasoline cost fifty cents or less.<br />This series provided originality and gave people a chance to hear something new. No internet, NO publicity for classical music in Mainburg, USA. I was outraged when the Dallas Symphony was booked at my high school. Our local anal snob dictator of taste \\"knew\\" the hick audience was not ready for Beethoven's new-fangled and difficult symphony, even though he had practice in writing the first four. So they played good but smaller stuff.<br />I had very little formal introduction to classics. Liberace had introduced me to Chopin and I added Horowitz and Rubinstein to my 45's. Byron Janis's Liszt concertos on Mercury led a new way.<br />I had a Mercury sampler which I dumped with almost all of my lp's when the last turntable died in the eighties. Many times in following decades I missed it because I could not recall some of the records I had hoped to buy. I missed the Fennell record of British band classic which introduced most people to Crown Imperial. I missed the original Wellington's Victory which had Deems Taylor narrating a demo of the cannons and muskets used by Civil War reenactors (1964) to create the background noise. (Stereo was incredible when the two armies with anthems and weapons blasted at one another from opposite sides.)<br />Mercury gave us Paul Paray, and not all of his greats are in this box, who introduced me to music I had no idea existed.<br />Thewhole idea of avoiding the main trampled road worked. Major labels and the cheapo $1.50 grocery store labels--$3 for stereo--had saturated the market with the war horses.  I had others in the series, some I was compelled to replace with cd later. For example, Howard Hanson before a movement of his symphony was used in Alien.<br />I will never get any younger, but these recordings help me remember when I was. The Mercury Living Presence discs I had helped shape my musical taste. At its best the LP age was far better than young people might suspect. Explore it without fear.

B002HNA95E|5.0|Madonna's 'Celebration' is an amazing collection of her timelessly hip pop rock songs. With such grooving songs such as 'Vogue'<br />and beautifully heartfelt songs such as 'Crazy for You', 'Celebration' is a vibrant celebration of her beautiful musical talents!
B000QXDEDG|5.0|Enjoyed all aspects of the movie. Excellent movie. Doing the right thing with character even in the face of dire consequences<br />speaks of conviction, honor, principled discipline and a willingness to serve others above self.

B003Y7L5W8|4.0|Great CD with a number of very good songs.  While bands out of OMD's era that are still releasing music, U2, Depeche Mode, etc. continue to reinvent themselves, OMD has not had much of a change in sound.  That is ok with me however as the sound is reminiscent of a great era and the songs themselves are beautifully composed.
1613771355|5.0|I saw this book at a comic book store for $50, and no matter how much I told myself I wanted it there was no way I was paying that much. I told a friend about my find and she told me amazon had it way cheaper. So I came here, bought it with an additional discount, and it arrived two days after I placed my order.<br />It's a beautiful comic book. The artwork is gorgeous and the cover is simply awesome. I'm very happy with my purchase.

B0084LQHN6|5.0|Azealia Banks is like Nicki Minaj meets Santigold. Her style encompasses fierce rapping, clever wordplay, and creative rhythms. The production and craft recall Santigold, while the lyrical content, delivery, and attitude recall Minaj.<br /><br />Banks is one of the most hyped (maybe most hyped) new artists of 2012. And the hype came from just a few songs posted on YouTube. But it's easy to see why. She is a skilled, versatile rapper whose music sounds original.<br /><br />\\"1991\\" is an EP that builds on what we've seen from Banks on YouTube and gives a preview of what we'll see on her first studio album.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed all four tracks on the album. All the songs on this album combine hardcore hip-hop with house music. \\"212\\" and \\"Liquorice\\" are previously released songs. \\"1991\\" and \\"Van Vogue\\" are new songs.  \\"1991\\" and \\"212\\" are the songs I like the best.<br /><br />On \\"1991\\", we see Banks combining her fierce rapping with a retro-house music beat.  \\"212\\" has house influence that is more current sounding.  \\"212\\" best displays Azealia's versatile delivery and ability to shocking yet clever wordplay.<br /><br />Anybody from hip-hop to indie to electronic music fans should check out Azealia Banks' music. Looking forward to<br />hearing her upcoming mixtape and first studio album.
0307730697|5.0|THIS IS A MUST READ. This book is the story of a true American Hero, Adam Brown a team member of Navy Seal Team Six. Adam's story has it all, drug addition, the influence of hanging around the wrong people, the love of a woman, salvation through Jesus Christ. Adam was the kind of guy that let nothing get in his way. The things he has endured throughout his life are unbelievable if they weren't true.Adam is the perfect example of what it means to be fearless in all things.<br />Normally becoming a Navy Seal is a dream come true for those who make it, but for Adam it became his last hope, to see why you will have to read the book, because I don't want to spoil it for you.This book fulfills one of Adam's final wishes that his spiritual testimony, his complete story, be told, including \\"my life before I met Jesus Christ and Kelly. The author Eric Blehm has accomplished this wish well. This a book every man/boy should read so as to see an example of a true American man. READ it your be glad you did.<br />I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. This review is my own.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Dang, read several of the bad reviews and thought to myself, \\"huh?\\"  This guy is hilarious and he kept me reading because of it.  Thought it was good information and gonna use every bit of it.  Everyone should have a mentor.  If you want to be succesful in something, what is the best thing you should do?  Find someone who was succesful and do what they did.  This guy is sharing with us step by step what he did to sell 1 million ebooks in 5 months!  Who is a better mentor than that if you are an author getting ready to sell your ebook.  Give me a break, yes, it's a ton of work duh...most successes take tons of time and effort.  Back to the basics...set goals and focus on accomplishing them.  One step at a time, you will get there.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|*****<br /><br />\\"Blew Me Away! - 100% Pure Spiritual Cocaine!\\" - ***Doum666***<br /><br />I don't really care about what other people think about Sinead. I don't really care about all those \\"so-called\\" average albums with *only a  few good tracks* put out by Sinead in the last few years. I don't really care about those who can't understand her or this amazing album. I don't really care either for her behaviour, or for using the stage as a \\"therapist couch\\" (that was a nice one BTW!). I don't care about this picture of the pope scandal and i don't care if you do.....<br /><br />I don't care about those things simply because she didn't either, never did and probably never will. Sinead is a real artist who never been afraid of saying what's on her mind, sometimes shocking and provocative yes, but that's especially what makes her the artist that she is today, WAY above anything else in the pop scene if you ask me. HOW ABOUT I BE ME is a very powerful album with very compelling melodies and killer lyrics performed in Sinead's unique style, like one reviewer pointed out, the lyrics she writes and the way they are sung is just gorgeous. The Album is good from start to finish and like every good album, some songs you will dig right away, others will grow on you extremely fast, making them very addictive,YES...addictive!<br /><br />\\"Old Lady\\" is a very good rock song that grooves a lot. I like the way she screams near the end, those back vocals arrangements by Sinead are amazing, she's really good at making her own back vocals like this. \\"Take off Your Shoes\\" is another good example of Sinead's ability to bring a melody to a whole new level with stunning vocal arrangements after just a few seconds in the song. \\"The Wolf Is getting married\\" is another hit on this album, a  simple acoustic groove with punch, lots of punch!. The drum kicks in after  a minute in the song and leads to a very interesting groove that is accessible for anyone. The song proves that Sinead is still on top of the pop scene, again with very nice vocals. Kind of song that should've been on \\"i do not want what i haven't got\\". \\"Queen of Denmark\\" is probably the shocker of the album, I've never heard of this song before but the lyrics are indeed very funny but also very blunt at the same time. The song has slow verses but also has a very heavy chorus where Sinead literally goes all the way and sings at the top of her lungs, its amazing to see she can still do that, it gave me goose bumps! \\"V.I.P\\" is my personal favourite of the album, an amazing Epic Anthem sing with passion, une tranche de vie, bluntly honest and spitting in the face of a few things gone wrong.....This one not only gave me goose bumps but also made my eyes watery....Yes, i'll be honest and admit i had a few beers but it doesn't matter, this morning when i listened to it i got the same feeling, and that's exactly what i paid for.<br /><br />Overall an amazing album! Sinead is still on top of the game and i strongly recommend the album to any fans of Sinead, don't hesitate, just buy it, you cant go wrong.....<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!n top of the pop scene, again with very nice vocals.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is complex, nuanced, and insightful. It set my mind to turning and kept me reading and reading and reading until loooong after midnight. I have read many books both professionally and independently published that were far worse in plot, characterization, editing, and word choice than Wool. I won't rehash the plot--I think in 900 reviews you can certainly find a summary. All I can say is: read this book. Years from now you will be able to tell your children: \\"I read Hugh Howey's Wool when it first started being famous.\\"<br /><br />It'll be almost like saying: \\"I read Charles Dickens in serial!\\"<br /><br />My only regret is that I can't get my kindle to update to the awesome new omnibus cover.
1610454812|3.0|I was given this book by Christianaudio in exchange for my honest review. I have a great website about Adam you should go check out, which you will find in my review below.<br /><br />I am really on the fence over this book. Personally I did not care for the book at all, and it took everything I had in me to finish it. In fact I had a deadline for this review back in May and sadly just couldn't make it on time.<br /><br />The writing by this author was not very good at all. There was so much information given, sometimes just thrown in randomly, that my head would spin. This would be highly technical information and abbreviations only someone in the military would know or could relate to. (did we really need to know every one of these details to get the basic idea of the story?) If it was a print book I would have had to flip back numerous times just to set the story straight. However, I was listening to a digital recording so that proved to be not very easy. (You should never have to do this if a book is well written.) Many times the story would be rolling along and then in an instant change to something entirely different. Once they were at a funeral rattling off the many accomplishments of the deceased, I think it was Adams funeral actually, and the story stops abruptly mid sentence and goes into Kelly's dialogue. Another time Kelly was getting ready to meet Adams plane in Delaware, and all of a sudden she is in Virginia, or was it Arkansas, with her family. Somehow she got from Delaware to Arkansas with a brief stop in Virginia awfully fast and without any explanation. One minute they were at the funeral, the next they were staring at a vacant piece of land, and then building a house on it. There were so many other instances of this happening all throughout the book from the beginning forward, I couldn't keep track of them all. Characters were introduced at a rapid pace as well and then you would find them popping up later on in the story after completely forgetting about them.<br /><br />I also got the feeling that Adam was a saint and no other human or SEAL could ever match his accomplishments. Every SEAL goes through the same training. They are the best of the best we are constantly told. So it would seem to me that his grand feats of skill and accomplishments are not unique to only him. But yet we are constantly told how great this man was, and there was no one else on earth like him. Well, that may be true, but there are many people who have accomplished huge things after being addicted to drugs. I felt this book minimizes the accomplishments of so many others who may have come just as far, if not farther. The book also minimizes everything his entire family and friends did for him, and makes them just side characters to \\"his\\" story. (yes, I know it IS his story, but the people in his life that affected him the most should not be minimized)<br /><br />This story moves along very slowly while focusing on his usage of drugs. I quickly grew tired of hearing about the many times he returned to the drug after saying \\"It won't happen again\\". He was so determined and strong willed about everything in his life, but yet he couldn't handle the demons calling his name. For a person to be this strong willed and driven I find it hard to believe he would give in so easily. (yes, I know drugs can do that, but the book is pounding his greatness into our heads quite hard that it makes him sound like he should be able to lick the habit instantly)<br /><br />By the last few chapters I was literally in tears. It is sad to hear how his death went down, and there is room to second guess whether what he did was necessary, or if his death could have perhaps been unavoidable. Was his decision to do what he did made too quickly? And how about all of the soldiers who attempted to save his life? Their story was played down, but they were true heroes too.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that the narrator does a huge disservice to the characters. He speaks well most of the time, but when a female voice came in to play, he was terrible! He gives Adam's mother, sister, and wife a southern drawl like you would not believe. I knew this sounded terrible from the first moment he read their dialogue. I thought to myself \\"this cannot be how they really sound\\"! And sure enough, I found an awesome website with an interview video of his friends and family. His mother, sister, and wife DID NOT speak with a heavy southern drawl at all. In fact, they sounded perfectly normal with barely a hint of an Arkansas accent. He gave the women very quiet voices as well, almost a whisper at times. But the most bothersome was the way he read Kelly's thoughts and words. If you watch these video clips you will hear that she comes across much differently, and she would not have said the things in this book the way the narrator reads them. He just really had the female characters all wrong. I believe for Adam, on the other hand, he probably nailed it.<br /><br />Please check out this website if amazon will let me print it here: burnpit.us /2011/09/ patriot-profile-adam-brown (remove all of the spaces) or you can go to burn pit dot us and put Adam Brown in the search box. It's not one to miss.<br /><br />Being a tough guy, military story, you can expect there to be some language, although coming from a Christian company it did catch me by surprise when I first heard it. There are quite a few \\"effing\\", F-you or somthing like that which are never spoken fully, but said just as I have written it. There are a few Sh!+s or B!+@hes (I can't remember which one it is now) which are spoken in full.<br /><br />In the end I am left thinking this guy was the perfect guy, who was the perfect Christian, had the perfect life, the perfect wife, the perfect family, the perfect SEAL team, the perfect childhood, the perfect attitude, the perfect death, the perfect EVERYTHING. He can do no wrong. HE was perfect, and everything he did or touched was perfect. We can only begin to dream to be as worthy, but will fall disgracefully short, and that is how the book will make you feel. Unfortunately the book also makes him out to be a real jerk too.cters.

B005LAIGN2|1.0|I waited a long time to get this movie and I am very disappointed with it. The dialog is downright silly. Fighter pilots jabbering at each other in the middle of combat? I don`t think so. The screenwriter didn't have a clue about the relationship between the crew chief, an enlisted man,and the pilot, an officer. The crew chief would never speak to the pilot in the way depicted. Cliché after cliché after cliché. So poorly done. Computer graphics galore mostly unbelievable. What a shame they couldn't tell this great story with class and dignity.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why must all good things come to an end? I read Mockingjay from start to finish in one sitting as I just had to find out what would happen next! The only disappointing thing is that I don't think I'll find anything as amazing to read again in quite a while. I was left emotionally and mentally exhausted by the time I finished, in a good way, of course!<br />Mockingjay, the final book of The Hunger Games trilogy, was even better than the first two books. I've read trilogies before this and usually the first book was the best, but Mockingjay surpassed the previous two books.<br />I imagined that the final book would conclude with the usual happy ever after, but that was not the case, which made the story all the more rewarding for me. Don't get me wrong, I love my happy ever afters, but for a story as violent, thought-provoking and emotional as The Hunger Games, a happy ever after would have been very wrong. How could someone who has suffered as much as Katniss ever be able to live a \\"normal\\" life? It would be impossible. Mockingjay made me think about the soldiers who go off to war and fight for us. They leave as relatively \\"normal\\" people like the rest of us but return forever scarred. How could they not be scarred after the atrocities and violence they would have experienced?<br />Suzanne Collins is an outstanding writer and I feel privileged to have read The Hunger Games trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is really addicting and I might need an intervention... I play this all the time!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Discovered Breaking Bad about 2 months ago and became absolutely addicted to it. Actually watched the first 3 seasons in a matter of a week, couldn't break away!! Looked all over and the only place that had it at a decent price was Amazon (the first 3 seasons were on Netflix) so I'm a very happy camper indeed! Got hubby addicted too!! LOVE this show it is so original and you never know what's coming next. And the acting is superb to say the least. To actually LIKE a Meth cook and dealer and want to know what happens to them is quite a feat, especially for me. And even Gus, love that guy! But my favorite is Saul he makes you totally LOL.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. you should try it. you start off with a little bit of money and I got up to 200000 at one point so you should try this game out.
B0086700CM|5.0|All of my friends have this app and at my age which is 14 is a really popular game! I have a phone but I cant buy apps on it so the kindle fire is what I can only buy apps on and when I saw it I was happy! if I were you I would buy this app!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|IT WON'T LET ME INSTALL THE APP TO MY ANDROID. BUT IT WILL LET ME DOWNLOAD IT. IT IS STUPID AND EVERYTIME I TRY TO CLICK ON THE DOWNLOAD TO TRY AND DOWNLOAD IT. IT WILL NOT WORK. IT IS MESSED UP AND AFTERTHAT MY PHONE RESTARTS BECAUSE OF IT!

0316066524|5.0|After about 3 months with this book, I finished about a week ago. Now I can't stop thinking about it. There is no doubt that things can get a bit tedious at times. One of the three major subplots of the first half of the book can strain you a little. Suck it up and make it through, though. Enjoy the comedy, ambitious but entrancing prose, and very entertaining characters on the way. Some passages will simply wow you. To put it simply, go for it! You will be thoroughly rewarded throughout, but especially as the story comes together at the end. Then after the read, as you try to connect the dots, it will take over your mind (in a good way)!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Worth the money whether you buy or rent. You WILL watch it again eventually, It's just one of those movies. I am ranking this film up there with The Way Back and Alive, it shares both of those movies feelings and strikes the same emotions. This is more of a mans movie rather than a thrill seeking, action pumping explosive hype for impatient kids or girlymen kind of movie. This film strikes the primal emotions of man. MUST WATCH!

Why the recoloring? simple; There was no time for Mr. Bolland to finish the coloring himself back in 1987, so John Higgins was brought in to color the book instead.<br /><br />Apart from the Killing Joke, there is also the short story, \\"An Innocent Guy\\", from Batman: Black and White (1996), in color for the first time, which features some nice illustrations on famous Batman villains the Penguin, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and the Terrible Trio. We also get to see that awesome 1950's Batmobile in action which is seen briefly at the beginning of the main story.<br /><br />I would fault this collection on not reprinting the other great Joker covers created by Bolland over the last 15 years. It would have made for a more comprehensive collection of this artist's small but influential contributions to the Dark Knight. The cover for Legends of the Dark Knight #50 in particular should really have been included here. There was also a recent two page origin of the Joker which appeared in the pages of DC's 52 series with would have capped the book nicely.
