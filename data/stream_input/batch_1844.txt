B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this game but I wish it didn't have to always go to advertisements,.  Otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|amazon wants me to write a review for Forrest Gump.  The movie is rightfully so considered a classic.  Needing my review to know if people are saying good things about it, would be like wanting to know if I think the internet will catch on.  Well yes I liked this movie and would recommend it.  But I would be willing to bet that 99.9% of people purchasing it have already seen it!
B008D19WBQ|4.0|What sucks: Not the extended episodes I have gotten too used to over the last few years.<br />What rocks: Great packaging. Friends in HD! Another one-third of content added to the screen, finally built for the TV's of today rather than resigned to the history books.<br />Brilliant, extensive new bonus features (I can't believe they recreated Central Perk for Kaufman and Crane's interview!) Would have liked to see the main cast being interviewed too, but it's ok, I hadn't expected these new interviews anyway.<br />The disc book feels sturdy and classy. The episode guide, I woulda liked it to be a hardback instead of a flimsy paperback but it's really, really great inside. A new letter from Bright-Kaufman-Crane and some well-selected cast photos.<br />Also epically pleased Warner have continued making region free discs as this plays fine on my region B PS3. Looks great. We've actually had the complete series released here in the UK, but the packaging looks like it was made by an intern on work experience one afternoon. This boxset is the real deal. This is what Friends fans need in their lives.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love  the book and  learned a lot about WWII while following the drama of each character, sad it ended , can't wait for his next book
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The Facebook app is used on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and is only lacking in one area in my opinion. Sometimes when I try to view comments on a photo or on a status, it takes a really long time to load them. Other than that issue, the app is very productive.
0761169253|5.0|A quick read, but one to keep nearby for inspiration. Straight talk, and good quotes from classic and contemporary artists of all kinds. The graphics are simple but effective, and Kleon has a sense of humor.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app hasn't given me any problems. It was easy to install and has been pretty precise. I'm used to apps on my iphone and I find this comparable. I like the real-time radar tracking and the ability to view temperatures throughout the day.  I also like that it's always on due to its accuracy.
B009KZEKB6|5.0|I chose this rating because my wife is a Bee Gees fan and really wanted this album,, but it is extremely difficult to locate and this will make her Christmas, very merry.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|We appreciated them making this movie after cutting off the show prematurely. Amazing movie, but not too great watching it they Amazon
B003O86FMW|5.0|Highly recommend reading the entire Hunger Games Trilogy.  Best vacation read in a very long time. Very compelling story line. Sad when it ended - won't give away the ending.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Loved this movie. Action was great. Plot was interesting and their were interesting twists and turns. Might even buy it.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing Katy as the goofy, real person she is. Way more for than Truth or Dare with more fun an less drama.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|very creative take on Santa's delivery system, and what would happen if he forgot one child. good fun for the whole family, filled with plenty of Christmas spirit and cheer.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good fun, loud laughs, unexpected. Didnt know Anna Kendrick had such a good voice. They could have expanded the dj thing a bit more but overall no complaints.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I purchased this product form local shop.<br /><br />I should have listen to others and not invest in such useless thing.<br /><br />Inside of each 3 lenses there is metal ring sticking out. I think it will stick on lances on Kinect and its kind of spring motion. So when I was trying to remove it, and put it on it did put marks on my brand new Kinect.<br /><br />After attaching this product I did calibration and tilt set etc but Kinect didn't find me as player. As soon as I take this off it works fine.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT !!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very addicting! You always want to beat a new challenge or reach a new goal. The only thing I DO NOT like about this game is that for no reason it crashed after months of playing and I was on level 99! I have not played it since because I was sad all my hard work vanished. I would recommend this game to people who like to have goals in their games, but it is not like the original Oregon Trail game.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I like this kind of story because there are men who do this sort of thing and I was entertained by it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this final book in the Hunger Games trilogy! Although it is not as good as the first, it is better than the second. All your questions are answered and the story line comes to an end. I love the way Suzanne Collins writes these novels and they are hard to put down! I highly recommend any of these books to people who love fiction and adventure! You will not be disappointed!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vincen Flynn , is good  , he keeps you in the book from the begining to the end . Always looking forward to what is happening in his stories . Never boring or waiting to get into his stories.. His stories would make great movie material.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is truly motivational.<br />It goes into great detail about the various types of Resistances that we as creative people can feel while we create.<br />And after that it details out the various ways in which we can overcome these Resistances.<br />Truly, a greatly motivational book, if you are one of those who are struggling with the creative process...

B008BU70HW|5.0|I love the British sense of style and decorum..  Their wit and mannerisms are most enjoyful. To have each<br />character defined so well makes the whole adventure complete.

0887307280|5.0|I first read the E-Myth 15 years ago. I changed my whole business according to his model, and I am thrilled with the results. On top of that, I had the honor to interview the author, Michael E. Gerber on my radio show called Goldstein on Gelt. He gave me a lot more great insight personally, which I really appreciated. If you want to hear some of his ideas, go to YouTube: [...].
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Cute and really funny! Boston represent!! Elements of adult slapstick humor with romantic comedy. Great for teens and up. :)
B00338QENI|5.0|Fantastic book.  A nonfiction that reads like a novel.  Engaging story and fascinating science.  --Similar to Middlesex in that way.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|A lesson for the whole family ... Poignant and very important to understand what humanity does to the rest of the species on earth...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like it but I bate all the adds that pop up right in the middle of the game! otherwise I like it.
B000YHG72E|2.0|Love this movie and loved the price for a BluRay disk.  Picture is great and definitely BluRay quality but the sound is very low/muted.  We typically watch our LCD tv at a volume of about 25-30....with this movie we have to turn it up to around 80 for it to be the average volume we would watch any other BluRay disk.  Not a huge deal but I was disappointed with the sound quality.  It also scares the hell out of everyone when you forget to turn the volume down when switching back to tv programs!!!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I am a late joiner of the Castle fan club and I wish I had discovered it sooner.  I love that I can watch the reruns on TNT and buy episodes on Amazon.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys crime dramas will enjoy and with this show there is that added twist of the Castle/Beckett chemistry.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book tackled a very difficult subject and handles it beautifully.  The story will stay with me for a very  long time.  I had tears in parts and smiled in others.<br />A fantastic read.

B005LAII0I|4.0|I like this movie it is very entertaining and keeps your attention. I had to buy this movie when i saw it.
0762445262|2.0|I purchased this on 12/9 and will receive with Prime on 12/24.  Not what I expected in the time frame.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks but Im certainly worried about him,because in the majority of his novels, the protagonist had a conflict with her/his father and he died bring us to tears. In this one, the protagonist was a great  dad and person. Although someone always died in his novels, this time was the mother of the kids. I cant wait to see the movie!!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|THE PANTHER BY JOHN COREY  captured my attention in the first chapter.<br />.I have found another author I enjoy.  Looking for the next one
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|A weak lead-up to a stupid ending, I was expecting something similar to Way of the Gun and was let down.
0316017930|5.0|A division 1 baseball coach actually recommended this book at a showcase camp! It covers a wide range of interesting topics and many of the thought provoking concepts have spurred excellent conversations with my kids as well my peers at work.  It makes you think about how &#34;success&#34; happens and the little (or big things that you may not be able to control) things stack up to become a reality.<br /><br />It is a really easy read and I give it 5 stars!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite and this configuration is wonderful.  Can't wait to see all the extras.  Merry Christmas to all.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|All is well....oh exceot that it does not work!  I have the same app from the Play Store for my Galaxy S3 no problems.  Down loaded this one for my sons Nabi 2 but it will not run past the start screen!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great addition of the series.  multiple plots at the same time with multiple participants.  Plots are fairly complex but are plots that I could see might happen in real life.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|The one thing I don't like about this App is that it shows the temperature in celcius and not fahrenheit.  I have not been able to figure out if there is a way to change this so it reads in fahrenheit temps.  If you have any suggestion they would be appriciated.any responce.  Thank you.

B00AMBLDEE|5.0|We loved the first three Bourne movies and was hoping the fourth would be great too and it was. We hope the series will not stop here. We are already looking forward to the next. I rented this movie before buying it, to be sure it was worth buying. It is so good that I will buy it soon. This is a movie you must watch again. Like the James Bond movies, you never get tired of watching them.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|this is a must have on Blu ray for any fan of the movies. Danny Glover and Mel gibson at their best. Would be better if the movies came in a nicer box than a cardboard one.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|The case will work fine and the price is right.  Would recommend to friends and family.  The Fire fits perfectly in this case.

034580404X|5.0|My heart belongs to Christian Grey!!! Great books, couldn't put them down.  E.L. James has a way of writing to where you can see, feel, hear, taste what the characters do. Followed this series up with the Crossfire novels (Bared to You and Reflected in You), and I am waiting for the Entwined with You to be released in May. Great books to fill the void of finishing the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a novella so don't be disappointed by its short length.  The story revolves around a master forger being compelled to rebuild someone's soul, in this case the Emperor's,after an assassination attempt. The author plays with notions of reality and illusion as well as truth and fraud all the while pulling off a compelling adventure plot.  The two main characters are well developed and while the end is somewhat predictable it is still handled very well. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I simply love the story. It is well written, good English and the author created a very credible fictional world although it starts dragging a bit in the end. The character & motivations of the main protagonist (Katniss) is described in great detail but most of the other characters could have had more attention.  Furthermore I would have liked the end to be more on a positive note, nonetheless it is a spellbinding story and page turnover. Katniss as a character shines and is unforgettable.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|Great acting, compelling story, thoughtful dialogue. All the things that make for a great film..... except it was so head poundingly depressing I wanted to nip off to the kitchen and off myself. Sheesh. I recommend this film for those people who are so bright and chipper all the time (you know who you are) that nothing can bring them down.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|undestanding oneself...is an open eye experience! reading Ariely´s description on the behavior of human beings make you wonder where we came from...but, more importantly...where are we going to!!!!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I've wanted to buy this book for a long time but didn't really want to pay for the paper. Thanks Amazon for making this tome available in e form for a special low price.
B007L6VR12|4.0|Simply put, a great movie should take you somewhere else and let you explore it. Moonrise Kingdom did exactly that, bringing the viewer to small island on the brink of a great storm with characters that are idiosyncratic but also universal. Music is an actor and not the background in this movie that captivates and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats looking for themes and anticipating the great fugue. Story telling done through film; putting most modern directing to shame by showing how easy it can look when done well.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|For tall the hype I was expecting something with a bit more depth and quality acting. It was just OK. Kind of a mindless evening of entertainment.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The fourth and latest season of Castle. This is one of  my favorite television series and I hope they continue to make this series for many years to come. I most probably buy all of them right here.
B003MX8RJS|4.0|I was prepared to sit down to a long diatribe on the evils of the tobacco industry and was pleasantly surprised ( and quite ashamed of myself for being so judgmental in advance) to find a funny compelling story of a father's effort to get through this world of contradiction and raise a son. I certainly recommend this film for an evening of fun viewing.
B009E3EY38|5.0|nice  product  and  hi  cuality  nice ti have  it in home  and  tha  shiping  was realy fast thanks  again  :)
0446580848|5.0|Once again Nelson DeMille scores with &#34;The Panther&#34;.  This book is an excellent follow up to &#34;The Lion's Game&#34; and &#34;The Lion&#34;.  Detective John Corey never fails to keep the reader totally engrossed, and this time we are treated to a collaboration with another of DeMille's great characters, Paul Brenner (&#34;The General's Daughter&#34; and &#34;Up Country&#34;).  Nelson DeMille is one of the very best authors in America, and his wicked sense of humor, especially as expressed through John Corey, never fails to keep me laughing out loud as I read his books (I own and have read each and every one he has written).  I highly recommend this book - I guarantee it won't displease.
B009K0P10K|4.0|Only thing i dont like is there isn't enough episodes in the seasons. Leaves you wanting more and wondering what will happen
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|A very good action movie!  I went to see it at the movies, then just rented it again on amazon.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|one of the best shows always wanting more.. and very suspenseful, if you like criminal shows you have to watch it

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I like the game but way to many video ads that u cant skip. Almost costant adds. Greate app but lose the adds
B005LAII3U|3.0|The new Total Recall was mostly all style no substance.  There's so much potential in the story to be a heavier psychological thriller, but instead everything just ran fast for the sake of action sequences.  Not one of Colin Farrell's best movies in my opinion.  So many styles were copied in this movie.  It was like Minority Report meets Blade Runner shot through the lens of J.J. Abram's Star Trek (blatant overuse of lens flares) and with an orchestral score that sounded lifted from Tron Legacy.  I also didn't like how this future world just happened to have dubstep as the popular music for a nightclub.  Waste of money?  Not really, it certainly held up entertainment value, but I didn't feel connected with the characters.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a great app you can really stay on top of everything and plan your every move to be safe
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Crashes a few times.  user interface sub par.<br />Had problem playing back full HD video clips.<br />there's better alternative out there.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Another great Harry Bosch thriller ! Hold on to your seat Harry is tough as nails and smarter than the bad guys.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|If it's not free, I would have not downloaded it.<br />Not meant for high resolution screen.  Game play super mario knock off
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was funny. Not for kids. But good adult fun. I will watch it again. blah blah blah blah blah blah
B006ZNRD06|4.0|Best player to play all my high def vid so far.<br />lot's of support for different video codec.<br />good UI.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|It's slow in parts and the writing lacks a certain sophistication. However it is informative but some tighter editing would have helped considerably.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great writing and story line. Should have been nominated for Gold Globe award. Not sure why it wasn't selected? Too bad :-(
B009K45Y62|4.0|My husband is a HUGE Batman fan, and he thought he was getting the simple DVD for the movie. I have yet to see if the mask is plastic or a harder material, but regardless, this will be awesome sitting on our entertainment center.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Slammed was my favorite book of 2012 (possibly tied with Sea of Tranquility) so Hopeless was an auto buy. I don't know what it is about Colleen Hoover but the way she writes just evokes so much EMOTION from me. This was an amazing book. It took you to a few places you expected, a few you didn't, and a few WTF moments. I loved it though. Well done! I wish this was published in 2013 so I could say it was my favorite book of the year!!! :)
B004GHYCKW|5.0|Maybe Courtney Love/Hole around mid 90s; but she flamed out....<br /><br />In general, rockers like U2 & GNR hit their peak around early 90s when alt rock was blowing up--acts like Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, STP.<br /><br />so back to my question, who you gonna say better than my girl PJ?
B003B02O0A|4.0|This is one of John Grishams' personal favorites of all the books that he has written.  It is perfectly thought out, with never a very long space of boring words.  Always smoothly stated and with great detail and those moments of surprise and suspense.<br /><br />I had seen the movie quite a while before I purchased the novel for my Kindle, at first I didn't recognize the storyline, but as I read on and got more into the book, I realized that I had seen the movie because the one scene when the KKK attacks an elderly ill man was still vivid in my memory.<br /><br />Definitely a well planned and well written work.
B005LAIHHC|2.0|Movie wasn't what I anticipated. Had it's moments, but overall wasn't funny or worth the investment.  Maybe next time Sacha.
0765365278|5.0|I remember the moment I first saw this book. I was in the public library walking past the front displays, and a book caught my eye. Normally I shy away from reading a book by an unknown author for two reasons. Firstly, it's often junk. Secondly, I hate to start a book and then realize partway through that I don't like but have to finish it just to know what happens. And yet...<br /><br />I remember the cover, catching the light and calling to me like a golden ticket sitting in the gutter. Is that...a cover...by Whelan??? It can't be. He's retired. Hasn't done a cover in ages... I hesitated. The title drew me, and that cover illustration. It WAS Whelan, and one of the best illustrations he's ever done.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson. Never heard of him. A THOUSAND PAGES. I don't have time for a book that long, there's no way I'd be able to finish it. My schedule would never allow...but still... What if? What if this really was the book I'd been looking for...how long had it been since I had read a truly GREAT work of fiction? How many years had passed?<br /><br />I had grown so tired of reading mediocre sci-fi and fantasy and honestly, the best years had to be behind me, dooming me to spend the rest of my life re-reading the classics and finding yet undiscovered gems by Heinlein and McCaffrey, Tolkien and Card. And still...The Way of Kings...<br /><br />I took the book home. I started to read. The earliest parts of the book were rather vague, rather violent, and very strongly flavored of another world, one fully imagined and alien, yet human as anything. I wasn't sure I would like it. But I pressed on. And as I read, the world the High Storms with its Feudal/Desert mystique slowly broke down the walls I had constructed around myself. The characters began to unfold, striking strong emotions inside of me.<br /><br />Dalinar, once wild and violent and now noble and kind, yet fierce and strong and proud, reminded me of my father. Jasnah, arrogant, prideful, sharp and penetrating and beautiful, reminded me of my older sister. And Kaladin, who had longed for adventure, been betrayed by those he trusted, thrown into unimaginable adversity, and yet never gave up his ridiculous idealism, reminded me very much of myself in a lot of ways. There were others. The warrior forced by belief to do that which he despises, the naive girl who longed to save her family by betraying the one she admired. All of their stories enraptured me.<br /><br />The fights were brutal and painful, and I felt every blow. The supernatural power the Stormlight imbued took my breath away, the Shardblades fired my imagination like light sabers when I was kid. I felt the breath knocked out of me as the writer repeatedly outdid himself describing battles that made me cheer like a spectator at a sports match.<br /><br />The plot twisted, and turned, I found I had not read pages at a time, but dozens of pages at a time, desperate to see what would happen next, how it would all turn out. The plot threads so carefully sewn, brought payoff after payoff as twists I never saw coming landed one after another.<br /><br />The descriptions are marvelous, the narrative poetry, the dialog brilliant. The characters are archetypes, people anyone can understand and relate to. The world is original yet familiar like something out of the greatest dream you forgot you ever had. And at it's heart beats a great soul, a story of legend burning within the pages waiting to be told.<br /><br />But the real reason to read this book, is that Sanderson is a master story-teller. He KNOWS how to twist the story and guide to places you never dreamed existed. He will pull on your heart strings, confound your sense of reason, and blow your mind. But most of all, he will take you to the depths of despair, and pull you out of it to a climax so fantastic you will want to stand up and cheer.<br /><br />I told my then-girlfriend-now-wife to read this book. She devoured it. I told my best friends to read it.They tore through it like a Shardblade through warm butter. And now all of us are fanatical devotees of the worlds of Brandon Sanderson. I've read his blogs, listened to his podcasts, and I'm taking a day off of work just for the chance to meet him.<br /><br />My wife recently told me that she feels that Sanderson is the Tolkien of our era, and I have to agree. He is without a doubt the greatest living fantasy/sci-fi writer. He has already written some fantastic works of fiction (the Mistborn Trilogy in particular), but it is very clear to me that he has not yet reached his prime. And with this being the first book in a planned series of ten, he is just getting started. The best is surely yet to come.<br /><br />There are those who say Sanderson's books are too similar, their magic systems and fights are all the same. There are those who say his characters are all the same and lack depth. And there are those who say that his work is unimpressive, and not worth reading. Fair enough. People said Tolkien's books were shallow escapist fantasy. People said Tchaikovsky's symphonies were derivative and poorly done. People said that Star Wars would be a flop. No one remembers those people. Because those people...are wrong.

I've read his blogs, listened to his podcasts, and I'm taking a day off of work just for the chance to meet him.<br /><br />My wife recently told me that she feels that Sanderson is the Tolkien of our era, and I have to agree. He is without a doubt the greatest living fantasy/sci-fi writer. He has already written some fantastic works of fiction (the Mistborn Trilogy in particular), but it is very clear to me that he has not yet reached his prime. And with this being the first book in a planned series of ten, he is just getting started.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book when I saw previews for the movie.  So when I started to look for it, I was surprised to see it was originally published in 1999 and I couldn't believe it had taken me over a decade to read it.  It is such a cute story, following the (somewhat somber at times) realities of high school, friendship, self-discovery, and being YOU.  I feel like everyone can relate to at least part of this story; the characters in this story are some of my favorites across fiction.  I would recommend this book to anyone, I absolutely adored it.
0440246024|5.0|John Grisham  is just a good, no, an excellent writer. The Last Juror might not be as much a thriller as it is an insightful story about the deep south - Mississippi during the late 1970's. The characters are as colorful as the characters in the book. The main character, Willie Traynor is not a good ol' boy and not from Clanton in Ford Country, Miss, but he is the 23 yr old who bought the town's only newspaper. In a short time he and Callie Ruffin, a wise and strong black woman with several grown children, become best friends. A beautifully written and touching story with a murder, convict (Danny Padgitt, a young man of the area's mean and controlling Padgitt crime family) and some very funny town characters as believable as the story itself.  I was sorry to see the book end, but all good stories have an ending and this one is meaningful as the theme the story holds throughout - life and dying are news worthy according to Wille Traynor, The Ford County Times, editor.

0547564651|4.0|Difficult questions, uncomfortable answers.<br /><br />A man named Tough determines that toughness and curiosity are key to success in life, a gritty guy who dropped out of college, twice, and recently became a father and was wondering how he could do right by his child --is the simple take-a-way from this book. But this book is not as simple as that -in fact it is complex and the subject matter is complicated and difficult to put together. I'm thinking of \\"Humpty Dumpty.\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty together again. But Paul Tough tries and for that I give him very high marks.  Humpty Dumpty is a stand in for the American child in the collective, and we, the adults, with the help of Paul's book can see that HD is broken. And that goes for all the children - those of the affluent as well as the poor, and all of the children in between. How do we put Humpty Dumpty back together again?<br /><br />This book is disjointed and sometimes wanders and sometimes becomes repetitive and back tracks, and sometimes even becomes boring. Tough isn't the best of story tellers. It's kind of a word salad. Maybe that's because Paul Tough has plenty of good character traits but got lost, or broken (?) himself and didn't stay the course. He dropped out of college twice and never finished -which is what he means by the word \\"succeed\\" in the title of the book --graduating from college. But in looking at all the pieces (chapters and subjects addressed in the book) I'm going to redefine what he means.<br /><br />Buried in the text (I didn't read the book, but listened to it read and took notes, therefore I have no page numbers to reference.) success is defined as \\"Life satisfaction and high achievement.\\" Okay, for now. High achievement, Tough points out, does not guarantee life satisfaction but is almost a certainty that comes with affluence. The children of the affluent often suffer emotional problems and exhibit poor character skills/traits, precluding satisfaction. I agree. Character, as defined by Tough, consists of  these traits: Grit, Self-control, Zest, Social intelligence, gratitude, optimism, and curiosity. I would count those traits as personality traits, which Tough talks about intermittently--personality --especially the trait of Conscientiousness. Tough's character traits can be distributed across the personality construct of OCEAN, or Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. It really doesn't matter too much what you call \\"it,\\" character or personality - but that merging can be confusing. What matters more is how does character develop, and is it \\"malleable\\" (his word.) Tough wants very much to believe it is, but the evidence/research says it's really, really, hard to change it as a child develops into an adult. In other words, the older a person is, the harder it is to change. Character, or personality, is a process that develops over time and can be most influenced in the beginning of the lifespan and becomes fixed sometime, in general, in the mid twenties. Tough's book is about the process of trying to change a developing person's traits', before they become fixed, which will pretty much determine his achievement(s) and satisfaction(s). Said another way, you are your personality, your character, and that \\"character counts.\\"<br /><br />One thing Tough argues is that I.Q. (as determined by intelligence tests) is not a determinant of  \\"success.\\" That high school GPA is a better gauge of whether or not a person will graduate college ... because a high GPA indicates good character and that that is a more necessary component of \\"success\\" than I.Q. Grit, self-control, zest, and so on are more important in doing well in school and life than intelligence. Okay. So what is happening? What happened to Humpty Dumpty? Tough takes us (reader/listener) back to the beginning.<br /><br />Firstly, there is the attachment and bonding which is the foundation for all that follows. Given quality attachment Humpty has a chance but then there are all sorts of other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) that can inhibit Humpty's chances' of \\"success,\\" of which poverty is a huge adversity. Poverty of the parents, or in many cases, parent, is simply a precursor to more adverse situations. ACE tends to snowball - they adhere together and layer. There's a list of ACEs and the higher you score on the ACE Questionnaire, the lower your chances of \\"success\\" are.<br /><br />Tough goes into a whole lot of the most current and valid of older research, to lay out the problems, barriers, and pitfalls on the road to \\"success.\\" And looks at some of the attempts at remedy(s). It's just really, really, hard to get on the right track when you start off on the wrong track. And that's the biggest problem - early identification and then effective intervention. A major problem is: How do you help a person who doesn't want your help? Tough calls our current system(s) of intervention a \\"dysfunctional pipeline.\\" True that. Somewhat surprising is that medication intervention is not ever mentioned. Surprising because that is so popular today, often in conjunction with the behavioral and interpersonal methods he does talk about. Programs such as KIPP (Knowledge Is Power) charter schools, as well as instruction in Chess as a training device for thinking, freedom, self-determination, and self-control. (Read the book.)<br /><br />Success, what it means, is difficult to nail down in and of itself. It turns out that a college degree, in and of itself, is only a beginning--the first step. And there is an order to the process of becoming successful. It goes like this: 1) Get an education; 2) Get a job; 3) Get married; 4) Have children. But there are lots of problems as well as challenges to that scenario. As Tough points out, often the children of that \\"success\\" wind up with emotional and psychological problems. So it's not correct to call that success, is it? At the conclusion of that \\"success,\\" a person is only a third- or half-way through their lifespan. Even if everything goes well and a person \\"succeeds,\\" they can still wind up very much unsatisfied with their life by the time it's over - if say, they get sick and/or screw up their children. (Happens a lot.) It's better than the reverse order, though, you say - Have children, then get married (Sometimes divorce is necessary, even in the above `correct' sequence.) then get a job, and finally get that education, then get a better job. Paradoxically, that sometimes works! That's because of the grit thing. The value of hardship. The confidence building experience of overcoming adverse experience, of struggle, especially in childhood. It builds character.<br /><br />Tough thinks and argues that a highly skilled, effective teacher (and I'll add coach and/or camp counselor) can make a difference and get a kid headed for trouble turned around - but then says research says that that hasn't been shown to work in all but a small percentage of cases. If that weren't discouraging enough, there's this. Studies demonstrate that what school really has taught, is how to be a good little corporate worker. Traditionally, school schools you in high Conscientiousness and high Agreeableness --show up on time, follow directions, work hard, and do as you're told. In addition, and even more distressing, is that traditional education discourages creativity and curiosity. That is true.<br /><br />So ... What again is the argument to stay in school? What is the definition of success again? A bestselling book? Money? Many of the best writers and many of the richest (men) found their own way. Grit and determination (obsession ?) is certainly a factor. But, a lot of ruthless men share those qualities, too, and accumulate wealth, fame, women, children, and so on. Men of bad character.<br /><br />What is the answer to the question. How do children succeed? Iguess if we knew that, it would be a simple process--one, two, three, four. A simple thing. Instead we have this salad. Full of words and ideas and theories and research and myths and reasons and rhymes and conflicting interests that make for a mess. Sometimes tasty, and sometimes hard to swallow without grit.not correct to call that success, is it?

B008JFUUIA|5.0|I Loved this movie!! Anna Kendrick has such a great voice! I would totally listen to her music if she were to do an album. Definitely watch this....hilarious too!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|First of all, the capability to use the built in camera shouldn't be priced separately.  It should have been included with the device, since it was several hundred dollars to begin with.  Additionally, it has very limited capabilities and with the kindle HD device covers, you can't use it to photograph anything but yourself, as you look at it.  Additionally, it is difficult (if not impossible, since I haven't figured out how to do it yet), to store your photographs in an accessible folder.  Kindle Fire HD is a great device, but you sure don't want to have to depend on it for photographs.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I  watched this program for the first time last summer and just was intrigued  by the story and the individual stories of each of characters. Each of the characters is so complex. It's great to watch the interaction between the classes and how the lines continue to become blurred.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Family crowd pleaser and the children loved this rental (Prime membership) the adults in the family enjoyed this animation as well.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|Don't be fooled, just cause it has Bourne in the title doesn't mean it's a true Bourne movie. I loved the first 3 movies, great intriguing deep story with intense awesome action scenes, but this just doesn't carry over ANY of that into this one. At first I found myself feeling that this movie felt empty without Matt Damon, but as the movie progressed I'm glad he wasn't in this one as it was a poor movie overall and Bourne character, I'm glad he didn't tarnish the true Bourne movies by being in this one.<br /><br />The story, boring, not nearly as deep or intriguing, and actually quite action movie cliche, he has no medicine (lame story plot to begin w/) but the bad guys are after him so he has to beat them to it, even more lame. Action, barely any, without the fight scenes you never truly learn how dangerous of an agent he really is, and this just adds to me caring less about the story and character. I mean, Jeremy Renner is awesome action guy, but whoever created/wrote \\"Bourne\\" for this  movie is an idiot, in the first 3 movies you could tell how smart and dangerous he Really was, by how he absolutely tears through guys, speaking pretty much every language, and having great survival skills, you barely get ANY of that in this movie, there's barely a survival bit in the beginning, there's next to no action, and I don't think he even speaks another language other than English nor do we see any of his survival skills, this movie completely fails to give you any sense of who he was in the first 3 movies.<br /><br />It's an odd movie if you've watched the earlier 3 many times, there are a couple of the same faces, but the new faces like Edward Norton I could just not take seriously. The head of CIA is supposed to be this corrupt jerk, but again the movie in whole kinda fails to get this across, it's like I was supposed to care about him, but I didn't.<br /><br />Going on from that, it references the first 3 movies and it's plot, characters, and history, to give a back story, but all it does is serve as an ugly reminder of how good that story was and how much worse this one is.<br /><br />The ending, again, lame, usual Bourne car chase that barely resembles the ones in the first 3, they send this agent that comes out of no where who supposedly is stronger *spoiler* but doesn't beat him *end spoiler*, it's like if they didn't put in the required agent that the corrupt CIA people send after him to kill him, I wouldn't think this is a Bourne movie, this can also be said for how they keep talking about Treadstone and Blackbriar like it means something to the story, it's like they just put it in to make it look and sound like a Bourne movie but never really pull it off.<br /><br />If you are Bourne fan, watch it I guess, it's an ok somewhat entertaining watch, but if you're watching for a good Bourne movie, SKIP. I realized after writing this review how much this movie sucked and is truly a poor representation of the first 3. It saddens me more though seeing Bourne fanboys supporting this garbage.

B00796E7CA|4.0|I'm giving this book 4/5 stars - there is a lot of info to be gleaned from reading this book if you are curious about the history and back-story about the events and characters of Middle Earth. What makes this book fall short of 5/5 stars is that I find it difficult to  separate the writings of J.R.R. and the commentary from his son Christopher. It's not so much the verbiage, but the textual layout of the book. That said, it could be a limitation of the e-book that makes it difficult. Still, a great resource for the rabid Tolkien fan.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Collin ferrel was good and the ladies were great. Better than the old one but just kinda dry. When you are done watching it you are just like hey it was a movie. Just okay.

0345803493|4.0|After all of the hype, I finally gave in and read 50 Shades of Grey. I liked it JUST enough to get the second one. To clarify- I thought the dialogue was cheesy, and the story was weak, but the sexy was sexy enough to hold out hope that there was more and better to come in volume 2- and not only was that the case, but the story got stronger, the dialogue got less cheesy, and the sexy got sexier. On to volume 3 now. And maybe some 50 Shades inspired online shopping at unnames stores too. :)

0783240236|5.0|This has always been my very favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.  If you haven't seen it, you really need to add it to your must watch list.  You will never look at large gatherings of birds the same again!  I think of this movie every time I see a flock, or swarm, of birds.
0439023513|5.0|This is the last book of \\"The Hunger Games\\" Series. I really enjoyed the first two books, but began to struggle while reading \\"Mockingjay\\". It is worth the read though. The last chapter and epilogue are worth trudging through all of the devastation and warfare.<br /><br />This is the climax of Panem vs. the Capitol. The bulk of the book consists of warfare and death. Fortunately, there was a happier wedding scene midway which helped break up the gore. I wondered how Collins was going to be able to end the series with any kind of message of hope considering how dark the plot. She was able to pull off the seemingly impossible and I cried like a baby at the end. It was a singular perfect ending. This is a book that will stick with me for years to come. I would recommend to all ages and genders.
6304711905|5.0|The actors did a fabulous job in this movie.  How can you possibly beat Sam Elliott, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, Michael Biehn, Dana Delany, and Joanna Pacula.  Those are just to name some of the faces you will recognize.<br />My favorite line &#34;I'm your Huckleberry.&#34;  You will laugh, cry and really get mad while watching this movie.  It draws you in and keeps your undivided attention from the beginning until the awesome ending.  Be sure to add this to your must see list.
B0055OG2BC|1.0|First off ignore the other reviews that are based on the dvd edition. Surprisingly the dvd edition is far superior! This Blu-Ray edition DOES NOT contain Barry Nelson's  1954 version and has no menu screen it goes straight to the film. you have to use the pop up menu for features. Very disappointing now I have to repurchase the dvd version to have the 1954 CBS tv version.
B001F12J48|1.0|First of all, this is an epic movie. 5 stars all the way.<br /><br />That being said, do not buy the 3D version. No glasses made on earth will work. Terrible ghosting effect, looks primarily red and green with bad screen distortion.
0393088774|4.0|I have no formal economics education but have always loved reading economics blogs and columns. Prof. Krugman's book is an extension/collection of some of his writings in the NYT or his (excellent) blog. He presents his case for stimulus in a very readable and coherent way, so the text is not filled with wonky jargon - it is all very understandable and easy to read for someone like myself, with charts that are easy to understand. The reason the book is not a 5star for me is because of two things - one is that he is somewhat repetitive, and the other is that i would have loved a little more depth to the book. I understand that this was done in order to appeal to a wider audience, but at some parts it felt too simplified and rudimentary. Aside from these small comments, i think that is an excellent book and a worthy read for anyone who would like to learn a little more about economics, the state of the world economy and why we are still in the mess we are in.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I didn't realize it was a double CD! Loved her career, voice, style, I've waited a long time for this not even knowing it was out there!
0142421375|2.0|I am an avid Grisham reader however was not prepared for this book to be for a young reader audience.  Perhaps it is my fault but no indication was made as to the target demographic.  The book may be good for the intended age group but not for an adult.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of dubbed movies where &#34;gasp&#34; you have to read!! to know what the actors are saying!  I highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE!  The skill Master Ip must have posessed!!  The fights in this movie are AWESOME TO WATCH!!!!  Comical at times!  Master Ip wins the first fight of the movie easily,  not getting hit at all and NOT DELIVERING a single blow!  He stops his attacks perfectly,  calling out &#34;hit&#34; each time he could have landed one!  It shows the true skill a Master should have,  neither person being injured in the spar.  Cannot recommend enough!!!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|I'll be honest, not a whole lot of a storyline to the film but all the softcore sex scenes sure make it well worth your while!

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I tried to read this book many years ago and could not get into it.  After my daughter recently read it, she insisted I give it another try.  I'm so glad I did!  The first 75 pages or so can be a bit tedious, but this is important backgound.  After that the story picks up and becomes a book that is impossible to put down.  The ending will blow you away.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another great entry in the Pendergast series. About 1/5 of the way into the book found a 'wow, didn't see that coming' moment. The unexpected is always a good thing.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|quick delivery would do business with them again<br />I enjoyed the action adventure<br />Great that the people involved with the movie were willing to let American Veterans be a part of the movie
B005LAIGZU|5.0|True lives showing what realworld situations and decisions that have to be made on a moments notice.  Great job Seals!
B007X4ECMI|5.0|good action packed movie rated R so not meant for any young children<br />movie was sent quick and arrived on time
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|What a great family movie! Once you see it you feel invigorated and full of energy!<br /><br />Finally, a great comedy for everybody with great music. Finally something clean that you can watch as a family and have a good time.<br /><br />Outstanding acting and outstanding performance by all participants. All these young people have great voices and they can also act.<br /><br />The plot is simple. There is a competition between two teams within the same college in a cappella music (without instrumental sound). It is the girls against the boys. Who is going to win at the end? Well you have to watch the movie to find out. Actually I watched the movie twice in a row. It was great and the music is just unbelievable.<br /><br />Five stars for the entire movie. Everything in this movie is great. Plus has a great message. You need to take risks in order to win big.<br /><br />Quick note: on the amazon web site it says that the movie is 224 minutes long. The movie is 1h 52 min which is 112 min. Somebody made a mistake and multiplied the time by 2!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|quick service will do business with them again<br />Normally I am not a fan of sequeals but this is one of the exception of rules.<br />I totally enjoyed watching the third part of the series
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Do I really have to wait for the next book? Great to read.  I was not into reading these books before but it does allow you to imagine the storyline.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These are really good.<br /><br />Sound is pretty amazing.<br /><br />Only con is they are not as comfortable as the Tritton 720's they replaced.
B009HELT3C|5.0|We just streamed this movie in HD last weekend and loved it.  By far the best of the three movies in this series, with the fantastic music, action, and special effects you would expect, plus an intriguing and internally-consistent story line that makes it more than just the usual eye candy.  Definitely worth the price of the rental!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|With \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" Rod continues to explore the Great American Songbook. This, in essence, is Volume VI in that series. If you like the other 5 volumes you will love this. If you are looking for the Rod Stewart of 30 years ago...well, this is not for you. A well produced, very traditional set of interpretations of classic songs. And, in this, Rod succeeds. His strength is in selling the emotion in these songs. If you like supper clubs and hot cider by the fire on a cold night...what are you waiting for? This is for you.
0385536828|4.0|Ian McEwan, perhaps best known for Atonement, his 2001 novel, made into an award winning movie in 2007, is a fine writer and I would recommend any of his works on the basis of the quality of his writing.<br /><br />This, McEwan's most recent novel, published only last month, is a delight for a couple of reasons.  First, McEwan tells the story from a woman's point of view.  It would be presumptuous of me to definitively suggest he does it perfectly or even well, but so few male author's would even attempt an entire 300 page book from the woman's point of view, that he should get some kudos for that.<br /><br />Second, the plot.  It's a thriller...no, it's a love story....  Well, you will have to judge for yourself.  Ok, there are spies in it, but there are authors in it as well.  There are even short stories within the story.  However you read it, there is a twist at the end which caught me completely off guard.
B008B8DY2O|4.0|Very well written, interesting and captivating. After reading this book, I definitely want to visit India. It's very long though. I wasn't really interested in the sections about war machinery so skim read through those sections but I know people who really loved all of it. It's a definite read!
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I am so happy that Lego has introduced the Winter Village series.  These are a fun new tradition for my family.  The set has multiple figures, a vehicle, park scene, and the post office...lots of options for play.
0321885112|5.0|I am an experienced sketchnoter but I am always interested in learning something new.  I heard about the Sketchnote Handbook from Mike's blog where he let us take a peek at the process of writing the book.  So when the book became available, I was really excited to get it.  When my book arrived, I was in awe. This is more than a book, it's an Experience.<br /><br />The book cover is soft and matte, the pages feel thick, and the rounded corners just top it off.  The moleskin look was such a great idea. The inside of the book is just as appealing as the outside.  Mike's attention to detail comes through on every page.  I love that he included sketchnotes from various people along with their tips and tricks.<br /><br />The Sketchnote Handbook is a joy to read.  This book will guide the beginner through the visual note taking process with ease.  At the same time, the experienced sketchnoter will get a fresh perspective on techniques and style.  I highly recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this character, I actually like the second book a little better.. and i cant wait for the third..
B008FPOIT6|4.0|It seems a little strange to review this title on Amazon, as it's partially a paean to the weird little second-hand bookstores that often struggle in the face of online competition.  The story is just a little too breathless with the possibilities of high-tech entrepreneurialism at times; I felt it was at its best when it focused most on the titular Mr. Penumbra and the strange cast of characters surrounding him.<br /><br />Worth a read, particularly if you've ever stopped in a little used bookshop and wondered about its history.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love 10 and 11, but 9 was the one who brought me back to The Doctor. I grew up watching Tom Baker and I love how Eccleston's Doctor is like #4 (not too pretty, but funny and determined and... the doctor).
B005ZUR724|1.0|For the 2nd time this year Gameloft has updated their game and left usin the cold with no update going on day 4.  As developers you'd think they wwould update all platforms at once.  It's the best game out there and once again I'll have a steep learning curve when I finally can play again.<br />Give me back my game or at least contact me back and I'll give the game a review on gameplay instead of Gameloft's customer service.
0470901071|5.0|This book is great and so simple.<br />It can be used as a reference in network fundamentals.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who wants to work in network field.
034580404X|5.0|Although I've read the FSG trilogy before online-which strained my eyes, now I have to wear glasses- it was great having it in my hands. Books were perfect in its box set, and in cherishing them like my other favorite books.<br /><br />The story of Anastasia and Christian is an unusual but entertaining one. Although some aspects of the plot may be repetitive or you can practically see what's coming next, it's still a good read. Personally I love it :)
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Six months ago (roughly) The Hunger Games movie arrived in theaters. At that time I had no idea what the movie was about, but that there sure was a lot of excitement surrounding its release. Last week I read the book and last night I watched the movie and all I can say is ... thank God I read the book first or I wouldn't have known WHAT was going on in the movie. Good book, awful movie.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Haven't listend to it all yet. I'm not really into xmas music but this seems palatable. Mery xmas to all and to all a good night
B000000W5P|5.0|Good music for those of you who like the Rolling Stones. A lot cheaper then in the box stores. I would recommend this.
B0076DELIG|5.0|And as Harry ages his character continues to develope. He survived The Drop, but he is clearly getting cranky in his old age. There is very little room for more stories down his lifeline as an LAPD cop, but I would welcome reading about what he does after he retires (or is retired), & there is plenty of room to reveal details of his life as a young cop.
B00009RGBS|5.0|My wife enjoys doing plays so this has helped her a lot when practicing. She buys tthem online for a better price..
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my nephew who s 8yrs old. He enjoyed making the bike and then playing<br />With it and showing off to his friends. overall very age appropriate gift for boys and maybe girls too.
B009B2VBWE|2.0|This is not your typical Jazz vocal/piano by Krall album... It is quirky and the material does not make the same impact of her other albums... I understand going out on a limb... but as to this body of work... she fell off the limb and into the bushes below.  A album you only can wish you can forget.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I totaly felt like I was whatching it in the theater.  the colors where vivid and sound effects where great.  I recomend it to everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season one seemed compacted, season two a bit drawn out. Season three freaking rocks! I recommend all three seasons, but this is the one where the bar is raised to the moon. Filled with uncertainty, confidence, terror and sacrifice, this season has it all. And you will both loathe and emphasize with several unexpected characters all at the same time.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|The style of the arrangements is a refreshing change. The songs are not intrusive like some Christmas songs can be.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Funnest holiday movie ever.  Clark is a perfect example of goods things can happen to bad situations. His nutty family member just add to the zany humor.
B004SBX112|3.0|Ibought two apps of Angry Birds neither one would install in my Tablet. Don&#34;t know why so i just lost that money Just won't try to install any more from Amazon. Iam sure i would have love the game already have a couple of free ones on my tablet of got else where. Have a great Day.  Shirley
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, as I have with most of Pixar's productions.  Entertaining, clean, and full of adventure.  This movie is perfect for any family movie night.  And as usual, there is humor for both the kids and the adults, so everyone has a fun time watching!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|It is a great movie for little ones and big ones also, just a gentle show for a change and great for bedtime.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed the Wool Obnibus edition. It was really a different take on a post-apocalyptic story. He did a great job of having several cliffhangers within the 5 books. I look forward to reading his prequel to learn how all of this got started. Good stuff. - Thomas
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Overall it was a good game..had nice graphics and a good story line and plot.  The game did keep locking up on me though.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last part of the book was crazy intense! Some people told me they had difficulty reading this at the beginning, but I really enjoyed following along with the characters from book one to it's final book.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Parts dragged on, not nearly as compelling characters and story line as the first book (Matched). I only finished because I was listening to it as an audio book in the car.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never read anything like this before, but it was a page turner for me! I loved it! It's a little strange to get used to the mentality behind it, but once you get familiar with the characters, it takes romance novels to a whole new level.
0316017930|5.0|It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. \\"Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life\\" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one \\"the best\\". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.<br /><br />Impressing people without even meaning to is one of the earliest memories I have in life. After devouring all of the chapter and picture books I could get my hands on at pre-school age, my parent's classics and old science textbooks (or at least the ones I could reach off the bottom shelf) seemed the next natural step. Dad frequently retells a story in which he asks me as a toddler how I got to be so smart; I replied \\"good genes\\". Public school has no idea what to do with a kid who signs up for kindergarten being already able to read novels, play piano sheet music and execute batch files in DOS. I was tested at age 7 with an IQ of 163 upon entering the second grade, having already been skipped a grade ahead as well as being a year younger still due to having a September birthday. This conflict between being significantly younger than my peers at a critical age of development and also several standard deviations more intelligent than them was to be a continual source of strife. I begged and pleaded with my parents not to hold me back, not understanding the implications of being so much less emotionally mature than my peers. On the first day of class I got sent to the principal's office for taking my shoes off and refusing to put them back on. At 9, the teachers were fed up with me reading or drawing and 'distracting others' in class but also couldn't fail me when I was getting perfect grades, so I was pulled out and sent to a private school for the gifted, where after a year of constant boredom (diagnosed and medicated as ADHD) and other behavioral problems my teachers treated me as a class scapegoat and suggest that I be better off homeschooled or back in public school. These events marked the beginning of a long scholastic career of underachievement, contempt of authority, and befuddled administrators who weren't sure whether I belonged in the gifted program or Special Ed.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be born into a white, middle class family in one of the most highly educated and prosperous parts of the United States. My parents were psychology majors who read all the right books and took all the proper steps in terms of nurturing the development of a gifted child without stifling or overloading me. So why am I not in the same percentile of overall life success as I am in test score range? Gladwell goes into the many statistical reasons why the high-IQ child is no more likely to become successful than any other child when demographic influences are controlled for, some factors as completely out of our control as being born in the wrong month of the year. He also gets down to what I believe is the true difference between successful and unsuccessful people, the willingness to work hard. If I had been self-disciplined enough to put in the hours academically to master unfavorable subjects with the same voracity with which I took to computers, art, music and reading, plus a less cynical attitude towards the school system, I might have gotten a full ride scholarship to any of the best universities in the world. As it is, I'll have to settle for a community college degree acquired at age 19, being published and owning my own business by 21, and knowing that if I do desire to learn a new skill at any point in life, the only thing standing in my way is myself. (Though, as a side note, I definitely pick up new skills a lot slower than I used to as a child and find myself stymied more often, indications that my IQ has dropped either from aging or drug/alcohol use, something that I try to compensate for with extra patience).<br /><br />Though it will always be embarrassing and awkward, I've gotten used to the incredulous stares and people asking \\"how did you do that\\", though I never had a particularly good answer. \\"Lots of practice, the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time, and luck\\" is the old standby, though it sometimes felt insincere. Now, thanks to 'Outliers', I realize that's not an overly humble explanation of genius. If I ever have kids, I will not subject them to a barrage of tests in order to find out exactly how \\"special\\" they are. I will accept that they are special simply on the virtue that they are them, listen to them to find out what they truly love to do and push them to achieve high but realistic expectations. And that's my advice for children of all ages - do what it takes to be whatever you want to be and do the hell out of it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first! I love how the characters are intertwined and more history comes into play.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Fun read for my and my 11 year old son. We really enjoy the series. We still have a way to go with this author!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Best movie in years! Kids loved it, and we were entertained.  I would highly recommend this movie to any family out there.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Having played the original for the Playstation 2 years ago, I can honestly say it still holds the same magic on the Vita.<br /><br />The HD graphics provide an updated look and there are plenty of additions that make it worthwhile to play again if you've played it before.  The voice acting is still top notch and the added cutscenes are a welcome addition.  There are new quests, a new character, more places to explore and more choices to make.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game for anyone who has been, like me, yearning for a reason to play my Vita.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie on tv and bought it for my two grandsons as they are new parents.  I thought it had a really good message about what a father should be.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Love baseball or not, great movie.  It's all about the relationships between the characters.  Makes me want to read &#34;Shoeless Joe&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not typically one to watch anything sci-Fi or dealing with vampires, werewolves, or in this case..  Walkers (zombies).  The characters are captivating and the show pulls you in.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|I just recently started watching this series and honestly within weeks I had purchased every season available. It's addicting. I can't say enough to validate how good this show really is. It's not one that I would have looked at on my own I just happened to be home watching reruns one day. Great show.
B008518MOW|4.0|I was really surprised with the 3D in this movie. There is alot of depth with some pop outs. The depth really adds alot top this movie, sure to the fact that there are alot of outdoor scenes in this movie. Most of the pop outs had to do with guns and hands, but still it was balanced really well.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes I really enjoyed it, especially Josh Brolin, he did a great job playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones, even the voice was spot on. This one might not be as good as the first M.I.B. but it is better than the second, and the ending was really well done. Overall this is a must see movie in 2D or 3D, but if you can watch it in 3D definitely go for it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm not sure why but I love this game :) going to try some more of your games now thank you :)

0446615641|4.0|Well written as usual and a cast of likable characters. Really good plot lines which hold one's interest thru the entire book. Sorry when the book is finished.
B001CTDH76|5.0|We love The Mentalist, this is a great purchase.  This is a complete set so no more missing episodes.  Has some extra features also.
0446614459|3.0|I like most of his other books so much better. Well written as usual from this author just not as much to my liking.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|A few times now I have had plenty of balls left but after I shoot the color I'm on it glitches and says the game is over and that I have failed the level. I have not seen anyone else with these problems. I also agree that the vibrations are very annoying. Other that that the game is great. Start freshening up on your bank shots. I don't have problems finalizing the game or it sending the high scores to global rankings.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Fans of Earth Wind and Fire will really enjoy listening to their greatest hits collection.  These songs will bring back some good memories for those of us who grew up in the 70's and 80's when EWF were cranking out their hits.  Great rhythms.  Great horn section.  They had it going!  Enjoy!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is a spellbinding book that continues the saga<br />of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and Daniel Sempere.  Zafon has made this<br />third addition to the series of books an excellent read!  I plan to re-read the novel<br />so as to savor the writing of Zafon.  Highly recommend this book, as well as the<br />other novels which Zafon has written.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the best games I've played. The bonus content is as long as some full games. Graphics are great, storyline is engaging, and length and difficulty are satisfactory. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Many people told me how great this movie was.  I thought there were only about 3 or 4 funny parts, the rest was pretty slow.  Maybe its one of those movies you have to watch more than once to see the funny parts?
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|great movie but i would love to rent 3D movie so please guys give us that option thank you great job
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Never lets me down.Another great story. how does he do it. Enjoyed this book very much. Highly recommend it to anyone.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|Interesting to play. You actually need to think out your moves to maximize the effects of your play. And the price was unbeatable
B004WR125O|1.0|Doesn't do anything, connects to internet, but none of the net services work. Wish I hadn't thrown the packaging away. $25 lost.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This was a fun romp but I wish there had been more character developement. I never saw the series it is based on so I don't know how accurate it is but it stands alone as a quick comedy worth a few laughs.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|i tried to pay attention to the animation work and directorial choices. quite a few breathtaking vistas, interesting choices for making certain things out of focus to imitate real cameras, lots of panning going on.<br /><br />plot-wise, definitely could've used more tiny bears.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|easy to understand and excellent photographs.Well written and to the point.Just wish it were longer.Photo files could have been bigger so they could stand more expansion without pixelation.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well-written, good storyline. I have read two other of the author's books and have enjoyed all three. I would definitely recommend this book.
B007704HO6|5.0|Very uplifting book.  James writes very well about how his life changed as a result of this beautiful, smart ginger kitty. They're obviously very devoted to one another.  Beautiful story.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I just fell in love with the packaging and the little awesome mask that accurately portrays the damage after the fight between the darknesses. The content of the ultra violet for iPhone is so nice. I haven't seen it, I'm preparing myself...

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I recommend this product not just for the excellent movie but for the packaging and the extras, and the feeling of having one of the best movies ever in a preserved state with the best possible quality.

B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The Terminator has been one of those movies that I've been a fan of since the 90's, and it seems like with age, you end up loving it even more.  With Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies, I consider this among his absolute best, second only to the mighty Total Recall.<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that if you ask around a lot of Terminator fans, most will tell you that Terminator 2:  Judgment Day is their favorite movie.  If you would have asked me this question about 10-15 years ago, I would have concurred with the consensus on this.  However, after some deeper thought about the two movies, I now consider the first Terminator my favorite because compared to the sequel, the first Terminator movie has a much stronger sense of tension and urgency.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />In the relatively distant future (2029), a nuclear war has wiped out most of humanity.  However, armies of anthropomorphic machines and cyborgs are dead-set on eliminating the survivors.  The genocidal machines send a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to Los Angeles circa 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of human resistance leader, John Connor.  The human resistance sends a resistance fighter named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to infiltrate the Terminator and save Sarah.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />What makes this movie such a great one is the characters.  Sarah steals the show since she's very easy to relate to, since she feels like a real person.  When she's faced with impending death by the Terminator, she understandably acts scared as hell and when she meets Kyle Reese, she initially thinks he's a maniac, even when he saves her from the Terminator at the Tech Noir club.  Kyle is great as the \\"hero\\" of the movie because much like what John McClane would help establish in the mighty Die Hard several years after this movie, he's not unstoppable and is faced with grave danger that forces him to act creatively.  He knows that the Terminator is much stronger than him, and in the beginning, is even doubtful that he can destroy it since he's restricted from the high-tech weapons he had in the future, and is forced to fight with sawed off shotguns and homemade pipe bombs.<br /><br />Arnie did a great job as the Terminator.  The Terminator lives up to his name, and is one terrifying entity that could easily make him among the best antagonists in film in the last thirty years.  He has no emotion, can't feel pain, and is virtually unstoppable.  It's also really menacing to see him murder people, especially unarmed women.<br /><br />STORYTELLING<br /><br />One of the things that really helps out this movie is how James Cameron has the story told.  Through some scenes of exposition, such as when Kyle has to explain to Sarah what cyborgs are and what his life in the future was like, they didn't feel like the \\"designated spots\\" where exposition is done.  Especially with Kyle explaining to Sarah what cyborgs are, he does so in a really cautious and quiet manner, since he knows that the Terminator is looking for him.<br /><br />The logic behind time travel is not only established well, but like any good movie, the story and characters actually follow through that logic.  An example would be with time travel.  Only organic masses can travel through time, thus why the Terminator and Kyle arrive naked when they come into LA circa 1984, and when Kyle explains to a police psychiatrist why he couldn't bring back any advanced weaponry back to the past.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />With this movie being a sci-fi action/thriller entry, the action movies are top-notch.<br /><br />Since the characters are developed well, these make the action scenes that much more tense.  Among the best scenes in this has to be when the Terminator enters the Tech Noir club and finds Sarah Connor.  You see Kyle emerge and fire many shotgun shells into the cyborg and it doesn't stop him.  Also, this scene helps establish how much of a cold, ugly entity the Terminator is when he ends up gunning down a few people at the club during the firefight.<br /><br />Let's not forget the iconic scene where the Terminator assaults the police station Kyle and Sarah are kept in.  This scene marks how terrifying the Terminator is since not even over two dozen armed police officers could stop him, and shows how creative Kyle is when he's faced with danger and isn't in a position to fight.<br /><br />The action scenes also show Sarah and Kyle as vulnerable characters, which make you root for them even harder as the movie runs.  Kyle gets shot a few times and towards the end, gets worn down from all the combat to where Sarah has to push him into \\"snapping back into it.\\"<br /><br />The chase scene near the end also enhances the Terminator's characteristic of being unstoppable and of Kyle's creativity, since the Terminator survives a head-on collision with an 18-wheel tanker truck and Kyle has to see if one pipe bomb can stop a cyborg driving a tanker truck.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY<br /><br />Adam Greenberg's cinematography for this was perfect.  The shots of at the time current day Los Angeles look gritty and claustrophobic, helping to enhance the feeling of dread and tension in this movie.  I thought it was perfect to have the final fight take place in a factory loaded with robotic assembly machines, helping to further the feeling of industrialized, metallic terror.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS<br /><br />While some special effects have shown their age (such as the walking Terminator skeleton near the end and of the Terminator's face when one of his eyes are damaged), other effects still look good today.  I though one of the best-looking effects in that movie is when the Terminator does some self-surgery on his arm after getting in gun battles with Kyle, and you see the inner workings of his cyborg arm.  This was simultaneously gross and impressive to look at.  Even with the effects that could have aged better, the special effects overall help the movie greatly than harm it.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Brad Fiedel's soundtrack for this movie is one of the best I've ever heard in cinema, whether it be live-action or animated.  Some may complain that the music is \\"dated,\\" but I think it matches the tone and style of the movie perfectly.  Most of the music on here is made from keyboard synthesizers, and all of it is instrumental.  The soundtrack perfectly shows that a genius with minimal resources can make something brilliant.  The mechanized, metallic beats and dread-laden synth-layers are superb, especially in the scenes where Kyle has a flashback to when he fought giant war machines and automated gunships and during the end fight in the factory.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />This is not a movie for the kids, since there's quite a few scenes in the beginning with male nudity, some scenes of nasty gore, and a tastefully-done sex scene between Kyle and Sarah.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />The Terminator is easily among James Cameron's brightest jewels in his filmography.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Unfortunately I am a girl. Generally stupid and crude humor, but I did laugh a few times. It was worth $4 to rent for a group of people to watch. Not a fun date night movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|kids love it, good action without the gore.  why do i need 12 more words to complete my review i
B00632HWOG|1.0|After allowing the update it is useless. Won't load any emails. Would rather use previous ap....at least it worked well!
B004Y6MIXS|5.0|Very durable and reliable. I have been using it for nearly a year with no issues.  It has also worked well for packet capture and packet injection.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|It's absolutely fantastic!! It's easy to use, easier than I thought and it looks great!!  I would definitely recommend Invicta as a collection brand, I now own two divers watches and I love them both.  These are affordable and great lookin watches!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book fell right into place where war of the worlds left off. Looking forward to more great books like this from Mr. Follett !!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I've always been a huge fan of Pete Townshend and The Who. Only the Beatles and Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys rank as high in the rock-pop firmament in my opinion, so it's nice to see this memoir come along. I'll be sitting at my computer with the book in hand for many months to come checking out all the references, looking at YouTube clips, Google Maps, Wikipedia entries. I discovered with Keith Richards' Life that that's the way to do justice to books like these. Pete takes us through his childhood and formative years, hooking up with John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey, various iterations of The Who, etc., and on into the 80s and 90s when he was involved with numerous projects (and a couple solo albums) I know very little about, and feel a pressing need to check out. As Pete wrote this himself, without an excellent ghostwriter like Richards had, I would say the prose is a little flat, but it is honest. Townshend has been in the literary world for some time; he was an editor at Faber in the 80s and 90s. I do feel there are a few gaps. In other books about The Who, and in a TV interview with Pete I think, I've run across much more vivid descriptions of the first encounter with and hiring of Keith Moon. This book treats it perfunctorily, and as kind of an echo of the Beatles' Pete Best/Ringo situation. They had to kick out an older drummer at the request of new management. Pete feels bad about that, but I miss the description that sticks in my mind of a flaming red-haired Moon accosting them and saying \\"I can play drums much better than that geezer there.\\" I also wonder why Shepherd's Bush isn't mentioned more; I thought that was the London neighborhood most identified with The Who; here it's Acton, which looks to be close (a bit west) but not exactly the same. I've also read that \\"Tommy\\" was the result of Kit Lambert's pressure on Pete to think bigger; here Pete takes credit for the idea himself. Ultimately, at least for people like me who think of Townshend as a genius, the pages fly by too quickly. We do get a pretty good sense of how he thinks and how he set himself up with synthesizers and studios to compose all the things he has; one can't help but feel envious. You almost want a Volume Two to dig deeper into some parts. But I guess that will be the job of other biographers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved these books read all three in two weeks! And I have a 5 year old and 3 year old! I hope to get Greys side of the story :)

B007TK77QE|5.0|This was an excellent read with good humour some twists and turns that made you want to keep reading. Was certainly worth reading.

B005ZUR724|1.0|Just bought a kindle fire hd and I haven't even been able to play the game since I payed seven dollars for it. Every time I try to play it just says you need to update the game to log in and as far as I know there is no way to update it. Thanks for the support Gameloft....I'll go back to playing on my Iphone...
B003UESJ9M|5.0|its awesome i just wish she didn't die in the end it's sad that way but shes great in it i will watch it again
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I like the game but do they really have to give such hard missions??? REALLY!?!? COME ON!!! How can you possibly get 35 scientist High fives... IN ONE GAME!?!? EXACTLY!! YOU CANT! I like it but put easier missions.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|So much fun with all the strategy and action envolved! Id definetly recommend this game to strategy lovers cause this game is all that
B00197YZ7M|5.0|I really enjoyed the Bridges of Madison County. It was mailed quickly and I received it two days before I was expecting it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Legal thrillers are my favorite reading passtime.  John Grisham never disappoints.  This novel takes place close to home - the &#34;Southern District of Virginia&#34;.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|Album has some good songs but not as solid as some of her past stuff.  I would say it's weaker than her last four, but still good.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Just love the show. The item shipped quickly. The item received was the exact item described. Yessssss Yessssss Yesssssss. Go JO JO Go
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I love the Bourne movies and just because Matt Damon was not in this one it is still a great film about the way the government has people in these programs and how they are basically druggies by the government to follow commands , I thought it was very well done , already gave a spoiler so that's all .
143353083X|5.0|Somehow I feel I can go deeper into the Word when I read the ESV, perhaps because this translation comes closer to what the original authors intended to write. Other translations with more colloquial language are easier to understand and are great for new believers but many times are too one dimensional. This bible (compact edition) is beautifully designed and the study notes are extremely helpful for understanding almost each and every verse. It is also a much more manageable size than the original edition and sits comfortably on the bedside table.
0316227706|5.0|for all you dog lovers this book is AMAZING, make you smile and laugh! fantastic pictures of dogs underwater, we love it and everyone that comes over always ends up laughing on the couch looking through the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am recommending this book to everyone I know, it's the best future/science fiction I've read since Ray Bradbury in high school.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I usually enjoy John Grisham but found this book not up to his usual standard. Maybe I am tired of jailhouse stories but I found this one a bit boring and would not recommend it to my women friends. Maybe macho men would have enjoyed this one more. I would not have chosen this one if I had known it was about prison and prisoners.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is one now one of my favorite Tom Clancy books. I was unable to put my kindle down, I just found myself lost in the book.<br />I would consider this Clancy fans new and old.<br />There will most likely be people that review this and complain and pick at little tiny flaws, but those are people that obviously people that can't just enjoy a good book, reading isn't about looking for what the writer messed up on, or if it was ghost written.<br />Sit down with Threat Vector and let it take you into the Ryan universe.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Product works really well. Transmits good quality sound and the AUX input sounds just as good as cd quality. Good product and is easy to use.
B009CGAUW6|4.0|I like this game; it's one of the first games we've bought that's difficult enough that the adults will be genuinely interested, but easy enough for the kids to play.  My 5-year old can ALMOST play it without help.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed the more difficult, more expensive D&D games (Ravenloft, Drizzt).  This is vaguely similar - move heroes around and kill monsters - but much simpler.  Gameplay summary: take turns moving your hero around the board exploring rooms; each room has one random monster of a certain difficulty level; if you kill the monster, you get treasure; accumulate a certain amount of treasure and return to the center of the board.  There are four hero types to choose from, each has certain strengths and weaknesses; some are better against higher level monsters, others can get around the board easier.  Higher level monsters provide more treasure, but the heroes capable of defeating the higher level monsters need more treasure to win.<br /><br />It takes about 30-60 minutes to play.<br /><br />The game components are almost entirely cardboard... sturdy enough, but I felt like the heroes would have been better as wood/plastic.  The box has no storage elements, so the many cards / marking tokens can get jumbled together between plays; you'll want some baggies, rubber bands, or the like so you don't have to resort everything every time you play.<br /><br />A good value in the $20-30 range.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All of these books are awesome. They keep you read and turning page after page until it's done. I can't believe how this book ends! Are you kidding me! I can't wait for the next book
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Well done story that deserves a second look to pick up nuances missed first time.<br /><br />Quality of DVD is excellent.

B009GENZKS|4.0|This story is fun from beginning to end and I recommend this to those who enjoy yelling for the good guys.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book is a solid latter chapter in the Harry Bosch chronicles. He is winding down his career but just can't let go. A compelling character. One of my favorites....

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season (though the mid-season cliff-hanger had me up in arms!) Don't want to hand out spoilers, but at least one person who really needed to die did (though another person that didn't got nommed...but that's life in the zombie apocalypse and you wouldn't have a show without people you like getting killed.)<br /><br />So, watch this and get caught up before they roll out the new episodes in February.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Kept my interest beginning to end (which I didn't see coming).  Get this one as soon as possible.  You'll be glad you did.
0307346617|5.0|Read this from start to finish as soon as I got it. Was up until 2am, had to force myself to take food breaks. Excellent character development, excellent examination of modern society and politics, and zombies. Can't beat that.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Absolutely disliked this book.  It was trash and I could not believe it was on the best seller list.  Would not recommend it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and enjoyed it then, never believing for a minute it could be made into a movie.  The book was even more enjoyable the second time and the movie lost nothing in the translation.
B003CSV7TK|4.0|This show is great for the whole family, warm story, and has lots of laughs. The Actors for the movie seem to just make the show!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Liked it a lot, very funny. lots of topical humor.  Did not expect it to be this funny.  Would recommend it.
B005W0ARFQ|5.0|Another great read in the life of the intrepid private eye Bernie Gunther, he of the wisecracks and cynical perspective of the world. Kerr's blending of historical facts of the loathsome SS period in Germany's history with the fictitious Bernie who somehow always manages to survive the machinations of more powerful men is  a powerful  read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a rare dramatic performance of the highest level.  Having the privilege to revisit each or any episode, deepens my admiration and enjoyment of the finer offerings of the current entertainment media.

B008L5FFP6|4.0|Pretty great album and worth the buy. There a few songs that really get stuck in your head, \\"Bones\\" is now one of my favorites. I love the sound these guys have and look forward to hearing more from them
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Keeps you interested and in suspense. If you are still watching the show in Season 3 you've gotten past the gore factor. The story line continues to evolve and despite a lot of blood and violence, it's about human behavior, relationships, morality and more.
0393316041|5.0|Mr. Feynman integrated his humorous into his writing. This book contains fewer amounts of math equations, science proper noun compare to other scientist's autobiography. Thus, it is easy to understand for any age groups of people. A lot of people could not understand about reading a math or science book. If you are one of them, \\" Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\\" should become your first reading. The author showed connection between theories and real life. You may discover many of math equations, science theorems that apply in life. After finish reading this book, you will see your life differently. Mr. Feynman has proven how wonderful life could be if you keep looking at one thing from new perspectives. This book is not only a boring autobiography of a scientist, but also is a combination of life and theories.
1439156816|5.0|One idea I took from this book (among many) ... write 1,000 words per day.  Priceless advice.  Since doing 1,000 words per day some of the most cherished mini-stories within me have come to life.<br /><br />I gave this book as a gift to my best friend from grade school, high school and college when he said he wanted to start writing.  That's how much I think of the book.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This was so funny. My husband and I had a family Christmas Party (adults) we watched it that evening, some guests spent the night and we watched it again the next morning over bagels and coffee and laughed even more
B00AMS4H2M|5.0|You can't be a fan of hiphop and NOT buy this album! This is easily the greatest album of 2012, hands down! Tip is the best rapper in the game right now and this whole album is FIRE! So why don't you have it yet? Click that buy button!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I felt this one of his best stories. I read each one as they are available, and enjoyed it from start to finish!

B004LDLI0S|3.0|I'm 58% through the Kindle Edition. I've read the Murphy translation and Manheim translation. I really don't see this as better. The first 10% or so seemed easier to read... then came the typos. It's not just distracting; it's confusing. Lordy, Murphy has the English skills of a sixth grade boy. Murphy can't even number (1, 2, 3...) the points that Hitler numbered.<br /><br />We badly need a good translation of \\"Mein Kampf.\\" Murphy gets a C; his is no better than the free ones (several places on the internet). I would suggest that the next translator introduce several levels of headings and subheadings and split most of the paragraphs.<br /><br />As for the book itself: It's boring, badly organized, and wordy in all English translations. There are some real nuggets, but you'll have to dig for them in a mountain of dry sand.<br /><br />Hitler understood race and the Jews. This book is strongly and consistently anti-Semitic (meaning anti-Jewish).

B009IQG5LK|3.0|Like a child born of great privilege and pedigree, 1990's \\"Dick Tracy\\" was given every advantage and afforded some of the finest talents.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|Just like Galaxy Quest, this is poking fun at Star Trek.  It is reading Star Trek from the regular crew members point of view.  The part that I liked best was after the main story is over, the writer has several short stories that deal with side stories that are in the main story.  If you are a fan of Star Trek in any way, then you will want and will like this book.
B005723JSQ|5.0|It kept a smile on my face all the time! It's the classic Sophie Kinsella novel. a beautiful common girl and a handsome gentleman. If you haven't read any book of this author I truly reccommend this one. Is hilarious and sweet.
0345803485|1.0|Where to start? I am a twenty year old male college student. I am doing excellent in life, and I'm aspiring to be a successful novelist. However, what I want more than anything in the universe is to be loved by a woman who is out of this world and lovely in every way. Someone who would take me into her arms, embrace me, and tell me that everything will be okay. I worry about finding such a person quite a lot. And reading this book has made me worry even more. MUCH more. As I read through this poorly written mess, I repeatedly asked myself \\"Does Anastasia really have no sense of self respect? Would she really allow herself to be put in a situation where some masochist tells her when and what to eat, and when and where to sleep, and what to wear, and how to act, and to not talk to any other men - simply because this man is \\"attractive\\" and has \\"impossibly gray eyes?\\" What does it matter if he's attractive? What will Anastasia do when Christian's beauty fades?\\" Some people say that I'm simply missing the point of the novel, as it is not supposed to be a literary masterpiece. However, I can't help but reply by saying that whenever I read a book, I expect to be edified with good storytelling, mature and believeable prose, and intrinsic quality. 50 shades of grey had none of this. What makes me the most upset about this book is the way people have reacted to it. Christian Grey is every woman's \\"dream man\\" or \\"fantasy,\\" according to the women who posted reviews of this book on this site. Are you saying that a young man like myself will not receieve the unfailing and passionate devotion Christian blindly receieves from the women he seduces simply because I am not a billionare masochist with white skin and \\"impossibly grey eyes?\\" I would treat a woman right and would never do anything to hurt her. I would drive her out of her mind with my passion and love. I would satisfy her immensely with sex. I would complete her. Yet...I don't receieve the same praise the women on this site are giving to Christian Grey simply because I don't LOOK like Christian Grey, or am a billionare, or am a deranged, sexed up fiend. I can't believe women would prefer a man like this over a man like me. This book has seriously broken my heart.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It is the worst final I've read. It is predictable and even the sex scenes get me bored. Maybe could been better if the author waits to grow a little more the characters development to publish the final book. If you are curious just read the first book. there is another books in the same line (dom sex) that are better written.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I loved the way it looked on the picture, BUT I didn't think the cover would be flimsy.<br /><br />MUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE COVER!! It looks like it could rip easily, IF, not taken care properly.<br /><br />I'd give this product a good one to two years of use and it will bound to fall apart.<br />NOW, If you're looking for something long-term, then you'll have to invest in something above the range of $35.00
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It is bad literally speaking , but the story is one of the many women fantasies, including me. So I liked it!
B004EKCNMA|3.0|Overall, I felt that Disney took their usual liberties with a storyline, and turned this into a darker, more depressing film with random bits of unnecessary action. Instead of feeling the holiday spirit, I just felt scared and depressed.<br /><br />On the plus side, the animation was cool and the cast solid.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More sex scenes, the author tries to include a drama/mystery story line but it wasn not good enough for me.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Cute application. It's nice to kill time with it if you're waiting for someone or waiting to be seen in a doctor's office. The drawback is when you fail a level and game over appears, you cannot do anything to start over until the application decides its okay for you to start again. Backing out and going back in doesn't even seem to clear the app to allow you to start over. Kinda weird. Overall though, it's a really cute game and I do love to play it!
B003B02PFO|5.0|This was quite a change from his usual novels.  I didn't think I would like it at first, because it was a Christmas story, but it was wonderful.  A great time of the year to buy it, and a great Christmas gift for someone.
B00881PPTO|3.0|This application is helpful trying to approximate what tickets might cost you in the short term, but long term pricing and ease of use is not helpful with this application. Difficult to navigate this on Droid 3. Thankfully this was a FAOTD and I didn't lose money in getting the Pro version. I haven't uninstalled it but only because I've not got time to do it yet.<br />Honestly, you can go to your select airlines and sometimes get your flights cheaper by purchasing them direct instead of using these 3rd party applications.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My pre-schooler loves this game. A simple, solid kid friendly game. If your child plays with your device this game is a solid choice for those moments waiting in the lobby.
B0081336FO|4.0|2nd season is more gritty and much darker. serious most of the time. my favorite was Hounds of the Baskerville.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Our granddaughters have watched this DVD since they were little.  It has become a Christmas tradition for our family. We have an annual &#34;Polar Express Sleep-over&#34; complete with hot chocolate (with as much whipped cream as you can pile into a mug) cookies and whatever else they can think of.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|picture is amazing in HD, and the story won't let you stop watching. you will probably try to watch the entire season in a day if you can. Can't wait for season 2 to be out!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this g5 game!!  the story was fun &amp; exciting. I love the monkey because he really helped. great graphics-slight zoom but you didn't need too much. the hidden objects were hidden just right..not hard and not easy. I love most of g5 games &amp; this is one. I would recommend this to anyone. no timers and plenty of hints if you need them..
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I guess i'm joining the large number of people who are shocked regarding the pressing issues with this set..I sure hope EMI fixes the problem. What a shame.......
B004LWZW42|1.0|Is it prequel? Is it reboot? Answer: It's a little too much of both, and not enough of neither.<br /><br />I guess it's a new genre: The Preboot.<br /><br />This film is bad, and not within the comic book context...it's just a piss-poor film. Trust me; when they throw a hot, half-dressed blonde on screen every few scenes, and I STILL don't care...the movie's in a bad way. Even some very good actors can't redeem this farce. This wasn't just phoned in...it was phoned in over tin cans tied to string.<br /><br />I'm honestly trying to find a way to review this without massive spoilers, but it's proving x-tremely (get it) difficult.<br /><br />For now, all I can say is this movie is inexcusable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Still reading - about half way thru - very good read - will definately see movie when it comes out in Feb. 2013. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is both my favorite holiday movie and one of my top ten movies of all time. It is funny, heartbreaking and filled with love all at the same time.  This movie has been so under appreciated. The Soundtrack is so much fun also.<br />I want to make certain that you know this movie does have nudity and adult themes. Not suitable for children. There are several story arcs and one of them would be loved by children, but other arcs are too adult. Enjoy!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the best shows on TV, period.  Every member of the cast knocks it out of the park with their acting.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|Story and acting were first rate. The main character was soooo negative that it was a bit of a downer. The end sucked all the way around.
B009VL28W2|5.0|I pre-ordered and got a discount and it was shipped early on released date (tuesday) and got it by thursday!
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Been chatting with others online about what happened in this movie.  I watched it once, then again immediately after.  I guess the feeling of mystery and curiosity made this movie for me.  Actors were perfect.  Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the topic doesn't lend itself to moral interpretation, just puzzlement.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved the story line. But sad that the next book comes out In A year! This is a must read if you are a fan of Percy Jackson.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a great book, and so interesting it is difficult to put down.  Certainly the story serves what I believe to be its original purpose:  not to waste time, or to abuse it. Time is a wonderful gift, and this book will leave an important message regarding its use, imprint on the mind, and memory.  Thank you, Mr. Albom, for this wake-up call!
B004N6369Y|5.0|Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.
0316223239|4.0|Although in my opinion this book starts out slow and takes a chapter or two of acclimation to appreciate, the effort is well worth it. Stick with it, you will be glad you did. It is an impressive task the author took on, writing from the viewpoint of a 5 year-old, never stepping out of the role. The story is engaging as well as horrifying at the same time. I thought too that the author did an excellent job with different characters in the book. They are realistically flawed as we are all of course. If you get a chance, pick this book up, you will not be disappointed.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Any time Joe A. sits down and remembers to be realistic about things good things happen. His is a distinctive voice in the genre today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.
0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n<br />Review by Anthony T. Riggio<br /><br />I am sometimes accused of reading too much and perhaps I do, but I came across this book upon a recommendation from a friend, who also reads abundantly. I ordered it from Amazon and when it arrived I put it down to finish two books ahead of it on my reading list.<br /><br />When I started to read it, I was immediately captured by the exquisite writing style of Zaf&oacute;n in his Gothic tale of The Shadow of the Wind. Even though the book was originally written in Spanish, the translation by Lucia Graves was outstanding and was easily read by an American who only speaks English.<br /><br />Mr. Zaf&oacute;n writes in a style that has been absent for so long in many of the books published today. The book captures you and draws you in to its complex tale which transcends two generation in Civil War Spain and its aftermath.<br /><br />It is a story of love and identity projections with a memorable cast of character which support this terrific story. Interestingly, it is about books and their devotees. It is a mature story of love, both romantic and familial, with some violence within relationships and a sinister anti-hero who is extremely violent. Stephen King described it as \\"one gorgeous read\\" and I could not use a better adjective. Read this book! You will not have regrets.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.
1594488886|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Haled Hosseini is a book for both men and women who are caught up in the illusory struggle of gender dominance. The book is extremely well written and I found it more moving than \\"The Kite Runner\\", which will always be one of my favorite books.<br /><br />Hosseini's style is relaxed and not complicated. He has an almost Hemingwayesque style in his presentation and reads very fast. He includes cultural and Islamic words which broadens our experience and also lends to the authenticity of the overall experience.<br /><br />The book is about the human spirit both male and female and exposes the reader to the sometimes cruelty and joys of life in the Afghanistan culture. Like Kite Runner it exposes you to the extremes of the Taliban way of life and the hijacking of a peaceful religion by radicals with a personal agenda. It also accents the tragedy of the male dominance at the expense of the women in this culture.<br /><br />As a political observation, it is hoped that the women who live in this oppressive environment will one day temper the apparent ugliness, to westerners, this culture demonstrates.
B00009RAJI|5.0|A Classic collector's item by one of the most dynamic bands that has ever been assembled. This is a must recording.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay I only read this because I was tired of everyone talking about it. I couldn't listen to the radio, watch the news, or enter a public rest room without hearing people talk about this book.<br /><br />It was actually pretty good :-) It was a quick read--took all of three lunch breaks to read.  I enjoyed it and the way it ended made it so I had to buy the next book.  Not as crazy as people hyped it up to be, but overall a good read.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have the free version and I love it.  Simple to use would recommend to everyone.  I like that I can choose the days it shows am pm I can choose any songs I can change the color of the screen.  So yeah love it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all his books and hate having to wait to read another.  I really liked the four books he wrote about the Lincoln Lawyer and other three.  Harry is always finding a lost lover the older he gets.
B001J9Q44C|3.0|This book was a little wordy with all the rants and raves. You may tend to skip several pages as you go along.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book and I can't wait for the next book to come out! Yay, great job!
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Was an easy read. It was a required read but I would read it anyway. Kept me interested the whole time.
B008N1V11U|5.0|i think this is one of the funnest apps on the market it has really good grahphics and on the kindle fire it is great
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It was very easy to use. It gave me the right answers, and it was very accurate. The way it was set up was good, so I don't really have anything bad to say about it.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Don't waste your time on this movie it lacks a plot and is super boring.  There are many better movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in one day. It was fantastic<br />Love the content and twists and turns. only wish I could get the third one
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This continues the Clancy legacy. Wide in scope, excellent in presentation, one of the best I've read this year.  I love it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|As an iPhone user, I expected the Facebook app for my Kindle to be identical to my Facebook app on my phone.  I was stunned at how bad this version of the app is.  Who at Facebook thinks kindle users want to be restricted to the 10 most recent news feed updates?? There will certainly be hundreds of thousands of new disappointed FB users next week when gifts are unwrapped unless FB releases a robust version of this app instead of this buggy shoddy version currently available.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Probably one of the better ideas for a young adult series I've seen in a long time.  Really caugt fire with the general public.  The pacing of the book is great like The Road, and you really care about the characters.  Of the three, it's by far the best.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Simply wonderful!  Everyone needs to find thee videos and watch them.  All thier music is great and I especially love their Christmas music
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The conclusion to the trilogy.  Everyone had to grow up and there are some good twists in the end of the book.  It will interesting to see how they film it.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Excellent re-make and just as entertaining as the Classic Version.  I love the Greek Myth type Movies and this was well worth the buy to go with my collection of these types of movies.<br />Packaged well and delivered in excellent timing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you haven't read all threed of these already, get to it!  This book is structured much like the first one, and all the problems of the first book are growing for all the characters.  It was not as heart wrenching to me as the first one, but that can happen with bridge books.  It's a quick read and the whole trilogy is a brilliant idea executed pretty well by Collins.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Love the movie and into these type of Greek Myth stories.  Came in excellent packaging and works great and service and time was excellent on receiving it. :)
B0034G4OUY|3.0|This movie was okay, typical story line, kind of like walking tall. It have good action and a cool car, and was definitely worth the 4 dollars I paid for it. If you like the rock give it a try, if not then I would say to pass.
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|I loved this movie and now I can watch it in my video library as many times as I want.
B009CPE424|1.0|We tried watching this movie for a family film night. Everyone agreed that it was 1 of the worst on a management to the movies we have ever seen. I like kids movies most of the time, but I have no idea how this film got such good reviews. It was awful.
B008N1V11U|5.0|best game i have played in years it is super fun and i could not put it down for a minute
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book with a great plot.  Hard to put down once you start reading it.  I love Bosh and I like his philosophy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is an awesome TV series that I cannot get enough of. I love the premise of the show and feel that the acting is really good. Accessing the show via amazon.com is really great and the flexibility rocks!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|iv played all the games and this is the best one. this game should be above minecraft in top payed section of the app store but its not. lets fix that and give this game some 5 stars
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Awesome and addicting game that I would recommend.  It adds some creativity by combining some themes of the past games.  Also as usual the app always updates with new levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Every word Colleen Hoover writes captivates you and takes you on a roller coaster of emotions. Reading Hopeless I guarantee you will laugh, you'll cry, you will be angry, hurt, and you will without a doubt be completely consumed by the most scorching first kiss scene-without even kissing- you will ever read in any book! The actual love scenes will also do you in because they are the most intimate, beautiful, and breathtaking love scenes I have ever read. You become the characters and feel everything they do as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Sky is a strong, independent young woman who believes she knows who she is and what she wants. She hasn't shed a tear since she was five years old. She also has never been able to feel anything with any boy her entire life. All she feels is emptiness with every touch, kiss, or even look a boy gives her; that is until she meets Dean Holder. From the moment Sky sees Holder her feelings are awakened. Holder tries his hardest to get closer to Sky because no one has every understood him like she does. Sky lets this gorgeous boy into her heart, but by letting him in feelings and memories are brought to the surface that she wishes would have stayed hidden. Holder holds a secret that will completely turn her entire world upside down.<br /><br />Holder is everything you would want in a guy. He is gorgeous, perfectly flawed and above all: passionate. As Sky says, he is passionate about life, about love, about his words and of course, about Sky. I dare say I love him more than I love Will Cooper!! That is saying a lot!!<br /><br />This book is intense, passionate, gut wrenching, and at parts, even a little painful to read. It will keep you guessing and the big twist is probably one of the best I have ever read and I totally didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Even though at times this book is deep and dark, it is also filled with so many sweet, funny, and tender moments that I believe I highlighted a third of the book!<br /><br />Buy this bookIMMEDIATELY. It is easily one of the best books I have ever read and is going onto my Instant Book Hangover shelf with the rest of Colleen Hoover's novels. If you haven't read her other books, Slammed and Point of Retreat, well buy those too because I PROMISE you will be an instant fan of her writing.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|If you like Picoult's books, definitely read this one.  Her books are interesting on so many levels.  I've read most of her books and this one is by far her best.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Adventure/fantasy is my favorite book genre but there are few books that keep me interested past a chapter or two as many are just too cliche .  This is one of the few refreshing books which make my list.  Kudos to Joe for creating a world which feels unique to his writing and not a xerox of the atypical lord of the rings setting, and weaving in some very subtle parallels to mid/late 1700s America and Spain/England in the 1600s.  Excellent pace and good character developement...realistic without digging too deep.  All told, i would recommend this to anyone who liked the &#34;The Name of the Wind: The Kingkiller Chronicle&#34;, &#34;The Crown Conspiracy (The Riyria Revelations) series&#34; or of course Tolkein.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|My grandson and granddaughter loves this game..ifs fun, challenging and animation is great. I would recommend for children at least for the ages of 6 to 9
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I have the printed version of this standard reference, and thought that having it on my iPad third generation would be a good addition.  Unfortunately, while it will work on my much lower definition screen Kindle Fire, with repeated attempts to download it for my much higher definition iPad, it won't load and as such is....USELESS.  Buy this one in print, ONLY!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My grandson loves this game also, he tells me that it is alot of fun, and at the same time it is challenging for him..he hates to have to put it down and take a break from it. Age 6
B001ANSSDC|5.0|As a man who has suffered long and hard with mental illness, I get Pat Peoples. I get the struggles with women, I get the torment that comes from triggers, and I get the fact that in life we have to find silver linings in order to survive. This book is beautifully written and though Pat is a relatively simple character, his genuineness wants you to root for him. This is a tale about underdogs and people that have suffered through great personal tragedies, but the book was worth every penny. Different than the movie but both the book and movie are absolutely heartwarming and brilliantly made.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love the game. Best version I have played yet! Many different levels that will keep you entertained for hours if you let it.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|i chose it because he is including other artists to participate.<br />though, i would not recommend it for young children because of of certain words used for adults..<br /><br />only problem is that i would like to order another but amazon says i already ordered one.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I LIKED THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH IT TOOK MY GREAT GRANDSON TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.  HE LOVED IT TOO.
B0086700CM|5.0|my whole family is addicted! fun to play and add new characters. it would be nice to have more goals to reach.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Coming from a new harlequin series I thought this was a great way to start. Even tho I pre-ordered this as free on my kindle, this is one that I would have picked up in book form at the store and bought.
B000V7J82S|5.0|Got this for my son for Christmas and it is KILLING me not to play it now.....hurry up Santa so I can play this...He is gonna love it
1455519650|5.0|The book was delivered promptly and was in great condition.  I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and this book was just as entertaining as his others that I have read.<br /><br />Cecilia Underwood
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was an entertaining and somewhat humorous movie.  My husband and I enjoyed it but had to excuse the kids half way through.  The was too much aggressiveness for smaller children in my opinion.  My 6 yr pld son actually asked if he could watch something else.<br />My husband and I finished the movie later and I have to say I really enjoyed it.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I love Liam Neeson , I could just watch him read the phone book . The rest of the cast was very good . And the plot good.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love the look of an old book. But better than that is the durability of this cover. It is sturdy and well put together. Great look, great functionality - winner!
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Should not have to pay for HD when video quality was SD<br />So was the recourse here. Do I have any?
B004CFET56|5.0|I love Elvis Blue Christmas! Do glad to get it as an MP3 album. I listened to this as a child and its so nice to have it again.
0385536828|3.0|Like his last novel, Solar, Sweet Tooth will keep you interested until the end, mostly on the strength of McEwan's writing, and you must read to the end to appreciate the cleverness of the story. As a spy novel it is not particularly suspenseful, since no one is ever in any real danger. As a love story, it is not particularly moving, since neither of the (two main) lovers are that likable and both seem fairly superficial in their attractions. As a McEwan fan, I found this book to be about the caliber of Solar, probably a lot of fun to write, but nothing approaching the the depth of Saturday or Atonement or even On Chesil Beach. But it is still recognizably McEwan, and definitely worth reading if you need a fix before his next great book.
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I read extensively and have decided that when editors fail, it is up to the reader to do the job the editor failed to do AND STOP READING !  This was poorly written drivel.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Love this classic!  Cary Grant is superb and Monty Wooly is like icing on the cake.  Wouldn't be Christmas without this movie
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Its a fun game and it is not very difficult either. I would recommend it to people who like Call of Duty.
B009CPES4I|5.0|The acting was great, the story line was interesting and it was just a wonderful movie. We highly recommend it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I had not read Tom Sawyer for a very long time and decided to reread it because the sixth grade sub job was using the book.  If you haven't read this book, it is a must!  There are many themes in addition to the racism!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Unfortunately not even Meryle Streep could save this movie.  Streep gave as much as possible, but the plot was dull and predictable.  Take a pass on this one for now and wait until it's free with Prime.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As I read this book I found myself intensely irritated with the characters, but I couldn't put the book down. I would read until I couldn't stand them anymore.  Then I would go back and pick it up because I needed to know more.  A good read!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Not really sure what the point of this remake was.  Put it more firmly in the &#34;Blade Runner&#34; universe. A lot of the set design worked toward that end, but a lot didn't, too. There's lots of rain, squalor, ethnic mixing, and neon, but none of BR's brooding noir romance.  Plus there's the whole weird &#34;Minority Report&#34; maglev highway scene ripoff.  And the robots (which they call &#34;synthetics&#34; just as in BR) all look like they're out of Will Smith's &#34;I, Robot&#34;.  It winds up being a confused mishmash of styles and ideas, with none of PKD's overarching intellectual dread. Colin's not too convincing in the role of a vulnerable hero.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's better or worse than the original film. It's different, and maybe worth seeing of you're a PKD completist. I am saying it lacks any kind of authorial vision or direction, and it falls down on that, a LOT.  Yeah, maybe action movies don't need that kind of integrity, maybe they're just supposed to be fun, but this isn't all that great as an action movie either.  PKD didn't write for action, he wrote nightmares of the constructed self, and this movie misses that target. It doesn't even seem to aim for it, which begs the question of why bother adapting a PKD story at all?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Keeps me up to date on weather changes. This app is very easy to use. A good idea to have to keep up on the weather.
B000I9UA30|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. liked Will Smith min fact all the actors were great. I llikes  the story line.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We love this game! My grandchildren love this game. It is entertainmnet for many ages. Good graphics. We love angry birds.
B0060D123K|5.0|I love how much of the original text from the Dickens classic was used in the movie.  The device of having the narrator (Gonzo) and his silly rat sidekick helped explain some of the finer points that would have gone over my 7 and 8-year-olds' heads otherwise.  Absolutely true to the essential message of this heartwarming story, the Muppets bring the lightness and humor and relatability that would be otherwise lacking in this tale, yet it remained touching enough that as usual, the death of Tiny Tim in the possible future timeline brought me to tears.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I saw the movie Lincoln and then had to read the book. Of course the book has a lot more detail over an expanded period of time than the movie, but this history is fascinating. So much I did not know, misunderstood or just didn't care about in history class. This book makes the history come alive, and now I see how very important it was.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Hard to believe the behind the scenes antics of these powerful men.  You learn an awful lot about how past presidents can affect the thoughts and actions of a sitting president, and of the tremendous ego and paranoia it must take to desire and hold that office.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|You've read about one orgasm why read about 100;  all the same description.  Tell the story, please.  and there could have been a good story if the author was not so hung up on orgasms
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is absolutely wonderful application, love the fact that it's portable, it's intuitive, and easy to use.  It is on every device I own, and I can't think of living/working without it!  Great for collaboration too!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|arrived in timely manor, nice product my daughter will enjoy this to help her with her hobby that she has been trying to achieve.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|The is a great free app for Android devices. It's very useful for analysing overlap between adjacent wi-fi networks.  By changing our wi-fi channels to avoid overlap with neighboring networkjs you can dramatically improve wi-fi speed and reliability.  In my experience many of the 'automatic' channel choices made by home routers are less than optimal. bear in mind that truly only channels 1, 6, and 11 don't have any overlap with each other. This tool helps demonstrate that and the effective range of your wireless router.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|So, for a second I thought they might like really try to make a Holmes story based on one of the canonical tales and just spruce it up for the new tech and the 'buddy film' style of the last Downey movie. This isn't it. It's no Hound of the Baskervilles, but it basically takes a short story that was meant as a swan song for Holmes and adds a huge amount of story in front of it and then thumbs its nose at reality a bit at the end.  The performances are all stellar, the special effects are bit overdone. Still a decent movie and leaves me wanting the next one.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Wow...just like a good book....I could not stop watching the series to see what would happen next!  It was excellent.  The costumes were magnificant, the actors were spot on w/their charcter!  This series would make an excellent gift.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I liked this movie and found it portrayed the characters and events from the original source books much better than I expected from something that was coming through Disney.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just like every other Rapp story...excellent. great story line, the usual hectic action and the good guys win. Loved it
B002ZG999U|3.0|Is fuzzy as hell and the final ending is rather silly.  Basically there is a team of mercenaries, they do jobs, they have some loose canons, one of their lose canons betrays them, everything gets blown up on the guy who hired the loose canon, lots of bullets and bombs and in the end the mercenaries take the loose canon back into the fold.  Pretty much that's it.  Some ok performances and a surprise cameo and the rest is bullets, car chases, explosions etc. Plot is an excuse here... but its paced to keep things moving fast. An ok filler movie if you want a film that doesn't require you to think.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Pitch Perfect wasn't what I thought it would be.  The main storyline was alright, with the exception of the angry teenager with a dad who didn't understand her, blah, blah.  That's been done to death and this girl is in College, but fourteen years old.  In the beginning of the movie, it seemed like she was channeling Kristen Stewart.<br /><br />I did enjoy the music, when they weren't repeating &#34;The SIgn&#34; by Ace of Base over and over and over and over.  The songs from both groups were pretty good, especially from the girls' group at the end.<br /><br />The frequent mass projectile vomiting?  Not cute.  At all.  I seriously doubt they had that meaningful conversation - and sang - with that huge, smelly pile of vomit on the floor, that some of the girls were wearing.  Seriously, why is this considered comedy?  Ugh.  It's for that reason alone that I probably won't watch the movie again, despite how good some of the songs were.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I still like the original version of this movie better, but this remake has its good points and David Tenant's performance as the vampire hunter is a wonderful update of &#34;Peter Vincent' from a washed up tv horror movie presenter to a Las Vegas Goth & Stage Magic performer.
B0068FYZV6|5.0|I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND WHEN I ORDERED IT AND RECEIVED IT I COULDN'T WAIT TO SIT DOWN AND SEE IT AGAIN.  IT WAS GREAT.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great book. Kept me hooked the whole time. The main character in the astronaut version of MacGyver. I haven't read a novel in ages and this on got me all interested after It was recommended to me on a Space forums post. If you like space, science fiction with some real scientific base on it, this is the book to read.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I've enjoyed the Bourne series with Matt Damon, and would watch him again. But I truly love Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross. I'm happy that they expanded the story.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|A long, long, long ride, but I enjoyed it I enjoyed it more toward the end when the many seemingly disparate plot lines begane to be sewn together. The ending left me stunned and mumbling \\"Are you kidding me?\\".
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I've enjoyed the Iron Man series and can't wait until they do more. Winning it with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|The movie is too cluttered with fast action, and special effects, and not enough personal interaction and emotion for my tastes. The movie filned in some exotic locations, but far too little footage of the scenery. My personal choice for best Bond movies were the Roger Moore Bond movies, with Sean Connery second.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I grew up watching Gilmore Girls and it was great to get my set completed! Marathons of GG will be had this weekend! Thanks! :)
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Fairly entertaining, sometimes the plot is a little silly, such as climbing to the top of an &#34;about to launch&#34; Saturn 5 moon rocket, and jumping off of a skyscraper to travel in time. I hope there will be a MIB4.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|If you are a B Horror Movie lover...great twist from a children's flick perspective and lot's of funny moments! Enjoy
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|season one was groundbreaking in that it brought Jessica Lange to the TV but this season blows the balls off season 1.
B005LAII3U|2.0|First off. Amazons rating system of two stars, which I gave the film, means, \\"I don't like it\\", not \\"I hated it.\\" The only reason I didn't hate it was because the set designs were very good and the surroundings in hi def were decent. But, put that aside and the movie is a tiring act of emptiness. I was expecting Colin Farrell to put a hard edge spin on the Douglas Quade character but he looked lost, straining to look fearful, surprised and angry. Very disappointing acting by Farrell and the rest of the cast. I had heard that the story would not take place on Mars as the original did and figured that would detract somewhat. Well, it detracted a ton, and left the filmmakers scrambling to replicate a Bladerunner environment that visual looked good but emptied the core of the story.<br /><br />The whole feel of Rekall (that's how they spelled it)was lost. In the original Quade really seemed innocent, and his secret agent desires fully contradicted his \\"normal\\" life.\\" This film loses the dual memory concept and that in turn plays down the \\"fish out of water\\" excitement that should have driven the film. Both Biel and Beckensale were uninteresting and gave off zero sex appeal. I felt this era of film making would have given us a serious chick fight but the usual chop/cut style crap was thrown at us again.<br /><br />Worst of all was the villian. So bad that I not only don't remember his name but I don't care. And how many grueling scenes did we sit through of Quade almost being killed except that the killer needed to give fill explanations of why before doing so. Films always give some of that but this became annoyingly full throttle. Lots of gun fire but did you really care who got hit? It's bad when you can almost envision the film cameras nearby and the director yelling \\"go\\" as the action plays out.<br /><br />Although I have seen the somewhat campy original several times, I think I will now seek it out on blu ray and watch a real interesting sci fi film that had a gripping quality to it. Total Recall 2012 as it relates to the acting and script is a boring failure. Looking back, the original was pretty darn good.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I wasn't able to test this on the Kindle Fire; however, I did use it on my iPad and iPad Mini. It did not work well with the iPad - the sensitivity is off, making it hit or miss. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I like the idea of different size tips, but I don't recommend this for the iPad. I gave it four stars since I was not able to use it on the Kindle Fire. Please check someone else's review for information on that.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Nice story line and I like the way the author has inserted snippets of short stories that are ostensibly written by others, but are actually written by the author (of course, it's fiction).<br />Portions of the novel move slowly and there is, at times, more detail than I needed.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is very interesting and adventurous, I am kept ar the tip of mybed when I read it,  I love everything about. This book and reccomend it to ages !!!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|The info provided is priceless. It has changed how I view food for life. I will do all I can to incorporate this information into my eating program. Thanks for giving us the truth about wheat.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Just nice to have all three movies and the price was right - less than $10 per movie, and it came with an UltraViolet subscription so I can stream 'em from my iPad.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is cool.I was hooked within the first 5 minuets. so if u haven't bought it yet ur missing out on a jetpack joyride
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is one of the few pop artists that have talent today. While a lot of people use autotune Adele doesn't have to rely on it. She has a good voice live and the songwriting isn't too bad either. \\"21\\" isn't entirely pop though, Some songs are more soul and r&b crossover such as \\"Rumor Has It\\" and \\"He Won't Go\\" while others are slower piano ballads like \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Don't You Remember\\". Her first album \\"19\\" was good but \\"21\\" perfects everything. Someone like You (Live) is one of the best tracks and has an excellent vocal performance, the whole album's good. Overall, \\"21\\" is one of the best albums of 2011 and it's worth having in your music collection. Even if it's not your usual musical style, it's not usually what I listen to but I'm open minded many genres.
B002NNA9N0|4.0|If this movie doesn't make you want to better yourself in some way you're just beta as crackerjacks and you should probably go work at Mc Dons.
B008CP92ZO|2.0|Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but this storyline struck me more as cognizant infidelity than curious exploration. Aniston's character abandons her inhibitions in record time and is suddenly deaf, dumb, and blind to her husband's feelings. The story felt forced and as a result, lost much in the way of humor.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|really enjoyed it had read all the trilogy and movie was pretty true to the book except not as much about her life before the games.
B00006CXSS|5.0|You don't have to be a military or war buff to enjoy this series.  Damien Lewis is exceptional.  I've watched the entire series more than once!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This Bourne movie didnt have enough action scenes. I expected it to be on the same level as the previous Bourne movies.
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|This movie was over acted, there was too much soundtrack, lack of character development and Guy Pierce's character was ridiculous.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 7 year old loves this app.  She asks every day to check her ponies.  With the ability for parental controls I do not worry about her buying extras for it.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Non stop action!  Jeremy  renner did a great job.  Best of the Bourne movies by far!  Would watch this again.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This with the new Amazon kindle power plug works great my  kindle fire charges from 0 for 100% in 2 hours 30 mins. I have replaced the power cord 2 other time before this one. Frustrating but glad that is fixed.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love this CD!  This is a good mix of Maroon 5's music.  I listening to this a lot when I work out.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Got this for my kindle app on my phone.  Great story and setting, and the chapters were perfect little bite-sized chunks that I could ingest on breaks.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy should really be considered one movie. But if I had to choose a favorite, The Two Towers would be it. There is action, human drama, one of the best cinematic battle scenes (Helms Deep), plus the (spoiler alert) revelation of Gandalf the White.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|it's star wars, it's lego, it's and advent calendar.  what's not to love?<br />Lego star wars for the win!  Ho! Ho!  Ho!
B009ZE27US|5.0|that was asome the way it could tell your age and I have never seen one like that so that's the coolest app
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|like this movie despite being poorly directed and the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  However the message is worth it.
0316069434|4.0|It has been awhile since I've read Connelly's Bosch mysteries, but I do have them all. The Black Box is a natural continuation of the series with Harry and company being characters who still engage and develop. I especially enjoy mysteries that focus on the protagonist's character and thought processes as well as his/her relationships and other human qualities. Connelly does that very well - again.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|not to love about this &#34;classic&#34; series.  I like Harrison Ford a lot, he is a competent actor and the story is fun.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Many years ago, I saw the film version of this book, starring Richard Burton. It was fascinating. At the time, I didn't pay attention to the author but ran into his name often in recent years due to my new love of mysteries and espionage fiction. This is not an action driven book, although things do happen. There's little emphasis on &#34;blood and guts&#34; that we encounter contstanly today. What there is is strong characterizations, thoughtful description and exposition, and strong procedurals. This is a Cold War book, Connelly's first, I believe, however, even with the razing of &#34;the Wall&#34; and the breakup of the Soviet Union, I found this book a vivid 'rememberance of things past' as well as a mirror to events today.
0152023984|5.0|I love this book.  Great for both children and adults.  A classic.  Very highly recommended . . . . .
B0035HKWM6|5.0|I've always thought this was a classic Carrey film...where he does what he does best and that's act effectively weird.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this series! This is a great way to watch the show when you dont want to wait for it to come out on DVD. I watched all of season one in a few days to catch up for season 2.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is a great movie, and a great value.  4 different formats in one box, I wish all movies came like this!
B008458O3S|5.0|Great game. The puzzles are very challenging once you hit the bonus levels.<br />I enjoy watching the trains run around the tracks after finding the solution.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A fun read with surprising twists and turns. The book is comparable to other Grisham novels in that it is hard to put down.
B005OP7162|2.0|I considered this to be a walt disney type of show.  I am not into it.  Do not buy it.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Visually beautiful but the story was a little weak and the number of illogical/unscientific elements were annoying.  No outstanding acting roles.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read! Loved it. I highly recommend this book.<br />It grabs you as soon as you read the first chapter.
0689835604|4.0|I only glanced at this book, but it seemed perfect for my neice to read to her 5 month old baby.  Sent it as a Christmas gift.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|The first season is very addicting.  I was hoping the second will be as good! I was trying to wait for it to be free , but I thoroughly<br />enjoyed the first that my husband was eager to see the second season.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell and co-stars make this a Christmas classic for me.  You gotta see it and it will keep you in stitches.<br />Make sure you pay attention to the 4 basic food groups for elves. :)
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Enya all the way.  love the Celtic take on winter it just makes me lie back and sip hot cider
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderfully written, and a read like nothing else. The pure emotion Chbosky used was the spine, brain and heart of the novel.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Man TI did his thing on this cd this is probably his best cd yet every song is a banger
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I watched the movies before reading the series.  Both are enjoyable and different enough so that the book kept my interest.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.
B008J34466|5.0|This is P!nk's best album yet. Funny how time changes us all..She has grown so much in the last few years and it showed on this album. Thank God for P!nk!!!
B000286RKW|4.0|GoodFellas I agree with another reviewer \\"best mob movie ever\\" made although I felt some of the scenes went on longer then should have.  Trually an amazing cast and great acting jobs by the actors.  The supporting actors also added to the already great movie, if I am correct I think the black guy in the movie stacks was played by Samuel L. Jackson.  I also do enjoy true stories turned into movies, I think the director did a great job turning the story into a great movie.  I still gave it a 4 star rating because of the actors, director, music and allround great movie to sit back and enjoy time and time again.  So if you love your mob movies then pick this movie up and enjoy the \\"best mob movie ever\\" made.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I've seen this before, and know of a child who LOVES the Muppets (yay, Kermit, yay, Beaker!). I got this and another Muppet movie for him (he's 3) as it's funny, wholesome, and he loves it...and I think it will be a hit for Christmas! It was packaged well and arrived on time as promised. Would totally buy this again.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Taxi Driver is by far one of the best drama movies I have in my collection because first off the preformance of Robert De Niro, second the director's and camera man's amazing shots of New York City in the 1970's.  Third the script great one liner's from De Niro, and the famous \\"you talking to me\\" speech in front of the mirror.  I have personally watched this movie 4 times during my lifetime so far and never get tired of it.  Plus it was also listed in the 100 best films ever made which I agree with totally because of the reasons I listed in the above lines of my review.  So if you have yet to watch this movie it is a movie you have to watch least once in your lifetime I say watch it mutiple times to fully understand the whole movie and the points it tries to tell us as fans of the style of movie it is and contains.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This App stinks . It is completely random .DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!EVER!!!!!!  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B000FSME1A|4.0|This is by far one of Coppola's best movies he has made over his directing carrer.  Martin Sheen does an amazing preformance as a soilder with a very hard choice to make at the end of the movie.  Brando's preformance was also amazing you could sense the pain within his words because of everything he went threw in the war and toll it took on the character he was acting as.  Lots of people arugue which is the better movie the 2 hours and 33 minutes 1979 version, or the 3 hours and 22 minutes Redux Version from 2001.  Personally I only watched the Redux version because I believe its the way the director desire his movie to be when people watch the movie.  But if you don't own this movie yet, though enjoy war movies this is one of the best war movies made so far in film history. Buy this movie and see for yourself how powerful the acting is, the script, and the action truly takes your breathe away because it's so mind blowing.  Then once you have seen the movie then make up your own mind about which version is the true version.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Extremely well written with some interesting/funny/clever descriptions of events/feelings. Who is narrating this story??!! Almost a whodunnit, very intriguing. Excellent.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|With more than 500 reviews already, one more seems redundant except to say \\"David Foster Wallace is a genius.\\" He has no peers. What a shame we lost him.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love solitaire and this is usually the first style of solitaire that I start with.  It really helps me to concentrate on a solution.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Way to much computer jargon that the avereage person won't understand or care about. Must have been a total ghost writer
B009OYTAL8|4.0|It's the CW so immediately people have low standards, but it's a great show and has a lot of potential to last a while!!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I saw this film when it first opened some fifty years ago.<br /><br />This state of the art blu-ray restoration is really extraordinary making it appear just as it did at that time.<br /><br />Almost all movies become dated through the years but not this one.<br /><br />It could just as well have been made in 2012 if only they could.<br /><br />The writing directing and acting are first class from beginning to end.<br /><br />Beyond that, it is a true spectular with a cast of thousands of real people as opposed to the current clunky, comic book style computer projections so evident in a film such as Gladiator that detract from the authencity of the presentation and the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />Bravo Sony!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|I was surprised, honestly. I was just looking for a quick Christmas movie we hadn't seen yet. We all enjoyed this one. It was really well done.
B003RUZKC8|5.0|Great story line, and action packed!<br />I'v been trying to watch this movie forever, you can't get it on netflix or Blockbuster movie pass.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Disappointed.  Thought from the trailers that it was going to be funnier.  Didn't think a lot of the off-color humor was humerous.
B00AC8ZA3M|2.0|I'm a fan of Halo but in all honesty this didn't do it any justice. Halo fan or not you'll notice this movie has cheap special effects, over used slow motion (even in non-action sequences) and a constant fog/darkness that doesn't allow you to really see the enemies.<br /><br />The beginning started out well and set the stage for what I thought was going to be some serious chief epicness. Then you dive into the \\"action\\" with over used slow motion for insignificant scenes and enemies that you can barely see through all the smoke (I don't remember the games being so dark and smokey).  I figured \\"eh... it'll get better\\" but just when I thought the action was going to get interesting the \\"kick ass\\" fight scene lasted 10 seconds (grenade... back flip...done). Characters started out strong but I felt that the acting was really lacking towards the end of the movie. Plus master chief is barely in the movie...you see more alternate characters and as a fan I expected more of chief. I'm sure that it was the script and budget that constrained it.<br /><br />Not sure why this hasn't been made into an actual movie yet...but this movie is not what I expected it to be. Don't waste your money! Just wait for it to come out on Netflix...
B008VIKLWA|5.0|I was also reading a book on technology and human evolution at the time.  The movie really helped me imagine our own history and the origins of our own culture that are readily evident when you observe nature.  Technology may have changed us as we diverged from the common ancestor with chimps but you can still recognize our common heritage.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I like natural disaster movies because they are remote to my life. I wouldn't recommend it to any overly serious thinkers.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I absolutely loved this game.  I played all the way through accomplishing every possibly thing.  I recently came here to check if there were any updates, and unfortunately there were not.  I looked on the Play store and saw that it was updated a couple months back with 5 new courses.  This has become such a glaring problem with the amazon store.  They just don't get timely updates, or they don't get updates at all.  This is why I will continue to only pay for apps on the Play store.  Luckily I got this for free.  The one on the play store is free, but likely ad supported.  I was able to backup my data on this one, install the play store version, and restore my data there, so luckily I can play the new levels.  However, the average user may not be able to do this themselves.
B008602KQI|5.0|I purchased this item a while ago and when one of my granddaughters wanted it I purchased it for her. That will tell you that I highly recommend it. The movie was very tastefully done. It could have been a gory movie and thank goodness it wasn't. I didn't agree with some of the comments in the interviews but that is all part of freedom of speach. They have a right to say things I disagree with. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Team of Rivals is great history.  It is very well- researched.  While details carry the reader back Ito time, they also help him see how many things remain the same today.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Why wouldn't you like this?  It's Katy Perry and she's amazingly talented.  If you don't own this yet, you're missing out.  do yourself a favor and buy this.
B0060D123K|5.0|This is a great Muppet movie with some really nice Xmas songs.  Funny in the classic Muppet style, yet sweet too.  I watch it every year for Xmas.  My kids love it too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you've seen the first season, how can you not continue on?  You're a fool not too.  Season 3 is getting even better!
1455502758|5.0|Remarkable that somebody can write, as they are dying, of profound things of life and death and much in between, with no sentimentality but with great import and great impact.  I think it's an amazing book.
B00A04BKA0|5.0|Proof of Heaven.  Book arrived and is in excellent condition.  I am giving it as a gift for someone who requested it..
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Wow, wow, wow! I loved all the twists and turns, the new characters, and Pendergast's supreme intelligence and ability. I didn't want the story to end, and I'm glad to see they left plenty of material for the next novel or series. A very satisfying thriller.
1603427244|5.0|I love to learn new techniques and this book is easy to follow and full of new ways to cast on and bind off.  I have been knitting for over 40 years and it's always great to learn new ways to do things.  It makes knitting exciting again!
B00845PT18|4.0|It was not as good as the first movie, but I still found it entertaining. I will watch it again someday.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This season is not as good as last season, but I would still recommend. I hope the remainder of the season can raise my expectations for next season.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Sad, happy, lots of pathos - everything you could wish for in a film that you may be watching by alone with only popcorn to go with it.  Great cast and wonderful acting, I loved every minute of it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Been watching since season 1, I purchase episodes I miss on TV. It is just not the same watching on computer.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Love it - sadly husband hasn't caught the bug, so I am reduced to watching it when he's busy elsewhere, but no major problems as I can pour a drink,.get some snacks and kick back and relax.
B004GYY714|5.0|If you every paid hundreds of dollars for a shortwave radio and had to listen to sub quality reception. Never again with tune in radio. Check it out for free then pay for it it's worth every penny.
B004KA9VGA|2.0|It has taken me almost three months to labour my way through A Discovery of Witches. I admit that I have not dedicated all of my reading time to this single volume. Far from it. I have found it necessary to divert my attention to more enjoyable books.<br /><br />The concepts which underpin the storylines are absolutely brilliant. So much thought has gone into the connections between the witches, vampires, daemons and humans, and all of the timelines, which should have made this a gripping read.<br /><br />From most of the reviews that I had read, I was expecting much more. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, and deafened myself to the negative reviews that told me it would be a drudge.<br /><br />However, the introduction must have taken up around half of the book before the action finally got under way. It was all so long and drawn out. If the whole thing could have been condensed into less than three hundred pages, I believe that the result would have been stunning.<br /><br />The parts that I enjoyed, were the brief spells (forgive the pun) of magic, the time travel, and the references to the vampires experiences and encounters throughout history.<br /><br />One reference that really caught my attention, and I don't think that this is in any way a spoiler, was to Christopher Marlowe and Faustus.<br /><br />This is not a book that I would especially recommend to my friends, even if they are heavily into magic, witches and vampires, although some may see some appeal.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|Wow, Another winner from John. Produced by Kevin Shirley, great bluesy grunge and slide guitar. Also check out Joe Bonamassa's Beacon Theater DVD. John makes a cameo appearance and does a couple tunes with Joe.
0679428895|5.0|This is the story of a latter day Super Mario, an Italian plumber who overcomes very difficult challenges to fix the water supply to Napoli and surrounding areas before the local volcano erupts to ruin everything for everybody.<br /><br />OK, I admit that I am grossly trivialising a tremendous story, which is really about Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or chief water engineer, who is sent to the Bay of Naples to manage the water supply to all of the towns in the area. The main artery is the aqueduct, Aqua Augusta, which Attilius's grandfather may have had a hand in building under the supervision of the great Agrippa. Water engineering has been the career path of Atillius's family back through at least four generations.<br /><br />From the off, Attilius is up against it. His predecessor disappeared mysteriously, and neither his team of engineers and slaves nor those masters who govern Naples and the surrounding area, are inclined to trust the new aquarius.<br /><br />The first chapter opens with the horrendous execution of a slave who has been held responsible for the deaths of one of the local lord's prize fish. The lord's daughter, accompanied by the unfortunate slave's mother, urgently seek the help of Attilius, who quickly discovers that it is something in the water which has killer the precious fish. But they are too late to save the wretched slave.<br /><br />Events unfold and develop during the two days leading up to the famous eruption which buried Pompeii.<br /><br />This is a rivetting read, if ever there was one. As you would expect, there are many dangers to overcome, and, as you read, you will be wondering who will survive and who will not. This does not become clear until the final pages. I have to confess that I was wishing for the demise of certain characters, whilst hoping for the survival of others. That is a sign of how well Robert Harris engages the reader with the actors in this story.<br /><br />Definitely merits five stars.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have vision problems and I teach classes.  Therefore, I like to develop my lessons on my computer and transfer them to my Kindle Fire to use in class to keep me on point.  If you convert a Word document to kindle book format you will lose all of the multi-level numbering found in the outline form I use for my lessons.  If I save the file from Word in, PDF format it retains the entire outline format found in word.  However, PDF was very difficult for me to read on my Kindle.  The ezPDF Reader app allows me to set the size to what I need plus I can put it on night mode, (black background with white text), that is easier for me to see.  This app has improved my life and I am quite sure that of my students.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|These southern writers sure can spin a good tale. John seems to enjoy writing more than practicing law, which is pretty much my attitude, too.

159420411X|4.0|I decided to read this book with all the good publicity Nate Silver has gotten over the last 5 years with his handicapping of national Presidential and Senate election polls. Recently he has had some interesting interviews -- notably with Joe Scarborough where he bet Joe about the accuracy of his predictions and a really interesting, quite serious interview with Conan O'Brien about this book. I was a little disappointed with the book. Not because of the way it's written, but because he chose to concentrate on many other disciplines where predictions are made rather than getting into how he uses polls to determine his electoral predictions. Fortunately he spoke at length about how he did that on those television interviews.<br /><br />This book is interesting, though, because he shows how the data used in making predictions has been handled by the wide variety of forecasters who make predictions for many different reasons. In his chapter about baseball scouting and their use of data, he shows how scouts will always have an advantage because of the personal observations they can add to the data. So where \\"Moneyball\\" (in my case the movie) was portrayed as a battle between statisticians vs. scouts, Silver notes that over the past decade both camps have become instrumental in doing better scouting. If you've ever sat in the front row of a major league baseball game and seen how really young the players are, the book tells you why, with his observation that the average baseball player reaches his peak at the ripe old age of 27! The weather and earthquake chapters were also interesting, showing how forecasters have tried to soften their predictions from what the data suggested so that people would be more accepting of the data.<br /><br />Many of the positive reviews for this book are from people who are serious practitioners of making predictions and assessing risk. I'm not even sure what an applied business researcher does. But over the last 20-30 years it seems beneficial to make more predictions and decisions using data rather than totally qualitative criteria. \\"The Signal and the Noise\\" suggests that the best predictions might result from using data but with qualitative and distinctive human judgments as well.<br /><br />As far as the enjoyment factor, I agree with another reviewer who commented that the book reminded him of \\"Freakonomics\\" but with less fun. I think Silver is probably a fun person but that doesn't come across as much in this, his first book. As he continues to blow people away with the accuracy of his predictions I'm sure other, more enjoyable books will come. But if you can work through all his chapters, you'll realize that he has a very effective methodology of looking at data in common-sense ways to make very accurate predictions.ial to make more predictions and decisions using data rather than totally qualitative criteria. \\"The Signal and the Noise\\" suggests that the best predictions might result from using data but with qualitative and distinctive human judgments as well.<br /><br />As far as the enjoyment factor, I agree with another reviewer who commented that the book reminded him of \\"Freakonomics\\" but with less fun.

B008EKON56|5.0|I purchased a Fiio E11 headphone amplier to use with my iPhone and various pairs of headphones, and was initially underwhelmed with it's performance; I even considered sending it back.  After more research on the value of using a line-out connection, I purchased this LOD, and am very glad I did.  It brought out the true potential of the amplifier, and now my music sounds considerably better than without.  I would never use my amp without this LOD again.  Also, the USB charge port is very useful, and has come in handy during long listening sessions.<br /><br />The one thing I would advise is that for some reason, the mini USB cable that came with my Fiio amp (and charges it fine) doesn't work with this device, leading me to believe it was defective.  Luckily, I took the time to try a different mini USB cable, and it worked; it just (ironically) does not work with the Fiio brand cable -- FYI for those E11 users that may encounter the same situation...
B000E1YW0E|1.0|I loved the music but couldnt really follow the story. Too many characters and too many stories going on at once. I actually had to read on Wickepedia that most of the characters had aids! Yeah just didnt do it for me on any level.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|It was a very fast read. Touching and captivating full of beautiful imagery and relatable characters. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.
0385738773|2.0|This whole series has given me just enough to keep reading, but not enough to be satisfied. I basically only read the final book just to see what happened. I was pleasantly surprised that I did enjoy a lot of the book. But the end really fell flat.<br /><br />*Possible Spoilers, but I'll try not to really give anything away*<br /><br />Let's start with the good. The plot is very interesting. This is really what kept me reading. I love Dystopian novels, and the world he created and the mysterious plot was really cool and definitely made me want to read more. I wanted to know more about the world, WICKED, and everything about them. Sadly, when you finally read about what they are doing, it's just not satisfying. Not terribly, but just a bit anticlimactic. I wanted something more. He doesn't explain the reasons behind most of my questions, like why do they have to be put through sooo many awful things, so many deaths, and so many horrible situations? And yet practically nothing good? What was the point of the people being able to speak to each other in their minds? How did this government get so many resources while the world is practically destroyed? He just barely describes what they were doing, but doesn't delve into them at all. Wow... I already set in on the bad of the book...<br /><br />Well here is the rest of what I think is bad..<br /><br />The character development is poor at best, just like the other books. The first definitely had it the strongest, not that it ever was too strong, and the sequels didn't improve. The characters are pretty flat. The interaction and dialogue between characters don't ever seem completely real. This could've been avoided if we were lead to really care about the characters. It's not the weakest character development, but it is one of the weaker parts of this book, and the series as well.<br /><br />I often am finding Thomas to be putting tons of care into some things and characters that I don't feel he should have. I'll try not to give anything away, but when a certain character tells Thomas that he hates him and tells him to leave him alone, Thomas says that it was the single worst feeling he's ever had... Really? There have been countless people dying around him, some that he even really cared about like Chuck from the first book, and he's been lied and hurt and betrayed by other friends and especially the girls... and yet this is the worst feeling he's ever had... I think Thomas has the Flare bad and it's been affecting his brain and his emotions far more than the writer is letting on.<br /><br />*Definite Spoilers*<br />Okay so if you've gotten to the end, here is where I was dissapointed the most. Teresa. She was such a big character in the first book, and even the second. Now she's a nobody. The writer tries to bring back some bit of redemption and some kind of emotional reaction from the reader at the end. But Thomas doesn't seem to care when she gets smashed, and neither did I. Being such a big part of his life I figured Thomas would care a bit more... But nope. And then it was such a letdown. Three whole books of WICKED looking for a cure, and this last book title \\"THE DEATH CURE!\\" and yet nothing.... LAME! I felt like all these characters, every single one in the book went through this giant adventure and all this pain and suffering all for nothing... And where were they at the end anyways? Nothing explained. Nothing further to understand what's gonna happen to the characters next. I felt like it built up to a strong finale and then just fell down and pitifully ended. Very dissapointed with the end.<br /><br />*End Spoilers*<br /><br />Well yes, rant over. Like I said in the beginning, the book was captivating, kinda. But the end really let me down. I think with a little creativity, and some more effort, Dashner could've made something amazing, especially out of the end. But instead it felt like a first draft that was shoved out into the market...
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I have watched this movie before, it always keeps my interest.  I watched it with my son (29 yrs) and daughter (20) they both loved this movie to!<br /><br />Not for young children but a real great story for teenagers and older!

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This was a great movie it's funny yet touching in the end. I would rent again to watch. I recommend this movie
B0087ITBT8|3.0|I'll admit it...I got suckered by the previews for THE GUILT TRIP.  Although I'm not a big fan of Barbra Streisand, the movie looked like a bit of a guilty pleasure...a mis-matched road trip with mother & son.  Rogen and Streisand appeared to actually have pretty good chemistry together, and while I figured the laughs would be cheap and obvious, they might also be plentiful.<br /><br />Well, I was roughly half right.  The laughs WERE cheap and obvious, but not very plentiful.  And many of the best ones were shown in the previews (and some of THOSE were not in the movie until the closing credits \\"deleted scene\\" montage).  The chemistry WAS there, but it included a lot more sadness and anger than such a lightweight movie really could carry.<br /><br />Rogen plays Streisand's chemist son.  After years working with the EPA, he has developed a wonderful, renewable, totally safe and effective home cleaning product and has invested everything into selling it to big retail establishments.  He is, in fact, about to launch a cross-country road trip, starting in New Jersey in an effort to sell his product.  It just so happens that his mother lives right there, so he spends a couple of days visiting her too.  He feels bad that his mother is a bit lonely (she's been a widow for over 20 years), so he impulsively invites her to accompany him on his 8-day road trip.  Hilarity ensues (or at least, it should).<br /><br />Turns out Rogen is a terrible sales-person...and his pitch meetings with the corporate types are more pathetic than funny.  He's so awkward and ill-prepared.  It stretches credulity, especially when it's actually played fairly straight, rather than for broad laughs.<br /><br />And it turns out that Streisand is quite annoying.  Yes, she's annoying to her son with her constant chattering.  Her steady mix of over-bearing mother and condescending critic.  Yes, she's clearly a stereotypical \\"Jewish mother\\" and who better to play her?  But it all begins to blend togetheras just so much noise in our heads, and probably that's the way Rogen hears it too!<br /><br />The plot itself (will Rogen make a sale, will Streisand meet a guy) is quite predictable, and yields few surprises.  BUT, if you saw the trailer, you likely are not expecting big surprises or innovation.  The film doesn't need to surprise us.<br /><br />The two stars do have some amusing exchanges...don't misunderstand me.  Streisand does something outrageous and Rogen mumbles something under his breath that is amusing.  But there are very few out-loud laughs to be had.  The movie has a tough time finding a balance between its moments of near slapstick with its more serious encounters.  There is a lot of pain and sadness that these two characters are burdened with, and this hangs like a weight around a movie that clearly wants to be light on its feet and even wacky.<br /><br />It's possible to strike a balance like that (Apatow has done it numerous times and Rogen certainly can do it)...but THE GUILT TRIP misses out.  But don't get me wrong...it is modestly entertaining and amusing, and while I can't recommend you run right out and see it, don't let it completely pass you by either.  I should also say, at the risk of sounding like a fuddy-duddy, that it's probably going to be more amusing for fans of Barbra than for fans of Seth Rogen.  Despite bursts of bad language, it has a decidedly old-fashioned feel to it that might equate to \\"too slow\\" for a generation more accustomed to the rhythms of THE HANGOVER.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Although quite a bit of &#34;static&#34; (mechanically), the show was as interesting and funny as always.  It's nice to still have shows out there that can be enjoyed just because they are funny - not crude, sexual, or crass.  The show always has at least one REALLY good belly-laugh to it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|If you love purple, you will love the deep hue of this nice cover. While it is made well, I don't see it protecting the kindle very well in falls or mishaps. You can, however, prop your kindle up just fine. Pay very close attention to the fact that this will ONLY fit the Kindle HD 7\\"... And a good fit at that. Price is not too bad, though I think all covers tend to be more pricey than what they are truly worth. So my stars are based on usability and construction... Not on price.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I'd love to see more of the earlier various demons and monsters, but at least this is still interesting.  The actors, as brothers, are an excellent job of casting.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie was in general a good sc-fi flick.  The story shows the possiblities of foreign enities and the twists that come with the &#34;playing&#34; with science.  The story line is good, but filled with inept science protocols when gathering samples or emergency procedures.  It was a stretch of reality, but good entertainment.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I don't get this, the game just completely froze up on me. Plus, the game doesn't have even the basic supplies that you need like the pickaxe or stuff like that, and it doesnt have seeds or buckets, what's the use of even having the game if there aren't any enemies, buckets, or seeds?! Never playing this game again, getting it for the pc instead, I would recommend that you do the same too.
B007Q476KU|5.0|very good movie angry at myself that i did'nt watch it again and again....had so many interesting things happen and kept you involved with the movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give this trilogy 5 stars for it's commercial value rather than for its literary quality.  The author has had great success - I bought all three books didn't I?  I also read them despite their shortcomings. The main characters are made of papier maché.  The female lead is a sort of stumble-bum loner, perhaps a virgin. She has no boyfirend nor does she want one. Her  favorite passtime is reading 19th century novels by female English authors.  Within  days of meeting her new mate she becomes a sex goddess of the first order.  The least believable thing about the male lead is that by the age of 28, he has built a billion dollar fortune from shipbuilding.Even the asian tigers have trouble turning a dollar in this industry. In Americe, forget it.  Despite severe obsessions, he rapidly turns into a tender and loving sex partner.  .  The first book has the merit of developing the characters  in all their contradictions.  The second book manages to hold the line, but the third book is  almost an embarrasment.  The plot and dialog turn  into treacle.  The one thing that holds the trilogy together is the fact that it is in fact a complete sex manual, as long as you are young, athletic, eager and don't  have to work for a living.  As I said in the beginning, I gave these books a 5 star rating from a commercial point of view. If you really want to see why, try volume 1. If you do,I bet you read all three.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie as it was a positive, encouraging christian movie that discussed several everyday issues that are sometimes very hard to address.  This movie related to some of the same struggles I have faced and I very much appreciated the story line.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Her voice is stunning.  Such range and emotion.  Songs vary and keep my interest.  Now looking at getting her sophmore album.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is a pre-k replica of The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by John Murphy. Murphy's book provides clear instructions on how to tap your subconscious to bring about positive change. The Secret is a comic book filled with excerpts from John Murphy's version and does it no justice.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|I liked that they pulled certain things from the original.  Interesting new premise with excellent c.g. I enjoyed it for a remake.

B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This was a very poor attempt at a remake. I think they thought that special effects would be so much better than actually having a story line. It was flat with no real story which just made it boring to watch. Definitely not one of my favorites this month. Don't waste your money is my recommendation.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|The plot is complex as it is interwoven with other Bourne story. Probably should have read the book first. I still find it hard to understand as to what is the bourne connection?
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This was a very action packed and fast paced movie. It builds nicely keeping you guessing and thinking which makes for a very enjoyable movie. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B0026IWNZE|1.0|Slow storyline and not really that much dancing. Jessica Alba is probably the ONLY saving grace in this movie. pass on it.
B008J34466|5.0|Awesome album.  I love the whole thing.  Great as always. I will recommend to anyone.  Great job P!nk!  Listen to it all the time.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Who wouldn't like this movie, especially in blu-ray format. Peter O'Toole giving a synopsis 50 years after is priceless and Omar is always a good interview.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game kept me on the edge of my seat.  It had great graphics for this type of game.  Also it was long and we'll worth the money.  I had great mini games.  I suggest this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games with that added twist.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is the best of the series, and Brad does a fantastic job with all the action sequences. Great flick!
B00571F26Y|5.0|What an interesting book.  It tells you what to eat and not what to eat and why our bellies are big.  LOL
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Jeremy Renner is an exciting action star. The action sequences were believable and shot very well. The story line, while tied to Damon's Bourne, stands on its own.
B007SGM084|4.0|I loved this trilogy. Definitely for mature audiences, but a little erotica never hurt anyone. I think this series is also so captivating because it follows a love story of such a fantasy relationship. I only give it 4 stars though because the ending was just too predictable - was kind of a bummer to finish the book and realize what I had predicted was actually true. But nonetheless, it had my attention till the very end.... and I'm not much of a reading kind of person.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Seth MacFarlane is a comedic GENIUS!!! I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. Wahlberg has a knack for humor, his character was easy to identify with and I felt he was believable.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Sad, very sad sequel. Liked original, but nothing the least bit original or interesting about<br />this version.  Pathetic, non-sensical dialogue; plot predictable by grade schooler; just more<br />violence for supposed good causes. Some humor, though, which was welcome.  A<br />definite NOT See.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy's writes a realistic thriller and a good read from start to finish.  Great characters and knowledge of the military.

1449410243|1.0|The title was funny and I thought two of my friends would like this as gifts. There was no way to look at it online and I was in a hurry so I did not look at the reviews. I wish I had. This book has some funny lines, but it is highly offensive. Example: cat sitting on a copier scanning his underside. Another example: A baby being mauled by a cat... how is this funny? Anyway,  I could not give this as gifts and have to return it.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Dancing was excellent. The female lead was VERY dull, plain and just boring. Chatum Tanning was a great actor and dancer in this movie but even his acting and dancing abilities to not make up for the bad acting of the female lead.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Use this movie on an inpatient acute psychiatric hospital.  Great movie to help people realize that getting the basic life decisions right (e.g. care for self and others) does contribute toward moving on with life when you are stuck.  Wish Republican members of Congress would watch.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was a cute concept. but it had a lot of hokey stuff in it. I wouldn't watch it again. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for young teens or children. It had a lot of drugs and sexual stuff in it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|We don't normally purchase movies, we rent. Even down the road if we want to throw another buck out to rent it 2 or 3 times it's still cheaper to spend 5 bucks renting & watching those 5 times. This movie is worthy of being purchased in my household! It was an amazing ending to this particular Batman story line. I read many review about character overload & wasn't trying to get my hopes up before seeing it. However, I found those critics completely out of their element. It was beautifully done! We will watch this way more than 5 times. An owner for sure!
B009VB97EY|1.0|first of all the story line was boring, i was expecting more excitement but this movie fell flat, then you have the music they picked for the music which was very bad, they should have choosen something more upbeat something like electronic music and the guy that plays the role as the kid does not know how to act at all...by the way im a guy and was expected to see the magical world of male strippers and having multiple girls and wild parties and living the good life but this movie just showed a bunch of guys struggling with life and stripping...boring
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I was psyched when I saw that this was available for my type of phone. I downloaded and quickly became disappointed when the app would not open.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I was not looking for an inspirational book, just a good nonfiction read that that had a good story to tell, that is historically accurate and well written.  This book exceeded my expectations in every aspect and is also very inspirational.  I cannot imaging anybody that is interested in this subject matter not liking this book.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|bought this as an xmas gift i got this about 15 dollars cheaper than best buy it is perfect!!! totally recommend it!
B004EK91LQ|4.0|My kids and I love this dance show. It has the coolest effects and great choreography. The only reason why we didn't give it a 5 is because we wanted more dance and less of the drama.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Definately not Connelly's best..I think he had a deadline and rushed this one through..Pity since I am a huge Connelly fan.
B003SI9WYG|1.0|This show was weird and disturbing. It is not for kids. We thought it would be a fun movie to watch at Halloween time but instead we were left wondering why we wasted our time on it. Awful.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I think that this game was alright, I didn't have any problem with it, and I think that it's worth downloading.
B007549YM4|5.0|This movie blew my freaking mind man! Such a good flick. Raw, devastating and brutal. I loved it and think it deserves a watch. If you like anything Post-Apocalyptic, great cinematography and just a good movie.....WATCH it. I had to watch it at least 3 times just to absorb it.
B00932A66Y|4.0|Fairly high on the gross index, but a good plot well-acted. Subtitles well-done and not obtrusive. The author is great, and I would like to see more of his novels made into films. Norwegian films would be fine.
B004QSQML8|5.0|By far one of my favorite movies. Tim Curry set the bar for one hell of a devil, and this is definitely a classic. I loved it when I was younger and still dig it now, plus all the adds are a bonus. If you haven't ever seen this movie your missing out.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Reading this was like enjoying a delicious feast. I kept putting it down because it got so intense. It's been years since a book make me cry. It's food for the soul.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella never failed me... i could really feel the LOVE LOVE LOVE at the end of the book hoping that there will be more coming :)
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I absolutely love this product. It rests right on babies chest or next to his head and helps keep his pacifier in.  I recommend this product to everyone.  I only purchased one but I will soon purchase at least one more..
B00447G29S|5.0|One of my favorite movies, Watching it in 3D blu-ray is tops. If you enjoy this movie and have the option of 3D tv, get it!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I am taken away by the story. I never feel like I am bogged down in unnecessary plot line. This book is a rich tapestry and a master of story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|loved this book. characters are believable and story line is great. can't wait for the final book. couldn't put it down
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I rented this for 4 bucks. I should have lit my next 4 cheap<br />cigars with those 4 one dollar bills. That would have been<br /> better money mgmt. I'm serious. Shame on Amazon for even<br />putting this dreadful and lousy movie on their site. don't throw your<br /> money away kids
B00633W614|5.0|This is the second book of a series of three. It  was just as interesting and exciting with twists and turns as the first book. I can't wait to order the last book to finish a good story.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Well written, exciting, related to very current events. However, it was somewhat predictable in parts. It definitely stayed true to Mitch Rapp's character and behavior with some original new plot twist thrown in. I read this in less than two days time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I would recommend this book, it had an excellent storyline and kept the reader wondering the entire book.  Excellent Read
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Very slow pacing. I grew restless with this book and retired it before I got half way through this work.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Kept reading to wait for the storyline to start, but it never did.  Had to finally put it down, unread.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I really like Lee Child's works involving Jack REacher. However this book can only be rated as average at best. It was kind of draggy but still produced a readable story in the end.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|If you like the Aliens movie franchise and are a sci-fi thriller fan, then you will probably like this movie.  An interesting story concept about how humanity may have started along with a tie-in to the Alien movies.  Certainly not my most favorite sci-fi movie ever, but it's decent and worth watching.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Of course this is another of Connelly's  great Harry Bosch works. It has many interesting plot twists and turns and has a greater helping of Bosch's daughter involved in the story. A very good read as always is presented by this fine author.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Ordered for a Christmas gift so was very pleased how quickly and well-packaged it arrived. Can't wait to see him open it!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|WEll written but dragged in parts. Originality was a strong suit here. It took effort to get through some sections of this work but it was worth it.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Loved it. Funniest bear since Yogi.  Not a kids movie so don't be fooled<br />  Why do I need 18 words on her?
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Way too much drug involvement to be enjoyable.  This movie could have been really funny without being crude and disgusting.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have yet to read the books.  I tend to buy when I see something I want to read so it sometimes takes me a while to actually read it.  Sorry I can't write a review at this time.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|what has to be said?  either you love it or you don't.  obviously, i do!  decent price too.  also purchased seasons one and three!
B007R41E8O|5.0|Twisted Lands has some incredible and fun visuals which aid along a clever and engaging Hidden Object adventure game.  You will encounter animated scenes for the puzzle locations and Twisted also has some of the best object imbedding to be found in the genre.  Meaning the Hidden Object puzzles do not look like a backdrop with stickers overlaid.  They objects in them have depth, shadowing, and are most often theoretically functional in the area where they sit.  There are a few repeats of locations, but the objects are always new and its fun to think, &#34;Oh yeah, where was that corkscrew?!&#34;<br /><br />The HP Lovecraft feel to the app made it that much more fun and the player aids were helpful in a manner that moved the play along but didn't spoil the fun.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a fantastic game, and I am waiting for Fire Maple games to create a new one! My 5 yr old daughter liked playing with me. I had to help her a little and found myself wanting to keep playing without her, I couldn't put it down.  She now starts over and plays again, rinse, repeat.  Great graphics/pictures.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Running on my Kindle fire, this app looks crisp with very bright colors.  The gameplay, like any good casual gamer app, is intuitive and smooth.  There is no lag whatsoever, which makes swinging and grabbing all the hook points that much more fun.  Well done!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My son loves this game. So definetly i will recomend to keep your kids entertained. And best of all was free
B008VVT51U|5.0|This is such a feel good movie, I rented it twice, then ended up buying it. Its one of those movies you want to watch over again.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|All other DeMille books are good this one is not worth to read,  the other John Corey books are good this one wad boring and slow
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|GREAT book wonderful character development.  LOVE the historical references the second book is even better.  More action and more intrigue
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read all the Harry Bosch books and this one is just as good as the rest.  I love the character's personality...tough and tender at the same time.  Michael Connelly is #1 in my book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|i love building cities and civilizations so this game is a great choice for me. i would recommend this to people.
B008602KQI|4.0|They did a wonderful job turning this book into a movie.  Not exact, but very good.  I can't wait for the sequels.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love this show. I blew through the first two seasons on Netflix and HAD to know what happened next! Totally addicted.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Not only is this one of the coolest apps to use (just flip through it) it offers a good sellection of news items.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was a little too much sex, the second one I liked better and the third was really good
B00006LFGD|5.0|Added to my collection of great vocalists, singing songs that you can understand the words in and relate to in your life.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great movie.  The tie in to Aliens/Predator was not really a part of the story until the end.  Interesting precept.  Thoroughly enjoyable movie.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|While I ceased to be much interested in Tom Clancy after he started \\"corporate writing\\" - I presume a stable of ghost writers who expanded on his ideas, but the Jack Ryan stories always caught my attention. But this is a Tom Clancy more like the old ones - well-researched, excellent characterization and a fast- moving pace. The 'threat' in Threat Vector is the use of cyber warfare - invasion of sovereign and private sector computer systems by a foreign nation dedicated to the defeat of  (who else?) the US. Jack Ryan Prez plays a lesser role in this tale whereas his son Jack Junior, Ding Chavez and Mr Clark are in there fighting.  I am unsure whether Jack has been made a permanent president considering that his son was a mere boy on his first go-around and is now a young man with considerable black achievements himself. Like many believe, in the long run the bad guys are Chinese - not the Chinese people, of course, but evil genii supported by the Chinese military.  Unfortunately, the programs used as the main plot in this story are prescient, just as the Japanese airliner hitting the US Capitol bringing Jack Ryan into the presidency was prescient of the 9/11 disaster later.<br /><br />A great tale that should make us all wake up to the realities of how we are exposed cybernetically.<br /><br />The denoument of the problem is in the true Clancy/Ryan tradition.<br /><br />Question: Is Jack Ryan a prescience of a Paul Ryan? Jeez, I hope not, at least the latter part.<br /><br />An added note. The actor who played Jack Ryan Prez in The Hunt For Red October was, for me, the real Jack Ryan. Why he didn't wasn't featured in other similar movies is beyond me.  For me, he is the real Jack Ryan.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I learned that it is no available to download to the Kindle Fire, so I cannot listen to radio programs on my Kindle Fire which require a Flash Player.  Not happy<br />Linnie
B0055SWM08|5.0|simple game play but excellent puzzles to make this a great challenge. peaceful music is also very well done. great game!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a wonderful game for fellow Bronies! I enjoy being able to unlock characters as you level up. I recommend this game.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I read this book twice. It's an easy read and very entertaining. All the books in the trilogy are good but this is my favorite
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I really like Liam Neeson, I just don't like this movie at all. It starts out good setting the plot.. at least I thought so... then it never gets better, it gets worse really. Extremely disappointing, there is a movie with a seemingly similar plot to this movie called The Edge, they are directed VERY differently and unfortunately &#34;The Grey&#34; comes out way behind. Would not watch it again, but I am still a fan of Liam a badly directed movie won't change that :).
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have read it five times, this book makes me contemplate my own actions based on the main character, great book
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is no. 18 in the series about police detective Harry Bosch.  I've read them all and Harry never fails to thrill me. He is smart and sometimes bends the rules but always in a classy way. He sometimes tries too hard in his relationship with his daughter but you can't help but like him.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I got this gift for a friend of mine. The price of it was great and it arrived really quickly.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Fun simple app that is addicting and just a simple concept . Vivid colors and changing levels keep it fun
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was really happy with how quickly this arrived. Also I was happy that for just 24.99 I got the entire series, you can't beat that.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|i love this app! It is very addicting and has an arcade setting that progresses into some more difficult to complete levels
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it, loved all 3 of them, really. I would recommend all three. Only problem was I could not poor them down once I started reading.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|A very dark, but good movie.It was so depressing at times that I was surprised I liked it. Good ending.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Enjoy playing the several different levels and different seasons.  Good and fun games to enjoy while waiting for a particular tv program to come on.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Leave the two songs off with Miss Elliott and Kanye East and this album is perfect!  Lose John Meyer, Katy!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun way to pass the time while waiting for a tv program to come on.  Nice and graphics and sounds.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It only loads first few posts and then stops.  Will it be fixed soon?  I'm sure lots of people will be disappointed at Christmas when they get their new Kindle Fire HD's and Facebook doesn't work like it should!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Like the option of which dragon game to play.  Nice to have another mahjong game to play rather than the one on the computer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It keeps you reading to know more like being part of the story i was immerse. I cant wait to see this as a movie
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box was a typical Harry Bosch read - fast moving and hard to put down. Keep them comming.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Finally an ending for the Bourne Series! Renner played the acting role much better than the original. I hope Hollywood doesn't try doing a sequel to this.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|As a Batman fan from wayyyy back I have been enjoying Christofer Nolan's Bat universe immensely. This final chapter is a very satisfying end to his storyline. There is enough reference to the actual Batman comics featuring Bane to satisfy the diehard fan, the inclusion of Catwoman is a great addition and ... The happy ending, while maybe a bit out of character with Nolan's tone for the trilogy is still satisfying. The Cat and the Bat have always been closely tied together but never actually get together in the books; understandable since the storylines continue on forever. But in this 'universe' it's nice to finally see a conclusion for them. And of course this version of Bane makes for an excellent villain, the action is great as expected and all in all Nolan managed to complete his story with no letdown as far as I'm concerned. Well done! Here's hoping he can do the same for Superman next year - even if he is only producing this time.
B0086700CM|4.0|i like this ap. but after you play it for a while it doesnt go side to side normal or fast.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual - Harry Bosch is who you would want on your side.  I think Harry Bosh fans will enjoy reading this one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|suspense...action.  could not put the book down.  hope that the story of The Campus continues and that Jack Jr and his love gets back together
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|This was a great rendition from the book as I remember it. Very good acting. I truly cannot say anything other than just how very good it is.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really love this series! Not a lot of &#34;horror&#34; shows / movies scare the crap out of me, it's nice to know that their is some creativity still out there
B003YNFYD8|1.0|So you want a Beatles greatest hits album. You see two old and one new compilations on the racks -- the much toted BEATLES 1 or the RED and BLUE ALBUMS respectively. Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc. You want to know the sad part? BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually. Why? Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly. Yeah, whatever. I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart?? For shame!) Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes. Either they need to do one of two things:<br /><br />1. Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).<br /><br />2. Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set. That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs. The only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on Beatles records, and these make nice contrasting pictures, although the Red is from PLEASE PLEASE ME.<br /><br />As far as the music goes, so much has been written about The Beatles what more is there to say. Its all great stuff of course.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|One of my favorites :)  A very over looked movie of the 90's,  with very interesting  characthers.. Jeff Bridges is amazing as the dude..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved Colleen Hoover`s first two books, Slammed and Point of Retreat. But as impossible as it would seem, this book was even better.  Do yourself a favor and read every one of Colleen Hoover's books. I guarantee you won't regret it!
B002SSBD6W|4.0|I am not now, nor have I ever been, a vegetarian. However, living as I do in Berkeley, California, from time to time I find myself in the minority at dinners and potlucks. So, as you might imagine, over the years I've come to hear most of the arguments against eating animals.<br /><br />One thing has always puzzled me about the torrent of passion that invariably erupts when I question why I, or anyone else, should become a vegetarian (much less a vegan): apart from a few rejoinders that the practice of limiting my diet to plants will improve my health, extend my life, and make me a better person overall, most -- maybe 80 percent of the verbiage -- concerns cruelty to animals.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. I like furry little animals as well as the next person. Over the course of my long life, I've had dogs, cats, and rabbits as well as a few less cuddly animals such as turtles and fish as (dare I say it?) pets. Nor do I kick dogs or other helpless beasts when I'm angry or frustrated with other human beings.<br /><br />But why do so many people justify vegetarianism on the basis of animal cruelty when the practice of raising animals for food in factory farms promises to drown our country in [...] and spew so many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that it may eventually inundate low-lying coastal cities like Berkeley and make our planet uninhabitable for the human race?<br /><br />Where's your perspective, people? Cheez! We're already eliminating a million species a year from the biosphere by encroaching on animal habitat and screwing with the climate, and you're worried about hurting chickens and cows?<br /><br />Do I want to hurt chickens or cows? Of course not! I've even petted a heifer or two myself over the years. But still . . .<br /><br />To give due credit, Jonathan Safran Foer does explain some of the environmental consequences of factory farming in Eating Animals. But his foray into the hidden depths of this tragically misconceived industry is almost exclusively focused on -- guess what? -- animal cruelty. His descriptions of the way animals are treated are purposely graphic and sometimes hard to take. PETA will love this book. If you don't have an iron stomach, you might not.<br /><br />Eating Animals is Foer's first venture into book-length nonfiction. It's his fourth book. The novels that preceded it, Everything is Illuminated and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, have attracted critical acclaim, including a number of literary awards, and both are being adapted to film. (He also produced a strange  work of fiction that was more a sculpture than a book.) For what it's worth, I tried reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close but couldn't get past the first few pages. However, Eating Animals is brilliantly crafted. Foer's writing style, perhaps even his personality, come through loud and clear. He's obviously a brilliant young man, and if he can avoid falling prey to the silly experimentalism of some of his early work, he's got a great career ahead of him.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, are you wondering why I haven't become a vegetarian?

B0029P51NK|5.0|I wasn't sure where Mark Hollis could go after the classic duo of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock.  I sort of think that perhaps he wasn't sure where to go either, because there was no more Talk Talk after those albums, and no more Mark Hollis for 7 years.  This album is simply a revelation.  He is no longer dealing in forms as abstract as those of Laughing Stock, but the songs are just as thoroughly composed and carefully instrumented as those post-rock masterpieces.  The difference here is that his songs seem more intimate than grandiose, lyrics whispered and intoned gently over acoustic instruments--I often can't tell what he is talking about because he sings so softly, but the emotion comes through as clear as day.  This is a singular album, a marvellous achievement, and a crown to Mark Hollis' storied and incredible career; my only sadness is that after this album all we have is...silence.  Mark Hollis, wherefore art thou?
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Since I am a long-time journal writer, I was delighted to find this notebook app for my Kindle Fire.  I now have several separate notebooks in process, and the app lets the user turn the notebook into a .pdf if you desire to do so.<br /><br />It seems a little slow to type in the &#34;one finger method&#34; on the Kindle keyboard, but I'm learning that this is a way to slow my mind down and to process a little deeper all that I am thinking.
B004IYM2YQ|5.0|The Colour of Spring is a magnificent piece of 80's songwriting--both of the time, and timeless.  The songs are well constructed, perfectly played, and sung with luminous intensity by the great under-appreciated Mark Hollis, who really must be one of the most accomplished soulful pop vocalists of his time.  This is simply an extraordinary album, and well worth the time to check out.  Talk Talk have turned into a cult band, which is a little unfair--they should be celebrated widely as a treasure--but I'm letting you in on the secret.  Get this as soon as you can, you won't regret it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE. I PLAN TO READ IT AGAIN NOW TO BE SURE I &#34;GOT IT ALL&#34;
0761171703|5.0|These pictures feature dancers in everyday moments of love, grief, anger, happiness, work, etc. The pictures are amazing... You can only imagine how some of them made their bodies go that way! The words are equally inspiring. Short and to the point but meaningful. The end tells you more about the shoot of the scenes and the dancers involved. I liked that part alot too. This is a great gift for people who appreciate dancing or photography.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The crossfire series are pretty intense. I'm still deciding if I should read the third part, this stories change my mood. This love story is very sad and not worth it!
145210655X|5.0|This book is great! Any Star Wars fan will love it. I bought it for my brother (who is a dad) and my own Dad, both of whom are Star Wars fans. Minor fans will get a kick out of it too, but real fans will really appreciate it. Some pages are just pictures and word bubbles that depict Vader and Luke as a normal father with a young son (Luke drops his ice cream, he doesn't like the food Dad made, he doesn't like Leia, etc.) and some pages have lines from the movies (Luke, I am your father, you must listen to me, You don't want that toy- Jedi mind trick that doesn't work on Luke). All of the pages will make you laugh, and all feature familiar settings from the movie. This is a great purchase and I will be buying the sequel that features Vader and Leia that comes out next year, Vader's Little Princess.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love &#34;The Racketeer&#34;!!  John Grisham is a master storyteller.  Loved this one,  kept my attention and a fast read. Always  wondering what will happen next.  Enjoy the twists and turns of the story line.  Thank You for another great read,  Mr. Grisham.!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|FRINGE picks up where the X-Files had left off - pointing to the invisible realm, just a crack away in the veil of our reality.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Delightful story, delightful characters.  Seemingly lighthearted mystery connecting the old (ancient bookish secrets) with the new (Google and modern computing power).  Beneath the rather humorous contest between the geezers and the geeks, the story is rich with implications about the search for truth in the modern world.  Very enjoyable read!
B009346RSS|3.0|This worked for my satellite receiver from the TV ,  but not the Panasonic TV itself that has only one audio output which is a dolby toslink  output.  I ended up just using Y-chords from  satellite receiver to split the signal  to my stereo amplifier and the TV.  I will save my money for a  A/V Surround Receiver  that has a toslink input.  The bottom line is this won't decode dolby audio.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|i played it when ever i get a chance. when i do play it i tryed to get better each time
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Enjoyed this young Irish girl's story of slavery, loss, survival and connections.  Heartwarming and poignant, historically accurate.  I'll be looking for more by Kathleen Grissom.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed and more!!! I love the history. Ive only had it on my kindle fire for an hour and Ive figured out all its functions. User friendly
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical Connelly style. Harry Bosch is a great detective following a story with twists and turns. Good stuff. CSI investigative techniques with old school hard work makes for a break in a cold case. I would expect no less.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Thought this was funny for the first half of it then it went downhill and became kind of boring toward the end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The characters are realistic in its imperfection the plot focuses on how a marriage can unfold into a complex framed murder.  The perfect blend of a cleverly paced plot, intricate characters and detailed writing this novel was hard to  put down once started! One of the best recent contemporary novels!

B004YOEFG8|1.0|After watching it, I felt that Imax Hubble 3D failed to meet the experience expected of an Imax 3d movie. I don't want to make strong comment, but I would say that I felt cheated of my money. Why?<br /><br />Visual Experience:<br />On outer space scenes, the point of view and movement of the camera were very limited, which kept showing the same angle, the back of astronauts fixing the telescope, understandably so, since it is extremely difficult to get a footage from moving camera in outer space outside the shuttle. So the main outer space scenes are mostly static and boring, and shown repeatedly, which didn't really bring out the advantage of Imax 3d camera. With today's standard of filming, this is a major flaw, it's like watching footage of a surveillance camera.<br /><br />Next thing, scenes are switching back and forth from full hd to low-res and cropped footage of astronaut fixing the telescope's parts. I wondered why such editing style? I paid handsome price of Imax 3d blu ray to enjoy the experience and visual. Not low-res and extremely low-res in someparts .<br /><br />Content:<br />Other than visual, the information and education materials conveyed in this documentary, none are really new to public knowledge about living in outer space. Underwater training, space diets, etc. The documentary team could do better by exploring deeper aspects of living in outer space, peculiar stuffs that public don't already know.<br /><br />The Best Part:<br />The best part of it is ironically the 3d animation / simulation of a galaxy, which isn't directly produced by hubble. And it is short.<br /><br />3D effect:<br />3D effect is nothing special. None of the scene is noteworthy, it didn't make significant difference in experience nor making the audience understand the space quest better.<br /><br />My Conclusion:<br />For children or audience that is relatively new to space journey, this documentary may be acceptable. But for intermediate audience and above, and if you'relooking for 'wow' moment, meaningful information, and thrills. Well, this is not for you. I am honestly surprised that this title made it to Imax 3D collection, other than the fact that it was shot in space, nothing is special or worth the price tag.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I would not recommend this novel.  It jumps back and forth.The characters are not ell drawn as well as they should be.  The intrigue is not apparent.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Was best in the Mitch Rapp series. It was hard to stop reading, once I started. Was a great early Christmas present to myself.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is awesome I what play it all day love it love it love it love it love it
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read all the Harry Bosch series except this one.  A great series to read.  This one was good, not quite up to Mr. Connelly's normally very high standards.  Found muyself wishing it was finished instead of regretting that it was going to finish
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|My opinion may be clouded by our terrible streaming experience that day, but I thought the movie was very dark.  I have read the book and felt the movie did not provide the character motivation developed in the book.
B0034IZVV8|5.0|Theses are all my favorite songs, brings back good memories. I even have my kids singing and dancing with me.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Kids and adults alike loved this Christmas movie. Very good movie for the holidays. Grandkids were asking to watch it again.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Not what I was expecting. Only gave it four stars because it follows the alien series. Other than that, it was ok.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If I would have known how fowl this was I would never have ordered it. I really don't know how they can make a movie with all the filthy language in it. It was like what terrible things went through his head came out of his mouth. Don't know why Mark Walhberg would even play in a movie like that.

B009GEDP26|5.0|Very funny, intelligent, almost Nick and Nora Charles.<br />The writers are almost always spot on with their characters.<br />The actors are always true to their characters. All of them are real winners.<br />Nathan Fillion reminds me of James Garner and he may be the best straight man since Bud Abbot.<br />Stana Katic is very talented and a master of comic delivery. Besides she just makes me smile.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this when I didn't have any other books. As a woman I was not to interested.But wow! Our SEALS are the best and so brave to put their lives in danger for us.It was a fascinating read.Not at all violent.Just a testimony to how hard they train. All SEALS are awesone.Thank you for protecting our country.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Elementary has transfered the the Sherlock Holmes character, with all his quirks, to modern day New York, and done it well. The personification of Watson as a female sober companion actually works and the interplay between the Holmes and Watson characters is entertaining. I also like the way the police are portrayed as competent collaborators with Holmes and not bumbling fools. Very entertaining show.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas album.  You hear the holiday selections in Rod's own unique manner.  It is an excellent deal!
B007Y36K46|5.0|We enjoyed this very much. Great characters, action and most of all a good storyline.<br />I recommend it highly!! Great for al ages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Full of unexpected twists and turns ...  a captivating read ... ... ... .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app butttttttt it keep saying that I need to sign up or log in so I do but it keeps saying its wrong but checked 10 times literally!!!!omg idk
B006BDHAX0|4.0|no variety in the tiles designs the look of the tiles become boring after awhile.  When I have gone through all the dragons what's next?
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I don't run.  When I try to run I fall down.  So I was so surprised that a book about running would capture my imagination and revisit the thought.  There is much to learn from this book on so many levels -- and it reinforced my feelings that not all running shoes are that great for you.  They always made me more clumsy, and I started to look at the whole concept of running from a completely different view point.<br /><br />But even if you don't run, you can certainly get many positive things out of this book.  I really recommend it.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|How do you rate a DVD. It is the movie I ordered which is the one my granddaughter wanted.  thank you
B0019IB0II|5.0|If you've ever known anyone who has had a stroke -- or any brain/neurological impairment -- this is so enlightening.  And that Dr. Taylor recovered (after 8 years) to be able to write this book and go on tour and talk about it is simply remarkable.  Dr. Taylor offers information that is so needed, not only for the medical profession, but for families of loved ones who have suffered some sort of brain damage.  You wonder what is happening in their minds, can they hear you, understand you, where are they?  Dr. Taylor offers some true and needed insight.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I had low expectations, but have enjoyed every episode of this show. I never buy tv show episodes, but I actually bought the whole season of this one. Can't wait to see how the rest of the season goes.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. gREAT SONGS AND GREAT LEAD SINGER<br />wHY , WHEN YOU ARE ASKING YOUR CUSTOMERS TO GIVE THEIR OPINION DO YOU MAKE THESE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW MANY WORDS TO WRITE? yOU ARE DISCOURAGING ME FROM EVER RESPONDING TO YOUR SURVEY AGAIN.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The issues were very realistic and both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones give an amazing performance.
B006T3RM08|3.0|My MacMini is connected to my television in the living room.  I thought this would be a great option to keep my trackpad and keyboard tidy on the coffee table.<br /><br />The fit for both is very snug and it looks nice.  The ONLY problem with this product is that it isn't square.  The front right corner (where the trackpad goes) is raised slightly.  This wouldn't be a problem except when you try to click on the trackpad, there is travel distance between the trackpad and the table-top.  This was solved by gluing a piece of plastic to the bottom in order to square the frame up a bit.<br /><br />Other than that, it is great, elegant, and recommendable.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I thought it was funny and the music was fun to listen to.  I definitely recommend it. I really liked seeing the diversity which made the movie more interesting and very likeable.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Really wished I spent my money on another movie. Bad acting. Bad plot. One of those movies where you wished you had bought a good book for your Kindle.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|The movie is great (of course), and the Blu-Ray quality is outstanding.  But I'm not in love with the packaging.  There is no hard case - the DVD is tucked inside the back cover of the book (I posted an image). It kind of looks like an afterthought.<br /><br />The book will surely show some wear on the cover as it is slid in and out of the bookcase.  I wish I had bought the regular Blu-Ray instead.  To me, the book isn't worth the extra cost.<br /><br />Just my 2¢......
B000OVLBHG|5.0|The advertising to join the military reminds me of Uncle Sam Wants You of the forties. The hype to join the service makes the youth of the world think its all fortune and glory. But then the ugly reality begins with the mobile infantry. Brilliant depiction of Heinlein's story.
B0031N2NFS|5.0|Haunting melodies and lyrics. Different from their previous works but extremely enjoyable. I would reccomend this to anyone that is into the Iron and Wine, or The National styles.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The movie surprised me.  There was more of a story than I expected, the plot held together, the casting was good, and the acting was not overwrought.  As baby boomers, the superhero-teenager-coming-of-age-first-love genre is usually gag-worthy, but this story was surprisingly sweet, engaging, and dramatic.  The whole killing-children thing is a pretty sick artefact of our modern movie craze, but this screenplay treated the whole subject with more sensitivity and depth - as in these kids are about the age of young soldiers and they are indeed at war in defense of all of us.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really loved this book. It's just what I've been looking for in a book. It's a little bit Harry Potter, a little bit Twilight but written very well. More adult. I cannot wait to read the second book!!
6305428042|5.0|Great movie!! Watch this every year with my future step daughter! Came out when I was little and will continue to be a classic!
B008RC72G8|4.0|I bought this because I like Johnny Depp. I think he is a good actor.His movies are funny and different.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After reading the first book was looking forward to seeing where the relationship went - too curious to put it down.
B00866JL96|4.0|I ought this movie because the previews looked like it was good. It was a good movie. Glad I got it
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was interesting.  I enjoyed the relationships and couldn't wait to read the next book.  It would be confusing to be in an unstable relationship like this!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I bought this because the previews looked like it was going to be good. I like vapire movies. It as a good movie
B007NG93CK|5.0|As good a read as ever from Kathy Reichs. Prefer the books to the TV series though - characters in series not as I imagined them in books.
B005LAII08|4.0|I bought this movie because the previews looked like it was going to be good. I like Disney movies too.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Item rec'd promptly/pristine condition; highly recommend this seller! A+++++++++++<br />I enjoyed these selections as much as those on the Duets cd.<br />Tony is always a winner, he just gets better every year!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|have this on my iphone and kindle. Its a lot easier than walking around with the paperback and easy to use
B005X5XIL0|5.0|Item rec'd promptly/pristine condition; highly recommend this seller!<br />This was a wonderful concert from start to finish.  Bocelli was perfection, as always, the Orchestra, Conductor and Westminster Choir were sublime and the guest performances were thrilling. Even the rain didn't dampen the appreciation of the audience.  It was perfection in all ways--truly memorable and I will treasure having it on my shelf for repeat performances!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this game. It's simple but good enough to keep my attention and have me playing for a while.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've enjoyed all of Tom Clancy's books.  This is no different.  The thrill and suspense is all there with the familiar charactors.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was skeptical before checking out this show, but I really like it. I'm looking forward to watching more of this season.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover does it again! Absolutely beautiful story and writing. I laughed, I cried and even yelled a bit. This book lives up to her reputation as a brilliant writer! Buy it and read it already!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run is fun and was very addicting when I first got it on my iphone. Its good on the Kindle as well tho
0879309210|5.0|Very readable. Comprehensive coverage of many areas. Gave me enough info to start tearing apart bolt-on neck guitars, replacing stuff, and tweaking all kinds of things on the guitars I own. Highly recommend.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The graphics are pretty. Slenderman actually walks around which if you get a chance to see it looks creepy and you can even see his tentacles writhe around. Its only 3 stars for me because I beat the game the second time I tried and now don't feel like I got my moneys worth...it was too quick for me and there aren't extra modes like on the PC.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is absolutely, positively the best Christmas comedy of all time.  It takes a somewhat less than average family and shows you their issues, etc during the holiday season.  I've watched it every year for the last 15 years or more.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy a good laugh.  Merry Christmas!
B001OB7R7S|4.0|I've been a Steely Dan fan for more years than I care to count. You can't beat the sound of Fagen.
B008OOYALE|5.0|We love it. I find myself updating the game and buying new things. My 5 year old loves dragons, so this is his perfect collection.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|The piano product was an ok product.. I would not pay to get it but it being free<br />my grandchildren can play it.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Enjoyed this movie with the kids.  It downloaded easily and quickly, and was very affordable.  Will consider Amazon next time we want to watch a movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My husband loves it and plays all of the Angry birds games. Hope<br />they come out with some new ones soon.
B009329ZF2|4.0|But I rented it because my husband and my son wanted to see it.  So we sat down, watched it, and I despite myself, I ended up enjoying it immensely.  Perhaps its because I expected it to be SO BAD that I was pleasantly surprised -- but we ended up watching it twice before I returned the movie to the Red Box.  And now I have purchased the blu-Ray for my husband for Christmas.<br /><br />The movie is rollicking and fun -- don't take it too seriously -- and its definitely a promo for the NAVY (they really make the Navy look COOL), but really what got me is 1. the main character -- his comedic timing is perfect for this fun flick and 2. The old war vets that they incorporated into the film... that added a touch of charm that I didn't expect.<br /><br />This is a family friendly movie! It will pair well with popcorn and mountain dew :-D
B004SBX112|5.0|I, myself, do not usually play it but my husband loves it<br />and all of the angry birds games.Hope they will come<br />out with some new ones soon because he plays the same<br />ones over and over
B0090EHVMC|1.0|Cute is fine.  There were some funny parts with the kid's mom and Disco music.  But the commentary on the EVIL corporations was pathetic as if governments were never EVIL or rapacious of the land.  Just look at Eastern Europe's environment when the Iron Curtain fell.  It wasn't private corporate greed or capitalism that ruined the rivers and streams in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />I can appreciate hyperbole.  This movie shows an extrapolation of policies that focus on making a buck today, with no view of the future sustainability.  I just reject the indoctrination of children to have the mantra, &#34;evil corporations&#34; pushed into their heads under the guise of a cute Seuss film.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I do not like it.. Too hard to build objects to get the bad piggies to move.<br />I would not recommend it to anyone over forty years old.. Maybe younger<br />kids know more about it than I do.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|Was a cute movie.  Some great laughs but overall not a good movie.  Surely not worth the money to buy.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I saw it twice at the movie theater and decided to buy it. Have watched again with pleasure and plan to do so again. Some reviewers may see it as too much a Woodie Allen vehicle, but we thought it was utterly charming. I keep hoping for that time machine limo to pass by my corner and take me to the golden age.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4-year-old niece loves this game. She can stay on it for an hour and always goes back to it. I have played it quite a bit myself too! Works great on the Kindle Fire. Light and cheery game. Lots to do.The customers remain<br />happy even when you shave them bald! I just wish there were more characters, but I still give it 5 stars.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|the video quality was good and the process was very easy would rent again ... the movie wasn't bad either
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is a great mystery and the facts are kept until the end.  I did not give this book a 5 star because at time the reading is a little too graphic for my taste.  This is the first Lee Child novel I have read and will probably read more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game for when your bored, I just wish I knew how to get puzzle pieces to show up,  I've been playing forever &amp; the puzzle pieces hardly ever show up! Not even sure what the puzzle pieces are used for either, but it's fun lol
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter  nothing more to be said  Loved the books and the movies
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams were great in this movie.  I was even impressed with Justin Timberlake's performance.  I didn't expect him to be such a good actor.  It was a nice story.  Movie kept my interest.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Riveting, a page turner building to a great climax!!! Amazon reccomendations does it again. The kindle makes it so easy!!
B007704HO6|4.0|After being in London recently it was rather intriguing to see the James and Bob worked in places I'd been. A cat lover of old even if only half of it is factual it was a great read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found this book ran the gammot of emotions.  Anyone who has children could identify with the parents.  It was a page turner for me.  There were many surprises and agonizing suspense.  I do not think many would guess the ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|simple solitaire! if you love playing this old card game when you get bored then this is the app for you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|So far I like this app its entertaing! I play it often I give it 5 stars!! I like that u can customize the cards and background!
B009O2XY12|4.0|liked the game but did not want to purchase anything tto keep playing it...so I deleted it  thanks for the fun for awhille
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book is a bit confusing because its storyline is parallel to Book #4 A Feast for Crows. The book narrows down the storyline, supposedly, to focus on a handful of major characters. Unfortuantely, the number of minor characters once again grows and becomes an annoying distraction. (It really is a shame because I enjoy the overall storyline.)
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I could not relate to the kind of life the main character lead, but I could feel her fear and her compulsion. Well-written book that will draw you in.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|By now most people have heard of this book series and have a marginal idea about the plot line. It does make for an interesting read. Unfortunately, there are way too many characters to keep track of -- not all are prominent characters. You need to remember cousins and uncles of current and past kings as well as expanded family fueds and land grabs. After a while this becomes tedious and you just wish the story would continue without a lot of minor characters distracting from the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game turned out to be an amazing game please exuse my terrible spelling even with the kindle fire spell check :)
B009FZHYKU|4.0|kick ass like it so far the play back works ok it buffers every three min or so sucks a little but i deal
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe in Heaven, first off. I enjoyed the book because many of the things that I believe in about Heaven, and I have never even come close to being in or near Heaven, Dr. Alexander mentions that he saw or experienced while there. Even his feeling about being with God and then being separated from God, I believe that that is what it will be like.<br /><br />It was also good to read a neurosurgeon/scientist's account of life beyond death from one that didn't believe in &#34;any of that stuff&#34;. I liked the fact that he also ran down the 7,8,or,9 most popular explanations that another neurosurgeon would give, as he said &#34;just like I would have&#34;, after hearing about this experience from one of his patients.<br /><br />A wonderful book and highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am never disappointed by the Michael Connelly books, especially the Harry Bosch ones. The Black Box was another hit, keeping you guessing till the very end. The characters are so believable and you really can get very attached to them. I always feel sad when I finish a Harry Bosch book, I know it'll be a while before I get to read about him again. I hope Michael Connelly has one coming out soon!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who enjoyend any of the other bourne movis. Fast paced. A lot of action. Have to see the other movies to appreciate this one
0525478817|5.0|Super fast shipping- a great read to curl up on the couch with  blanket and a nice beverage. will get lost in the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything as advertised.  Nice to have the memory so that you can recall previous equations.  I would say get it if you don't have it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and very convenient. Know what is going on weather wise in your area or your favorite holiday/vacation spots.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nelson DeMille and have been waiting for this book.  I had pre-ordered it.  I'm only halfway through it but it lives up to my expectations and his previous novels.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This APP woke up my Kindle. Only complaint I had was ,&#34;Why didn't this come pre-loaded with the Kindle in the first place? Sort of like buying a car and learning the wheels come separate.
B000001FMC|4.0|Class group with Jazz and Pop influences. Sexy and easy to listen to. Dynamic videos to check out helped me in this choice.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|My husband and I love this movie! And since the Walking Dead has brought so much popularity to Zombie themed movies, I hope he will enjoy this Christmas gift.
B00AAQ7JNA|1.0|MPEG-2 in 2012? 224 kbps DD in 2012 on a bluray! Are you kidding me! I have dvd concerts with 1.5 mbps DTS on a 4.7gb dvd.<br /><br />This is unacceptable in every sense of the word and the menus are dvd quality too boot! The disc needs to be redone or taken off the market end of story.<br /><br />Her bluray concert from 2008 had DTS-HD and AVC and looked fantastic on a BD-25! A BD-25 is more than enough room for great audio and video of concert material. The DTS-HD track is over 5 mbps for most of the concert.<br /><br />For those that got the deluxe edition of her new cd a sampler of the concert is on a dvd. The sound mix is totally different and sounds much better. The dvd uses .19 kbps 2 channel DD. The bluray uses .224 kbps 5.1 DD and .12 kbps 2 channel DD and the bluray sounds noticable worse with both tracks than the dvd. Be prepared to turn up your receiver as well. Mine went up by 10+ db. MPEG-2 averages around 18 mbps for video.<br /><br />Amazon quite selling this for good reason. This appears to be a great concert that needs a redo concerning it's bluray! Houstan we have a problem!
B004DHAC04|5.0|First off... The supporting players in the Sudan were actual &#34;Fuuzzy-Wuzzies&#34; of Kipling's poem.<br />Second, It stuck very close to the book.  Third, and most important, the actors really worked at<br />convincing me they were who they portrayed. Think I'll buy the DVD...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is the most unique show ever!  It is so much different than one would expect a show like this to be.  It is more about the characters (which are amazing - outstanding character development) than just being just another &#34;zombie&#34; movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's best books.  I place it right along with THE DOME, and I have read that book twice.  First time as a book, and second time on my Kindle.  I'm sure I will go through this one twice also !
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is a bit different from a lot of the superhero movies and tv shows.  It is very entertaining and good character development.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I wished they had more maps but other then that its pretty good. it is a bit choppy, but considering all the other slender games are scams its good.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've only just gotten to the Domestic section of the book (and I've been reading the kindle version on the kindle app), but the whole book has been full of helpful tips and great strategies for learning and doing things quicker and better. I'm hoping to take the tips on language learning and help teach my father conversational Spanish in the next two months. On top of everything, it's teaching me to look at food in a whole new light. I cooked before, but as I read through I find myself becoming more thoughtful in how I spice and prepare my food.<br /><br />Congratulations on another solid book, Tim!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I knew that Greg was never gonna get the girl....but who knew.........I don't wanna spoil the book. But who new that person would end up getting a girl friend!!!
B009K0OL06|4.0|Continually interesting plot twists and surprises. Some of the acting is less than completely compelling but I came back for each new episode.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This is a beautiful watch,for a goods price, I like recommend it. is super and flashy invicta is the good brand.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game but there may be something out there that may have less ads.<br />But since it's free who can complain.
B009JBZH54|5.0|all three movies are fantastic and with the Blu ray the picture quality couldn't be better. I LOVE THESE MOVIES
B00A757EFW|4.0|well, its pac-man all right! an old-fashioned, well put together game. I like it a lot, simple task and goal not much too it. Great for a quick-paced timekiller. its a nice game but it does have a couple downs. I am not sure if its just me, but this game gets REALLY boring REALLY fast. that's the only thing I don't like about it. otherwise its an ok game. old yet crazy fun. lol
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed ths book immensely. Righ till the end you were I sure what the lead character was up to. It was a different type of book for John Grisham.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its an overall great game, I just don't see any real good reason not to like the game. good fun, nice graphics, nice everything. I think Rovio did a great job on its most original game, plus it was the first I downloaded. Great job rovio.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I can't believe I haven't reviewed these already as I've purchased them several times.  We use these often to listen to audiobooks. They fit any size ear pretty well as they aren't filling the ear canal like ear buds.  I like that my ears stay dry and comfortable for hours unlike when using ear buds or headphones with full ear coverage.<br /><br />If you don't have the volume too loud you can hear someone talk, a vehicle approaching or someone running up behind you so I feel safer wearing them instead of ear buds when I'm outside. If you regularly need to block out your neighbor's barking dog or screaming children so you can hear your music or audiobook, these are not the headphones for you.<br /><br />The negative is the cord as it is very thin and easy to stretch and break near the entrance hole into the headband with one tug too many. We roll and tie the cord so it is long enough to fit into our mp3 player with just a little ease. That keeps the cord from getting snagged on drawer knobs and such. The good thing is that the broken cords are usually easy to repair if they break near the headband and you can do a little soldering. I keep the old headphones for spare parts for repairing others.<br /><br />I just ordered 3 more to last us a few more years.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read every Nelson DeMille book and this one is a favorite, I love John Corey's humor and the action is terrific.
B00ABYM6K2|3.0|The aspect ratio on this streaming film seems entirely wrong. The figures appear vertically elongated and I couldn't discover any way to make an adjustment. The film itself is great.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|Love the tunes & especially Sarah's melodic voice.  The orchestration is superb, subtle when it needs to be and grand when it makes a difference.
B005IQZB14|5.0|very compelling and well- written, this story grabs you and you can't stop reading.  i love adventure stories, and this one is a winner.  the personal growth aspect is there as well, all wrapped up in a great read.  it's as close as i'll ever come to hiking the pacific crest trail, but it does give you the feeling of what it must be like to do it.  highly recommended.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book chronicles the discovery and treatment of cancer, from the barbaric to modern day cures/palliation/treatment. The book is fascinating, but not one that can be &#34;speed-read&#34;. Every page is eye opening and educational ....imagine using a microscope powered by candlelight to discover leukemia! This book can be read by clinicians and non-clinicians; however, I feel that it should be required reading for anyone that works in the medical field. As a hospice RN, I see the end result from non curable diseases; to know that technology is advancing to help people overcome illness is inspiring. Hope is all any of us has; empowerment through education is second only to that hope, in regards to disease process and progression. READ THIS BOOK!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I leave this cable next to my computer when I want to connect my Fire so I can transfer photos from the computer.
B005HSL626|5.0|Took a second download attempt, but after that it worked fairly seamlessly. Basic concept- slash fruit. Simple enough to Zen out and let your mind relax, and burn off a little stress. Fun!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Entertaining but juvenile in parts.  The author is very tech-oriented and part of the story touches on  friends of the protagonist who do computerized &#34;boob simulations&#34; (his words, not mine) for the film industry--just to make female actresses look more, er, realistic.  Might be just a tad offensive to female readers.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Was a good alternate look for a &#34;what if&#34; type of story. I liked it because I like Lincoln and was different that the same ol, same ol in vampire tales.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I love true stories.... Stories where people pull themselves up by the bootstraps to change themselves and help others!<br /><br />Sam Childers has hit rock bottom.  After he realizes he has nowhere to go but up, he makes his move.... It's not easy, even after Sam finds God....<br /><br />I especially like the speech Sam gives the banker when the banker tells him he can't lend him any more money...  Again, Sam finds a way to help the children of Sudan.  The movie is graphic but realistic; the children have suffered horrifically yet they are still kind, gentle souls; and children are forced to kill by the leaders of the LRA.<br /><br />Don't just watch this movie for entertainment; it really does share the woes of life in Africa.  It is a life lesson and really makes me appreciate what missionaries are doing for those who cannot help themselves.<br /><br />I give this movie 5 *****s.  Enjoy!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|As the title states, I really enjoyed all the tracks. It's a great first album that I would recommend to both violin and pop enthusiasts alike.
B006O6F932|5.0|My kids really enjoy it.  Very hard to find in stores.<br />Lot of fun for everyone this xmas.<br />Enjoy it
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a great show!  The characters are just hilarious. We just laugh at all the funny quirks and sci-fi referrences.  It's so funny!!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Considering the cast of well known actors I was expecting much more but was disappointed.<br />Maybe if you like dark comedy...
B007N5YY2K|4.0|Was good and engaging. Had a few bumps in the road but I enjoyed it very much - nice mix of suspense and humour.
B005CMSDLE|3.0|Beautiful settings and an interesting premise, but there was too much violence and Cate Blanchett's performance was TERRIBLE! (Amazing--I've never seen her anything less than great.)
B006GECE9Y|5.0|It has the least glitches and problems for any flash-supporting browser that I have used. They did a good job with this one. Very smooth on my SGS2, though works well on the SGS3 too.
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|My family and I love listening to this album every year! It's classic Tull but very upbeat and appropriate at this time of year.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Easy to use, all around does a good job. Ive only tried it for portraits can wait to try landscapes
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Delighted to be able to get this video on my Kindle. I accidently missed this episode. The interaction between characters, the comedy relief, it is still the best program on TV!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great story line and twists/turns. Was engaging from the start and didn't go quite where I expected it to..great ending.
B004EK926K|4.0|A great remake of the original dickens classic. Jim Carey isn't too over the top. The animation is just beautiful. I picked up the bluray so we can watch it every year.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I really like this product. It syncs with Titanium Backup and stores all of my electronic books for school. As a point of interest, it randomly upgraded my to the 50 gig storage for a year recently.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great plot. You never how far it is giong to go and if Reacher will survive. But what I'm beginning to figure out, NOBODY BEATS REACHER!
B00000IZOR|5.0|I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I thought this would be a stupid or even inappropriate movie for my young kids---but it was really funny and sweet with a wonderful message. The whole family loved it.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Could have been better but still was enjoyable. Action was pretty well paced and the story line was ok...zombies could have been more aggressive. Yeah I know, I know; not that kind of movie, still they could have been a little less wimpish.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|Movie developed characters and was able to expand story line better than most book adaptions. Director and editor did great job getting all needed info into movie
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Roy has an amazing voice that is difficult to match. Tommy sounds great on this album. I was very concerned about the change, but hopefully this eases any concerns others may have about it.
B00913DPW2|4.0|This is the best game that I have played on kindle so far. The puzzles are challenging. It is fun to have a game that actually requires the use of your brain. I enjoyed the graphics and the structure. The coins are only used to get silly fortunes, so that seems like a waste. The rest of the game is complex and interesting.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Came with no instructions. Can' t figure out how to delete photos or videos. However, it does a good video.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a cliffhanger at the end!  I can't wait to start reading the final book. I know I won't be able to put it down!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Took off with a bang and kept right on going with the action and thrills. Really, really enjoyed it. No disappointments.
1419707663|5.0|the Wimpy kid movies got my grandchildren started on these books.  I love to see them read instead of watch TV
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I really like the purchase that I made from them. Its a great carrying case for everyday purposes when I dont need extra lenses.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This show is so funny every episode gets better , I thought when my kids told me to sit and watch this with them it was going to be stupid or dumb , I WAS WRONG
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This ia another Great 5 star Movie!  I would definatly recommend it to family & friends..I also have have Beverly Hills Chihuahua  & Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 which in my opinion were also 5 star movies! the picture & sound Quality are great. & I also received This DVD in good condition.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|I love this movie, this is the best Christmas movie of all time, but I am really disappointed that the 2012 DVD release is missing the &#34;When Love is Gone&#34; song...they just cut it right out. Its very bizarre. Be warned if you buy this product, its not the whole movie!
B00008WT5E|5.0|Great CD!  It arrived from Amazon well-packaged and very quickly.<br /><br />About the CD itself, it's one of the best AC/DC albums in their collection.  This isn't as raw or as heavy as its predecessor, &#34;Let There Be Rock&#34;, but the songs are terrific.  Highly recommended if you're a fan of the band, especially of Bon Scott.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|i enjoyed these movies in this series. the story just keeps moving.  on a different note your reviews don'y allow me to express what i wish to say. you make me feel like i am i school with a specific words assiginement
B003Y059EK|5.0|i've always loved this movie! It's awesome....I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Wizard of Oz. It's not exactly like the original as far as the set design and characters but still worth watching.
B008XCM18Q|2.0|Yeah, usually books are better than the movies, not in this case. I'm almost finished with it and struggling to maintain interest. The dialogue often doesn't ring true, something a writer would write, not something that a person would say. The movie streamlined a complicated plot, and made Bourne's female pal way more believable.
6305428042|5.0|This is a very funny movie and I would highly recommend it to my family & friends I watch this wonderful movie all of the time. This movie met all of my expectations. I also received this DVD in good condition.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|It took a while to get into the story. It then became interesting and built up to a fascinating ending.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Josh Brolin is excellent as a young Agent K.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is solid science fiction, and the personal story will tug at your heart strings.<br /><br />I recommend.<br /><br />Jeff Irvin
B001FB4W02|4.0|My set came on time. there is nothing wrong with any of the disks i wish season 1-5 would come out on blue ray.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I can not seem to get into it.  The book is disjointed and does not seem to flow from one chapter to another.
B009GESJH2|5.0|i bought the cd blind, hadnt heard any of the music  it is awsome  i love kid rock  he is amazing
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series, ever since the beginning. Pushes the envelope on many levels, especially the way the show explores human dynamics/desire to survive.... Huge thumbs up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a very great game but in the next update needs to have a lot of stuff added for it to be a whole lot better.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I like that this Blu-ray doesn’t force you to look at a bunch of previews when you initially pop it in… Sure, it starts to play previews and commercials, but you can select the VIEW button (on the PS3 remote) and go right to the main menu, which is much more user-friendly and convenient than the average menu, so you don’t have to skip-forward one preview at a time.<br />When Frank Miller’s “Dark Knight Returns” came out it brought me back into the Comic Book stores, where I found other titles such as Animal Man and Sandman.  This is a worthy adaptation of Frank Miller’s classic graphic novel, even if it’s not a panel by panel replica, and I can’t wait for Part 2.<br />Peter Weller (of Buckaroo Banzai fame) provides an excellent Batman voice, perhaps the best ever. I also enjoyed the digital version of the original comic included here as an extra feature, which lets you move panel by panel after showing the whole page and looks good on the screen… unfortunately it won’t remember where you stopped, so you’ll have to go the beginning each time.<br />“Her Name is Carrie, Her Role is Robin” is a short documentary featuring interviews with Bruce Timm, screenwriter Bob Goodman, Grant Morrison and others, that I wish had been longer.<br />There’s also a two-part Two-Face story from the archives.<br />I’ve been a Batman fan since I was a kid, and now I’m probably as old as the character is in this story… and it all still works.<br />I would recommend this to a friend, and in fact already have. I’m also giving this as a present.
B009NH9IMM|3.0|My movie came on time and was well packaged. there are no scratches on any of the disks everything is fine.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Weatherbug is cleaner and easier to move around in. Too much data to search through to get what you want.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Too long and too much car chase.  Predictable but kind of expected that since it was a Bourne movie. OK
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a Colleen fan and this book did not disappoint me in the least bit. A very powerful story. Really enjoyed the book
B007TXN4TK|3.0|there were only 10 songs or so to choose from. The game is fun but the selection is very limited.
B007TVANDM|5.0|I bought this when my daughter was 23 months. She still loves hearing me read it. And she's starting to respond and sing-along.
B000L212HW|4.0|My blue ray came on time. it play's just fine i'm very happy with my movie there are no scratches on it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. very addictive! there is a lot that you can do! so many things you can buy and its easy to get acorn's.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Love being able to read something I like while waiting / wasting time as in a doctors office. I use on my iPad but was surprised to find that is also appeared in my iPhone.
B000WTXD30|5.0|This collection of songs should be in everyone's MP3 player! Great classics! The price is well worth it! I suggest you add it to your collection!
034580404X|5.0|This was the best love story I have ever read!!!!<br /><br />It seemed very real.  The characters were very convincing.  I have read the trilogy twice.<br /><br />Looking forward to the movie!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game, lots of fun.  Can't beat the price either. Try it you'll like it..  A fun game for new angry birds users
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very good product.  Easy to use.  Easy to read.  The only problem I have is not being able to play some is the games like Slingo Bingo on the Fire.
B0016CTX68|5.0|The Rolling Stones is the most persistent rock group. It is amazing how much energy and joy is still in their live performances in their *sixth* decade on stage. Much of the explanation for their successes can be found in the tracks of Let it Bleed, which has masterpiece written all over it. Here you will find songs that can be played as if they were just written this past week. They are all that good on this record.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A real page-turner, hard to put down, and full of twists and turns. Highly recommended for mystery lovers and someone in need of an easy but engrossing book.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|This game sucks. It doesn't work like it says it will. Waste of time don't download this. You can save time and do anything else.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|This is the greatest series of Vampire stories I have read in a very long time.  Am so looking forward to the rest of the series.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I didn't appreciate getting half way through the game, and being asked for more money to complete it! When you pay for something that should be it!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game is awesome because it is a combination of two of my favorite games star wars and angry birds
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I have to admit I was skeptical when my son and daughter took me to see the Avengers. But I left a fan. It was very entertaining and exciting. The Hulk was the b est so far. Have a bit of trouble getting used to the NIck Fury charater. I have not r ead marvel comics in many years. But this is not the Fury I read back in the 60s and 70. Watch this movie till the end! That is wheret he best lines are said!!!e
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I wanted to see this movie since they were advertising it but...Not even half as funny as Family Guy is....a little disappointed.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|My  local store had stopped carrying this season right before I decided to buy it. Was very happy to be able to order this and add it to my NCIS collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought 2 of these for my sons for Christmas. They were thrilled. I am not a Dark Knight fan but it was fun watching all 3 movies together.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|for a fighting game is good for kindle fire. one of the few games there is that you don't need Internet to play. unless you want upgreaded weopons and gear.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|A must see movie, if you are a Clint Eastwood fan. Awesome movie, Sean Penn is great as well in his role.....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I purchased this game for my Kindle Fire for my 6 yr old grandson to play, but had no idea that I would get hooked on it as well! Love this game! Harder than it first appears, yet once you solve a puzzle you realize how obvious the solution actually was. I highly recommend for all ages 6 and up.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Did not want to put it down! This is a great book full of action and intrigue. I would recommend to anyone who likes a fast pace adventure book.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I try to get a new Christmas DVD every year and had been watching for this particular one, but not seeing it in the stores anymore. My children are now grown up but we still enjoy this version of the Christmas Carol.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Do you love Harry Potter?  Do you wish you had all of the movies in one set?  Then this is a great buy.  You have all 8 movies in one package!  What a great collection!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|As always the birds give me a fun time.  I purchase this app for my kids, but I love to play too.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|who doesn't love this book? Excellent piece of literature. I enjoyed this in high school and decided to get the ebook for an overseas flight. This is definitely one of my favorite books.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|WALL-E is a great movie for kids and adults alike. The first two-thirds of the movie has almost no dialog, because it's mostly WALL-E on screen by himself. You're almost taken by surprise when the first human appears later in the movie and you realize that you've sat through (and enjoyed) an hour of a movie with almost no words! The movie is that well done! This is a movie you'll watch over and over with your kids.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I have seen other reviews of this movie and I was not quite sure I should spend the money.  I did like the story - it seems to complete the trilogy nicely.  Not every story ends the way we would like but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was a good game. I wish it were a bit longer though. I have never been disappointed. with G5 games.
B005LAII08|5.0|What a great movie!  Great story line, good characters, and just an overall good movie.  It's about a princess who tries to change her fate and go against her mother's wishes, but in the process finds something amazing along the way.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love this character. Couldn't put it down. Action filled and a great page turner.. Looking forward to the next book
0061124958|5.0|I loved this book and movie as a child. I am thrilled to be able to share it with my child as she starts reading chapter books.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved Wild from the opening lines.  It's a captivating story of one woman's struggle to find her way in life and on the PCT.  It's metaphorical prose is engaging and deeply moving.  Wild is a raw account of Cheryl's adventure through cold, dark, bright and beautiful.  It's a narrative I won't soon forget.  Our men's book group is reading it in January 2013.
1878424319|4.0|It is great for life in general and helps you find focus, in my experience because of depression and anxiety.<br />I think though that it would appeal to a range of readers, It is written very well and is easy to absorb.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|feel good storey with a simple plot and wrapped around some history,now look forward to the movie.Could almost believe I was there
B00005JKZ3|3.0|The first movie was great.  However this movie fell short when compared to the first one.  It's got a lot of toilet humor and the acting is all right.  If you need all three movies then get it, otherwise just rent it and find out for yourself.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very well written and I couldn't put it down.  However, I found it hard to believe that the book ended and kept turning the pages for more.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|One of my favorite artists. Not a fan of the country songs but loved all of the new songs on this album.
B0087HT36U|2.0|I found this app to be boring and not very fun to play.  After playing this game I decided it was to much like other games like angry birds and those were better made then this game.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Fun game, addicting, would be better if it was multi player. I would recommend this game to others that want to play a fun game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|And quite correct from a hacker perspective regarding attacks and cyber war. Great read, and a &#34;Stu's warmly recommended one.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an AMAZING book. I have just cried tears of joy and sadness for the last hour or so. As I was reading i was going to write about how you can't judge a book/person by their cover or rumors but this book is much So more. I loved Holder and Sky. To see all the pain and joy that came from this story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. One of the best books I've read so far.
B0045XICB2|5.0|purchased this as a christmas gift for my daughter, im sure shes going to love it, as for me I dont watch this kind of stuff
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun cantstop playing you should get it no ads its the best my kids love it I love it do much
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I like the concept of this game where you get to build different vehicles to move the pig to the achieved goal of each scenario.  My only problems with this game is that there are not enough levels (I wanted to play more then they had).  I also found the adds that popup during play can be a little annoying at times.<br /><br />I also found a few bugs in this program where once the game reset and lost my progress in the game, causing me to redo all of the levels I had done prior.  I also found that the skull sandbox level caused some items to be deleted/removed after collecting some of the stars.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoyed Michael Connelly's The Black Box, but then I'm a fan of Harry Bosch! Check it out. It is sure to please.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|would give more stars if i could. it was a riveting book. Best i have read in a long time.
B004X75RCW|4.0|It’s a cute romantic-comedy with a typical and predictable plot, but I enjoy that type of movie. A warning to those who are downloading to HD to Kindle, make sure your internet is fast enough for HD. I purchased HD but had to download standard. It’s probably not an issue with most users. Also, you must be connected to the internet to watch; something I didn’t know.
B0097BO21G|5.0|I've been listening to this album for years. Celine's vocals out extraordinary on this album. My favorite track is &#34;War is Over&#34; and &#34;Ava Maria&#34;.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|If you want action with a glued to your seat story line, you will love this movie. Ordered my own copy!
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Every page brought back memories of my own rural and small town childhood just after WWII, even though my life was in the U.S., not Canada.  Munro manages to find the universalities of life regardless of time and space.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|4 of my brother in laws have a LifeProof and love it. They work well. However, buyer beware of purchasing one off of the web. I ordered one for me and one for my husband and both were bogus items. Were missing parts, didn't have seals, package had been opened and taped shut, etc. Only reason I'm rating the product is so people will be wary of who they get their case from. Otherwise the product is fantastic. Plus not bulky at all for being such an extreme case!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Silly but I like how the Colors give me an instant and accurate readout of my battery life. I used the free version for almost a year and in keeping with my philosophy if I still use the free version for that long I dump the ads and upgrade to a pro version. I have not regretted this choice yet. I believe in supporting good products.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It is a good movie.  Not the greatest, but has its funny parts.  There are some stupid parts also.  That is why I only gave it 3 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|oldy but goody something to do when you cant get on line wait for someone at dr office or to get gas etc
B002BI6SMI|5.0|One of his best movies ever! Fast moving ruthless, fearless mission to find and retrieve his daughter from brutal sex slave lords.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I bought this album because I liked Thrift Shop; I checked out some videos online and was absolutely blown away.  I know the videos add a lot to each song, but simply listening to this album every day to and from work, I am completely blown away.  I've contemplated buying it as a gift for a number of people that I know; today a young co-worker told me she was struggling with drinking and I immediately thought of the second to last track which talks about Macklemore's struggles with the same issue and I think his song could help her.  This album is a blast to listen to but still focuses on real life.  It's helped me.<br /><br />There are a number of tracks that I have found to be powerful, both in their musical construction and their lyrical content.  I play through new albums slowly, listening to each track multiple times before moving on, and some tracks are worthy of an album purchase all on their own.  I have big hopes for this artist and would absolutely buy a follow-up album if it is similar.<br /><br />There is however one huge blemish on this otherwise amazing record:  Schoolboy Q's lyrics on the song White Walls.  These are counter to everything Mackelmore seems to be about - they glorify \\"white hoes in the back seat snorting coke\\", stealing liquor, and having unprotected sex.  This album is largely about Mackelmore's struggles with alcohol and drug abuse and the importance of humility and non-materialism.  Schoolboy, go back to school - if you're going to rap, learn some rhetoric.  I absolutely hate that part of that song.  If I had heard this song first instead of Thrift Shop, I would have avoided this album entirely.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Ending seemed a bit rushed, but a fun read. I apparently need to add 11 more words here they are.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombie Epidemic.... The most Anticipated Season of the year!!!!<br />I'm addicted I go back and even watch previous episodes.<br />I really hope they keep this amazing show going.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Some of my favorite British actors appear in this film. There are some very delightful and some surprising twists, others not so surprising but very satisfying none the less. I wish they would have used the backdrop of India more, in a cinematic-art-photography way, but it was very well done. Maybe they did, and I just wanted panoramic landscapes instead of crowded streets. At just over 2hours I thought it might drag, but was in fact very well paced all the way through.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|haven used it much cause it is late in the evening when i use the devise and i did not have head set have head gear now will try fo more fun
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee child is the master of psychological research of the human mind.<br />He takes you thru the whole thought processes logically all the way thru the book.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise.  Non stop action coupled with a good storyline.  Much better than the AS version with really hot chicks.  I recommend it completely.
0786860707|5.0|If you love or want to know about animation this is still the book to get. I would classify this as the Bible of animation anyone interested in this field, it would be a mistake not to own this book.<br /><br />In reading this book it tells you about the history of Disney animation the 9 old men.<br />I'm barely through this book and loving every min of it. It's amazing to see how far we have come reading this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never in my life have I been captivated by a television show like this - terrific actors - just can't stand knowing that it will eventually have to end
075669812X|5.0|My son Sebastian love it and he is a Ninja Go fan. His favorite is the Gold Ninja plus all of them!
B001HN6922|5.0|wonderful story line grate morels good cast fun movie jest like the first one cool job thank you very much
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is the best show ever! And this season is the best they have done yet! The characters are well matched and the drama is just enough...peppered with a dash of intrigue and a bit of humor too! The writers for this series are wonderful...and the actors really bring the story to life. Very believable!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Great holiday movie- my two year old loves it!! He loves singing the hot chocolate song and asks to watch it every day- he has only seen it twice, but it has stuck with him!!
B007N9FKCY|3.0|The first several levels were cute and trying to get thru them were different and felt good about getting thru them. I got tired of the music but needed it to make it enjoyable. The FAOTD are at least a way to try some games that I would not normally enjoy. This was one.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been a fan of the Jack Ryan for years, and to hear that his legacy is still living evolving in Tom Clancy's mind fills me with a lot of hope for the world...
B004EPZ03O|5.0|There is a quote on the front of the DVD which best describes this movie: If you aren't a Muppets fan, you will be! This is for long-time Muppets fans or those who have never seen Muppets before. Great songs and cute story. I received this DVD promptly and in perfect condition. It was a great gift!
B000P0J024|5.0|the music is wonderful very light and fun to sing with the songs you know and nice to hear the ones you dont
B000Q7ZO8U|2.0|I purchased this blu-ray to replace a damaged dvd version.  My dvd version had a 1.85:1 ration that fills up the entire screen on my tv.  The blu-ray version is like 1.240:1 which gives you about 20 inches on a 60 inch screen.  I couldn't see any higher quality with it being in 1080p over the dvd.  It was cheap at under $10, which is it's most redeeming quality.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love this book; it is an education about what is happening in an area of the world I didn't know very much about and I LOVE the humor of the main character.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Fantastic - I love the 3-d effects and the grand kids stay real quite & still.  We all love it!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|So glad this finally came out on DVD. One of Barbra Streisand's life achievements, this movie is compelling both visually and aurally. She and Patinkin are fabulous performers and singers, and even Irving does a good job. The story is well known, but if you suspend belief just a little, you can really find the layers of meaning in Streisand's superb direction.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|The DVD arrived very promptly and in perfect condition. This movie is for anyone who likes creepy movies, especially from the 1980's. Very satisfied, thank you!
B005K17RU0|4.0|It loads and updates far more efficiently than The Weather Channel app. Great graphic display is easy to read at a glance.  I really like it!  Months later -- still like this best and now it's my primary, go-to weather app.  I had to update  this because everything still applies, but recent updates cause this app to load slower and lock up easier.  Also, the ads that support the free app are really, truly annoying.  This last update almost seems to be designed to lure people away from the free app to the paid app which does not have ads, so supposedly solves the previous two problems.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|I've watched both the original and newer versions of Miracle on 34th Street.  I know that comparing 1947 movies to 1994 doesn't always translate well, but I think that the newer version flows much better than the original.  The story is very close with only minor changes but I really like the actors in the newer version better.  Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle and Mara Wilson as Susan Walker are the stand outs in this movie.  Everyone just seems more likeable in this version than the original.  Maybe it's because the store is fictitious in the new new movie and the characters don't seem as hard edged.  Anyway, I found this version to be more enjoyable than the original even though I usually prefer the older versions.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The best of the Batman movies by far. Good Characters. Enough action to make action freeks happy.  Good story with godd subplots. Sets up &#34;Robin&#34; movies.  I wonder what they will be like.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Not really happy with this app. Not sure if I need to fix a setting, or what. But can't view much of my wall or anyone. when on my home screen I can only see a short period of time. any suggestions appreciated.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|If you've read the book, the movie plays out just like you saw it in your mind; if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this movie. Disturbing? For sure. Compelling? Absolutely! Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS APP. THE FIRST THING TO DO IN THE MORNING is to open this APP to check the weather.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|When I decided to read this I was honestly torn, the reviews are either extremely good or extremely bad! I completely understand because wow this is just an extreme book! This book just seemed very real to me, the characters are all people you absolutely love to hate because they are really emotional but it was honest emotion and honest mistakes. I don't think you can truly relate to emotions like this  unless you've been there and in that situation. Some reviews have said that Travis was unstable and needed therapy, but I just saw how honest he was with Abby and how he really tried to change but in the end he didn't need to change. Some relationships are dysfunctional but i don't believe this was one of those, she was emotional scarred by her past but like its always been said you can take someone away from something but it'll always be apart of them whether good or bad. I think people look at this from various points in their life but im 21, i know how up in air relationship can be when your young, so the back and forth and insecurities are there because there's a long road ahead and they just can't know where their mistakes and decisions could take them. I could definitely feel the love and frustration of trying so hard but never quite getting it right with abby and travis! I read about them and it's like seeing my best friends in a book because man i've seen some fight exactly like that lol! I'm definitely a happy reader, cant wait for Travis's POV!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A different twist on the Sherlock style detective series. The actors work well together for these stories. I would certainly enjoy more of this series providing the writing continues at this high a level.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I found this one a little far fetched. It seems a little hard to believe that a normal, well adjusted teen would agree to do this. But, as alway, great storytelling.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book keeps you guessing until the very end.  The twists and turns make this an interesting book and one that you will not want to put down.  I enjoyed it as it was a great suspenseful novel without a predictable plot.
0784011176|2.0|I loved Holly Hunter in &#34;Saving Grace&#34;, so I went searching for movies in which she starred. This slow-moving, depressing movie is one I wish could un-see. Save your money and buy the &#34;Saving Grace&#34; collection.
B0009UC810|5.0|I bought this movie for my boss for Christmas. She had been looking for it for awhile and couldn't find it. The movie was in great shape and well packaged.
0439023521|5.0|I love to read and this book holds my interest.  I bought the following 2 books in the trilogy and am sure i will enjoy those as well
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Our kids are 5 and 2. They love the movie. It has very nice songs, too. Just brings smiles back when one of them  starts humming the tunes...
B0096CDG0O|4.0|It's like playing Yahtzee with your friends. I like the &#34;dice&#34; sounds. Very realistic and fun. I recommend this game!
B0085YNML2|5.0|This game is a great mix of strategy and physics.  And it is super cute, too!  Definitely a must buy!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny movie and the songs are great. It is glee on steroids :-) If you like glee you'll love this one!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it keep the kids in their toes as they play and enioy the activity .they are looking foward top play the game over and over  again.
0439023491|4.0|A great book by a great author to complete the trilogy!  Hunger Games is a great read and hoping to enjoy the next 2 books as much
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's \\"Total Recall\\" kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.<br /><br />Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Minority Report\\".<br /><br />Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.<br /><br />The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?<br /><br />Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (\\"Underworld\\", \\"Die Hard 4\\") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.<br /><br />However, I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one.
B000NY12LO|5.0|In light of recent tragedies, I still reflect back on the heartbreak portrayed in this story. As usual, Jodi Picoult is spot on with her character development.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|This 3-cd collection of the best of Michael Jackson is very well done. Hard to find (thank you Amazon.com). Mike's greatest hits here are well chosen and well listed. Loved it. If you want a piece of the KING in your cd-collection, this 3-cd set is well done ! Enjoy magic behind Mike's music, you won't regret it.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Even if you are not a Stevie Wonder fan, it's hard to do better than 21 songs for $2.99. This is/was an Amazon Prime offering. It's a deal.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|In Phantom the author has run out of ideas This is an overreaching, convoluted plot. I became uninterested in the characters long before the end.
0439023513|5.0|Love this trilogy...great novel by a great author....I will read all 3 in the trilogy!  Arrived very quickly and at a great price
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This was a fun movie with sophomoric humor.  Perfect for a good laugh after a long day at the office.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I ordered it and received it before the scheduled date. Glad I read the book first as it made the movie much easier to understand.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I would have never thought that Star Trek could be remade so that it felt like a fresh concept. I really enjoyed this but I'm a Star Trek fan to begin with.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical Tom Clancy. Especially timely as cyberthreat debates are going on. Multiple unexpected twists and turns of the plot. Lots of technical detail Quick entertaining read
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like the people, it was awful from beginning to end. Five other readers agree with me. I do not understand how anyone could recommend it.
034580404X|3.0|No reflection on the seller just did not like this trilogy.  if you want to read a harlequin romance with a loittle bit of stupid sex, read this
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie was just as compelling as  &#34;Forest Gump.&#34;  I love the way it travels in a time line... great movie to watch as a family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book so quickly.  The subject matter was tough at times, but it was a beautifully written book.  I don't know how Ms. Hoover does it, but she can create the most beautiful, emotional, (and sometimes sexually charged!) scenes that just suck you right into the story.  As with her prior novels, Slammed and Point of Retreat, she does an excellent job creating thorough and believable (if somewhat extra quirky) characters.<br />To sum it up, I loved it, couldn't put it down, can't wait for another Colleen Hoover book.
098555780X|5.0|Great book. even better photos !! you have to learn the rope lingo, which makes sense..... much better than.....<br />  &#34;take the end that is in your left hand, loop it over and around the other one.... now, take the other end of that first one, and put it over and under and then through that tiny hole.... then gently place your right foot on the loose end of the second one....... pull snugly and there you have it..!&#34;<br /><br />The glossary of terms is very informative and helpful !! The books arrived in perfect condition!!  no bends or dings.... nice.<br />I bought 2, one for me and one for a friend's son.... he plays High School Football, and I'm sure he'll make a few things for his groupies....<br /><br />Speedy delivery too !!
B00130UFY2|5.0|I must say, i am fond of his movies. I have watched all his series, and he didn't disappoint me. love it!
076115728X|5.0|Creative, fun and imaginative, this is a great little book for your budding artist, or really any kid.  Unusual book with all the interactive elements.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book is so well written and I liked the historical part of it as well as the basic premise.  It was, however, more of a saga than I like to read.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I've read almost all of his books and at the end of each book, I am reminded of why I keep going back to him as one of my favorite authors. This book is no different; a truly romantic read.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|I've loved Dominique since the 1996 Olympics, so it was great to get a behind the scenes look of her time as a gymnast.  And it was great to hear the story of her sister!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|The songs on this album are wonderful! If you're a fan of &#34;old school&#34; Van Halen, you will love this.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|crude jokes, not that much funny. I didn't find it entertaining as i thought it would. I saw a clip on the daily show that led me to have some interest on it to begin with. I wouldn't advise for conservative households and traditionalist.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This apps works for me.  Lots of settings to choose from and easy to use.  It is not a complicated process for an individually challenged person that I am. Love it as it is part of my everyday life. Thanks.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a nice story that is written from the heart.  I enjoyed reading it and felt like I was on the trail with the main character.  Her  pain and joy were portrayed nicely and she was very relatable.  I recommend it to anyone who likes hiking.
B001DDBCUA|4.0|I had only seen one or two of the series tv shows (when on business trips in hotels), but went to the movie with family who loved the series.  I really enjoyed the movie and didn't feel at all lost or behind the curve for not having seen the tv show.  As to the content itself, it played real for emotions and over the top for showing &#34;fantasies&#34; as 'real' life, so just remember, it is not a biopic, but an escape!  My 73 yr old mother saw it on cable for first time and got caught up in its story.  Just a fun, well done, movie escape that explores life from four different female viewpoints.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I gave this book five stars because I so very much enjoyed reading it.  At the conclusion of &#34;Something Borrowed&#34;, I was disheartened to see it end.  Therefore, I was delighted when it continued in &#34;Something Blue&#34; (the sequel, told from Darcy's point of view as opposed to Rachel's).  Darcy was not a very affable character in &#34;Something Borrowed&#34;, but as &#34;Something Blue&#34; progressed, I found myself warming up as her disposition and qualities gradually changed for the better.  I think Emily Giffin is a great writer; she holds your interest from the first page and leaves you wanting more.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|I purchased the Kindle edition of this book, and I wish I had bought the paper copy. It's a great book, but it's hard to read on the Kindle.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I liked the way Mitch Rapp is moving forward in his own development not just a static set of character parameters.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. It was a quick, easy read that made me wish I would wake up married next to a handsome stranger...but then again, that's why they're stories, right?
B008RNGCAO|4.0|Lengthy but very much worth a read, we all know the climax but still kept me entertained throughout and even the art is captivating. Great work all around.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Will Ferrell - Can they go wrong with him?  My little one can't get enough of this movie. The bits I've watched had me laughing aloud. Another one I'm going to end up buying instead of renting again. One of my kids all time favorites.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to download and play on my new Kindle Fire. Easy to see and it helps to pass the time when I am going some place with my husband, also helps calm my nerves and keeps me from being a passenger drive, LOL
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used this for nearly a year, until Swype came out with its latest version. It's much better at predictive typing than Swype... I've typed entire sentences without actually having to input the words. It just knew what I was going to say. Make sure you use the text message/facebook training feature, so it will learn before you even start.
B00006JL1Z|1.0|There is background noise. Very poor reproduction. The thing doesn't open up easily. It took great effort to open it using media player. The last two tracks on disk 1 have serious recording flaws. It's a piece of s_ _ _.<br />Some of the tracks have skipping.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I think I know a few of them, funny, laugh out loud and I have been to Sweden. They do love thier Snaps and beer.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I've been stalking the lego website daily and it finally paid off. I got a set last week and it was delivered today Dec 18. If you are patient they will get more in stock every week or so. Warning: it's way small. I know my son will be disappointed with the size but at least I wasn't disappointed with the price -- even though it is only worth about $10 at best.
B003SI1W3K|5.0|Funny story that kept my little one occupied while I worked. Now I'm being asked to rent it again, so I would have been better off to purchase it instead of renting.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This my first persona game & I loved it<br /><br />best vita game I have ever played :)<br /><br />just buy it
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Why do you have a Kindle for Android app when I can't download it on either of my Android Products??  What Android can you download this on.  I had a Pandigital Android no go.  It has gotten older so I replaced it a few weeks ago with a new Coby Kyros which I  even purchased on Amazon still no go. So as I said this is useless as far as I am concerned. I have had NO problem downloading a Nook I guess I will just have to ask for Barnes and Noble gift cards instead of Amazon.<br /><br />Now I have found a website call good e reader and found apps there to download I couldn't get here, not only kindle but also nook and yeah Netflix.  Now I have both readers on my Colby tablet.  Mama is a happy camper now!!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|this game is o.k. for faod but if you have to pay for it save your money. Images are small on the kindle fire and  while it does zoom, doing so causes a penalty.  Script is boring. Its like many other hidden object games on the market. I wouldn't recommend this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thus book was great. Can't wait to start the next one. Poor Ana and Christian. It has such a sad storyline.
B001GKJ2DE|5.0|Maybe my best collector, packaging is awesome, goodies are great, really a must have!<br />A great price for a great collector !
B00005AAFS|5.0|Great price on this album! It shipped fast too and the cd didn't come off of the plastic button that holds it in place. This is a must for ant Rammstein fans.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books. I haven't found one yet that I didn't like. I look forward to more.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Easy to watch through the website. Lost a star because I could not watch it on my mobile device. (apple)
B0092QITO2|1.0|I never in a million years would have guessed that I would like the schwartzenfritz version  better.  but wow.  the acting is pooperific, the same dialog, yet no mars?!  Austrailia.  ORLY?! I want my 4 dollars back.  haha...I want my two dollars!
B008B37C8Q|4.0|Being a 'Zappa NUT' I must admit that I LOVE this CD and play it in the car repeatedly<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />There are changes from what I remember from having listened to the original vinyl MANY, MANY times many years ago and I prefer to hear the music as it WAS. (I guess I'll have to dig through my piling system to get the original vinyl and capture it on the computer if I want to hear what I want to hear.)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The storyline is incredibly intricate, with new friends and foes at every turn. I love how nothing is cut-and-dry in the series and you always have to second-guess motivations and words.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead. happy amazon has it available so close to it coming out on amc thanks a lot
B004S5FVJS|4.0|Stone Cold by David Baldacci - I like it. Not as good as Hell's Corner for me. Easy to read.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart puts out another hit, what else is new! Great Christmas album. Thanks again Rod STewart.  Have a great Christmas Baby.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is really weird but also really fun to play and when I play my daughter is like what
630587493X|4.0|At what point in time does man become his own creator.  Interesting movie.  The concept of the movie isn't so far into the future that we, as a society, shouldn't start considering artificial intelegence won't happen.  It will, then how would it be delt with.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! In a world where honor and duty just won't get you very far, you cheer for the morally upright characters in a land on the brink of war. Absolutely fascinating!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|Great game for both young and old. get it if you are in need of mindless fun! It' s perfect for that :)
B004TP0M0K|5.0|Hell,s Corner by David Baldacci - can not put down this book. I love it! Very intrigen and smart book.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Good Christmas, but doesen't campare to Rod Stewart, keep trying Michael. But it will be part or my Christmas music for years to come. I wouldn't buy another one put out by him.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Some levels more difficult than I think they should be.Overall a very fun entertaining game for people of all ages
B000GT7XXW|5.0|It's classic, and performed by classical actors.  Shakespear is hard to follow for the uneducated, but this move plays out the authors mind.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|This thing really makes carrying my big DSLR around very easy. I used it on a few jobs and it worked flawlessly. But the real test for me was when I was able to take it out with my 3 kids. I was able to bring my big camera out with them and it did not get in the way of wrangling my 3 little ones (ages 6,4,and 2) It felt like a natural part of me that I did not have to worry about hitting the kids with, or feel awkward handling it when I was taking it out to take pictures.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector is best Clancy/Jack Ryan novel in awhile.  Better story line and lots of action with further development of Ryan Jr.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|My grandkids enjoy this game and the only reason I keep it is for when they play on my Kindle
B0042AEOG0|5.0|What can I say great Christmas album listen to it over and over again. I just love the upbeat music.
B008YP272M|3.0|Mortality was very interesting to start but sad as you could see the deterioration in the writing as it progressed.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This cd is amazing, they never disappoint me.  I will buy each and every cd they come out with!  Amazon had a great price and had it out before some other sites.
