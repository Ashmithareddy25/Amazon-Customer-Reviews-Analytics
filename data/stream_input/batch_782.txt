B00006EXDM|5.0|Hot Rocks 1964-1971 is an awesome two CD Stones compilation set that has so many of their best hits. This also makes a great introduction to the band, too, just as other people have said. The sound quality is excellent and the artwork is really nicely done.<br /><br />The first CD starts with \\"Time Is On My Side;\\" this classic Stones tune really rocks well and they deliver this with lots of positive energy! The percussion is great; and The Stones sing and play this to perfection! \\"Heart Of Stone\\" has a great beat; and Mick Jagger sings this passionately--with all his heart and soul. He sings of a woman he knows and it all works very well. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" is easily one of their best hits ever--and one of the best rock songs ever written, too. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" explores the frustration a man can feel when he doesn't have a girlfriend; and that's something many guys can relate to. The song rocks well anyway; and I could never tire of hearing The Rolling Stones doing \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\\" Excellent!<br /><br />\\"Get Off Of My Cloud\\" is another classic by the Stones; this song has a great beat and they handle complicated tempo and key changes like the pros they were and still remain! Mick sings great and \\"Get Off Of My Cloud\\" is a major highlight of this two CD set; the lyrics are very creative, too. \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" uses some pretty awesome electric guitar; and listen for The Rolling Stones to do their very best on \\"Paint It Black.\\" \\"Paint It Black\\" has one of the best arrangements The Stones ever wrote and sang; and the music is also very well done. \\"Under My Thumb\\" is yet another classic tune by this incredible band; they ace this easily and I always like to hear this song.<br /><br />The first CD ends strong with The Rolling Stones doing \\"Let's Spend the Night Together.\\" \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" celebrates the happiness of attraction between a man and a woman and that's terrific.<br /><br />The second CD continues the hits. \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" has a pretty cool flavor to it; those electric guitars work well and Mick Jagger sings this very well. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" was always one of my very favorite Stones tunes; \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" keeps the new listener guessing at who the song is about until the song is well along and that draws in the listener really well. There's also the poignant \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" with its sublime female chorus; this song about life makes its point well and that's the strength of this song in addition to the music. \\"Brown Sugar\\" rocks so hard that I love hearing this--even if it's over and over again! \\"Brown Sugar\\" is easily one of their best songs ever and the topic is interesting, to say the least...<br /><br />The second CD ends with \\"Wild Horses;\\" \\"Wild Horses\\" is a passionate love song that always tugs at my heartstrings when I hear it. It moves me a lot and it's a total masterpiece. Good for them!<br /><br />Overall, The Rolling Stones turned out a \\"greatest hits\\" set so strong it DID take on a life of its own. Even all these years later, this album sells quite well and newcomers are always buying it. This two CD set proves that The Rolling Stones were-and are--one of the best rock and roll bands of all time. It will be a long, long time before we see another band this good again.sh\\" has a pretty cool flavor to it; those electric guitars work well and Mick Jagger sings this very well. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" was always one of my very favorite Stones tunes; \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" keeps the new listener guessing at who the song is about until the song is well along and that draws in the listener really well.

0743556003|5.0|Lisey's Story is a worthy addition to Stephen King canon.  It's refreshingly unique very simply because the protagonist is a middle-aged woman, and the story is almost entirely told from Lisey's perspective.  It's a bit odd hearing King narrate in a female voice, but he pulls it off, and it sounds honest and authentic.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot, which I found an interesting amalgam of King's \\"From a Buick 8\\" and \\"Insomnia\\", and Clive Barker's \\"Coldheart Canyon\\".  Like some other reviewers, I found Lisey's and Scott's coded talk a bit overworked at times, but palatable.<br /><br />I listened to Lisey's Story unabridged on CD narrated by Mare Winningham.  Ms. Winningham gives a solid performance, well-suited for Lisey's earnestness and resiliency, and reasonably dynamic giving life to Scott Landon and the supporting characters.

B00140PK6O|5.0|This is one of the lastest and greatest from the BBC. Long overdue.<br />Each character has their own story line which is interwoven with the others in a compelling saga.<br />If you like this, also check out Larkrise to Candleford, another excellent period drama from the BBC.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I've listen to this many, many times since I received it and still enjoy listening to it as if it was the first time!    If you liked listening to the music, while watching the movie, you'll love this CD.
6305428425|5.0|I bought this video after I saw the film on ABC. All I can say is, you will watch it over and over again. It is really funny beyond believe.
B000002MFQ|3.0|For one summer, in 1993, I listened to this album religiously. It's an instrumental album, carrying the sonic motif familiar to anyone who's seen the Exorcist.<br /><br />So, I slipped it back into rotation, to see if it was as good as I remembered.<br /><br />For me, this album didn't ring true to my memories. I had remembered this album as inspiring, but now it seems entertaining, but also somewhat pretentious at times. Ah well...sometimes the memories matter more.
0679437223|5.0|Other people have written much better, and more detailed, reviews of this book, but its true hilarity and power (which I have heard is quite different than the movie, which I've never seen so can't comment on) simply need to be experienced. Some of the imagery is almost divine; much of it is deliciously ironic; and a little brings us back to the horror that was the reailty of World War II.     Just read it.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|No need for the formulaic breakdown (but thank you for that!) because it doesn't matter if Season 4 ran for 300 minutes or 30 minutes - fact of the matter is, when it comes down to the writing, direction, production, acting, etc., LOST is the best out there. I cannot think of another TV series- or even movie- that comes close. Sure Season 3 sort of hit a slump (in my opinion) but it came back pretty strong this season.<br /><br />And regardless of how short this season is, LOST is something you end up rewatching a couple of times anyway, again because of the QUALITY of the show (hence the very reason for purchasing the series in the first place, right?) so who cares how much it costs! Because what's the alternative:  buy some other movie in its place that you will probably end up only watching once or twice anyway, right?  Whereas the LOST series ends up paying for itself because of its replay value!<br /><br />So if this is the price of great entertainment, I'm in!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|This movie will not play on my Pioneer DV-333. I have been in contact with Pioneer who tell me that their engineers are looking into what the problem is, as other owners of Pioneer DVD players have reported the same situation.    It does play on my computer's DVD player.
B0008ISM40|3.0|well, no, it's not really, but it may as well be.<br /><br />here's the thing, in retrospect this is clearly a transitional album.  this is trent reznor playing with a band trying to find his sound, trying to get back on track after the commercial failure of \\"the fragile\\".  he's trying to focus and update his sound, without losing any of his edge.  in many ways he accomplishes this, with modern-sounding production and an attempt at balancing noise with dance beats and catchy hooks.<br /><br />the problem is, he doesn't get there.  he's experiementing with different sounds and ideas trying to find what works, but only a few succeed.  listening to the follow-up \\"year zero\\" you can see where \\"with teeth\\" was heading.  the political ideas, the post-apocalyptic imagery, the more conceptual and less personal songs are the trails he followed to greater success on \\"year zero\\".  here he still has holdover angsty-diary tracks that say the same thing as always in less interesting ways.<br /><br />\\"every day is exactly the same\\" works best, while \\"the hand that feeds\\" worms into you despite being annoying and uninspired.  \\"only\\" rips off \\"down in it\\" without showing any growth.  the rest of the album has its moments, but often it sounds forced, as though trent is trying too consciously to make a nine inch nails album.  despite flashes of brilliance, \\"with teeth\\" sounds like any of the flash-in-the-pan nine inch nails wannabes that came and went in the 90s.  thankfully, trent avoided their fate and crafted a brilliant follow up.  if any nin album can be skipped and forgotten, this is it.
B000002AV5|5.0|While in grad school in Kingston, in the early 1990s, I listened to this album repeatedly. I found the album to still have all its charm...no bad notes anywhere. I moved away from this album, all those years ago, in search of new music, settling into my Collective Soul, Tori Amos, and Sarah McLachlan groove of the later 1990s. So, now the album is back in my rotation, and it's as welcome as before. Particular standout tracks: \\"Your Love is King\\", \\"Smooth Operator\\", \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\", \\"Never as Good as the First Time\\", and \\"No Ordinary Love\\".
0810993139|5.0|My fifth grader loves the Wimpy Kid series and until recently it was hard to get him to read anything but sports books and fact books. I appreciate any book that goes above and beyond to appeal to active boys who wouldn't ordinarily sit down and read independently.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This album is considered by most fans to be their best album so far, and no wonder. It has many great tracks and will make you bang your head, but in the end, you always want more. That's why Rammstein sticks to 11 tracks. All in all, it's a good thing they didn't include any more tracks, it would have changed the flow of the album.
B000002LND|4.0|This is the best and probably only cd I would have of Madonna, well,...Only thing I would change is \\"Crazy for you\\" and \\"Live to tell\\" What I find so painful to listen, she is good for dancing music, but her voice isnt good enough  singer for balads...i would change those two  tracks for True Blue and Oh Father, even her voice still not so good, at least has great lyrics and arrangements.    Other than that I Love anything else and could play and enjoy the whole CD at any time and place.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I'm blown away. I didn't know this would be a numbered limited edition - like so many rip off items these days. My nephew picked my up this Zone 4 PAL item in Australia a few days back. Now in my hot hands!    I'll be honest, Blade Runner is my most favourite film (Followed by Once Upon A Time In The West). I loved the voice over version, couldn't figure the unicorn scene and now am able to enjoy 5 slightly different versions at my leisure. I was disappointed when rumours started in the late 90's/early 2000's that Sir Ridley Scott wanted to tell a more complete story in his own way(The man is a Movie making genius.), but the films owners etc could not agree on the project.    Now it's here and done and is what I call a modern day masterpeice. Whilst containing special effects, it's not ruined by them or overtaken by them like certain other Sci Fi films. The crisp film quality, awesome 5.1 sound, this film has matured into an awesome product. Ridley's final Cut version is indeed satisfying and I am glad they sorted out those loveable errors which we can still see in some of the versions but not in the final.    Thank God Joanna Cassidy agreed to come back and reshoot the Zora dying scene. Thank God the cables on the spinners have gone and that Batty death scene has become night and not daylight.    I just wish Harrison Ford would sort out any issues with Sir Ridley Scott and allow the film stand up proudly as a high quality work it is. It would have been really cool to have had the Core cast and Ridley sitting around a table discussing the merits and opinions of the film and their anidotes.    Whilst some might not be happy or think this edition offers nothing new, for me it does. It looks tidy, sounds tidy and lives up to what I saw way back in 1982. All the extras in the case are really quite cool. I guess a replica of his gun would've been a nice touch or a big poster that I could've had lamenated and on my wall but I am really happy with what I received.     I'dlike to thank Sir Ridley Scott, the Film's entire cast, The film's 2007 restoration team & the various BR fan sites that never gave up hope for making this fan so very happy. And thank you to Phillip K. Dick for creating such an interesting story. Despite the film being slightly different from the book, it was a masterful inspiration. I wonder what might have happened to Deckard & Rachel after they left? Nah, I don't want a sequel.    A quality product to which IMHO delivers! Only 4,400 & I got one! Yippeeeeeee!
0756404746|5.0|I could not put this book down. Rothfuss writes with passion, with vivid imagery, and with a knack for cool details that draws the reader into his amazing world. While he works well within the conventions of fantasy, I can't hold that against him. There might be no real new ground covered here but what Rothfuss does is make it all feel so authentic and comfortable. Its rare for a fantasy writer nowadays to inspire my imagination so completely. He makes me want to write, not that I think I could compete with this great new wordsmith. I eagerly await the next book in this series. If I have one gripe its that I have to wait almost a year for the next book.
B0000E2FLC|4.0|AC/DC always puts one hell of a show and this one was probably one of the most epic. I gave it 4 stars because they didn't include some songs that were included on the Live 2-CD set. Razors Edge would have been awesome to see. Regardless, this DVD is still amazing.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie for two very important reasons.  One, it still had the action-adventure that I loved about the original trilogy of films.  At the same time, it brought the Indiana Jones story into a new era--the 1950's.  I really loved all of the 50's references in this film, from motorcyles to greasers to atomic bombs to flying saucers.  I think the genious of what Lucas and Spielberg have done here is that they have managed to incorporate all of the great elements of a 1950's science fiction film into the Indiana Jones storyline.  Absolutely brilliant!!!!    Now, to be fair, I went with a group of friends to see it, and several of them hated the film because of its sci-fi elements and crazy, seemingly unrealistic stunts, and I've read similar criticism from other reviewers here.  But let me answer those two points of critique with these thoughts.    1) The sci-fi element--yes, I know, a number of people were upset with what pops out of the ground towards the very end of the movie, and the related elements that led up to it.  But the Indiana Jones films have always had something of the fantastic in them.  But this time, instead of mystical objects that melt people's faces or age them to dust, you have more extraterrestrial sense of fantasy.  Personally, I think it better fits the 1950's setting and pop-culture motif of the period.    2) The unrealistic stunts---Um, did those people ever see the original films?  I had this discussion with a friend at work today.  He hated this one scene in the film---I won't describe it for those who haven't seen it, but for those who have--here's a hint---\\"there are three,\\" and \\"AHHHH!!\\"  My answer---Indy, Willie, and Short-round fall out of an airplane with a liferaft and land in the river.  Enough said.  The Indy films have already had wild stunts.  That's half the fun of the movie.    So, I think this film greatly adds to the Indiana Jones story, and I can't wait to go see it again this weekend.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Awesome product and it arrived much faster than I expected, in perfect condition for an exceptional value. Very pleased!
B0017U7PT6|1.0|Gee... Normally, even a boring movie can be looked better in the movie theater because of the bigger screen and sound effects, here is an exception. this movie is just flat-out boring!!!! The story line is predictable, and when the best actor is the animated elephant, you know some seriously wrong with people's acting.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|If you are a hardcore Rammstein fan, this is the package for you. If you're a casual fan, the extremely huge tour-book, the exclusive CD and the second DVD aren't really worth it, to be honest. You probably won't really care about the huge pictures, the second CD has some good tracks on it, but a casual fan won't really miss them and the second DVD is two documentaries, therefore, if you really only like Rammstein a little bit, it might not really interest you.    Rammstein fanatics, however, will probably appreciate this package.
B0015519VS|1.0|I am a big Usher Fan, but this album is a whole new Usher to me.!! at the beginning i didn't like the album. coz honestly, its nothing like his old ones!!!!!!!!! but after listening to it twice, lyrics are beautiful !!!!!! very touching !! i love the album now !! but you should know, its nothing like Usher old albums !! its more grown uo i guess !!
B0015519VS|5.0|\\"Here I Stand\\" threw me at first due to this being the follow up CD to \\"Confessions\\",(thank God he didn't try to make another \\"Confessions\\" which was an excellent CD),                I have been a \\"Usher Fan\\" since his 1st 1994 debut album \\"Usher\\", which was very mature or should I say too mature for Usher at that time which he  had excellent to maturing vocals and was an excellent album, for which I have been longin for him to return to that style 1 more time when he matured, enter \\"Here I am\\" this is what i've been waitin for from him for a while now.         It seems that Usher has taken a step back and decided to sing instead of lettin lite and very little vocals and lyrics and booming music carry him  (I prefer good vocals for sure), (I am a romantic also) this CD does not bore at all, it is \\"THAT CD!!\\" you put on with your loved one or your significant other (Grown Folks Music) and if you let go of the \\"Confessions\\" CD and really listen to \\"Here I Stand\\" all tracks 1 thru 17 takes you \\"THERE\\" for sure, if you don't gettit, you don't gettit, or you're not \\"grown up\\" enoff to gettit.           I applaude Usher for his return to \\"LOVE MUSIC\\" on this one, but let's jam on the next one for sure.
0321525655|5.0|I think that this book show the way to make better presentations, because Reynolds tell about the creation processes: desing (with pencil and paper) and focus her book in practical aspects.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|The 3-disc edition is for any serious AC/DC fan. The extra material on the 3rd disc makes the set feel complete and the reproduction swag is a nice touch too.
B0019O0W90|1.0|This 'exclusive' LP is far from exclusive within it's core.  Usher's vocals pull from his obvious fascination with a certain Neverland Ranch resident.  His productions are well meant,  but this ENTIRE LP falls flat.
B0012BUX0I|5.0|RL...The 0 Star review is very entertaining and through his humor, he makes some great points...    This movie is not for everyone...

B0007Y08QA|5.0|\\"The Machinist\\" is not only an amazing phychological thriller, but it contains one of the best performances I've ever seen. As soon as you see Christian Bale's skeletal body, and how emaciated he became just to play the part, you know there's something special here.     The main character is Trevor Reznik, a machinist who lives a lonely life and suffers from chronic insomnia that's destroying his life (he hasn't slept in over a year). He's lost an incredible amount of weight because of his illness, and he's also developed compulsions (soaking his hands in bleach and scrubbing his bathroom floor with a toothbrush, for example). His insomnia, as well as a series of freakishly odd happenings, quickly leads to paranoia. When an accident happens at the workplace, Trevor is thrown into not only confusion, but guilt, as well, as he tries to work out who is leaving strange sticky notes in his apartment. Without giving out any spoilers (and there are plenty to give), the ending is not what you expect... and it's this ending that make or breaks you as a fan of psychological thrillers. Frankly, you'll either love the twist or feel cheated. I loved it.     If you enjoy phsych movies, then \\"The Machinist\\" simply will not dissapoint you. Period. I feel that this movie is way underrated, especially given Bale's performance. But one thing that is misrepresented is the movie's own description of itself as outright \\"horror.\\" I would never classify it as horror - it's definitely creepy, and it is way \\"out there,\\" but don't let the idea of HORROR turn you off. It's not. The story is just so against the grain that people might not know what to make of it...hence the classification of horror. In my opinion, anyway. Awesome. Go and enjoy some great storytelling.
B00004RYZT|4.0|This is the first live release of Rammstein, and it's a pretty epic outing. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because the DVD is \\"censored\\" by removing one song, Bück Dich, because of controversial elements in the performance. If it bothers you that much and you have a VHS player, get it.
0321525655|5.0|This is an awesome book! Just great.     If you are interested in doing better project presentations, this is an awesome book!    Highly recommend!    Thanks  Bill Dow
B00164KYS2|5.0|The movie was FABULOUS on the big screen, I cant wait to own it on DVD and complete my collection......
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch TV but I do buy TV season series after the DVD hits the stores.  I just happened on this series and only purchased it because of the customer reviews.  I liked it straight out of the gate and loved it by the end of the 1st disk.  I also can't get the Theme song out of my head. When I finished the Last show, I felt bereft there was not another season on the shelf to buy.  So what was the appeal?<br /><br />This show is like our future will, most likely, really be someday.  The crew of Serenity travels the galaxy not unlike Captain Kirk or the crew members of the Star Ship Enterprise but with more realistic and believable exchanges.  No disfigured alien creatures, warp speed or inter-planetary molecular transportation.  No... it's more like getting from California to Boston in a in a 1975 Volvo.  Serenity is an old, but sturdy, (Firefly) cargo vessel manned by a semi-renegade crew.  They must deal with shadey individuals, in order to eke out a living among human civilizations who display varying degrees of social evolution and moral consciousness.  There is a lot of humor but the cast and writers never let you forget the bottom line is survival by what ever means necessary.  The show had the perfect cast, writers, composers and directors. Everyone of the 9 person crew appeals, even the less than stellar character, Jayne (yes it's a boy named Jayne and it suits him perfectly). It got better with every episode.  I would have gone straight to Amazon or BestBuy and bought up every season (after I watched the 1st disk) were there more seasons to buy. I feel kind of like I had one Lays potato chip and some \\"Big Bad Meany\\" tossed out the rest of my (very fresh) new bag.  I could say a lot of ugly things about the person at FOX who holds the scissors but.... I prefer to think it is some big shot's nephew who secrectly works for their competition. (-:  Guess it's back to my books until the next season of Monk Arrives...
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein's debut album starts out with a rumbling, menacing sound and ends with a powerful crash. This perfectly reflects on the nature of Rammstein, a powerful force that builds up and suddenly destroys everything, then leaves a rumbling echo that slowly dissipates. If you've never heard Rammstein, this is obviously the place to start.
0452289963|5.0|This book defines and offers help to alleviate so much dysfunction in American society.

0385338724|5.0|This is my first book by this author.  I really enjoyed her writing style.  She was very funny, and you fell in love with the characters!  Great story that held my interest right until the end.  I would love to see another book with the character Lexi in it.
0679746323|1.0|This is a horrible book. I am surprised that the author has a doctorate degree yet her logic is totally problematic and her sources are questionable.    Firstly, as some reviewers have pointed out, the logic of the book is absurd: I want to prove Mao is evil --> I will collect facts to prove it, whether or not they are supportive. A lot of times the author is forcing some facts to prove her negative opinion about Mao although they don't prove anything.     Secondly many of her facts are unfounded as well --- you don't know exactly what the sources are and can't verify them. I myself have a doctorate degree --- you have to footnote your sources so that peers can verify them. Rather than a biography based on rigorous research, the book  is filled with bias, guess, misleading and fabrication, which are already proved by other scholars.    The author was a \\"red guard\\" herself and had the privilege of studying abroad as one of the first group of students sponsored by the Chinese government when the cultural revolution ended. I am puzzled what had turned her into the other extreme --- she hates Mao so much that she even loses the ability of unbiased independent thinking, a critical attribute of scholars. In summary I can't agree more with a statement made by another review --- this book \\"uses propaganda to fight propaganda\\".
0375836675|5.0|I love this book. It is easy to read. The plot is great. I hardly put it down. And the message i get from this book is \\"You could change the world being an ordinary guy!\\"
0618871713|5.0|I live an hour away from Beech Creek, Alison Bechdel's tiny hometown and the setting for much of her graphic memoir Fun Home.  I've always found the area oppressive:  dark, looming mountains casting perpetual shadows on impoverished, dying valley towns.  But after reading Fun Home, I revisited Beech Creek, to see Bechdel's childhood home and the grave of her father Bruce, and to remind myself of how cruelly ironic life can be.<br /><br />Bruce Bechdel, a man who loves literature (in his early days he identified with F. Scott Fitzgerald; in his final days he reads Proust), an aesthete with a taste for the baroque detail of the Victorian era, and a creative and versatile designer of interior and exterior landscapes, is born and lives in rural central Pennsylvania, running the family funeral home and teaching at the local high school.  He never quite fits in.  Always sun-tanned and exquisitely dressed (no plaid hunter's shirts or chewing tobacco for him), persnickety and a bit prissy, but at the same time speaking with a back-country twang, Bruce seems uncannily out of place in Beech Creek.<br /><br />And he's a closeted gay man, who has occasional affairs on the side and otherwise sublimates his repressed sexuality by obsessively restoring the Victorian-era house in which Alison grew up.  The tension of his closeted life makes him aloof, prone to violent temper tantrums, controlling, and sometimes cruel to both wife and children.<br /><br />Alison's Bechdel's memoir of him, and the way in which her own identity both became the inverse of his and yet in many respects parallels his, is a sophisticated narrative that underscores just how complex personal identity is.  Alison is who she is, just as her father was who he was, because of the convergence of Beech Creek, sexuality, alienation, fun, repression, the need to be creative, the yearning for affection, the factuality of history and the re-creation of memory.  There's no formulaic happy ending here, no artificial structuring to make more sense of the relationship between herself and her father than there really was.  Instead, what the reader is offered is a profound, sensitive, bittersweet effort to explore memory in search of identity--an effort which throughout is punctuated by Bechdel's references to both Proust and James Joyce--and an appreciation for the ironies of fate which make us who we become.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned that they read the memoir at one setting.  I found it so intense that I could only take it in small portions, and even then I sometimes felt overwhelmed.  For in sharing her own identity-forming memories with us, she invites us to plumb more deeply into our own.  And both exercises, although potentially liberating, can also be harrowing.sense of the relationship between herself and her father than there really was.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS!!!! JUST GOT MY SET FROM AMAZON AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN I STARTED TO TEST OUT THE DISCS BY SEASON 3 EPISODES WERE NOT PLAYING. THIS SET IS DEFECTED AND PLAYS ON MY COMPUTER AS THE SUPPOSED NEW SET. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN RE-PACKAGE THE SAME 2005 SET AND CLAIM IT TO BE NEW. I WANT A REFUND FROM AMAZON. I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THE EXCHANGE GAME, HBO NEEDS TO DO A RECALL.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is one series I will not miss. I haven't seen a series that can hold my attention like this in a long time. It is worth every minute of it's viewing time.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I got this as soon as it came out. Another great album from the guys in NJ. It certainly has a much more country sound than any of their earlier work, but that's not a bad thing. A slightly different flavor, but still distinctly Bon Jovi. Didn't like it quite as much as Have a Nice Day, but it's still a great album.
B0013V33DG|5.0|For those of you that saw this production with the Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD, this is the same show. Natalie Dessay's impecable comedic timing and sparkling coloratura, Juan Diego Florez's brilliant high C's, and Laurent Pelly's genius staging all make this the best version of this opera available on DVD (only the Sutherland/Pavarotti version surpasses on CD).     However, this taping does not match the performance given at the Met on April 26, 2008. Dessay was not in as good of condition (I assume) at Coven Garden, and thus a great deal of her vocal ornamentation heard at the Met is not present on this DVD. Nonetheless, she remains a wonderful singing actress, even if the vocal embelishments aren't quite what they were in New York.    It also seems that this production had a chance to iron out some minor flaws after touring in London and Vienna. If you did not see the production in New York, this will not affect you. I just felt the production was funnier, the singer's were more relaxed in their roles, and things just seemed to run smoother overall at the Met.     My last little complaint was that the lighting seems to be dimmer at Covent Garden. I don't know what it is, but a few scenes seemed lost in the shadows.    Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful DVD that shouldn't be missed. My complaints are small. While the Met's production earned 5/5 stars, this one might earn 4.9/5. I highly recommend this DVD.
B000002GXX|5.0|I bought this just to get the full length Journey of the Sorcerer, but ended up liking the whole album. I approve, though Lebowski does not.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|I had been eagerly anticipating this release, and was severly disappointed.  For those of you fans of their \\"dummy\\" album, be forewarned, this album is nothing like it.  Its bland, boring, and uninspired.  I kept resisting the urge to skip to the next song, in hopes of finding something that really spoke to me, but nothing.  Then I listened to it again the next day, hoping that maybe I just hadn't been in the right state of mind the first time.  But still, on 2nd listen, I didn't like it.  Back to listening to the old stuff!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This one was an instant classic when it first came to theaters in the late 80s. See Chevy Chase at the top of his game. If you've heard of Christmas, you will love this movie.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is a very addicting show. I hadn't watched it on ShowTime and so when I bought it my plan was to watch one episode a week. I eneded up finishing the WHOLE DVD in 2 days :)  Very well costumed and the actors do a great job. Nice to see some minor actors getting good roles.

B00007JS31|5.0|\\"Bat out of Hell\\" is the 1977 classic album from Meat Loaf which features songs by Jim Steinman.  The release I am reviewing is remastered, includes three extra tracks (though admittedly one is just an introduction), and includes a DVD with 12 Videos.  The original album was produced by Todd Rundgren.  The band assembled for this album is an interesting group.  Included are Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan from the E Street Band, Edgar Winter, and Ellen Foley, and Todd Rundgren also played and had three additional members of Utopia play on it as well: Kasim Sultan, Roger Powell, and Willie Wilcox.  The album developed from a musical which has been described as a sci-fi version of Peter Pan, and parts of it have been compared to Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" album, but it really doesn't have the same kind of sound to my ear.<br /><br />The original album is just seven tracks long, opening with the title track which sets the tone for the whole album.  It, along with two other tracks are what is left from the musical which was titled \\"Neverland\\".  Like most of the songs here it is about teen love, or perhaps I should say lust, as love is really not a factor in most of these songs.  The second track is \\"You Took the Words Right Out Of My Mouth\\" and was first single from the album, as with the first track it is about lust and the confusion between lust and love in young people.  That is followed by \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" which is the second of the three songs from the musical, and the lyrics are a bit more positive, though one still gets that feeling of teen angst.  \\"All Revved Up with No Place to Go\\" is the last of the three tracks from the musical, and the title pretty much speaks for itself as it follows in the same mode as those which came before.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with \\"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\\" in which the singer wants and needs the person they are singing to, but they don't love them.  A bit more mature in content than the teen songs in the first half, here lust is not confused for love.  \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" follows up with the story of a relationship built on young lust which turns into a miserable life for both the boy and girl.  The original album then closes with \\"For Crying Out Loud\\".  The three bonus tracks include \\"Great Boleros of Fire\\" and \\"Bat out of Hell\\" live versions, in which the first is an instrumental intro to the second.  The third track is \\"Dead Ringer for Love\\" which appeared on the 1981 album of the same name and for which Cher provides the lead female vocals.<br /><br />The DVD includes several songs from the album as well as additional material.  Like the album, it opens with \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", which is followed by \\"Read `em and Weep\\" from the \\"Dead Ringer\\" album.  Next up is \\"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\\" and that is followed by Razor's Edge from the \\"Midnight At The Lost and Found\\" album.  Up next are \\"More Than You Deserve\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Love Her for Both of Us\\" from the \\"Dead Ringer\\" album.  Next is \\"If You Really Want To\\" from the \\"Midnight At The Lost and Found\\" album, and then come \\"You Took The Words Right Out of My Mouth\\", \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\", and \\"Dead Ringer for Love\\".<br /><br />The DVD also includes a biography and discography (both written) and the music can be played in surround sound or stereo.  The videos are fun, but the core album is the best part of this package.  I have to give this collection 5 stars, as the original album rates very highly and the additional material in this collection adds to the overall value.  Price is a consideration though, so look for one which isn't too expensive.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|This Indiana Jones movie has some long, wild car chases, incredible switches from vehicle to vehicle, some very funny gags by Harrison Ford, a reunion with an old impregnated flame, nostalgic views of old cars, and a mild feeling that the film could have been better.<br /> Ford is trapped in quicksand about to go under; his only escape is to grab hold of a thick black snake and be pulled out. His savior yells, \\"Grab the snake.\\" Ford, panicky at the sight of the fearful reptile, cries out, \\"Don't call it a snake. Call it a rope.\\" When he and his entourage is about to go over an enormous waterfall, he hears the group's madman (John Hurt) say, \\"Three.\\" Ford says, \\"Three what?\\" and then he realizes that they are going to go over three horrific waterfalls, each one worse than the preceding one.<br /> Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flick. It can be a lot of fun because of the tongue in cheek style. Ford is good in the part; he's had enough practice to perfect the role. There's lots of hokey stuff, but it's still better than a lot of the other dross around.

1433203316|5.0|I loved this book.  Probably a little better than the movie.  And I loved the movie.  However both are one in the same.  I wish they would have made the movie to match the book. But that's another review.<br /><br />Do NOT buy the cd version of this book.  I borrowed it from the library and had major skipping issues.  I thought I'd buy the book because the first disc kept my interest.  I had skipping issues with all 5 discs.  I returned the first audio book and had more skipping issues with the next audio book.  Luckily, if any of you have one of those things called a  cassette player, circa 1963.  Blackstone audio has a cassette version available and you are surely not to have any skipping issues.<br /><br />Robertson Dean reads this book with so much intensity that I find myself listening to the book over and over again.  Pretty soon I'll be able to recite it.
B00005JPLW|1.0|If the new Star Wars didn't make you puke with over use of CGI then this one will. A story of a king who leads his troops to defend the country against Persian monsters and freaks.    It was like watching Mortal Kombat meets Army Of Darkness, but instead of being entertaining in some way, it makes you sick to the stomach to have to watch CGI slow motion limbs flying around and creatures and mutants being fought off 1 by 1.     It seemed like a video game more then a war.     The whole battle takes place in the same area, and the Persian \\"God\\" only sends in a certain army type at a time. It's like a video game with new bad guys for each level they ascend to, level 1, roman soldiers, level 2, ninjas, level 3 a rhino, level 4, 2 big elephants.    The sub story of some guy screwing the queen and attempting to make the Spartans look like she was a hoar (damn amazons word filters)... what was that all about? He gets killed in the blink of an eye. Huh?????? What was the point of filming that?    If your into long drawn out, overly done repulsive unrealistic CGI work, characters you have no feel for, and a video game like atmosphere where they kill the bad guys, have a sleep, kill some more, have nap, kill some more, limb here, slow mo running there... then this movie is for you.    I can't beleive 500 people give this a 5 star rating. That can not possibly be right, it has to be people involved in the movie making accounts and praising there own movie, it must have been why the movie was so many years in the making, they where raising enough money to hire 100's of people to use the internet to give itself great reviews... cause i can not for the life of me see what any normal person would see in this over rated, over promoted, over hyped piece of crap.

Watched many times and can't get enough of it. The sound track also is something to play whenever you want to chill or creat a special momnet. Sorry for those who didn't like it, just don't know what you are missing. I bought this DVD and cd of the sound track because I want to watch it with my kinds when they are older.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|This is a great third album by TOAD.  I like every song on this album.  The lyrics to So Happy and Hate my Life are excellent.  There is not a bad song on this entire album.    They put on a great live show as well.    Buy this album!!!!!!
B0013J30XG|5.0|From a brilliant screenplay that distills the best of what the animated series truly is, to its non-linear editing, jumping the story forwards and backwards like the Mach 5 on its powerful jacks, the Wachkoski Bros.' SPEED RACER is the best film of the year thus far, and a perfect example of how artistic, brilliant and smart summer films once were.    The Bros. create a \\"Speed Racer\\" reality for the film that is beyond description.  It's one-part our world, one-part Speedy's universe.  Colors glow brighter than on Christmas day, all portions of the frame are in focus - from the character talking to camera, to the character behind him, to the wonderfully detailed scenes capes behind them both.  What you get are shots and scenes from SPEED RACER that are composed, painted and presented with the same creative level of color, artistry and movement as those found in the top Japanese Anime films AKIRA, GHOST IN THE MACHINE, METROPOLIS and SPIRITED AWAY.  For an American audience unindoctrinated in the world of Anime, this brilliant look, choice and feel is simply lost.  To put this in perspective, it's like casting pearls before swine.  The Bros. also breath life into the stylized SPEED RACER animated series action sequences, combining flat elements such as simple action moves with animated \\"movement\\" cells and heightened reaction shots to give us fight sequences that move, pop and produce a mile-long smile on everyone's face.    Ultimately, this is what holds SPEED RACER back from out grossing simple, less intelligent films such as INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.   SPEED RACER is too smart and too sophisticated for the average audience member.  It runs too fast for America Joe Blow moviegoer to keep up.  For those looking for an intelligent and emotionally involving family summer adventure, hit the track with SPEED.  You'll find yourself racing to keep up, roaring through the turns and thundering into victory lane with a huge grin on your face and thedesire to immediately pluck down another $8.50 and see the flick again.  If you can, do SPEED RACER: THE I-MAX EXPERIENCE.  The best \\"trip\\" you've had in the movies without drugs since Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.     Go Speed Racer, Go!
B000ICM5VW|5.0|well, I just got this HD version movie for my collection.I love it, and the HD version is even better than the regular DVDs. The picture quality is awesome.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Donnas' back! Although, with her string of dance hits, over the past several years, it's as if she was never gone. With Crayon's, her first studio CD in 17 years, her voice is as great as ever and she blazes up this CD like the pro that she is.<br /><br />The CD opens with her first single: \\"Stamp\\" which is a very anathematic song that will have you doing just that; stamping your feet! With a heavy/strong beat and a great melody, it is one of the many standouts on this CD. \\"Mr. Music\\" sounds like it is ready to be in the next commercial for iTunes; talking about her love for music and how she can't get enough of it. \\"Crayons\\" have a very subtle reggae sound to it (think early Rihanna) and is very hooky and fun. It is bound to be a hit. Very radio friendly. \\"The Queen Is Back\\" is just that - showing that she can get down with the modern hip hop sound with the best producers and still command the song without it being over produced. Very catchy. \\"Fame (The Game)\\" is a very different song for Donna. It has a dance/rock vibe to it and she sings/raps the verses and it makes it work very well. \\"I'm A Fire\\" is a very vintage sounding Donna song with a dance/disco sound that meshes with today's sound perfectly. A gem! Already a HUGE hit on the club charts. \\"Science OF Love\\" is another very modern down sound but Donna pulls it off to perfection. \\"Be Myself Again\\" is a beautiful ballad that shows that Donna still has those huge powerful pipes and can sing with the best of them. Love it!<br /><br />The songs that I did not mention are songs that I just cannot get into. I don't hate them but, they just sound a bit out of sorts with the rest of the music on this CD. I would have loved to go 5 stars on this but, with those few songs that I tend to skip over, I just couldn't.<br /><br />This CD is a must have for fans: past and present. I just hope she does not wait another 17 years for another great CD like `Crayons' because how we `love to love you', Donna!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|Has anyone else noticed that the screen ratio for season 4 is listed as 1:33, rather than widescreen 16:9 as the previous season releases have been? Is this a mistake? Sure hope so...
B00005JPLW|5.0|No, I don't have a spectacular quote from the movie \\"300\\" in my review. There were plenty of them, that's for sure. Somewhere between Gerald Butler sputtering inspirational lines and endless bloody battles, Zack Snyder's adaption of Frank Miller's graphic novel happened to cross the line and not only beat \\"Troy\\" for the spot as the best epic war movie, but also beat \\"The Matrix\\" movies and take the gold as the best action movie ever made. While the action sequences seem original with their bloody slow motion swordplay and a red sky, they are actually expansions on what we saw in \\"The Matrix\\" films. For example, in the beginning action sequence of the original \\"Matrix\\", Carrie-Ann Moss' character was in mid-air just still for a few seconds. While none of that is in \\"300\\", you easily get the sense that \\"The Matrix\\" gave a lot of inspiration for this film. Yet in  a way the battle sequences seem so original, maybe because we've not seen stuff like this in recent epic movies like \\"Troy\\", \\"Gladiator\\", or \\"King Athur\\". In the end, it doesn't matter how unrealistic or how out-of-this-world the film was. In the end, the world saw a complete masterpiece from Zack Snyder, who directed the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake. As an added bonus to the spectacular motion picture, Warner Bros. has included a wonderful two-disc special edition. On the first disc, Snyder has a sole yet very informative commentary. On disc two, there are many great making-of features including webisodes. The only thing left out of this are the two very great trailers for \\"300\\". This is a definate purchase for any action fan or any fan of the Wackoski Brothers (I think that's how you spell).
B000MCIBAW|5.0|This album is simply the best Doors LP!  No doubt.  The entire mood of the album is well...Strange!  A complete concept album with some of the strongest writing I have ever heard/read!!<br /><br />From the title cut right on thru to the end...there isn't a single flaw.  This was the Doors at their best and Jim's writing was POWERFUL.<br />Get it and you won't be disappointed...why can't they make music like this anymore.<br /><br />RIP...Jim.

1416550518|5.0|'The House at Riverton' was such a delight to read I re-read it once I'd finished to explore the relationship between the two Hartford sisters more deeply, especially once I knew their secret concerning the tragic 'suicide' of a young poet. This is a tale of lost loves and twists of fate, but the story also provides us with a wonderful flavor of interesting history from an innovative era; a time when women were starting to explore more independence. Grace was once a young lady's maid to Hannah Hartford and kept her secrets, even before she realized there was a deeper bond between them. When Hannah falsely believes Grace can read shorthand, this simple mistake has deadly consequences. Grace's guilt follows her into her Golden years until she's able to release it by disclosing all the secrets on tape for her beloved grandson at a time when he's struggling with his own guilt and grief. The characters are written with great emotional depth and the reader mourns their missed opportunities.  We hold our breath as tragic events cause relationships and lives to crumble. I look forward to reading other novels by this talented author.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

The 1080p resolution made it seem like I was watching it for the first time all over again! There were myriad little details that I had never seen before, graffiti on the walls and so forth, that makes me very glad to have upgraded my 27\\" Standard Definition TV to a 50\\" 1080p DLP TV. Hi-Def ROCKS! I'm a fan of the original cut with Mr. Ford's voice-over narration and I've had several copies on VHS but never in widescreen. Now, to have all the versions available in one set is a dream come true. Don't even get me started on how good the audio is! I have to upgrade to a home theater receiver that supports Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio now or I'll never be happy! Do yourself a favor and purchase this set for your Blu-ray collection - no matter which version you prefer.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, \\"Iron Man\\" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress. \\"Iron Man\\".<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau (\\"Elf\\", \\"Zathura\\" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario,sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.<br /><br />As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.<br /><br />When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.<br /><br />Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references.

His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.    Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|I am very excited to watch this movie. Because it is very fun to watch on tv. I would like to buy this movie without Blu-ray. I just want one disc of the dvd with full screen edition on it also.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Every summer, there are a number of films so highly anticipated that when they don't meet those expectations, even slightly, people badmouth the end result, angry they wasted their time and money. The film could be 'good', but because it isn't 'great', many people aren't happy. If the expectations weren't so high, the film would receive better word of mouth.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is such an example. Not a perfect film, or a great film, it is, nonetheless, a fun ride and provides a lot of enjoyment. But because this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made, expectations were high. Too high. No one, not even the combined talents of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford could meet these expectations.<br /><br />It is difficult enough to create a magical film. With all of the people involved in any film production, everyone has to be at the top of their game to create a movie experience to be remembered for the ages. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" did that. Sorry, George, I refuse to call it \\"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" as you have relabeled it. Quit screwing with the magical films you have created in the past. Stop renaming things and stop adding digital enhancements to your classic films. Stop. But it is almost impossible to capture magic a second time, let alone a third or fourth (depending on how you view the various sequels.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Skull\\" has some fun chase and action sequences; an interesting villain, a nice new sidekick and it is great to see Harrison Ford play the role again. It feels like putting on a pair of old slippers. Very comfortable.<br /><br />But those slippers have some holes. That and some technical problems make the experience of watching this film less than stellar.<br /><br />1957. Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick, Mac (Ray Winstone, \\"Fool's Gold\\", \\"Sexy Beast\\", \\"Beowulf\\") have been kidnapped by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and her Russian troops. Spalko has been combing the Earth for artifacts rumored to help people control other people's thoughts and minds. That is her goal. Mind control. Spalko is after a crate she knows Dr. Jones saw about 10 years earlier in New Mexico, so she takes him hostage and brings him to a military warehouse at Area 51 in the Nevada desert. He is incredulous, but has no choice but to help her, due to the sheer number of guns pointed at him. Later, the FBI becomes suspicious of his role in this operation and ransacks his college office, causing the University to fire him. As he is about to head to New York, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf in full \\"The Wild One\\" regalia) shows up on his Harley and asks Dr. Jones for his help. His mother, Marion, was taken prisoner by some people in South America after their family friend, Professor Oxley (John Hurt) went crazy trying to find the location of the City of Gold and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cryptic letter leads Jones to help and he and Mutt are soon off to Peru to help find Marion and Ox. There, they run into Irina again, who has Marion and Ox in her custody. Jones is soon happy to learn that Marion is Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Mutt is their son. Will they be able to get past all of these complications to find the fabled City of Gold and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?<br /><br />The \\"Indiana Jones\\" films are Spielberg and Lucas' tribute and homage to the Saturday afternoon serials they used to watch in theaters when they were kids. The same sort of matinees made with zero budgets and zombies, monsters from mars, ghosts, Flash Gordon and other fantastical heroes and villains. When you start applying logic to a film based on such subject matter, you might go as crazy as John Hurt's character in the newest installment. So, when there are definite holes in the script, you have to decide if you want to go along for the ride, or start dissecting the film and pointing out all of the various problems. For the most part, I chose to take the ride and had a lot of fun. There is an event that happens near the beginning of the film, which proves to have no consequence to the rest of the story. This was more problematic for me than anything else, but I'm willing to overlook even that. \\"Indiana Jones\\" is all about the thrill ride and \\"Crystal Skull\\" provides a number of sequences with this type of endorphin thrill.<br /><br />Harrison Ford returns as Dr. Jones, the intrepid archaeologist who works part time as a college professor and finds himself embroiled in some outlandish plots. In \\"Crystal Skull\\", Lucas, Spielberg and David Koepp (who wrote the screenplay based on Lucas' story) have taken a real thing and formed a story around it. This follows the modus operandi of the other installments. In \\"Crystal Skull\\", they use the discovery of such an item as the springboard to create a whole history and mythology for the characters to discover over the course of the film. Some people may find this creation interesting and fun. Others will (and are) discounting it immediately, for face value. But these same critics should remember back to the original material these films are based on in the first place. Flash Gordon. Monsters from Mars. The like.<br /><br />The key to \\"Indiana Jones\\" is the elaborate action, special effects and production values applied to these same fantastical ideas. In \\"Crystal Skull\\", there is a lot of effort to make everything seem very normal and real. But in a number of instances, I noticed a stunt double sitting in for Ford and other actors and there seemed to be a couple of instances of noticeable green screen use. These are not acceptable. One of the best things about these films is that \\"Ford always does most of his own stunts\\". When they use a stunt double during a relatively tame motorcycle chase, it just spoils the illusion. And you can always tell when they are using a stunt double; the hair is always slightly off and the scene is shot from behind and far away. Or the character has their face turned away from the camera. These moments, and the plot hole I mentioned earlier do a lot of damage, but they don't ruin the film.<br /><br />In the earlier films, Spielberg and his cinematographer, Douglas Slocombe worked very hard to give the films the look of an old film from the 30s or 40s, to match the era in which they were set. This gives the films a rich, lush look. In \\"Crystal Skull\\", Spielberg works with Janusz Kaminski and the look is very different. Everything seems to be infused with light, bright white light seeping from the edges. I think this was done for a couple of reasons. The film is set in 1957, and the beginning of the story takes place in the Nevada desert. But it also seems like this might have been done to help disguise the true age of some of the characters. It almost seemed like gauze or Vaseline had been used on the lens a few times. This infusion of light might be designed to help cover this up and make everything seem a little washed out, a little blurry. What better way to hide the signs of aging?<br /><br />Harrison Ford is back in a role so tailor made for him, so comfortable, you can't do anything but welcome him back. He is clearly having a lot of fun, even if the role seems to be a bit of a strain for him at this age, that he becomes instantly watch able again. Watching him portray Jones again almost helps to erase some of the abysmal performances he has done in the years since his last outing as Dr. Jones. Almost. I'm afraid \\"Hollywood Homicide\\" is just too bad to forget. That and \\"Random Hearts\\". But for the few truly terrible performances he has done in the last 19 years, he has also created a number of memorable roles, like Dr. Richard Kimball in \\"The Fugitive\\", like Jack Ryan in \\"Patriot Games\\" and \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", like President James Marshall in \\"Air Force One\\". When Ford is on his game, there is no one better. Ford's return as Indiana Jones is welcome, but a bit of a strain to watch. He is clearly 19years older to match the 19 years since \\"Last Crusade\\", and isn't as nimble as he once was, but the fedora and leather jacket still fit like a glove.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is memorable as Irina Spalko, \\"Stalin's fair haired girl\\". She takes people prisoner left and right and seems to have no problem taking over a military base on U.S. soil. Nothing will stand in her way because she is so intent on her goal. She is a brazen woman, perhaps more so because she seems to have the unconditional support of her boss, Stalin, the leader of her country and a very powerful figure in the Cold War. She is a cultured woman and addresses Dr. Jones in a cultured voice, like most movie villains of yesteryear. She can also wield a mean sword and uses this weapon to fight off an attack by Mutt.<br /><br />Speaking of Mutt, Shia LaBeouf is very good as Mutt. For a while, I have heard reports about rumors swirling on the Internet, about two aspects of this film. Unfortunately, these seem to be the worst kept secrets in movie history because both are essentially true. Mutt is Marion's son, but when he initially shows up to meet Dr. Jones, he doesn't know they are related any more than Dr. Jones does. Mutt is all sneer and attitude and LaBeouf seems to be channeling the spirit of James Dean or Marlon Brando. Mutt rides a motorcycle, wears a leather jacket and slicks back his hair with a comb dipped in soda pop. When Indiana says something Mutt mistakes as an insult, he grabs his switchblade in a threatening manner, threatening no one but himself. As the story progresses, they each eventually learn the truth. When it doesn't immediately register with Indiana, Marion tells him \\"It's not that hard, Indy.\\"<br /><br />And Spielberg clearly enjoys the work of the new, younger sidekick, so much so, he lets his inner child get the better of him a few times. Initially, there are a couple of ideas used in the story that seem fun, at first, but they are so overused they quickly become tedious. There are three or four such instances.<br /><br />Karen Allen returns to play Marion Ravenwood, Indy's true love and it is nice to see her participating in the adventure. Ray Winstone plays Mac, Indy's partner in adventure and his role is meant to provide some complications, but it isn't deep enough to make a lasting impression. John Hurt plays Professor Oxley and he spends most of the film in a delusional state, spouting crazy information only Indiana seems to understand. Jim Broadbent has a small role as the Dean of the College where Indiana works.<br /><br />When we finally get a clue as to the meaning behind the Crystal Skull (and as soon as you see it, you'll know what it is supposed to be), the rest of the story falls into place and the big finale makes sense. As much sense as anything in this type of story could. This involves the second Internet theory leaked a while ago. Again, one of the worst kept secrets in movie history. When we first see the Crystal Skull, which is quite early in the film, you have to be prepared to go along for the ride. If you aren't, nothing they do will make the film work for you. If you can suspend belief and take the ride along with the characters, you'll have fun.<br /><br />Where will \\"Indiana Jones 4\\" fall in film history? That is up to you... and you... and you to determine. For me, it is all but impossible to make a film to rival the original \\"Raider of the Lost Ark\\". The third installment \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\", featuring Sean Connery as Indiana's dad and River Phoenix in a prologue as a young Indiana Jones, came close. Very close. The second installment, \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is widely acknowledged as the low point of the series. So, I would rank this fourth installment better than \\"Temple of Doom\\", but not as good as \\"Last Crusade\\".lot hole I mentioned earlier do a lot of damage, but they don't ruin the film.

B0015LBIZO|4.0|There are plenty of reviews about the music on this disc, so I'm not going to go there. Overall, this box is a great collector's item and a tresure trove for the Portishead fan. It's worth the outlay, just for the excellent quality of the pressing, on heavyweight, pristine vinyl.    BUT...if you're like me and enjoy the sound of vinyl but also require the convenience of a digital copy, be aware that the data files (on a nifty 1 GB P shaped rubber memory stick) are copy protected, meaning you can't even EDIT THE INFORMATIONAL DATA on the files if you import them into iTunes or any other digital library. You can't make a CD and import them back as non-protected files, either. THIS SUCKS....FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE SPENDING! Just so you know.    The rest of the goodies are nice....the etched 12\\" of Machine Gun, the films, and the art print suitable for framing. But come on...this copy protection crap is out of control. Newsflash....there are always ways to get around this stuff, record companies, you greedy, failing morons. Yeah, I can always rip the vinyl copies back into my PC, but at this cost, I shouldn't have to. Maybe I should just steal it next time.
B0013J30XG|3.0|Speed (Emile Hirsch, \\"Into the Wild\\", \\"Alpha Dog\\") eagerly anticipates racing his Mach 5, a car designed and built with the help of his dad (John Goodman) in the Crucible, one of the premiere events in the World Racing League circuit. As he waits in the locker room, mentally preparing himself for the upcoming race, he remembers back to a similar moment when his older brother, Rex (Scott Porter) once faced the same challenges...<br /><br />Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, the duo behind \\"The Matrix\\", one of the most visionary films ever made, \\"Speed Racer\\" isn't as bad as the third installment of \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy, but it has problems. I was hoping the brothers had worked the kinks out of their system, the same kinks that helped to create \\"Revolutions\\", the third installment and one of the most disappointing sequels ever. They've worked out some, but not all of them.<br /><br /> ...But Rex and his father had a falling out and Rex ended up having a bad accident during a race, causing his death. As Speed takes to the twisty, curvy track, resembling something out of a Matchbox set only a sadist could create...<br /><br />The Wachowski Brothers are very visual filmmakers, interested in, possibly obsessing over all details of the looks of their films. This may seem like a `well, duh\\" statement, but the brothers have created many completely unique worlds for their films, making them seem believable, viable, possible. Of course, they become a filmmaking powerhouse after \\"The Matrix\\", spending this cache to make two sequels to that film. Yes, I actually liked the second installment, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\", but even I have my limits. These limits were surpassed by \\"Revolutions\\". As the producers of \\"V for Vendetta\\", they helped to stamp their signature on this project as well, creating a future look at a very Orwellian London. Now, with \\"Speed Racer\\", they turn their unique eye on an animated series they grew-up with. \\"Racer\\" really does blow your mind with new and interesting visuals; there are so many interesting ideas at work in the film, it would take me hours to go through them all, so I'll just highlight a few. The brothers use a `deep focus' technique giving this film the look of animation. Generally, if a camera is focusing on one subject, people and objects in the background, further behind the subject in question, are blurry, allowing us to focus on the character in the foreground. If the attention shifts, the focus changes. In \\"Racer\\", both subjects are always in focus and this gives the film a flatter appearance. Normally, this flatter appearance would be problematic, but it is intentional and the color palette of the film is filled with neon colors and brightness, making these same images pop off the screen. It's a unique, somewhat strange effect. Because the images are a little flatter, and at the same time, they aren't, they almost appear slightly 3-D.<br /><br />...Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Speed's gal-pal, Trixie (Christina Ricci) sit in the crowded stands, ready to cheer Speed on...<br /><br />I know the Wachowski Brothers grew up with the original animated series and are trying to pay homage with this film. But they are, perhaps, paying too much homage and not trying to fix the things they should. Many of the actors portray their characters in a very, very broad way and this only makes them seem more like cartoons, less real and makes it more difficult to believe in the rest of the world the brothers spent so much time and effort to create. Paulie Litt who plays Spritle, Speed's younger brother is particularly broad and cartoony and it doesn't help that he has Chim Chim, a monkey at his side, throughout the entire film. There are a few nice visual puns involving Spritle and Chim Chim, but these characters place a strain on an already incredulous story. There are also a series of villains who growl and snarl at the camera as though someone is shouting out single word descriptions of their emotions, causing them to react. Hirsch, Sarandon, Goodman and Ricci do a better job with the material.<br /><br />...Speed takes to the track and it quickly becomes evident the other racers are determined to do whatever they have to do to keep Speed from winning. This is like no race you have ever seen before; more like a wire cage match combined with NASCAR, the drivers have implements added to their cars to help them fend off attackers who have added dangerous implements to their cars, implements designed to do some nasty stuff...<br /><br />And this film is like no film you have ever seen before. In addition to the crazy, interesting color palette and the crazy designs of the racetracks and cityscapes, they Wachowski Brothers use two interesting techniques throughout the film. Rather than use a normal dissolve or other typical transition to move from one scene to the next, they frequently use one or more characters, wiping them across the screen as the scene changes. Frequently, these characters are talking as well, providing some thought or snippet of information relating to the action on screen. This is an interesting technique, because it provides a lot more layers to the film, always, always giving us something interesting to look at. But it also an overused technique and ultimately becomes exhausting. Frequently, the characters used for this technique are the seemingly dozens of sportscaster, many from other countries, speaking in their native tongue. Because these characters appear randomly, sometimes shouting a line in Italian or Japanese, their appearance only serves to add to the cacophony of the film.<br /><br />...But Speed is a great racer, possibly the best ever, so he is able to deflect the attackers off, flipping his car, jumping from one track to the next, the car spinning through the air with ease...<br /><br />This is easily the best part of the film. The races are amazing to watch because they seem to be taking place on a Matchbox set in the film \\"Bladerunner\\". It's a little difficult to follow the action at times, but this helps to keep the viewers engaged.<br /><br />...Speed's antics attract the attention of Royalton (Roger Allam, \\"The Queen\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\" and lots of British TV credits), a wealthy industrialist who is very interested in getting Speed to race for his company and help promote his new, unbeatable engine, which would conveniently be built into the car he wants Speed to drive.<br /><br />And Racer X (Matthew Fox, TV's \\"Lost\\", \\"Vantage Point\\") is a mysterious, \\"Robin Hood\\" type, out to help those who need it. He takes an interest in helping Speed especially when he declines to join Royalton's team. After a series of events unfolds, Speed is able to race in the upcoming Grand Prix, the penultimate event for all racers. But Royalton unleashes the many henchmen...<br /><br />Royalton's henchmen eerily resemble the 1960s Television version of the Riddler's goons.<br /><br />...At his disposal to ensure that won't happen. Will Racer X be able to help?<br /><br />\\"Racer\\"'s problems are even more upsetting because I had such high hopes for the film. The trailers promised a mind-blowing, trippy journey. And the filmmakers deliver on this promise. But the story is lacking and the acting is uneven and an odd storytelling device makes the film a mixed effort, one many are clearly staying away from.<br /><br />The odd storytelling device? The film opens with Speed sitting on a bench in the locker room, waiting for the next race, psyching himself up. As he sits, his back to us, he remembers back to similar events involving his brother, Rex, when he was much younger. So we watch a moment between Rex and Speed, then return to the current, thanks to Mom and Pops (Sarandon and Goodman) sitting in the stands, cheering in both scenarios. We watch a moment of the race, than return to the other story. Back to the race, and so forth. Much like the character transitions, this initially works and provides interest to the film, but it becomes overused and ultimately slows the film...<br /><br />And this review...<br /><br />...Down at a time when every minute counts. The same thing happens during the Grand Prix race. A few moments of the race, transition to another story in the past, back to the race, and so forth. This technique makes the Grand Prix, the big, ultimate, climactic race seem like the slowest race ever.<br /><br />I also think it is a mistake to market the film as `family friendly'. This campaign is most likely driving away the teenage boys, afraid there money and time will be spent watching something too tame and sweet. Teenaged girls? Maybe. Little girls? Forget it. So, little boys are really the only audience suitable for this film. And they can't buy tickets on their own. So it is left to the few people interested enough in the film, or nostalgic enough for the animated series, to buy a ticket for this film. And there are apparently very few of those people out in the world.helps to keep the viewers engaged.    ...Speed's antics attract the attention of Royalton (Roger Allam, \\"The Queen\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\" and lots of British TV credits), a wealthy industrialist who is very interested in getting Speed to race for his company and help promote his new, unbeatable engine, which would conveniently be built into the car he wants Speed to drive.

Will Racer X be able to help?    \\"Racer\\"'s problems are even more upsetting because I had such high hopes for the film. The trailers promised a mind-blowing, trippy journey. And the filmmakers deliver on this promise. But the story is lacking and the acting is uneven and an odd storytelling device makes the film a mixed effort, one many are clearly staying away from.    The odd storytelling device? The film opens with Speed sitting on a bench in the locker room, waiting for the next race, psyching himself up. As he sits, his back to us, he remembers back to similar events involving his brother, Rex, when he was much younger. So we watch a moment between Rex and Speed, then return to the current, thanks to Mom and Pops (Sarandon and Goodman) sitting in the stands, cheering in both scenarios. We watch a moment of the race, than return to the other story. Back to the race, and so forth. Much like the character transitions, this initially works and provides interest to the film, but it becomes overused and ultimately slows the film...    And this review...    ...Down at a time when every minute counts. The same thing happens during the Grand Prix race. A few moments of the race, transition to another story in the past, back to the race, and so forth. This technique makes the Grand Prix, the big, ultimate, climactic race seem like the slowest race ever.    I also think it is a mistake to market the film as `family friendly'. This campaign is most likely driving away the teenage boys, afraid there money and time will be spent watching something too tame and sweet. Teenaged girls? Maybe. Little girls? Forget it. So, little boys are really the only audience suitable for this film. And they can't buy tickets on their own. So it is left to the few people interested enough in the film, or nostalgic enough for the animated series, to buy a ticket for this film. And there are apparently very few of those people out in the world.
B0011ZWNF8|4.0|It wasn't until I saw Dream Theater in concert that I started to really enjoy this album. It was not as impressive as their other albums and it was a little off the wall as far as lyics, but... hey, if your as big a fan of DT as I am than its worth owning.
B0000TAPOC|5.0|One should never question an album with Led Zeppelin on it. This one proves that they did it. They rocked the 60s into the 70s. These sessions are raw proof of their live abilities, stay away from the knobs, Satan! If you believe in real music, without overdone overdubs, but just real musicians getting it on at blues and rock, you cannot be wrong buying this one. For everybody else: buy this one and start getting a life!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Demonic possession and the questions of it actually occurring have always interested me. I'd see specials on television with various experts weighing in on whether someone was mentally or emotionally disturbed and in need of psychological help and treatment, or if they were indeed subject to possibly malevolent supernatural forces or intentions.     Now, such a situation has been effectively dramatized in \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\\" Based loosely on a real incident, the story involves a priest, Father Moore, who performed an exorcism on a young girl possibly possessed, and who has since died, being placed on trial to determine if his actions led to her death, due to her not receiving proper medical attention.     Some of what I found effective about the film included how it kept its balance in being a fright film as well as an involving court room drama. The dialogue is believable and never melodramatic, which might have been an easy trap for the film to fall into, considering its mixture of the demon possessed genre, along with the courtroom drama.     The moody and grey cinematography with much fog, also lends the film an effectively mysterious and creepily ominous atmosphere. The writing plays with opposites in order to give the characters and story more complexity, and to befuddle audience's expectations.     All of the actors are pretty convincing. Laura Linney stars as the defense attorney for the accused Father Moore, and her character is actually an agnostic. Linney effectively takes the audience on her journey from simply viewing her present case as a chance for promotion in her career, to becoming sympathetic to the priest's cause in telling Emily Rose's story. She becomes more open to the possibilities of what Emily and her story could well mean, especially as strange things begin to occur around her.     Tom Wilkinson is sincere and courageous as the clergyman on trial, who's not concerned for his own welfare. He simply wants to tell Emily's story andwhy he feels its important. Campbell Scott is strong as the prosecutor determined to prove that Emily Rose died due to medical negligence on Father Moore's part, and not from any demonic possession. As I mentioned about opposites, what helps make the plot more interesting and complex, is that as Linney's character is agnostic, so Scott's is a devout Methodist, but who is also, as he says, \\"a man of fact.\\"     The real acting cudos, however, goes to Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Eschewing much of real heavy make-up effects, the film relies much on Carpenter's acting ability and her contorting of her facial and body muscles to convey Emily's struggle. It's very effectively unnerving to watch her, and Carpenter's performance always keeps one in a state of wondering if she is really mentally unstable and disturbed, or if she actually is suffering from a demonic influence.     What I appreciate most about the film is that no easy answers are provided. That ambivalence is exactly what the director, Scott Derricksen, is aiming for as the film encourages audience members to question their own preconceptions about the supernatural; if and how it may influence our own world and daily lives. Lastly, it recalls the days of older horror movies that placed more emphasis on the fear of the unknown for the characters, and less on piling up the body count and simply splattering the screen with blood and organs.     While it shares the title and subject matter with that classic T-Rex of demonic possession, \\"The Exorcist,\\" the film goes in a direction that more nuanced, chillingly ambiguous and thought provoking than some more recent fare in horror movies of late. I'm excited to see more director Scott Derricksen in the future in movies.
0393327345|5.0|I don't know about you but I was obsessed with the Movie, so much so that I bought the book. I found the book to be much deeper and richer in the philosophical side of the story. Which gives the story a more profound, darker, and  psycotic element, one that is not as prominent in the movie. But I still remain a huge fan of both. I enjoyed reading this book very much and would recommend it to anyone. Well deserving of 5 Stars.

1416562591|5.0|Great fiction writing is like acting and directing at the same time. The novelist needs to create believable personalities, original voices, and plot. The character that Adiga created here, Balram the servant cum businessman, speaks in an original voice that sounds lyrical, devilish, believable.<br /><br />On the surface, the novel is a 250+ page letter from Balram to a visiting Chinese diplomat. On the micro-level of words and sentences, Adiga comes up with original character development that convinces the reader we have blood and flesh. Yet it's fiction. The story is a study in character, and character development seems to be Adiga's main strength. The story's plot and setting rests on Adiga's firm background as a journalist covering India for Time magazine. Adiga is familiar with both the poor and new India, and in the novel he contrasts the two societies to great effect. In the end, it's the conflict between these two societies that is the crux of the story: \\"Dark\\" and \\"Light\\" India are constantly at war, yet the two extremes also seem to share certain values. In the novel, both the rich and the poor are corrupt, resort to bribery, sleep with prostitutes, cheat, lie, steal -- and even murder -- to get to the top. In the end, this comparing and contrasting of values is what this book is about.<br /><br />As an aid to character development, Adiga gives animal nicknames to the rich landlords that serve as supporting characters. Given that the poor in India tend to be illiterate and relate to people and things according to their environment more than through academic means, animal nicknames seemed like an ingenious character development ploy. The novel is filled with little elements like this that work well.<br /><br />At the end of the novel (after Balram kills his master and becomes the narrating entrepreneur of the story) the plot tends to wrap up rather quickly (I will not give it away here); however, although it wraps up quickly, it is a satisfying ending because it completes the theme of the book, which is the contrast and similarities in values between the rich and poor in India.me of the book, which is the contrast and similarities in values between the rich and poor in India.

I was already my ideal body weight but want to tone up and improve cardio, This video is hard work! I like that I feel like I actually did something after it's finished. I just about die towards the end with the side squats and arm lifts and I'm only using 3 lb weights!!! The only reason for only 4 stars is that you can't skip forward to the main work out on the dvd as others have mentioned. It's annoying, but I still highly recommend the workout.    Update: I just moved to level 2 and can barely make it through! I think this may take more than thirty days for me to get to level 3! People are right that Jillian Michaels is pretty motivating though.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost has had its up's and down's, particularly during a sub-par second season and a drawn out third season, but after the jaw-dropping ending of the third season, Lost is back on top.  For those that haven't seen some of the episodes featured in the fourth season of Lost, be warned that some spoilers are ahead here.  With rescue seeming to be in sight, things get even more complicated as a group of strangers (Jeremy Davies, Ken Leung, Rebecca Mader, and Jeff Fahey) make their way to the island, and they're not all there to save anyone.  Adding to the problem is the freighter boat out at sea which Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) arrive to, where they get a big surprise (which wasn't a big surprise to viewers of the show) as Michael (Harold Perrineau) returns, and he's working for Ben (Michael Emerson).  With Ben and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) warning Jack (Matthew Fox) that they can't leave the island, everything comes to an explosive season-ending climax involving a murderous commando (Kevin Durand), more light ends up getting shed on Lost's mythology as well.  Now mixing both flashbacks and flash-forwards, we learn that at least six of the Oceanic survivors make it off the island: Jack, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Sayid, Sun (Yunjiin Kim), Claire's (Emilie de Ravin) baby Aaron, and naturally, Ben.  The season-ending shocker promises that things are only going to develop further, as there are only two seasons of the show left to go.  Even though more characters were introduced (and at times it felt as if more time was focused on Sayid and Desmond's time on the ship than necessary), the way that Lost managed to juggle all these characters this season is something extraordinary.  And while favorites like Jack and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) felt as if they took a step back, both have some great moments here as well.  Most importantly however is that this season of the show firmly re-establishes the series as a spectacular mystery-thriller that will have you drooling to see what happens next.  Even though the show briefly came to a stop thanks to the writer's strike, Lost never missed a beat this season.  Needless to say, if you gave up on Lost in the past, now has never been a better time to get re-acquainted with the series, as things seem to promise to only get better from this point forward.  As corny as it may sound, getting Lost has never been so enjoyable.er that will have you drooling to see what happens next.

B0012GMVDK|2.0|I only liked \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"Anthem\\" on this CD, and even those are a cut below Leonard's best work. This release gave me the feeling it was made of tracks that were not good enough for earlier albums, and someone decided to put them all one disc and get rid of them. The biggest insult to his fans, however, is to try to cover Irving Berlin's \\"Always.\\" Both Cohen and Berlin are great songwriters, separated by a generation and a World War and amazing changes in love and courtship and sex customs. Leonard is great at writing relationship lyrics, and so was Irving, but for different planets. Try \\"Various Positions\\" and his \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums instead of \\"The Future.\\" This one is just not in the top ranks of his concept releases.

CP was one of my drumming heroes as a young kid learning to play and it's a shame that he's been relegated to this.     Pull it together guys and put some balls back in your writing.

Although not a complete anthology of his music, it includes most of his major hits including those with \\"The Highwaymen\\" and best of all, his last hit \\"Hurt\\". This is a must-have for any Cash fan or for anyone who wants a collector's edition of his music. I rate this CD \\"very good\\".
B0015519VS|2.0|This is nothing really memorable about any of the tracks on the CD. Other than the baby laughing, I have 3 kids and can truly appreciate the cuteness of their laughter, it truly warms my heart. But it was COMPLETELY out of place in this case.  After hearing \\"Whats your Name\\" which is kind of up beat to go into \\"Prayer For You\\" just seemed weird and awkward to me.  \\"This Aint Sex\\" is ok, as well as \\"Something Special. \\"Love in this Club\\" at first I didn't really care for this track simply just because of the concept of someone \\"making love\\" in the club is just nauseatingly disgusting, but it does have a fairly decent beat and is kind of infectiously so it grew on me. (Being played on the radio every hour on the hour did help with that).  Overall this was a dud for me.<br /><br />Can someone please go find the \\"You Make Me Wanna\\" \\"You Remind Me\\" \\"Caught Up\\" \\"Got It Bad\\" \\"Let It Burn\\" \\"Confessions\\" Usher please!!!!
B000YD7S2Q|3.0|Werner Herzog's 1990 Bayreuth Lohengrin has some very good singing and occasionally interesting staging yet is seriously marred but dull direction and interaction among the characters. Of the four Lohengrin's I have seen on DVD (Abbado, Domingo/Vienna; Hofmann, Levine/Met; and Hofmann, Nelsson/Bayreuth), this overall has the least interesting characterisation and involvement from the singers.    The singing generally is fine. Paul Frey is a lyrical although unheroic Lohengrin, but this man can't act his way out of a box. He just looks stiff and unfomfortable. Cheryl Studer was well known for her Elsa, and offers much warmhearted lyricism. Try as she does, though, there is no chemistry between her and the dullard Frey. And she is simply not as moving as the Met's Eva Marton. Ekkehard Wlaschiha's Telramund and Gabrielle Schnaut's Ortrud are reasonably well done, but try as they may, they are somehow held back by well-known filmmaker Werner Herzog's inability to get his actors to well, interact much in a compelling manner.     Herzog's best moments come from his nature-inspired Act 2 dialogue between Elsa and Ortrud, more personal and compelling than most anything else in this quite static production. Herzog's emphasis on nature in Act 3 also is winning but when the actors and direction leave such an insipid impression on stage, the trees, the snow at the end - fine touches - go for little.    The Act 1 entrance of the swan is not compelling at all here. Almost embarrassing. And too often, the chorus, so vital in this work, while sounding great, looks small and insignificant through Brian Large's camera work.     Conductor Peter Schneider is one of the best parts of this performance, offering a straightforward reading with both lyricism and drama, rising to some compelling heights and passion when called for. Still, that and Studer's fine Elsa are not enough to bring this Lohengrin into the top rank.     Overall, the drama here is not compelling, not nearly as much asin the Levine/Met and Nelsson/Bayreuth productions, my favorites. Maybe one can chalk it up to Herzog's inexperience with the opera medium. For the most part this is just dull to watch.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Under the careful, intelligent direction of Stephen Frears, the great Helen Mirren captures and displays with amazing clarity the essence of Queen Elizabeth II's quandary during the wrenching summer of 1997, immediately following the death of Princess Diana, who famously died in a car crash in Paris while being chased by papparazi.  Ruminating over the palace's appropriate public response to the death of the ex-communicated princess, the Queen is caught between the ever-growing clamor for an official acknowledgement of Diana's passing and what she and nearly all her consorts (except for Tony Blair, who has just been elected Prime Minister) consider a near-vulgar display of public grief (i.e., her own stiff-upper-lip resolve to act on her own terms).      In the movie's most stunning scene, the Queen proceeds through the throngs that have gathered at Buckingham palace and is confronted by a child who offers a bouquet, insisting that the flowers are meant for the Queen.  Having expressed more remorse for the demise of a stag than for her former daughter-in-law, Elizabeth is surprisingly touched by this simple gesture and it reveals her humanity, however circumspect, without ever betraying the steely contenance of a long-reigning monarch.  It's also testament to the power of Mirren's daring and brilliantly nuanced performance.  \\"The Queen\\" also features the legendary Sylvia Sims as the Queen Mother, Micheal Sheen, who effectively approximates Tony Blair and the charming Helen McCrory as a spunky, devastatingly funny Cherie Blair--an independent, thoroughly modern and successful career woman who disdains antiquated \\"royal\\" formalities.  Also notable is James Cromwell as the crotchety Prince Phillip.
B000P2A24W|5.0|For 25 years Bon Jovi has been keeping the Jersey Shore Sound alive, but unless Southside and others (most famously The Boss) they have always been combining it. This time the choice fell on country. Yes, it's not a joke, it's country... although using a banjo in the background or just having \\"Big & Rich\\" sing with you doesn't necessarily constitute Country... or Western for that matter.    And let's be frank, Jon can give a thousand more interviews telling everybody who doesn't want to hear it that evolving into country is just an artistic statement, this record has foremost paid off econonomically for the band. It was just a given that any country-pop-rock-combination would work in small-town America, the first Billboard #1 debut since \\"New Jersey\\" is just proof of that.    But let's stick with Jon's argument: Let's assume that this album is just an artistic statement, just about the beauty of writing songs, and not about selling tickets or anything. If the art tells us anything about the artist, then the question is obvious: Is this new direction a sign for a creative burnout? Or is this album to the band what a haircut is to an abandoned woman?*) Or, to concentrate on other members of the band, to a failed acting career?    Disregarding that, there is just one bottom line: If you buy Bon Jovi, you get Bon Jovi, no matter what. You get the Jersey Shore, the Pop, the Rock, the Captain Kidd, the King of Swing, the Tommy, the Gina, the Country (attempt), the Live Experience... the uncomparable... just the good ole Bon Jovi. They've given us the soundtrack to all of our Twentysomethings' lives.    Keep the faith these days-ly,  Team Heaton    *) By the way: Alcohol is not the answer, even if you just broke your shoulder.
B000FSME1A|3.0|No one seems to realize this but there are not two but three versions of this movie. The end of the original is too short and I find it unsatisfying. Redux is WAAAY to long and drags. A version called \\"The Directors Cut\\" came out on VHS some years ago and was somewhere in between the original and the Redux, having a longer end without the dragging middle. I don't like Redux and the original is not as great a film without the enhanced end.

1582701709|1.0|As a desperate father of two who has recently been layed-off during this burgeoning recession, I wanted to believe anything that gave me hope. My girlfriend suggested The secret. I sat in the bookstore and spent a couple hours reading it. I'm still wondering what the big SECRET is, as if I had missed something crucial. I wonder like many desperate readers, \\"am I too thick-headed to buy into this \\"law of attraction\\" as a cure-all device for the needy?\\" Am I too pessimestic that I cannot fully quench the message to make success my reality?     I was quite unsatisfied and confused after reading the Secret. Positive thinking should be a state of mind that bolsters our confidence in times of doubt and crisis, not a scheme to arbitrarily take and expect the riches that are not due. This book is hokum and doesn't articulate it's message but rather reiterates it in various phrases. I am dissappointed to say it is a book promoting false hope.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie very much.  It was engaging & kept my attention from beginning to end.  There was success, romance, humor, death, and sadness - and it ended well.  If you like a good story, try this one out.

I have always known I was blessed to be born in America but,  when I saw this incredible production,  for the very first time, I realized how these men worked to give us this freedom we have.  I now look at the Declaration of Independence with wider and tear-filled eyes.      As for John and Abigail Adams?  Their love for each other -  the strength they gave to each other - because of  this same love,  makes me wonder if we would ever have had a nation without them.      Thanks to all who made this program possible.  It must be the best of their life work and will last forever in the lives of Americans.   I am grateful to David McCullough (and his Rosalee!)  for this - their work -  as Rosalee was surely David's Abigail in his career.   God HAS Blessed America!
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie has incredible effects, wonderful acting and a beautiful story. It's a nice change from all those sappy, been-there-done-that romances. This is a beautiful and original movie about love conquering all. And it doesn't just involve the love between the husband and wife, but also the love between the parents and the children, and even the family dog. It uses wonderful images of both heaven and hell, and will make you wonder what each would be like for you. Two thumbs up.
1401301363|5.0|Nigella is my original muse, she single handedly got me back into the kitchen and cooking when the days of making cookies with my grandmother passed and I had to start doing it on my own. I have all of her books and honestly they are something one can actually cook from, my shelves are bending from the amount of cookbooks they house but only half are being used to make dinners and cakes, others I look at for inspiration and for pictures but Nigella's recipes are worth every penny one spends on a cookbook. I can't express my love and gratitude for this woman; she's intelligent, cheerful, honest a magnificent food writer who actually got me into writing as well, I even got my first KitchenAid mixer because she used her so much to make all of her delectable treats.  So fear not, this and other books that she penned are not only gorgeous to look at but they can help anyone put something mouth watering on the table in no time. This one has pictures on almost every page and a short little bit of how this came to be or how she eats it before each recipe, probably my favorite part of the book.    This book is broken into occasions rather than seasons or ingredients - Thanksgiving & Christmas, New Year, Meatless Feasts, Valentine's Day, Easter, Passover, Breakfast, Kitchen Feasts, Kiddiefeast, Cut-out Cookies, Chocolate Cake Hall of Fame, A Georgian Feast, Eid, Ultimate Feasts, Hallowe'en, Rosh Hashanah, A Venetian Feast, Festival of Lights, Partytime, Midnight Feast, Wedding Feast, Funeral Feast ( somber I know but the food is actually very appropriate and having herself lose her mother, sister and first husband to cancer, Nigella is still living life and making the best of what she has) so no matter what one celebrates they can find something good in this super large volume. I have to admit that I use this daily and don't wait for special occasions.    Feast is probably her biggest ( thickest) book to date, and I made some good things from it. Let me tell you, the PumpkinCheesecake (on page 68 ) was my first cheesecake and  no only was it ridiculously easy it turned out so good I was shocked I made it myself. There was a suggestion for Butterscotch sauce on the page to pour on top, I made it as well ( gotta love the pairing suggestions) and the combination was just divine. The sauce would also go well on something like an apple and macadamia nut crumble or anything thatis sweet.     Gingerbread muffins on page 91 were so warm and cozy I make them in cold weather to keep the chill of, the trouble is stopping at one. If you want your house to smell like a home, make this!    Roast Loin of pork with caraway, lemon and garlic - spicy fragrant, nothing ordinary about this simple to make dinner, makes great leftovers as the rub on top intensifies.     Chicken Pot Pie - I guarantee that after this one no one will be shopping for it in the frozen section of their supermarket, flaky dough, creamy hot center, lost of peas, ham and chicken in sauce, the only caution is not burning the tongue as it's hard not to gobble up.    There's even Muttar Paneer - an excellent Indian dish, makes me feel silly for ever thinking it was hard to make. Now I can control the ingredients and how much salt and fat goes into it, one can make a healthy lunch out of an exotic staple after all.     This book has everything, I don't know how this woman thinks it all up, but she makes these recipes and writes about them, she feeds them to her children and friends, real people are involved into bringing this book to life and it shows.    - Kasia S.

B00005YUNY|5.0|This is not one of those orchestrated monstrosities where an orchestra gets paid to riff along with a band (i.e Symphonic Metallica). The music of Yes works well with an orchestra and the band itself is always in charge but never overshadowing the orchestra. A big plus is that the members of Yes seem to understand something about songwriting and arranging moreso than most and the result is surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable, especially the version of Close To The Edge here.<br />The camera angles are nicely highlighting the different sections of the orchestra at key times during the performance as well as the band and  the conductor. Yes share the stage surprisingly well with an orchestra. It at first sounds like the band have turned their instruments down a little more than usual in an effort not to overplay. There is a definite chemistry between band and orchestra here.<br />This is probably more for diehards than casual fans but well worth it. My only complaint is minor one. I thought some of the fans on the second \\"making of\\" disc were a little unecessary and I would've preferred to see more of the band and less about their fan clubs and t-shirt sales, but I can always skip that disc.
B00005JPFH|5.0|This movie was great again from your friendly neiborhood spiderman. This was a great performence intense action violence the effects was awsome everthing in this movie was great. They did real good with sandman, venom, hop goblin, and black suited spiderman, i have to say that was pretty amazing but the game sucked but this was great. Spiderman4 is comeing out next year with carnage lizard and probly rihno, that will be a awsome battle spiderman3 is'nt the last theres another comeing, but this movie was great. I liked all the spiderman movie but part2 was outstanding that was a perect battle between doc ock and spiderman, spiderman was great to were it all begain from a single bite from a spider, the chemicals from the spider transformed peter into a strong and fast webslingng superhero, then he had to face the green goblin then after that fight was part2 with the fight with doc ock, a man that attached 6 arms in the back of him self as a science acspirement, but then a accident happend his wife died so he begain to commet crime but spidy did'nt let that happen. Then spiderman defeted doc ock then this came out with more intense drama and action the effects was great, so this was a great movie.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|of a dark, grotesque and miserable existence. Johnny Depp has an excellent talent of interpreting pain from the script to the screen. A horrible story with fairly good singing on Mr. Depp's part.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|It is painfully obvious that this movie is a money grab to transition to a new trilogy with the new kid, which will be an even bigger money grab, done by the 'second trilogy' money grab king himself!  And that pains me to say, as I love Star Wars and the old Indiana Jones movies!    I can only imagine the conversation....   \\"Got any new ideas? no? ok, a sequel then...\\"  \\"But sir, we already ended the trilogy.\\"  \\"That's ok, get the kid that saved the Transformers movie, and throw a bunch of money at Harrison Ford, and create a transition movie to a new trilogy.\\"  \\"Don't we need a story?\\"  \\"We'll worry about that later.\\"    The story is horrible.  The usual way Indy goes through and sorts out the clues is not there.  The clues and legends in this movie may have looked good on paper, but the way it was shot, there was no deduction to get Indy or the viewer to the final desitnation.  The clues mentioned are never thought through and served no purpose in setting them on a path to the end.  \\"They're pictograms!  Ok, we're gonna fall down a waterfall!\\"  And viola!  We are there!    There are plot holes all through it.  The FBI is after him, then not, he magically gets his whip back a couple of times, tarzan reenactments....  the rest would be spoilers, which I don't like to do, and I think I am dancing on the edge of a few as it is.    So I will close by saying that at the end of the movie, I watched for the director to avoid them in the future.  Steven Speilberg is labeled as director in the beginning, but as I suspected, about 4 or 5 'set' or 'asst' directors are listed in the end.  This may be an indication that they directed this thing by autopilot.  They phoned it in, and it shows....    To end on a good note, Cate was good as a villian, and there are a couple of one liners that shine, so I will give it two stars.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|With so many reviews I am basically doing this to be able to rate the CD, which I gave five stars to. My sister had made me aware of a Sunday morning show hosted by Charles Osgood called Sunday Morning which usually features a singer or group each week. One Sunday it was Michael Buble and I decided I liked his style. I am not a Frank Sinatra fan, nor a Dean Martin, Paul Anka or Perry Como. I am a recent Guy Lombardo fan who awoke in me an interest in big band music which is a definite change of pace from the guitars, banjos and fiddles used in my favorite types of music -- folk and bluegrass. I was and always will be a Beatles' fan, so I chose this one for Can't Buy Me Love. I did recognize You Don't Know Me, Save the Last Dance For Me, and How Sweet It is. I played the disk and just let myself be enveloped in the sounds from trumpets and saxophones. What struck me from the start was how much it reminded me of the end song in the DVD Finding Nemo called Beyond the Sea with the feel of a lounge song. I enjoyed Buble's singing though I would not be able to compare it to similar style musicians as I don't listen to them. The tempo was soothing and exciting at the same time, and liked that he hadn't changed the sounds of the selections I was familiar with. Whether I will buy another of his CDs or not, I am very pleased with It's Time.
B000IFQLBE|5.0|Its just amazing that we are in the year 2008 and John Fogerty is still putting out fantastic music. Th new release, Revival sounds strong on the brief listens that I have given to date.  However, the live recording The Long Road Home is just phenomenal.<br /><br />There is an excellent mix of classic Creedence tunes and solo material.  John varies the arrangements slightly from song to song.  Some tunes are shortened some are lengthened.  An all acoustic De Ja Vu All Over Again is very touching.  I love the bouncy delightful Looking Out My Backdoor especially when substitutes tangerines and Elvis are singing with the band on the second bridge.  I especially enjoy the banter John does between songs.  It gives the CD a very intimate feel.<br /><br />Everything works for me on this release.  Soe complain about the songs being too fast or the drummer adding excessive fills but truthfully those are all good things to my ears.  The ability to evolve and vary arrangments is what keeps JOhn Fogerty fresh to my ears in this year of 2008.
B000002J29|5.0|I got to see this amazing band twice in Kalamazoo Mich during the 70s. The first time I sat for 2 hours with my jaw on the floor, I had never witnessed anything like it and was so blown away that I had to be reminded to hit the joints being past to me. From that point on I was a Genesis devotee .. well ..at least up to the point where they seemed to sell out to top 40. This live album is maybe the best live album I have ever heard. It perfectly captures what it was like in sound to be at a Genesis concert and a must for any true music lover of any type.
0765348780|4.0|Hoo boy, I don't know how to review this one. . .  I liked many parts and disliked many parts in this first book.  I gave it four stars though cause its better than 90% of whats out there.<br /><br />Well, the pros first I guess:<br />1)Erikson is great at world-building.  While not as gigantic a scope and world as Wheel of Time, it does have a larg scope and world.  Some like that, some don't.  I, personally, love that.  Its got a lot of detail, especially with the natural gas city, Darujhistan, and above all that its a fascinating world with fantastic history that you could really get into.  I loved the idea of the T'lan Imass and Tiste Andii. The yearn to learn more about this history is probably what is going to keep me reading through the next book.<br /><br />2)Erikson has good writing ability.  While I don't generally agree with anything written on the covers of book for advertising, what Elizabeth Haydon said on the back is exactly what I thought of Erikson's writing.  \\"Gripping, fast-moving, delightfully dark. . .\\" blah blah blah.  He's not a great wordsmith like Donaldson, or a beautifull writer like Hobb, but he does have an interesting unique style and I quite enjoyed it.  And from reading other reviews it looks like it only gets better and changes as you go.  Thats fantastic in my opinion.<br /><br />3)What made the story awesome for me was that, well, I fell in love with the story!  There was so much crap going on it was fantastic!!!  I didn't have any problem remembering everything, even the subplots within the subplots.  I thought this had waaaay more plot twists, which there was no possible way to predict in my opinion, than George R. R. Martin will ever have.  Of course Martin makes it more realistic in that its a choice of the character and not random events caused by the gods or magic like with Erikson.  But seriously, with those random events happening you still want to see what happens to the characters and how they will respond to it. . . and how plans change. . . and your worried the hole time about whether or not they are going to get through it.  Thats a cool thing about killing your characters, you never know who will actually die!  I seriously could go on an on about how much I liked the story and all its subplots within subplots and having those tie into the story in large ways, but I think you get the idea.  It's totally epic.<br /><br />Now the Cons:<br />Well, this seems to be a disputed opinion, but one that favors the dislike of the characters. I personally didn't find the characters very interesting.  Maybe they will get more interesting and more thought-provoking later on in the series as Erikson becomes a better writer and more characters are introduced, but in this book I just didn't care about the characters very much.  Paran was kinda interesting, Tattersail was kinda interesting, Rake was kinda interesting, Whiskeyjack was kinda interesting, and maybe Rallick was too, but beyond that I didn't fall in love with any of the characters.  This is a horrible thing for any writer as everyone knows that characters are the most important thing in a book.  Fortunately, even though the characters were boring, I found that the story more than made up for it, so I enjoyed the series enough to put 4 stars up. . .<br /><br />The worst thing, though, is the magic. . .  While its not anywhere near as bad as Wheel of Time with the characters magically knowing how to use. . . well magic they would have no possible way of knowing. . . Gardens of the Moon doesn't give any explanation on how magic is used or how it was created.  They just used Warrens, which doesn't make sense to me since a warren is an area where rabbits live in burrows, or a mazelike place where one may easily become lost, so there was no way to look up the meaning of the word to figure out what it was.  If there was an explanation about warrens in the book then I totally missed it.  Anyway, I thought the magic was cool, even if it wasn'texplained well.<br /><br />Lastly it seemed the end was a bit rushed. . . kinda.  The demon coming in at the end didn't really register with me as being all that bad after Erikson worked you up over the Jaghut.  It was just like, \\"oh another powerful bad guy\\". . . It gets killed so quickly though that its like, what the heck was the point of that?<br /><br />Ah, well, other than those bad things the story is complex enough for me to like it even though the characters suck and its as simple as that.  Pretty long review just to say what I said in one sentence.  Damnit, twenty minutes wasted. . .s a bit rushed. . . kinda.

0060531053|5.0|If you've ever even THOUGHT about brewing your own ales, lagers, stouts or porters, this is the book for you.  Papazian is extremely knowledgable and has a writing style that makes the process fun and easy to follow.  It is essentially the \\"bible\\" for home brewers.    My 3 cents (wasn't it worth more then 2?)
0767817478|4.0|I loved this move, than again i am not a fan of the original series of films but this one was my kind of flick.<br /><br />A Mutant Lizard is unleashed upon the world after it is mutated to ginormous size through nuclear radiation caused by French Weapon testing. When the lizard enters New York you can guess there are problems. Causing enourmous amounts of damage to the city the Military is fixed on destroying it. But it wont go away. The creature lays eggs in the Madison Square Garden Complex and now its spawn threaten to spead into the streets of New York.<br />The main character played by Matthew Broderick is Dr. Nick Tatapoulus, a failing anthropologist who is contracted by the Government to find out what this thing is and where it came from. With the help of his Ex Girlfriend and The Men and Women of the US Army he sets out to stop the ultimate destruction.<br /><br />The film is a new take on the Classic story and is in my opinion better. The orginal Godzilla was an alien that procted earth by destroying buildings? Sure he fights other giant monsters but thay cause less damage than he does. This film says he is a Mutated Lizard from the Galapagos Area and suggest the possibilty of Other Mutations.
0767817478|4.0|The American Godzilla movie seems to be a very divisive film. There is no middle ground, some either like it or they hate it. I am one who actually really enjoys this film despite its flaws. Having grown up on the Toho Godzilla films of the 60s and the 70s it seems that the majority of the complaints about this movie are in how far Rolland Emmerich and Dean Devlin deviated from Godzilla's original design. I think those who were upset with the design changes do have a valid point. When you change the design of a cultural icon it is bound to upset the core fan base. However, despite the monster being Godzilla in name only, the movie does have many qualities to redeem it.<br /><br />Pros: Taking the design of the monster on its own merit, Godzilla, or Zilla, as he is renamed by Toho studios, is a very creatively designed creature. Even if one doesn't consider this creature Godzilla, on his own he is a well designed monster and a welcome addition to the panoply of Toho's Kaiju creatures. He is more animal like than his Japanese counterpart (and less indestructible) and this has been the source of many of the criticisms levied at this incarnation of Godzilla. But from my perspective the CGI effects are much more superior to a guy walking around in a latex suit and that adds to the sense of realism. Rolland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have unapologetically stated that they make fun lighthearted popcorn movies. That is exemplary with this movie and that is where the enjoyment comes. All of the Toho Godzilla movies are covered with a healthy slice of cheese or two and the American version is no exception. This is a light hearted movie which doesn't take itself too seriously and is enjoyable despite its flaws.<br /><br />Cons: Sure the movie does have its cheesy moments but in my opinion all of Toho's Godzilla movies (with the exception of the 1954 Japanese original) are covered with more Velveeta than this American version. I believe Matthew Broderick does an excellent job in the lead role as well as much of the supporting cast. My only major complaint and big flaw as far as the characters are concerned is with Mayor Ebert. He spends the majority of the movie just whining and complaining and worried how this will affect his popularity. Even when the military is doing things to protect the city Mayor Ebert really doesn't seem to care about the welfare of the citizens at all. The other complaint is that the time spent in Madison Square Gardens with the baby Zilla's is the part of the movie which seems to slow down and drag a bit too much. Other than that I really do enjoy this movie and wished Zilla could get another chance to star in his own feature length movie.s well as much of the supporting cast.

B000009ROK|5.0|Compre esta coleccion porque conocia algunas de las canciones, y debo decir que por el precio, ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho recientemente. El bolero ha sido un genero muy popular en las generaciones de mis abuelos y mis padres, y sus melodias son tan vigentes hoy en dia como lo fueron muchos anos atras. Luis Miguel interpreta estas inmortales canciones con un estilo unico y glamoroso. En resumen, estoy muy satisfecha con esta adquisicion.
0671449028|5.0|My 2 year old loved this book for a looooong time, and it was our ritual at bedtime.  She memorized the book, especially the brushing the teeth part- great teaching tool for brushing teeth!!  We loved it.
0763639184|5.0|I was given this book in the hardcover format as a baby shower gift.  My daughter (now 20 months old) has LOVED it since the first time we read it.  The bright colors and beautiful rhymes hold her attention.  Now she loves pointing to all of the fish as I describe them.  I was so happy when they started making the boardbook format.  I stock up - buying 4 or 5 at a time - and give them away for EVERY baby shower or new baby gift.  This is a FABULOUS book that ALL kids should have in their collection.

If you can handle it, read it. here is a description of what this book is about (does not contain spoilers)    this storie is about victor, the protagonist, who is a sex addict. He finds 'unusual' ways of finding sexual partners and in messed up places. The story transitions from victor's past and present with his mother who is in a hospital. To pay for bills and stuff, Victor scams people by acting as if he was choking at restaurants. That is a very narrowed down discription but i am trying to not have spoilers.
B00005JXY3|5.0|Following Daniel-San's (Macchio) triumphant, albeit incredibly improbable, victory at the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament, there is little time to celebrate.  Mr. Miyagi (Morita) gets a letter from Okinawa informing him that his father is dying.  He knows this is a potentially deadly situation because of an old grudge with his former best friend Sato.  Nonetheless, Miyagi let's the recently dumped Daniel-San (it was only a matter of time before Elisabeth Shue realized she was dating a sissy) come along for the trip.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Okinawa, Miyagi soon realizes that he has very little time.  Not only will his father die very soon, but his former best friend Sato - who incidentally has a watermelon for a head - wants to fight him to the death.  It turns out that Miyagi left his homeland eons ago because both he and Sato liked the same girl, Yuki.  Rather than fighting for her, Miyagi took the pacifist route and left the country.  In Sato's eyes this was disgraceful, and an insult to his honor.  Sato has held the grudge ever since, and has used that anger to fuel his drive - he owns everything from the construction company to the brothel.  For some reason, however, he was never able to convince Yuki to be with him...or work at the brothel.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Daniel-San is still a whiner who gets bullied by anyone with a pulse.  In this case, he gets bullied by Chosun, Sato's best student.  Chosun is a vicious, callous karate expert with a 18-inch waist, who manages to oversee illegal gambling schemes in his spare time.  He's ten-times the goon that Johnny from KKI was.  I am convinced the main reason Chosun despises Daniel-San is the fact that Daniel-San is nearly in the panties of Kumiko (Tamlyn Tomita), a town cutie, before he's even been there a week..<br /><br />All of this sets up the final battle scenes, where Miyagi faces Sato in a bizarre twist of fate, and Daniel-San must face Chosun.  This is where I have a problem.  While I especially appreciated how the preposterously telegraphed \\"Crane Technique\\" was so easily dispatched by Chosun - yet another lead villian who would murder Daniel-San in real life - I was quickly disappointed to see that the new finishing move was even more ridiculous, and Chosun loses his honor as he transforms from a guy who simultaneously beat up 5 soldiers into a complete moron who can't see, duck, dodge, or block any of the 47 consecutive punches Daniel-San applies to his face.  This is incredibly difficult to digest, especially considering the ease with which Chosun pummelled Daniel-San in every previous encounter, making him look like a spineless toddler in many instances.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie is a classic, and we get to cheer Daniel-San's scrawny carcass onto yet another victory.sterously telegraphed \\"Crane Technique\\" was so easily dispatched by Chosun - yet another lead villian who would murder Daniel-San in real life - I was quickly disappointed to see that the new finishing move was even more ridiculous, and Chosun loses his honor as he transforms from a guy who simultaneously beat up 5 soldiers into a complete moron who can't see, duck, dodge, or block any of the 47 consecutive punches Daniel-San applies to his face.

B0015519VS|3.0|He should have changed the name of the cd to Family Man or something like that. Besides Love in this Club, he doesn't have too many songs that aren't about how he is grown up and happily in love. With that said, I do like the cd. Its just a different Usher than what people are used to. He might reach a different audience with this cd and maybe lose some of his younger fans. If you listen to the cd expecting for a lot of songs like there were on Confessions, you might be disappointed. My favorite tracks so far (besides both Love in this Club songs) are Trading Places and Moving Mountains but I will have to listen to it a few more times. Nothing really jumped out at me as a song I really love. One thing I do love, is Usher is not one of those artists who comes out with a 12 track cd.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I didnt like this movie at all . Iwhich i would of seen it before i bought it . It dont make any sense at all. Iwas so dark you could hardly see anything at all. My husband even fell asleep  during the movie. It moved so much it got me dizzy. Iwouldnt advise for anybody to purchase this. Iwished i hadnt purchase this  It not worth $14.99 . thats what i paid for it.
B000YENUI6|5.0|This is a film about Russian mafia in London.  The casts are all very good, very believable.  Viggo is extremely good as the 'driver'.  With his good research, the tattoo becomes a major element in this movie. This is one of the best film I have ever watched in this year, and it proves David Cronenberg is not just a director who gives us mainstream movies like The Fly, Scanners, but something really enjoyable and outstanding.
0812975219|5.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb is an extremely insightful individual with an equally impresive gift for storytelling.    His basic thesis is that although we like to think of our lives as ordered and predictable, they are extremely prey to random chance, and are in fact far far more so than most of us can even understand. We create delusions of predictabilty, mentally rewriting our own history in order to avoid excessive anxiety. He brings a unique perspective as both a genuine thinker and a man of practical experience in one of the most volatile occupational arenas of modern life - the stock market.    I found the autobiographical aspects of this book (both in the first person narrative, and the use of the fictional Nero Tulip) as interesting as its more philosphical and analytical content.
0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is a story about \\"self\\" so the author does discuss her feelings about everything.  Ummm...that's generally what autobiographical books do.   I'm rather surprised by some of the bad reviews.  I can't imagine any woman wouldn't find something enjoyable or interesting to relate to in the author's journey.  I recommend this book to all of my friends who are interested in reading and it's one of the most enjoyable stories that I've listened to in a long time.

B000RZGIOA|4.0|This was a excellent HD Transfer on the HD-DVD with plenty of features. Should be just as good (if not better) on Blu-Ray. The only downside is that the DTS track was in 6.1 ES, which isn't supported by any HD-DVD players and very few Blu-Ray players support this track (this matters if you are using PCM sound through HDMI). Most Blu-Ray players make the jump from DTS Core Audio to HD High Resolution and HD Master Audio with nothing in between. Don't be discouraged though, cause it still sounds great down-mixed to 5.1. Highly recommend switching from the DVD version to this HD version. The quality is great and a definite improvement over the DVD releases.
B000YABYLA|4.0|The characters are interesting and funny. The dialog is very good. The acting is excellent. The characters find true love. The main character learns about life. There are no perfect couples and life is complex. My biggest problem is the baby. Juno had sex because she was curious and she was bored. I don't understand why they didn't have protected sex. She planned the encounter for months and she obviously knew better. They didn't have sex in the throes of passion. They had sex because they were curious.     We follow the pregnancy's development. Juno through it all never forms an attachment to the baby. She objectifies it. She decides not to have an abortion because she was uncomfortable in the clinic and didn't like the staff. She decides to give up the baby for adoption.     In the end there are no consequences. She is the same strange, sweet girl at the end of the movie as she is at the start of the movie. The baby is completely out her life as if nothing happened. Her father says to her at the hospital after Juno gives birth that one day she will be there on her own terms. I don't understand. She made every decision to get there in the first place. It was on her own terms. Maybe, he meant that the next pregnancy will be planned and she will want the baby. She seems depressed after the birth, but no moral misgivings and no post-partem depression. The baby is almost a Hitchcockian McGuffin. It is introduced into the plot to provide conflict.      I enjoyed the movie but maybe because I was a guy I was not overwhelmed. The one really bad thing is the music. One obnoxious song towards the beginning goes on forever with horrible lyrics and an repetitious melody. I think the song was supposed to be a duet of Juno and her boyfriend. However, there was no reason to inflict so much torture for so long.
0060531053|5.0|I got this book on recommendation from my friend Aaron when we were brewing at his house this weekend. We brewed a variation of the \\"Goat Scrotum Porter\\" on page 200.     The book is however much more than a recipe book for beer. It is divided into three major sections:     Pgs 1-39 give a basic outline of brewing history and the knowledge you need to brew a beer from a basic kit.     Pgs 40-240 are the meat of the book. This intermediate brewing section goes over every aspect of brewing from yeasts to sanitizing your equipment. It also includes many recipes for ales and lagers as well as ideas on how you might adapt any recipe for your own tastes.     Pgs 241-388 really get into the science and math behind brewing. I have only skimmed this section, but it seems to be a fantastic reference guide for the advanced brewer.       What sets this book apart is the well written and funny style that Papazian brings to everything from water mineral content to the human migrations that transport Viennese lagers to Mexico. Most appreciated is his constant reminder that if you are feeling stressed about the minutia of brewing \\"Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Homebrew.\\" This seems to be both his philosophy and the first step of all of his recipes.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was disappointed that season 10 ended the way it did, but was glad to see they put out this movie (and one more is coming!!!) I really enjoyed it, and was glad to see that SG-1 still lives on. Looking forward to the next film now.
0486411818|5.0|This book has been a core finite element reference for me for 16 years.  The mathematics are actually somewhat mild compared to most of today's finite element literature and many of the other seminal finite element texts.  It is completely inappropriate for an undergraduate level text, but it is an excellent graduate level introduction the FEM.  It provides a sound basis for advanced topics in non-linear analysis.  It does assume that the reader already has a reasonable background in related fields (e.g. continuum mechanics, linear algebra, and real analysis).  I have never touched the code that the text references.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I've always been a big SG-1 fan, and never wanted to give Atlantis a try. Once SG-1 officially ended, I decided to give Atlantis a try. I watched season 4 on TV, got into it, and realized they'd done a good job on this spin-off. I still had several questions, since I started watching season 4, so I picked up the 1-3 seasons here from Amazon. It didn't disappoint. While there were a few \\"dud\\" episodes (which show doesn't have those??), I really enjoyed the whole series thus far, and am looking forward to the new season.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Unlike most people reviewing Third, this was my first listen to Portishead. I hadn't even heard the apparently popular Sour Times before. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise. This is by far the best album I've listened to this year.  For those of you into Radiohead's Kid A/Amnesiac/Hail to the Thief stuff, this is a must for you. Third is very trance-inducing. The musical compositions progress very nicely, always catching you by surprise. It's very trippy (no pun intended) with a lot of the album making you sit up at attention to what's going on. Although it may be a difficult listen for some, Third is very rewarding upon mulitple listens and there's a lot to grab hold of in a lot of the songs.   The melancholy lyrics and the marriage between electronic beats and sounds are a surprisingly and exceedingly strong match for Beth Gibbon's beautiful vocals.   I don't understand the 1 star reviews, I fully believe this a a 5 star album and perhaps one of my favorites of all time.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|A must have.  Its good dancing fun music.  Bump this music up anywhwere and I know youll be dancing around - give it a chance.  Its Hip and modern, and very NOW. Im very happy with my new Donna cd!  Love it!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|I recently finished a leadership training course sponsored by my company. One of the activities that we did in the class was to reflect on great world leaders and think about what qualities made them great. It came up during the session that some years ago the teachers had led a similar exercise, but had actually asked the participants to try to communicate with a living leader who had personally affected them. The idea had been for people to get in touch with a former manager or teacher. However, it happened that one of the participants (not having a manager who he or she had admired) contacted Nelson Mandela by email. To everyone's surprise, he responded quite kindly and shared some thoughts about leaders and leadership.<br /><br />When I was traveling in South Africa, I heard many similar stories. Tour groups who told about Mandela coming out of the parliament building to greet and talk to the tourists. Employees at Robben Island talked reverently about how he had taken personal interest in their lives based on the briefest of acquaintenceships. Every story emphasized his humbleness, his respect for others, and his basic approachability.<br /><br />Long Walk to Freedom, for me, confirms that image of Mandela as a man who is great in part because of his humbleness, and his resistance to myth. He emphasizes his role as the man in the middle, pushed by circumstances and common decency into greatness. He consistently avoids overdone bragging (the little that is there is surely allowed him) and looks hard at the actions that the ANC took in their quest for freedom.<br /><br />While it would have been interesting to read this before going to South Africa, I actually think that I got more out of it now after seeing the country first.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. It is not a perfect narrative. It suffers in parts from being written over a period of years. There are some little repetitions and awkwardnesses along the way. None of those things matter at all in relation to either the reading experience or the importance of the book. I liked it very much, and would recommend it highly to others. Do not be daunted by its size (625 pages, in my edition). It is actually a very quick read and kept me intensely interested the whole time. Genuinely inspirational.perience or the importance of the book. I liked it very much, and would recommend it highly to others. Do not be daunted by its size (625 pages, in my edition).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just started this video on Wed. I did it 2 days in a row, then I gave my body a rest for Friday. Believe me, I needed it. My legs were hurting me so bad. I resumed today, and I allready feel a difference in my endurence. Just in these few short days, I was able to push a little harder than I was the first couple of days.    I decided to give this video a whirl because our gym membership is almost up, and it's just too expensive to renew. The workout is only about 20 mins. It's not long, but you don't stop for a break. If you need to, she says 5 seconds. But if you want results, you have to push yourself.    But listen to your body. If you've done a couple of days, and your body really hurts. Then give yourself a day off. You don't want to really injure yourself. But I would say no more than 2 days off. The longer you take inbetween, the harder it will be to get back into it..
B00004TRD8|4.0|I watched the special extended version and the only difference is the alternate ending put back in the movie. You can access that ending separately on disc 2. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because the extreme DVD version looks and sounds better. I liked the original ending better because in reality the future is unknown. The hours of extras on this version are well worth the buy.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|The Best band out of the Athens,Ga. scene is by far R.E.M. No disrespect towards The B52's,Pylon or Love Tractor, but even they know it's true. I have been a fan since the early 80's and think I qualify to review this album. I am not obsessed with R.E.M. and have an EXTENSIVE CD collection, so that I am not listening to any one band or style as some others might.<br /><br />I would find myself in the group who would declare that the last truly GREAT R.E.M, albums were \\"Monster\\" and \\"New Adventures In Hi-Fi\\", But unlike those that totally trash albums like \\"Up\\",\\"Reveal\\" and \\"Around The Sun\\"' I simply think those were weaker efforts. The remaining three members tried various things scaled back the rockers in favor of lower key and more arranged song structure. Some of the stuff off these 3 albums is great, but as a whole each album was not in the same league as anything they did when they were a quartet.<br /><br />It is with great pleasure that I announce that this is the best stuff they have done since Bill Berry retired. The album has solid rockers and a couple of low key songs. If you are a TRUE R.E.M. fan you have likely all ready bought this album and this review is a waste for you. If however you are casual fan disappointed by recent albums and want something closer to the days of \\"Monster\\", plop down your cash because here it is.<br /><br />I am bewildered by some of the people who have given this album a poor review. These are likely the people who screamed loudly for an album in the vain of \\"Monster\\" and then they are given one and they trash it.<br /><br />DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!! This album will bring you back to the R.E.M. faithful. Currently my favorite tracks are the title track and \\"Man Size Wreath\\", however the album is solid enough that I will likely jump around on favorite tracks.<br /><br />I gave this album five stars and while I don't think it is quite worthy of five, it is a solid 4 maybe 4.5 I gave it five because of the clueless wonders who gave it poor reviews. There needs to be some of us who add some balance in the world. Is this their best work?? No. Is this a great album?? HELL YEA!!!!some of us who add some balance in the world. Is this their best work?? No. Is this a great album?? HELL YEA!!!!
B000003NA3|5.0|I was lucky enough to acquire a cheap 2nd hand copy of this set, on the first day of a vacation.  (Talk about recharging one's batteries.)<br /><br />Being a set of mostly posthumoulsy released live \\"takes,\\" OF COURSE there are passages of raw, unformed-ness, and ideas which were ignored in favor of the development and pursuance of other ideas...That's mostly what live modern jazz, even GREAT live modern jazz, is.  (Thomas Merton's COLD WAR LETTERS - the first of which dates from 7 days before the first of these VANGUARD sessions - are of the same kind of ground-breaking nature, have the same kind of mixture of developed and undeveloped ideas.)  This is an important critical point, because if you require exquisitely chiselled statements of Mozartean perfection, spread across a whole series of performances, well, then, modern jazz just ain't your idiom.  These 22 tracks have been judged as if they constituted some kind of artist-approved, \\"finished\\" work.  But they do not, because Trane only approved 5 of these 22 tracks for release during his lifetime.  Still, all of them are essential for understanding John Coltrane.<br /><br />These VILLAGE VANGUARD tapes, recorded November 1-5, 1961, document one of Trane's more incendiary, more overtly experimental phases. I see this as part of a recurring dual pattern in Trane's work:  an alternation between the digging of raw gems and the subsequent refining of those gems in the crucible of his art - each of these complimentary phases revealing different qualities of that particular \\"set\\" of gems. You have to go back to Trane's initial emergence on the scene to really see this.<br /><br />First, there is Trane's 1955-56 work with Miles Davis: intriguing, probing, yet rather raw and unformed.  (Check out the 1955 Miles/Trane \\"Little Melonae\\", or their 1956 \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" and \\"Sweet Sue\\"). This is followed by his more assured 1957 work with Thelonius Monk, and his concurrent Prestige and Blue Note debut sessions as a leader (\\"Goodbait,\\" \\"Blue Train,\\" \\"Moment's Notice,\\" et al). My theory is that being with a genius  as idiosyncratic as Monk not only forced Trane to sharpen his intuition as to what he himself was \\"about,\\" but even made him sound more \\"lucid\\" by comparison - and thus gave him a new confidence.  (Not to mention that during this pivotal year, Trane quit his heroin habit, cold turkey.)<br /><br />Then come the \\"paradoxical\\" years of 1958 through 1960.  They include Trane's second stint with Miles (MILESTONES, \\"Green Dolphin Street,\\" KIND OF BLUE), and the beginning of Trane as a \\"live\\" working leader of his own band (not merely the designated \\"leader\\" of studio-recorded albums, important though they have been up to this point).  What makes this phase so \\"paradoxical\\" is Trane's alternation between two seeming (but related) \\"scalar\\"  opposites...On the one hand,  his arpeggiated \\"sheets of sound,\\" imposed over lightning-fast harmonic \\"changes\\" which push the \\"coherence envelope\\" of Bop and Hard Bop to the breaking point (GIANT STEPS, et al)...On the other hand, the opening out into the less cluttered \\"spaces\\" of modal - as in  \\"scalar\\" - harmony (KIND OF BLUE, MY FAVORITE THINGS).  It is during these years, in the midst of this \\"crucible of alternation,\\" that John Coltrane finds his true Voice.  And I use the word \\"alternation\\" literally, because GIANT STEPS follows KIND OF BLUE by a matter of weeks.  But overall - as long as you understand \\"modal\\" as including, but not restricted to,  the designated Western \\"modes\\" (i.e., Dorian, Phrygian, Mixolydian, etc.) - it is the vast territory of modal harmony and \\"line\\" which will constitute John Coltrane's musical \\"Living Space,\\" almost to the very end.<br /><br />But by early November 1961, Trane is poised for a more overtly experimental \\"stretch\\"  - and a deeper exploration of the implications of that modal harmony and \\"line\\" which he had made so sweetly palatable in KIND OF BLUE and MY FAVORITE THINGS.  Among other things, thismeans substantial passages in which pianist McCoy Tyner's crystalline accompaniment is dispensed with for more exploratory (some would say \\"abstract-sounding\\") harmonic \\"digs.\\"  That is to say, you wouldn't play this stuff at a dinner party.<br /><br />Within a few weeks of Trane's VANGUARD stint (as you can hear in the LIVE TRANE set), he is performing some of these same works in Paris and Stockholm - already refining some of the lines and harmonies he has \\"dug up\\" at the VANGUARD.  (And so is Eric Dolphy, who has been part of Trane's working band since a month or so before the VANGUARD sessions).  This continuing \\"phase\\" will last through at least the end of 1964 and produce his most accessible mature work : BALLADS; COLTRANE; COLTRANE & ELLINGTON; COLTRANE & JOHNNY HARTMANN;  LIVE AT BIRDLAND; the fall 1962 & fall 1963 live European performances found in LIVE TRANE; CRESCENT and of course A LOVE SUPREME.<br /><br />Then, following the increasing spiritual awakening signalled by A LOVE SUPREME, the sessions of February and May 1965 take the listener into choppier but exciting waters (THE COLTRANE QUARTET PLAYS, \\"One Down, One Up,\\" \\"After the Crescent,\\" etc.)  Overt experimentation is once again the order of the day -  and as if to confirm this, in the midst of these sessions Coltrane even re-records \\"Neptune\\" / aka \\"Brasilia\\" from the '61 VANGUARD sessions.<br /><br />The struggle and foment of these sessions is followed by a more lucid \\"patch\\" which seems to emit a hard-won kind of peace:  the session of June 10, 1965 which includes \\"Suite\\" (a wilder, abbreviated kind  of LOVE SUPREME), the astounding \\"Transition\\" (perhaps Trane's single greatest recording, if I had to pick just one ) and \\"Welcome.\\"<br /><br />However, within a mere six days (June 16, 1965), Trane will record  \\"Living Space\\" and \\"Vigil\\" - a daring duet between Trane and drummer Elvin Jones  which anticipates the INTERTELLAR SPACE tracks of February 1967 (these are also sax-and-drum duets). This overtly experimental \\"mode\\" will last for the remainder of the Classic Coltrane Quartet's existence (i.e., through  September '65)- and for the rest of his life.  You cannot help wondering what Trane might have made of his final-phase \\"raw gems,\\" had he lived for another 5 years.  (The February 1967 \\"Venus\\" offers a tantalizing clue.)<br /><br />Now, having pushed the saxophone to its \\"natural\\" technical boundries and a bit beyond- constantly trying for notes higher than the instrument was designed to produce-  and yet still possessed of a relentlessly  exploratory spirit, I have always suspected that Trane would have benfitted from, or even mastered,  the emerging world of electronics and synthesizers.  (It is known that, in the final months of his life, he was practicing with the experimental prototype of an electronic \\"doubling\\" apparatus -  which enables a wind player to play multiple notes, simultaneously.)<br /><br />It is THIS kind of perspective which makes his death a gaping wound in the fabric of African-American improvisational music which has still not healed :  not only did his People, and Humanity, lose one of their greatest explorers, but perhaps the emerging electronic jazz idiom was denied the Great Creative Voice it never really had...At least, not in a way equivalent to what Trane did for purely 'acoustical' jazz.<br /><br />So regardless of some uneven passages- which in themselves are quite instructive - you could not go wrong by investing in this set. I share Mr. Grabowski's distaste for Coltrane-Cultish  \\"slush, mush & gush,\\" but I will risk it, here:  This is a generous, beautifully restored slice of bristling, no-holds-barred, relentlessy self-confrontational, creative LIFE. Is there ANYONE doing such things, to this extent,  in music, today? Or, if there were,  could we TOLERATE it?

B000063UR2|5.0|I have always loved this movie, it's the perfect type of fantasy movie. Tom cruise as a young man in shorts and chainmail and a wicked rendition of the devil played by Tim Curry. Totally wicked.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I have been in love with this film since I first saw it when I was 11 in 1982......I can't even count how many versions I have bought on VHS and DVD thru the last 20 years.  However, looking at this version is like actually going to see it in the movies back when it came out!!  SUPERB JOB!!!  The original score fits so well with the story, and, for once, its nice to see the most complete version of this film available - its just over 90 minutes.  So many other versions are between 54 and 81 minutes.  BUY THIS!  If you even remotely like this film, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I had forgotten how great this album is, hadn't heard the whole thing in years.  The re-mastered version sounds great & it's definitely worth having.    Led Zeppelin's How The West Was Won (a set of re-mastered live recordings that were released  in 2003 or 2004) is also great and worth having if you're a zep fan.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I have really been enjoying Madonna's new album. It rarely happens to buy an album and enjoy almost every song on it, without having to skip those songs that were made to fill in space...    Very contemporary and retro at the same time, high quality production and no less than what you would expect from Madonna, after the super Confessions album.    Great stuff, very Madonna, and more than great value for money!
B00008OWZC|5.0|These are a set of live recordings that were rediscovered in 2003 and re-mastered.  They sound fantastic and are a must-have for any zeppelin fan.  I've recently had  to start driving to work one day a week and these cds have made me look forward  to the ride (which is otherwise miserable).
B00000IHC7|5.0|I saw rory Gallagher in the early 1980's as a soldier in Europe, and he definitely rocked the house that night!! this allbum is a pure classic! I highly reccomend it to anyone that likes bluesy rock!!!
B000002JEV|5.0|This is another must-have for anyone who can't hear enough live Led Zeppelin.  This album seems a little less polished than the other live recordings; the tracks  are older and there are multiple versions of some of the classics.  There is nothing  on this I don't enjoy listening to.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is the best album ever. It truly helps you understand Bob Marley's want for the world and how he feels we can overcome strife, racism, and the hate that is in the world. Just press play and feel the overwhelming rythms, and captiving tones that only Bob Marley and The Wailers can give.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye does. If you know someone who loves music, but doesn't love Graduation, their issue is with the artist, not the art. The art cannot be denied. Kanye flat out makes great music. It's been a lot of years since I heard a hip hop song and went searching all over to find the original song that was sampled. This CD has several songs like that. Take a welcome break from tough guy posturing and drug sales and just enjoy music for a while. You won't be disappointed.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I usually refuse to see a film with Johnny Depp in the cast.  I truly enjoyed this film.  Never a fan of the musical either,  this production left me haunted.  The sub-text presses itself out in front and never lets you forget why \\"we are here,  where we are\\".  The sadness within each character is portrayed with greatness and talent.  Truly an entertaining film,  Carter is my favorite although.  A great film,  and what films should be:  entertaining and provocative.
B000OV170W|5.0|I am a new fan of Jodi Picoult books and really enjoyed this story for many reasons. To begin with, taking a topic such as genetic engineering and giving it a real-life (not sci-fi) take was wonderful. In Anna, we meet an old soul that was given life for the express purpose of saving her sister. In that way, the ending is wonderfully fitting--although it was not what I had expected. The tale was woven into a fabric of a total story from the threads of each character's point of view. If you are looking for a book club read or perhaps a novel for a young-adult/high school club, this is full of many topics for discussion. Loss, Anger, Fear; even teen angst, using designer genes, legal aspects/rights of patients and children, it's all here.
B000005JA8|5.0|In 1968 or thereabouts, as an impressionable and marginally-adjusted adolescent, I was handed a psychoactive substance of unknown origin (kids, don't try this at home)--and an hour later the hander of said substance was playing \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" on his dad's stereo.  I'm amused when I hear the so-called psychedelic music of the time--this bent my mind permanently and more truly fit the bill of \\"psychedelic\\" music, even though it was natural insanity without artificial enhancement, what he was doing.  Jefferson Airplane and suchlike were fine and entertaining, but Don Van Vliet was something else entirely.  I love Frank Zappa's control-booth glee re \\"The Blimp\\"--\\"it was perfect.\\"  It was.    If you've come this far, buy it.  It won't be something that you put on for background music several times a month, it will be kneeling at the altar of difficult music that accomplishes something that mere mortal music cannot.
B000059GEH|4.0|A wonderful classic from the 1950s about three women with the perfect plan for future happiness. To marry millionaires.  What they don't count on is in their search for a rich husband is finding true love and having to decide which they would rather marry for love or money.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|The plot is ludicrous at best but the important thing is this movie succeeds in advancing the Indiana Jones franchise and its mythos nicely. The movie is essentially one death-defying action sequence after another as the heroes and the villains race to solve the mystery of the crystal skull. At the end of the long amusement ride, the movie nicely ties up Harrison Ford's tenure as the hero while introducing Shia LaBeouf as a potential successor. Mr. Ford is as charismatic as ever stealing almost every scene, while Shia fulfills the youthful eyecandy factor quite well (although his character is as typically one-note as his roles in other movies). Cate Blanchett adds a bit of sexy mystique to a rather sterotypically written female villain. Other than that, it's not a memorable movie, but it is a sequel that fulfills its purpose.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are a lot of reviews already and basically if you dont want to read them all just buy the damn thing and if you like it maybe check out the bands history and the ultimate fate of its leader.    With this many positive and negative reviews(and a lot of haters too!) that should tell you this album is worth trying out, although you've proably already heard most of it.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I can't fathom who the target audience was for this film. 12 year old boys? No, that would be insulting 12 year old boys. Middle aged women who like to look at half naked men? No, that would be insulting my age group. Granted, I don't mind guys running around in capes and underwear but that stupid golden haze over everything just made them look weird. The main thing I wondered while watching this movie was were the people making it high? Maybe I would've liked it more if I'd smoked some of what they had.<br /><br />I'm all for interesting cinematography and artistic visuals, and at times this film had some, but the whole movie was so pretentious and self-absorbed that the attempts at being cool were laughable at best. The worst part was the redundant *poetic narration*. Did anyone else catch that nearly everytime the narrator spoke he ended with something like \\"And we will protect Sparta for every man, woman, child, infant, fetus, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin, step-cousin, half-cousin, quarter-cousin, brother in law, sister in law...\\" Ad nauseum.<br /><br />It takes talent to ruin a perfectly good premise, but in this case the film makers managed to. If nothing else, this movie is good for a laugh. But don't waste your hard earned money buying the DVD. Rent it for 4 bucks from Blockbuster and have yourself a good giggle.
B000VNMMQG|3.0|Amazing Grace is like a bookend to Spielberg's Amistad from the late '90s.  Both have their hearts totally in the right place, but the story just kind of moseys along, a good historical account told without a great deal of flair.  You know William Wilberforce is a rebel right away because he's the only one who doesn't wear a wig in Parliament.  He also scores 100 percent on the debate rejoinders that leave his opponents speechless and his supporters in stitches.  He suffers from colitis, but refuses to take laudanum.  He is, in short, a living saint, and about as interesting.  It doesn't help the movie that it is filmed in such constant near darkness, even in the interior or outdoors in daylight scenes, that it is sometimes difficult to recognize characters.  At the end of the movie I found myself wishing for less Wilberforce and more of John Newton, the slavetrader who found religion, renounced his past and years later wrote Amazing Grace.  He is played by Albert Finney in the film and there is way too little of him seen.
B000E9910W|5.0|Really great olddies. I love there music and it is because they had a video concert on HDTV that I ordered this CD. Great music with great sound.
0307265730|3.0|Despite being a prolific writer, Lahiri fails to offer something unique and new in her third book. All her stories are marked with predictability, repetition and sameness. Probably her imagination is limited to her own Bengali immigrant experience. Nevertheless, she has an innate ability to handle complex emotions and this sustains interest in her stories.
0452289963|5.0|Most of the principals here are not new or revolutionary, but the way they are presented is.  This book truly gave me new \\"tools\\" to use in my everyday life to feel and be more satisfied, joyous, and hopeful.  This man really has a gift for simple language to convey very enlightened information.  I believe he is the real deal, and this book is well worth reading!
1400082773|4.0|This is a terrific book; a great story written in beautiful prose. It sheds light on the inner strife and conflicts that Barack Obama faced growing up as a black person in America. Obama wrote this book when he wasn't in the limelight, so there is an element of openness and candidness that makes the story very appealing. Obama's strength of character, charisma and ability to generate hope prevail in these pages; and these are the very same traits that have contributed to his astounding success in the presidential race. I could never fully comprehend why Obama is usually termed as a 'uniter'; this memoir proves that Obama has an ability to transcend barriers of race, class and religion.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I saw this at the cinema when it came out and wasn't particularly impressed. However having picked the DVD cheap, and rewatched the film I have revised my opinion somewhat. This is actually rather clever, and mostly very entertaining, and would have got 3 and 1/2 stars if that was possible.<br /><br />The good things about it are the split screen effects, which recreate the comic book style well, and the story which has a little more depth to it than some comic book films. As for the Hulk himself he is a marvellous creation. For one thing he's much bigger than in the original comics, where he was maybe 7ft tall, in this I'd guess he's more like 20ft tall. Of course this doesn't help with the problem of how his trousers stay on!<br />Strangely for me the CGI effects seem to work better at home than when I saw it in the cinema. Maybe I was just expecting too much at the cinema.<br /><br />On the down side I really only have one criticsm and that is that at 2 hours and 10 mins its a little too long.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good with the Hulk Cam certainly being worth watching, as it gives you an entertaining insight into how the film was made and some of the problems of filming around a main character who doesn't exist.<br /><br />So overall at the right price this is well worth getting.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I like sci-fi movies with lots of special effects and excitement. I thought this movie would be great based on alot of the other reviews. This is a movie for sci-fi nerds. What a stupid and boring movie.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition)   I have the VHS & a recorded copy of Dirty Dancing.  Boy does this DVD do the movie justice. Also have a Cassette that I play in the car & CD in the House.  I can watch this movie over & over again & still cry, laugh & get up and dance.  The 2nd DVD of interviews & etc. is absolutely the greatest.  Patrick Swayze is the only male that could have pulled off the \\"Jimmy Dean\\" & \\"Soft Touch Stud\\" actor!  What an actor he is.  With Jennifer Grey as his Partner,  what could go wrong?  The Tribute to Jerry was superb as well.  It is a must for anyone that likes Motown - 60's Music & Dancing even if it isn't Dirty....  If you haven't seen this Movie shame on you, get it and enjoy.  How refreshing, no guns or drugs or killings...
B000MRAAJM|4.0|First off I had no problem popping this in my 60gig PS3 and watching it. Viewing it on my 42\\" Panasonic plasma 1080p blew me away. Our kids sat glued to the tv and completely enjoyed it. I am sure the quality of your viewing experience depends on your set up. I would absolutely recommend it.    Now for the packaging and BBC America. You know how you push the button in the middle of the Blu-ray disk and it pops out of the package? Well the first and last ones don't pop out easily. You really have to work at it. I started with disk one and pushed on the button and it wouldn't pop out, I tried again with no luck so I tried pushing on the button and grabbing the edge and lifting..and guess what...It cracked and would not play. I blamed the packaging and wrote BBC America. I got a response directing me to the correct people to contact. So I wrote them and never got a response. I wrote them again and still no response. They suck. So be very careful when removing these expensive disks from the packaging
B000002O4X|4.0|Of course you must have liked the movie to enjoy this CD.  My favorite classical music station played cuts from this CD and so I purchased it.  Most enjoyable.
B000002UB3|5.0|the best band that ever recorded on this planet has achieved musical genius on Abbey Road. there will never be a better band!!!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was one of the best television events in a very long time. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series. I take issue with the suggestion that Paul Giamatti was an incorrect choice for the role of John Adams - I thought that he was a brilliant choice. Who did these folks have in mind for a role like this, George Clooney??  I predict that JOHN ADAMS will clean up at this year's Emmys.
B00169XU8I|5.0|It is a great Album....What more can I say!?! Either you recognize Madonna's talent for new and appealing and fun pop music or you are one of those people who dislikes it just because it's Madonna and although you haven't heard it or listened to it with unbiased ears, she is and always has been a stunning commercial success, and therfore can't possibly be good....    This CD is effing great!
B0013L2EDQ|5.0|This was the first James Rollins book I have read and I loved it.  It was fast paced, action packed, and was hard to put down once I started it.  I will be picking up his other books to read in the order they were published as I devoured this one.
0805047905|5.0|Talk about a book that my son loved!!!!! After a few days he was reciting the book without looking at the pages. He is only 2.5 years old. He especially loves the part with the teacher and kids at the end. You gotta invest in this book. It is so worth it.
159102594X|3.0|I had heard glowing reviews of Joe Abercrombie's books, including comparisons to George R.R. Martin. The praise was largely unfounded. Although there's much to keep the reader engaged over these 500 pages, there are numerous shortcomings that consign the book to second-tier status.    The storyline is rather simplistic; although not predictable per se, it lacks the surprising and exciting twists that the best authors love to spring on their readers. The never-ending menagerie of incompetent and arrogant politicians, soldiers, leaders, etc. falls just short of believability. The magic is unspectacular, the climax truncated, and one of the protagonists (Glokta) never experiences personal danger.    On the bright side, the fight scenes are excellent, and Sand dan Glokta is a memorable and complex character. Other than that, this book has little to offer beyond diverting airplane fare. If you want dark tales of scheming politicians and hardened fighters, just watch CNN; at least then you'll be occasionally surprised.
0679809015|4.0|When we got this book my son was instantly drawn to flipping the flaps up to see what animal they were talking about. He really enjoyed this book. Great book with a great price.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Below is my original Review, I have to admit I only listned a couple of times. What turned it for me was hearing the stuff live on Austin City limits and I got a copy or the Stubbs shows at SXSW. This CD reminds me of a better version of Document with a couple of songs sprinkled from Reconing, Fables and Pagent. Ignore those giving this 1 or 2 stars. They are not paying attention. Great Album, I will be enjoying it all summer.    After reading the reviews early on Amazon I bought the new CD. I have all of R.E.M's studio releases and on first listen I liked a couple but further listening something really bothered me. I never liked Monster. It was like what a waste of guitar and it was a revertion back to Murmer, probably my least favorite R.E.M. CD. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a wall of sound. Heavy distortion on the guitar. What is the point? Play guitar Peter. We know you can. I do have to admit I like some of the cuts but when I'm making a mix CD of R.E.M. I start with Automatic and Out of Time and move backwards. I really have not listened to anything regular since Monster. Also something happened to Stipes voice. I don't know if he blew it out or what but he sings nothing like he did in the hey day. Just search up on YouTube for later stuff and you will hear what I am saying. I've been saying for the last 4 CD's that it will be the last one but I'm still holding out hope that there will be another Reconing or Fables or Document or Lifes Rich Pagent and heres hoping the next one will be better
B000JLSLZG|1.0|Okay..I have never claimed to be the brightest star in the sky! I bought this thinking it was a regular DVD and doesn't play on my player. Would need to buy the HD format player that is not being sold now. So be aware of your purchases. This is totally my own fault but don't want others to do the same 15.00 mistake.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|If your still in denial about how bad the state of America's health care is then I suggest you give this a viewing for it covers everything and makes you wonder if having socialized medicine would be such a \\"bad thing''. Watch it, it's informative and entertaining at the same time.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|Many people have said this and i'll say it too,\\"this isn't the real a7x\\"and if you just started listening to them don't judge okay i mean i really miss their old stuff heavy metalcore was the way to do it.I'll rate this album like city of evil it only has three to four songs that are good others sound cool but na i don't know,oh yeah skip the country song man i mean come on seriously?i know they wanted to experiment but jesus really?well at least it's half rock too.This also deserves more than three stars cause even tough i hated when they stop screaming(only a few screams in city of evil and this one but nothing brutal)they are pretty good muscicans even if you hate everything about them you have to admit they are good.So just download the songs or something but what i like about them is they still have heavy sounds but who knows how their next album will be.M shadows said the first two albums were gonna be half screaming and half singing and the other two just singing,and for their next album it might be something totally different it might even dissapoint people who like their new stuff,just saying or probably still sound like THE NEW A7X NOT THE REAL AVENGED SEVENFOLD!
0743496736|5.0|this book is amazing.  it displays every aspect of a teenagers mind in such raw ways.  you know when you watch a movie a second time you get more out of it? that how this book is. read it again. speaking of movies, this would make a great action/drama. seriously. think about it, jodi. =]
B000YEUUCK|4.0|This is a spectacular and immensely enjoyable concert, and seeing the Blu-Ray made me wish I could have been there live.  The staging is astonishing.      Importantly for shoppers living in Japan -- this was the first test-case for me of buying a \\"Region A\\" Blu-Ray disc and trying it on my local player in Tokyo, and it played flawlessly.  This is not the case with DVDs, but apparently we'll be able to enjoy American releases of Blu-Ray discs here.  Hooray for progress.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I think Madonna has forgotten her life-long fans! This album is extremely hip-hop and so different from her style that her fans feel disappointed! I understand that it's an album with a strong \\"American\\" flavour and rhythm, but outside the States, it's a real \\"hard candy\\" to swallow! In Europe we don't like this kind of music as much as in the States, I hope this album is only a revengeful goodbye to the Warner company and she returns to the previous rhythms immediately! Remember, Madonna: we're your fans, but we enjoy the music too!!!
0345501292|5.0|I have to say that the research involved in this book was intensive.  I am a pretty well-read fan of Lucas and Spielberg and I was still discovering cool snippets of information on every page.<br /><br />If you need a frame of reference for the amount of love put into the writing of this book you should look at Rinzler's [[ASIN:0345494768 The Making of Star Wars]], and Bouzereau's [[ASIN:0345409817 Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]].  If you liked those books, you will love this book too.<br /><br />If you are a fairweather fan, you may find the information overwhelming.  For those fans, this is not a fluff PR book put out by the marketing guys.<br /><br />This truly is as \\"definitive\\" a chronicle of the \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies as you can get.<br /><br />Last note...if you want this book in HARDCOVER, it is not available in North America.  However, the remedy is very simple...go to AMAZON UK to get it in hardcover.  Get it now while they are still available.  At the time I'm writing this, they've already sold out of their softcover versions.
B000W04S6U|5.0|The above title describes what you say while playing the game after listening to this CD. Pretty soon you'll be freaking out your buddies by mock conducting it and saying dun dun da-da-da-daaa dun to the tune. Besides that, the music is awesome! Great orchestral music in a great FPS (First Person Shooter for you non-gamers) If you're thinking \\"Video game music? There's a CD for that now?\\" You are the biggest n00b in history.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to buy all of John's Albums as they came out on vinyl. I agonized for years, decades really, over what cd's to buy, and just never got any of them. Finally I had to make a decision, and I picked this up. I think the selection of songs is very good, I like the order they are arranged in, and I really enjoy listening to these discs separately from start to finish. I think this compilation does an excellent presentation of all of the qualities that I have admired in his work. If you are looking for the one album to get, I think you will be very pleased with this choice. This is as good as a best of collection that I have ever heard from any artist or group. Enjoy!
B0000029AP|1.0|Wanted Aerosmith represented in my collection, but I think the live album might have been a better bet. This one just gathers dust.
0312330537|5.0|Another reviewer suggested that this is of a quality only seen every five years or so. I would go so far as to say that in 45 years of reading only one book comes to mind that might outrank this book as a piece of literature. That would be John Steinbeck's East of Eden. It's a different story from a different voice, but the quality of the prose, the continuity of the story, the depth of insight into what it means to be a human being, and presentation of ethical and moral dilemmas is simply incomparable. I have bought over a dozen copies and given them to people whom I treasure for no better reason than the joy of experiencing this book was just too good to hold to myself. So far I have read it three times in two years. There will always be two copies in my house. One to loan, knowing I won't get it back, and one to read when I need to be reassured that life is to be felt from the core.
B00164KYS2|1.0|The movie, I mean.    This is a bad, bad, bad, really bad movie.    I've got all the TV seasons of SATC at home on DVD, and I love them.  I'd heard bad things about the movie, but the wife wanted to see it, so I went along.    It was overwrought, predictable, mostly unhappy, snobby, and badly-written - to the point of toilet jokes.  Everything about this movie is heavy-handed.    Really, really awful.  And the awfulness goes on, and on, and on, and on, for *two*-*and*-*a*-*half* hours.  Two-and-a-half hours I'll never have again.  My God!  I thought I was going to have to chew my head off.
B0000085N4|3.0|This is probably The Cult's most highly regarded release. Many rock listeners turned to The Cult after hearing this. While there are some timeless tracks, others are just forgetable.     Used as The Cult's rise to stardom, Sonic Temple is the bands album for the recording industries behalf and not necessarily their own. The talent is there, obviously, and was contorted and arranged in a manner to sell records, which it did. \\"Sun King\\" starts this off on the right foot driving the beat home. \\"Medicine Train\\", the album's finale, is the most stripped song on the list and is mainly a heavy handed tune, harmonica and all, that makes you think that this wasn't done in the eighties. This is probably their best cut on this release.     \\"American Horse\\" is a powerful hard rocking slow ride with thundering power chords and Lead Gutarist Billy Duffy's frentic fretting is a breath of fresh air. Anthemesque in nature, this may be the best cut on this release. \\"Fire Woman\\", a quite catchy tune, can be regarded as a made for TV movie. The guys play the tune but don't seem to be presenting it FOR you which is a trademark of The Cult. Sticking in your head is what this track does best.     The power ballads of the decades metal caught on with \\"Edie (Caio Baby)\\", a tribute of sorts to Edie Sedgwick. The orchestral accompanyment conveys all that is a metal ballad. If this is for you, this would most likely fill your cup. If good rock is what your craving, this likely will have you throwing that cup out the window. \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\", a constant on the show setlists,(why?) \\"Automatic Blues\\", and \\"Soldier Blue\\", are considered filler for a release to get this band some damn airplay. \\"Wake Up Time For Freedom\\" can be considered what? I'm sure they'd love a do over with this one.      A less than inspiring effort is what I feel for this record, shallow in depth and the furthest thing from what The Cult is all about. Many people who believe this as The Cult's finest hour, I believe became fans of The Cult during this time and sees \\"Sonic Temple\\" as the benchmark of what they can do. Well that's okay. They're one of, if not the most, unique bands of our time. Try to categorize them. Go ahead.      There is a reason why there has never been another release similar to \\"Sonic Temple\\". This is not them. They saw what the mountaintop looked like, did what it takes to get and stay there, and knew for themselves that this is not what they were doing what they were doing for. Been there, done that. Good, back to business. That is why they are MY Cult since 1985. It's all about the music. I'd give this two stars but hey, they are The Cult.
0679805273|5.0|What a classic! And great for graduation. It also has a neat place to write a note in the front on the book for my students.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have never been so captivated by a movie before.  I have favorites but not like this one.  I cannot get enough of this movie.  I watch it over and over and over again.  I talk about it to anyone who will listen.    The imagination of the director, Julie Taymor, combined with the phenominal singing by the actors leaves you in awe.  It's a love story inspired by 33 Beatle songs set against the backdrop of the 1960s amid the turbulent years of anti-war protest, mind exploration and rock 'n roll, the film moves from the dockyards of Liverpool to the creative psychedelia of Greenwich Village, from the riot-torn streets of Detroit to the killing fields of Vietnam. It is a must see. Caution...you will be hooked.

1580088694|5.0|At the James Beard Awards in 2006, a huge, on-stage screen supplemented each presentation with images for the audience - images that illustrated themes within restaurants, foods, photos, and books. As a \\"foodie\\" who writes about beer, I was enchanted by a number of entries, including Hungry Planet: What the World Eats by Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio.<br /><br />So intense was this impression, that I was unable to leave the memory of this book at the Awards Ceremony. Two years later, the compulsion overtook me. Hungry Planet: What the World Eats stood on the shelf at my local bookshop, tempting me with what lived within the covers. This masterful display of \\"what the world eats,\\" is so alive that, as I read, I become a participant in every global society we pass through.<br /><br />Each chapter (organized by country) begins with a photograph of a \\"typical\\" family unit. The families are posed within their living quarters, surrounded by the food consumed in an average week. We feel as if we are peering into their personal lives. We know how much they spend on this food, (converted into US dollars). We see what they wear, how their family unit is structured, and what we would encounter in the marketplace where they shop. We are exposed to the sudden realization that some societies physically work for an entire lifetime at the meager chance for survival, so harsh are their living conditions. In other societies, the threat of obesity and diabetes looms with constancy, despite an affluence that, in theory, should be the key to longevity and health.<br /><br />The authors give us extraordinary details about foods in each land - how animals are slaughtered and preserved without refrigeration; the method used to patiently separate barley grains from sand; or the necessity of constantly hand-filling an animal trough with water, because the earth and the heat claim its own share. We imagine surviving on skewered scorpions, seahorses, cicadas and silkworm pupae; Spit-roasted cui (Guinea pig), narwhal skin, polar bear, and camel; Khova (partially caramelized condensed milk), mung beans, spiny lobster, and aiysh (porridge); espresso coffee, well water, jasmine tea, cocoa, and Ur-bock beer. We also contemplate the effect of preservatives, prepared foods, and fast-food franchises on our daily lives in the Western world.<br /><br />So fascinated was I with this voyeur's look into the personal eating habits within our fellow global societies, that I was unable to put this book down. As a documentary on global survival, it is superb. As a catalyst to our own self-examination, it is invaluable. It does not read like a novel, but is a rich tapestry that can be digested in bits and pieces - with leisure, or as an all-consuming, intellectual work.hal skin, polar bear, and camel; Khova (partially caramelized condensed milk), mung beans, spiny lobster, and aiysh (porridge); espresso coffee, well water, jasmine tea, cocoa, and Ur-bock beer.

B000002UAC|5.0|With the Beatles, one of the best collectable albums of the Beatles strongly recommended. I don't have that much to say, simple, the Mamas and the Papas of Pop and Rock music. The Beatles forever.    Cuban/French, Hector.
B000HEYVD6|5.0|I became a David Baldacci fan while reading The Winner. I don't remember what caused me to pick it up. I'd never read him before, and I guess I was looking for new authors. It didn't take me long to realize that this was a master story teller. I savored that book as one might savor a fine wine.    The Camel Club is another edge of your seat tale that takes the twists and turns that Baldacci weaves into the story so cleverly. He does something new this time, at least from the books I've read. He reveals some of the villains early in the story; he just doesn't reveal what they are planning to do. The concept is a fun change in his story telling.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|My favorite one. The sound is awesome and the line up of musicians is sensational!
B0014KD46W|5.0|Ever since he played with Spencer Davis Group (as a teenager), Winwood has been churning out consistent hits. No small feat for a career spanning over forty years. I believe \\"Nine Lives\\" is every bit as good as Steve's 80's album that gave us such hits as \\"Higher Love\\" and \\"Roll With It\\". Every song on the CD is a pleasure to hear.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter Season II was just as satisfying to me as the super, cool, Season 1.  Dexter's development of more 3 dimensional morality, and through this, a much more realistic character, made me enjoy him and the show just as much. Yeah he has more ambivalence (for a while) in this season.  But in the end, as was clear, but less convincingly so, in Season 1, he is not a true psychopath.<br />  And I love the often slapstick, sick-humor (e.g. between Deb and Lila, and of course, from Dex's sex-obsessed lab boss), which alternates with subtle understated very funny lines and and actions by Dex, Doakes, Lila(e.g. her hilarious paintings and sculptures), sister Deb, and...just about everyone.<br />  I differ with some reviewers who say the love interests in this Season so strain our credulity, that they become one of the flaws that make Season II not as good as Season I.  I tend to believe they are just as believable (or unbelievable) as the romantic tangles of  Season I...if we can believe Rita can possibly still let loser ex-hubby Paul through her front door, and that Deb can lose her usual right-on instincts about who's a BS artist vs. who's a legit guy, in her choice of lover in Season 1, surely we can believe Dex's and Angel's being led by their proverbial \\"male DNA\\" to hang with (and over) \\"vampire\\" girl in Season II!<br />  Some reviewers also think the lower numbers of vigilante executions by Dex in this season are another mark of its lower status compared with Season I. But while Dexter is diverted by several potential big threats to his cover, and thus away from keeping up his vigilante \\"count\\", those missions he does complete in Season II are developed more, with resulting greater heights of \\"dealing out justice\\" than those in Season I.  And each of the two grand finale, long-time coming, executions that complete Dex's quest in both I and II,deliver an equally satisfying punch in my mind!  Well, both seasons are great...and worth your time if like me, you come to love Dex, and to want to stroke his sexy boyish face, and root for him to find his way to a less tortured life!<br />  So Judge (or suspend judgment) for yourself, and watch this very satisfying \\"dark comedy\\"love Dex, and to want to stroke his sexy boyish face, and root for him to find his way to a less tortured life!     So Judge (or suspend judgment) for yourself, and watch this very satisfying \\"dark comedy\\"
B00164KYS2|5.0|I've read a couple of reviews for this movie that were not flattering - or even slightly positive.  Funny - they were both written by men!  If you loved the TV show (if you didn't - why go to the movie - you wouldn't 'get' it?), you will leave the theatre satisfied.  Satisfied that it was true to the characters; satisfied that it made you cry; satisfied that it made you laugh; and satisfied that you fell in love all over again with Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte.  I can't remember the last time I paid to see a movie more than once. I don't know that I ever have.  But I will be going back next week, and buying the DVD when it's available. This is a 'must see' for all 'Sex and the City' fans.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|If you like Captain Jack Harkness and Doctor Who, you will love Torchwood.  It airs after the watershed in England, so beware it's meant for a more mature audience (not for kids).  There is more violence, blood, and much more sexual content (including gay and lesbian content).  The series is based around Torchwood 3 in Cardiff, started by Captain Jack Harkness in order to find any alien technology and make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.  The characters are all interesting in their own unique way.  If you're not sure, buy an episode online somewhere and take a look.  It'd worth it.
0743298020|5.0|I had just finished reading Water for Elephants and was looking for another book to escape into.  I wanted a book about another time and place that was descriptive enough about the scenes that I could envision myself there, but not so descriptive that the plot gets lost among all the flowery language.  This book met and exceeded my expectations.  It did start off a little slow, but it was needed to set the story.  Once I got into about the 4th or 5th chapter, I had a hard time putting the book down.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I have never bought an R&B album before but I have been a Madonna fan for over twenty years.  I like this album, especially the track with Kanye West (Beat Goes On). It makes me want to dance and gets me pumped up for the day.   I liked her last album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, even more but it was more my style of music, very club, very dance.  Hard Candy has really grown on me. Madonna has made me really appreciate R&B.

B00139W3NE|2.0|As a fan of fantasy/action movie I had high hopes for this movie but actually fell asleep watching it. The story was the Achilles Heel of this movie. It was all over the place and just didn't hold together. An allstar cast could not pull this out. I am guessing this is yet another case where the movie does not do the book justice.    The two things that really stood out were some of the atmospheric special effects and the acting of Dakota, who was excellent as the young heroine.     But nothing can save a wandering story with lots of holes that leave way too many questions.
B00164KYS2|5.0|The series finale of the TV show \\"Sex and the City\\" was absolute perfection. Although I was very excited to see \\"Sex and the City: The Movie,\\" I didn't think it would be possible to top the way the series ended. The movie did not top the series, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a play-by-play of the film because I don't want to spoil the plot for everyone. Obviously, the movie picks up several years after the TV series left off. I understand why some critics are having a field day with this film. Yes, there are a few hokey moments in the movie, and there are some issues with the plot. Personally, even I got a bit irritated with Carrie during the movie. Exactly how much crap from Mr. Big is she willing to put up with in her lifetime?! However, all that aside, I am not writing this review from the point of view of a critic. I'm writing it as a die-hard \\"Sex and the City\\" fan. And the bottom line is, it was so great to see Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte together again that I'm willing to forgive all the little things that were wrong with the film. This movie made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me remember why \\"Sex and the City\\" is one of my favorite television shows of all time. Plus, it had a happy ending for everyone, which is exactly what we want for all of the girls.<br /><br />Fans of the HBO series will adore this movie, which is a wonderful tribute to friendships, fashion, and love. Based on those attributes, \\"Sex and the City: The Movie\\" is a five-star film all the way.
B000000HTL|4.0|This is my NEW review (it's a 5 star album now but amazon won't let me change the rating).    To me, if you like one Van Der Graaf album, you'll probably end up liking most of them (then again, I haven't heard the supposedly bad late 70's albums the band did so we won't count those).  The only thing that can separate one of their albums compared to the rest is whether the songwriting is a little bit better or a little bit worse.  For this album, I believe the songwriting is a bit improved.      From beginning to end, the lyrics are better than usual, and the vocal melodies are a tad more emotional and exciting.  Compared to Pawn Hearts, well, it's hard to match the quality of the songwriting on THAT album, but this album honestly isn't far behind.      In fact, you should probably go ahead and make sure you own BOTH albums, to experience a double shot of greatness.  Both albums are just very very good the entire way through.  Give yourself time to adjust to the lead singer though, because you might believe he comes off like a goofball with a strange vocal range the first couple times you hear him sing.      Favorite song?  Well, probably \\"Lost\\".  At 11 minutes it goes through a roller-coaster ride of lyrical emotions and puts colorful images in my mind, but if you go into the album familiar with the band you know that MOST of their songs do the same thing.  It's a really good song from a really good album.    and this is my OLD review.      Van Der Graaf Generator is a very talented band, both lyrically and musically (and VERY underrated atmospherically) but this album contains nothing we haven't already heard before.  Basically all their albums sound the same, and whether you like the bands style or not is completely up to you.      They are definitely a band that likes to focus more on lyrical themes over instrumental chops, which makes them *much* different from that of, say, Emerson, Lake & Palmer or Camel.    Overall, a great album (and a great band) but if youhave another album by Van Der Graaf Generator and enjoy it, don't go in expecting to be blown away with something that's much different from the album you already have.  Just expect more or less the same thing, with different lyrics, but with an identical mood and style.

0061367036|5.0|This book is great!!  It like having my own demon-hunting journal!! The way it is written is like a reference guide for demons, ghosts, monsters, and Indian curses.  Some used on the show, but many more not yet used.  It is entertaining and interesting!! An A+ book
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|Between the Project's groundbreaking 'Tales of Mystery' (1976) and the release of 'Turn of a Friendly Card' (1980), the arrival of punk and disco had changed the music scene out of all recognition, but the genius that was APP sailed on regardless, producing a succession of groundbreaking albums ('I Robot', 'Pyramid', 'Eve'). 'Friendly Card' was the best Project album to date, and many, myself included, rate this as the best of the lot.     Inspired by gambling - or perhaps, more broadly, by the relationship between chance and destiny - 'Friendly Card' is a beautifully crafted, inspired concept album where the total exceeds the sum of the parts. There are great individual contributions here - Ian Bairnson's guitar work and Chris Rainbow's sublime vocals, to name but two - but the overall cohension of the album is superb, under the inspired guidance of Parsons, Eric Woolfson and Andrew Powell.     Though including some catchy songs (such as 'Games People Play'), the heart of the album is the 'Turn of a Friendly Card' suite. When I first heard this, I felt it was a crowning achievement in the prog rock pantheon. It sounds just as good today.    The remastering of this version is excellent. To be sure, it's been done with a light and subtle touch, but it should be remembered that the sound quality of the original album was far ahead of the contemporary norm. Add in the excellent bonus material and you have a beautiful reissue of one of the truly great prog rock albums. Brilliant.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I've been a Madonna fan since her \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" years and have several of her CDs. Although I count \\"Immaculate Collection\\" and \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" as favorites, I must say this \\"Hard Candy\\" really left me disappointed.    I bought the CD anyway, but probably won't keep it for long. Other than \\"4 Minutes\\" and \\"Give it to Me,\\" the majority of the songs on this CD are overblown and overproduced.  The singing is uneven and there is just too much going on.  And, on the whole, the songs (lyrics, music) are just not good or pleasing to listen to. There is also a song called \\"She's Not Me\\" that is repetitive and so horrible that I can't sit through 5 seconds of it!    All in all, I give it 2 1/2 stars but only because of the 2 songs mentioned below. I hope Madonna's next effort will be a vast improvement over this one because compared to \\"Confessions....\\", this one is definitely a loser.
0345444051|5.0|This is an amazing, shocking book.  Like 2001 the movie(and it's inspiration-Clarke's  story \\"The Sentinel\\"), man encounters alien civilization in a way that is far more fascinating and original than the typical invasion story.  I don't won't to say too much.  That could ruin the story.  This might be the best science fiction book(and one of the best in general) I have ever read.   The only slight problem I see is that traces of anachronism are presented in the book-originally published in the 50's.  Clark tried to update it a bit 40 years later, but some of the age still shows.  That is only a minor concern.  The story is so powerful and excellent that one little dirt speck can't ruin its overall luster
0670018651|3.0|After hearing several interviews with the authors in support of \\"Perfumes a Guide\\", I gave it a look-see. Several reactions:  1. Maybe there's just something I'm not comprehending, but I don't get how these reviews can be anything but completely subjective. Yeah, I know, I read the authors' credentials, PhD in biophysics, \\"avid collector and expert\\" (whatever that entails), but I still don't get how this can boil down to anything other than \\"I like- I don't like.\\"  2. The terminology (even with a glossary in the back) is really almost incomprehensible.   3. The prose is beautiful and often quite funny in a snobby/ snotty way, but in the end, it was completely unhelpful in making me understand what a fragrance smells like or what I might like to wear.  4. The authors seem to be totally biased toward classic (and often French) fragrances such as Chanel and Guerlain, all of which smell very old fashioned and well, perfumey to me. Not something I would ever wear. My favorite fragrance in the world, on the other hand (which shall remain nameless), they condemn as \\"terrible\\" and \\"hideous\\". I suspect it's because it doesn't smell like their idea of a classic perfume. To me this is akin to only liking Beethoven and being unwilling to listen to Bernstein (let alone the Beatles).  So my recommendation is, get it from the library and skim through it for the fun of the writing. Don't take it at all seriously, and DON'T let it influence your very personal choices about how you smell!
1423101464|5.0|Riordan continues with his amazing ability to put ordinary, ADHD & dyslexic Percy Jackson into amazing scenarios only known through Greek Mythology. The book is action-packed from page 3... Percy continues his friendships and adventures- I can't wait for book 5!  Definitely a must for Potter fans~ it lives up to the same \\"everday misfit realizes his true potential and calling\\" storyline.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|John Hurt was the guy who had the Alien burst out of his chest in the original Alien movie.  In the Krystal Skull, John Hurt, playing Oxley, carries the crystal skull of the alien around for most of the movie.  Payback in an odd way.    This film did not have the humor of the first Indiana Jones movie, but it had plenty of action and noise.    It should play well on the home screen as well.
B00164KYS2|5.0|Didn't think I was going to like the movie, because I love the show, but it was awesome. I laughed and cried and the whole theatre seemed to just love it too. I can't wait to watch this over and over. It also made me realize how lucky I am to have loved my husband for the past twenty plus years. The \\"girls\\" were vibrant and the clothes delicious. First movie I really enjoyed in a long time.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Compared to the Colin Firth Jennifer Ehle version, this movie has better casting and better camera work. The problem is, of course, the duration. They try to fit into a 2 hour movie, and it just won't work. It doesn't capture the subtlety of many events, and the character building is ignored. However, if you haven't watched any other versions,you will love this one. I definitely love the casts, as they are more real, the age of the actors match the book, and Matthew McFadyen is a better cast for Darcy than Colin.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Jane Austen wrote  with a lot of words, but they sure translate into great movies. I liked this one and had just seen the PBS one and wanted to see if I still liked the older one as much... I do. The looks between the actors is priceless and the subtlies are fun to watch. Plus I love the use of Chopin's music.

B00171EO0I|5.0|I've read most of the reviews and as with any film they vary.  I personally loved this movie.  The cast was great!  It was a love story -- very bittersweet -- but the love the lead character had for his wife was unselfish in that he truly did understand her and believed in her enough to help her find her dreams and fulfil them.   It was a story of a mother and daughter gaining a better understanding of each other.  That was so touching.  It was a story of friends and how they are not always in the same place emotionally and that the friendship can survive the hurts with understanding.  It was a tear jerker --- but it was thought provoking too.  I will watch it again.
078322737X|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was in junior high and just recently ordered a copy of the DVD from Amazon. Believe me this is the movie that has stood the test of time and gets better every time you watch it. Ron Howard, Candy Clark, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams,and up and coming actor named Harrison Ford and a few others certainly made us go back into a time of innocence. So Where Were You in '62? American Graffiti brings back the memories! Well worth enjoying again and again!!
B0019O0W90|2.0|I did not expect this from Usher. I was sooo looking forward to buy the cd and it was quite a mistake. \\"Love in this club\\" original and remix are the only hit in the album. Usher did not take his time for this one.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|I love Indiana Jones and I wanted to love this movie, but it is so poorly written and so cheesy... I had heard the buzz that it wasn't great and I went in with low expectations... and for the first twenty minutes or so, I was pleasantly surprised... yes, there was way too much superfluous dialogue, but the tone was serious and I was hopeful... but then they're in South America and the pointless dialogue starts to bog down the action and I feel boredom creeping in... then they reach the Russian camp in the jungle which is where the wheels come off... boredom increases with the poor writing and then Karen Allen pops out of a tent, as a prisoner mind you, and may as well have waved at the camera... this sets the tone for the rest of the movie with stupid, bad sitcom dialogue, absolutely no suspense, no characterization, no character arch, and set pieces that give our hero nothing to do, but move around and wink at Shia. There's no emotional connection within this film at all, no danger, no pain, no wit... It's passing entertainment of the mediocre kind... the National Treasure movies are better then this... which isn't saying a whole lot, but they are better written and nothing can save a bad script... not hundreds of millons of dollars of amazing special effects, like some embarrassing prequel movies you might have seen...     This movie is such a wasted opportunity... a fantastic cast and Harrison Ford still looks amazing, but if he thinks this movie is good, he should retire. Lucas should have retired a long time ago and we (the generation that grew up loving his films and paying for his empire) will hate him for ruining are beloved heros and adventure films. Spielberg will be forgiven... where on earth was the man who made Minority Report, War of the Worlds and Munich? He obviously went along with George and he did like Last Crusade the best with it's cartoony action, undermining all suspense and coolness of our hero. At least Crusade had a decent script that didn't violate basic rules of screenwriting 101.     There are good ideas within in this film... It is a good premise and it could've been a great suspenseful tale about the missing link and aliens set in the atomic age of the fifties... but it never materializes... you'll here complaints that it shouldn't have been in the 50s and that there's too much CGI and that Shia is not Indy-like at all (he's quite good in this actually), but NOTHING will destroy a film more than bad writing. It took them 19 years to come up with this script, you think it would be note perfect, or perhaps at least fantastic, or maybe just good... but no, it's just bad... and it has you know who's hands all over it... Honestly, how stupid and untalented is George Lucas at this point? If you're going to make crappy films, please make them original and stop destroying past glories.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Very reminiscent of Traffic with Chris Wood on flute and saxophone with Stevie on the B3.
0452289963|5.0|I guess its all about \\"what you're looking for.\\"  Some reviewers had negative thoughts about the book - it was exactly what I was hoping for.  It doesn't center on any one religion and provides for insight and personal growth.  I think it is well worth reading.
B000HD1AEA|4.0|I had been looking for a CD by Sarah M. for quite awhile, but could not find what I wanted at the local stores.  This concert CD is just what I needed, and the convenience of buying it on-line and having it delivered to my mailbox made it even better.  It was perfect for listening to while getting my regular therapeutic  massage!!
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Would you or wouldn't you?    I really enjoyed this movie (although I found it did drag a little in some places), and it really gets you thinking.  Of course, you probably know the story line by now but it's something you have to see.  It was done well, and the acting wasn't bad; it was the moral delema that I found interesting.  As much as David and Dianna loved each other, when they were backed up against a wall with no money whatsoever, along comes John Gage to 'save the day'.  They had to know it wouldn't end well and even though they were fine for a while after the event, before long, the mistrust and regrets started up and eventually led them to go separate ways.  I won't give up the ending; I thought it ended well and almost wished it kept going to see how they lived after it all.  A really enjoyable film that I watch every now and then.  I really love Woody Harelson in this.  He was brilliant I thought and the best actor in this movie.  See it for yourself and I hope you enjoy it too.
B00164KYS2|4.0|Forgive the unimaginative title to this review--its an unforgivable line straight from the script--but I can't think of anything else to call my comments with regard to Michael Patrick King's \\"Sex and the City: the Movie.\\"  A reluctant fan of the show--I never did see all the episodes making up all six seasons--I regarded the series as an empowered woman's fairytale featuring four willing and able young women that seemed to achieve more orgasms over those fetching five-inch heeled shoes than the revolving door of men that seemed positioned confusingly either as the object of their obsessions or simply an unnecessary high caloric dessert after an extremely filling meal of life, liberty and the pursuit of designer labels.  Regardless of my preconceived notions `Sex and the City: the Movie\\" converts from small screen to big screen successfully with nary a hair out of place.  To those of us who have benchmarked time with the dissolution of relationships between friends and family members, the film drives home the very real point that the cohesion between two people is not only complicated and fragile, but also facilitated by its witnesses.  As a New Yorker living far away from my birthplace, I wished my lifelong friends were closer so that we, too, could enjoy intense moments of pain and joy like the four women in the film.<br /><br />Now doesn't that seem serious for something meant to be as light and airy as pink spun sugar purchased at a stand in Central Park?  Don't get me wrong:  the film dazzles with some of the craziest fashions ever assembled by Patricia Field--my personal favorite?  Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) in a big navy blue theme t-shirt and over the knee argyle socks--yuck!  The women apparently earn oodles of money - Samantha alone manages some of the plot's stickier financial snafus with just a whisk of her fairy godmother magic wand.  Fantasy does abound with the never-ending stream of high-ticket social events and invites that require appearing in a little more than that reserve `little black dress.' Dispersing cold cash for just one of those wildly colorful outfits alone in the current high-priced gas crisis would probably mean choking over fish heads and rice for an entire month for the average off-the-rack wearing bread-winner. However, no matter what these women don or what parties they attend--and I doubt they could be more spectacular or showy--the imperfectness of the human condition comes into cold play.  Are we ever really satisfied and do we know what really is important?<br /><br />In its splashy Carrie-narrated way, this intentionally silly film about New York and its ladies manages to hit a major home run.  Unexpectedly, Sarah Jessica Parker, with her elongated face that only Modigliani or Picasso could love, exhibits nuanced emotions that immediately connects her with the audience.  She's pencil thin and can wear all those kooky outfits with panache, but somehow she makes liking her and rooting for her effortless.  Are we jealous of her?  No, we empathize.  Even when she has it all, she doesn't have it all.  She may be in a different tax-bracket but her problems can be the theme in a country-western song. There's no pretty ribbon, shoe buckle or marathon-long closet that catches all the loose ends for her.  The morals faced in this tale are as old as those in Aesop's Fables: happiness may be ephemeral but it does recycle; catch it while you can and enjoy it. On a secondary level, the holistic synergy between the four friends is warmly palpable and more valuable than the $50K-plus diamond ring Samantha covets; they all have their own lives, yet marshal their limited time to constantly and sometimes unrealistically connect.  Somehow as horrendously formulaic as all this sounds, the film delivers its message while also working as an entertainment.<br /><br />Some reviewers have intimated that none of this materialistic focus on the likes of Louis Vuitton handbags and Manolo Blahnik shoes works afterthe terrorist attacks of September 11th.  This certainly is not true.  Superficial, it may be, but the film delivers a sense of a strong New York presence--so very important for this New Yorker who hasn't been home since 1999.<br /><br />The film's only real liability is in the way it conveys its sense of men.  As entrepreneur and savvy man-about-town `Big,' Chris Noth seems paralyzed--literally nauseated--unable to speak to a woman that he professes to know after ten years of being in an `adult' relationship.  Likewise, the other significant others appear as adjuncts to their uber-women, minding their own business, tongue-tied in the face of so much power.  Only Miranda's husband, Steve (David Eigenberg,) vibrates occasionally with a spark of egalitarian concern for a marriage tottering in the wasteland of domesticity.  We expect, of course, the beefcakes:  these are well appreciated--the inverse of the usual average male finds supermodel cinematic daydream.<br /><br />A lesser annoyance factor comes in the guise of a gutsy Girl Friday hired by Carrie to get her life back in ABC order.  Add to that the superficial weight comments directed at Samantha's visibly larger gut.  Oh well.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Designer labels and delightful New York events star in this continuation of the lives of the four sexually uninhibited icons of 21st century life.  The stories, infused with emotionally charged angst and frustration are certainly not recommended for anyone who did not like the television series of the same name. The romances here depicted reek with a certain amount of bewildered despair.  However, anyone who has `made it' in terms of career and financial security like the women in the film may ask that quintessential question, \\"Is that all there is?\\" and hear a resounding open-ended \\"Yes, but . . .\\" and roll with the punches.  Fun and fanciful, this sequel plays well in terms of fun, delivering what is expected with a little extra.  Love those shoes.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"of September 11th.

0756404746|5.0|I'm not a literary snob, I did enjoy the book immensely.  At first I was a little surprised at how the story was told but after a chapter or two I really got into it.  I think the character development in the book is simply outstanding and I found myself laughing hysterically at some of the things that happen.  Overall I find the story not only believable but riveting.  The Author has weaved magic, a seemingly unbelievable power into the story in such a way that makes is so easy to believe yet you can appreciate the difficulty of the characters mastering it.      Chapter after chapter you will not want to put the book down.  I can only hope the rest of the series is done as well as the first book.      Excellent.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Death at a Funeral takes you on a dark grin of a path when what can go wrong, does. Between the writing and the actors, the plot line can leave you with a sweet after taste. I found myself laughing at every corner and thinking, \\"Oh no, seriously?\\" Done perfectly in british style without the hollywood glamour.   I highly recommend this as well as many of my friends who asked if I had seen it yet, and stated, \\"You must see this film!\\"
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have bought 2 versions  of this cd i bought the regular version with 12 tracks and i bought the Circuit City Version with 2 bonus tracks including the song It's Only Love and a remix of the club hit I'm A Fire. I have seen alot of music released in the past few years by alot of artist that are just horrible and don't need to be even considered as music. Even this year in the pop/r&B there hasnt been really anything to catch the ear and make u listen other than madonna. But as for Donna Summer she has crossed many genre's with this cd. with great songs, Great lyrics  which is what the music industry needs today to show the \\"kids\\" what real music is. as Others have said Donna was the queen of disco had a few hits in the pop industry after disco.  But she proves she back and not going anywhere Except straight to the top of the charts. Its time for the jokers like Mariah to move out of the pallace cause the queen is back and here to stay.

B000N6TYLW|4.0|this show has been great from beginning till end, though you can tell difference without the palladinos. there are some memorable moments, a few good lines here and there, it's all very gilmore-like. just that in the end they tried to wrap up everything into last two episodes without letting things sink in: logan and rory's break up, rory's getting the job, meeting amanpour, lorelai and luke's back together..it's a good ending but it could be done better. lauren's performance has matured and it'll be so hard to shake off the lorelai gilmore character for many years to come!  it'd be awesome if there's a GG movie..
0805079831|5.0|I got this book for Christmas and have been reading on it ever since.  Unlike people who devoured the book, it has taken me some time to digest this.    Klein has an overarching theory about Shock doctrine and how shock--whether it be physical or psychological or economic--can create a vaccuum because the shocked person(s) are relatively in acute crisis and that allows for draconian measures to be instituted.  I suspect that people who do not like the book get hung up on this over-arching theory.  I have been slow to buy it and yet there is something there even if it does not attain the status of grand theory--an overarching idea that explains \\"everything\\".    And yet, I would urge readers to make peace with this relative flaw and just read the book.    There is something here.  She is not \\"all wrong\\".  I guess in my view of humanity, I would say that Frideman's followers have not been enthusiastic about embracing the pain they have inflicted.  Like many flawed people they have minimized and refused to look at the harms their theory inflicts.  (the same can be said for many theories of economics and other fields)  But she makes a case for it and it is real.    Now I am about two thirds of the way through the book, where I am reading the chapter about Corporatist government.  The revelations of this chapter are worth the price of the book and yet to read it in isolation probably won't get you there.  The book is an interelated whole. But here she asks some very important questions.  If (as she successfully posits) the interests of the government and the interest of big business get conflated and become one in the same, what are the incentives for peace?  Corollary questions can be asked:  what are the incentives for the government to take care of people as a whole?  To see a healthy nation?  To provide jobs that provide a just wage and a promise of a future?    In my own field I was stunned to go the CDC web page this winter in the midst of the flu season and to find, on a public information page about influenza, an unprecedented emphasis on anti-viral agents such as Tamiflu. The mainstay of public health approaches to influenza have been prevention in the form of the vaccine and self imposed quarantine and goodhandwashing, to name the highlights.  And here was this emphasis on getting in to your doctor to get Tamiflu at the first indication of influenza.      In this particular chapter, Klein talks about how, in an unprecedented way politicians have maintained their connections to business interests (sitting on boards, on the payroll, holding controlling stock interests) WHILE IN OFFICE.  Their policy choices have directly impacted ultimately their own bottom line and not unimpressively!  So it is a minor point in this chapter that VP CHeney sits on the board of the company that makes...Tamiflu!!!  Ta-da!  Business interests triumph and public health practice changes.  And believe me, Tamiflu is a drop in the bucket of the profits that Cheney and his ilk have seen from being in a position that allows individuals to create policy from which they ultimately profit. This should be concerning to anyone no matter on which end of the political spectrum they count themself.    Read the book.  Read it in little bits if that is all you can tolerate.  This lady has something important to say.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|After reading various reports of people leaving the cinema halfway through film due to nausea caused by the camcorder effect of the filming I pre-ordered this with some reluctance.However, I found it better than expected. Don`t get me wrong, it is very annoying to have the picture `thrown around 24/7 but after a while I didn`t notice it quite so much. It would have been so much better to have had `normal` footage but that would have taken away the idea of `caught on camera`.  The beginning where the characters are introduced is quite drawn out and I didn`t really care what happened to any of them as they were all annoying but once the film got started I quite enjoyed it. I found myself dying to see the `monster` up close and it didn`t really disappoint.Especially when near the end the one fellow looks around to see it looming over him after you thought it was dead.  I would have liked to see more made of landmarks being destroyed to get a better feeling of the carnage going on around the characters and their world crumpling around them.  Over-all an OK film but the hand held camera approach to filming did make viewing difficult.

B000YKE87W|5.0|I am writing this to support the rave reviews others have given this recital album as well as to express astonishment on the others who heavily criticized the disk.  I have heard Kaufmann once live earlier this year at the Met.  I must admit that he is the finest male voice (and actor) I have heard in 30 years--and that included some very fine singers.  Only a few like M. Alvarez, Hampson, Terfel are really in his league.  He may lack that Italianate squillo but he has the Germanic version of that wonderful Vickers \\"ping.\\"  He seemed very comortable in all the languanges and genres on this album.  Ironically he seemed no more comfortable in German that in Italian or French.  And I don't consider that criticism.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). Rated PG-13. Running Time: 2 hours, 02 mins.<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg. Written by George Lucas, Jeff Nathanson and David Koepp.<br /><br />It all started with the first film,<br /> [[ASIN:B000F21K66 Raiders of the Lost Ark - Full screen Version (1981)]] (1981).<br /> [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)]] (1984) (actually a prequel)<br /> [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)]] (1989)<br /><br />Followed by the tv series, Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992-93, 94-96)  [[ASIN:B000VDDDVE The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years]] (1992-93).<br />  Harrison Ford returned as &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; (at age 50) in the episode, &#34;Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues&#34; (1993-tv).<br /> It has been 19 years since the Last Crusade and finally a new &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; Adventure is made, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).<br />Director Steven Spielberg. Story by George Lucas, Jeff Nathanson. Screenplay by David Koepp.<br />  Harrison Ford is in great physical form as &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; and the action and adventure is all here.<br />  Karen Allen returns as &#34;Marion Ravenwood&#34; from her role in the first film, [[ASIN:B000F21K66 Raiders of the Lost Ark - Fullscreen Version (1981)]] (1981).<br />  The Cemetery Warriors are played by Nito Larioza and Ernie Reyes Jr. You may remember Ernie Reyes Jr. from his brief tv series, Sidekicks (1986-87).<br />  Ke Huy Quan (now Jonathan Ke Quan), &#34;Short Round&#34;, is now a martial artist--stunt coordinator, but not in this film.<br />  Originally it was planned for Mr. Quan, Kate Capshaw and John Rhys-Davies to make an appearance at the wedding, but I guess it didn't happen.<br />  Sean Connery turned down his chance to do a couple scenes in the film favoring retirement instead. They then added two actors, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent.<br />  I really enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford as &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; again. That was fun.<br />  What I did not like was the &#34;Crystal Skull&#34; artifact which looked like a cheap plastic thing with cellophane wrapping inside.  Steven Spielberg's obsession with aliens is prominent in this film and every other film Spielberg makes.<br />  Also in the cast: Ray Winstone, Cate Blanchett, Shia LaBeouf.<br />  The end of the trail and the final act of this film is a real disappointment to many long-time &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; fans.  The younger generation is probably saying, &#34;I don't get it, Daddy-O&#34;<br /><br />  The very last scene is kind of cute, but we are still yearning for more &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; adventure.<br /><br />  Option of language and subtitles: English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />  Thank goodness THX changed their old intro. I absolutely hated that old one with the very annoying organ sound that kept getting louder. Gets in the ears and makes people ill. Now they have a very nice, CGI flowery THX intro.

B00078XKDE|3.0|good album ... buy \\"Midnight Boom\\" if you're choosing between the two!<br />The sound is edgier and raw and they're honed in to a level that is near perfection.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Probably the best compendium of her work (and a great DVD too, as this gives the audience the chance to see Loreena's really outstanding musicians show off their 'stuff!'), this and 'Ancient Muse' are two of my favorite CD's!!  More!  More!!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|\\"Fallen\\" is a great album, and \\"The Open Door\\" picks up where it's predecessor left off.  A creative blend of melodic elements, grinding guitar, Amy Lee's piano work, stunning vocals and murky lyrics work very well to make the band's best effort to date.

B0013A1T8I|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW\\"!!!<br />Anyone who loves good storytelling and max animation should see this movie and guess what?<br />This is only part one so imagine the other 2 :)
B0016A2FFG|5.0|All I can say is AL GREEN is BACK and better than ever!  It's been a long time but so worth the wait!!!
B00004WEJZ|1.0|This is a poorly done kidnapping of the Bond franchise with an aging Sean Connery performing a shameless and unoriginal rip-off of the Thunderball plot.  I would be embarassed to have this in my collection.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|I started with \\"Red Roses For Me\\" as my first Pogues album.  Mistake (which is not to say it's a bad album).  I would say start with this one or \\"Rum, Sodomy & The Lash.\\"  At any rate, the Pogues are definitely worth hearing, and this album is definitely one you should have if you dig them.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|and you've got Donnie Darko in a nutshell. There is a reason why this DVD is now available for five dollars at WalMart, because the movie was a phase. Nothing in it really adds up, and it's stab at existentialism is pathetic.<br />It's an okay movie. It seems like most people either 'love it or hate it'...

B0018CWEYY|5.0|*Possible spoilers within.  Additionally, don't read this if you haven't seen the third season of \\"Lost.\\"*    \\"Lost\\" closed its third season with a moment of sheer creative brilliance.  There are moments that make one gasp.  It takes some craftiness to make these moments satisfying, but even as early as its first few scenes, \\"Lost\\" had secured itself as the supreme ruler of gasp moments.  Then there are moments that change one's perception of everything -- and these are few and far between.  But no moment has ever been quite like that final scene of \\"Lost\\"'s third season.  \\"Lost\\" is about a group of people who survive a plane crash and need to get off the bizarre island they've crashed on.  Yet in that series-altering, mind-boggling moment, we found out we were wrong.  The series wasn't about getting off the island.  It was about the island itself.  How did we know that?  Because the final scene was a flashforward.      And guess what?  THEY GET OFF THE ISLAND.    So where does the show go from here?    That brings us to Season Four.  \\"Lost\\" has always been a superb show, but within Season Four, it enters the ranks of the all-time television elite.  People, this is one of the finest seasons of television I have ever seen.  As ever, I'll try to convey some of the wonder I experienced watching this season within this review - but you really have to see it for yourself.    Last year ABC made a deal with the show's brains, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, that ensured they would be able to tell the entire \\"Lost\\" story.  That was a step forward for the TV biz, an industry which has been changing more and more as of late.  The deal states that \\"Lost\\" will air six seasons, with the final season airing in 2010.  Initially, each season would contain 16 episodes.  Then the WGA strike hit.  Due to the strike, the season wound up with 14 episodes; the remaining 2 episodes will wind up as the 17th episodes of Seasons Five and Six.  In the case of \\"Lost,\\" the strike was a great thing.  More so than any other season of the show, Season Four has a straight story to tell.  Over the season's 14 episodes, that story is told fast, vividly, and without a wasted moment.  We wouldn't have had that if the strike hadn't forced the writers to pack everything in a little.  Kudos to the WGA for that.    Speaking of storytelling, wow.  Joss Whedon is the greatest writer the television industry has ever seen, and I don't think even he could tell a story like this.  Lindelof and Cuse are among the most creative visionaries the medium has ever had.  They continue to take us to places that one could never imagine.  Most importantly, because they have now successfully planned many of the show's central storylines, one knows that they aren't just pulling these shocks out of a hat - it's all part of the plan.  The rest of the writers deserve a ton of credit as well.  They have done a fantastic job of fleshing out characters and storylines convincingly and naturally.  The show has no shortage of character development; as usual, one can expect to be pretty surprised at where some of these guys wind up and what they do by the season's end.  Above all else, though, \\"Lost\\" moves along its storylines at such a roaring pace that no series could hope to compare.  My one complaint about the WGA strike: certain topics which the writers had hoped to tackle by the season's end, like the curious case of Marvin Candle/Edgar Hallowax or the four-toed statue, are still wide open.  But that's a small complaint.  The writing hasn't been this good since Season One.    It's no surprise, then, that Season Four produced some of the series' finest episodes.  There isn't a bad episode in the season.  The fierce pace of the season ensures that the lesser episodes are only the ones where the pace lets up (though even then, the show is moving much faster than any other on TV).  The least of the bunch are the sixth and tenth episodes of the season, \\"The Other Woman\\" and \\"Something Nice Back Home,\\" respectively.  Every episode is so high in quality that each deserves to be mentioned here.  I won't do that.  What I will do is mention the cream of the crop: episode 5, \\"The Constant.\\"  If you haven't heard about it already, \\"The Constant\\" is the best episode of the entire show, as well as one of the finest episodes of television in history.  The storyline involves Desmond (the utterly magnificent Henry Ian Cusick) becoming unstuck in time (think \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\") and flashing between 2004 and 1996.  Desmond must find a way to become fastened to 2004 again before the strain of the time travel becomes too much and he dies.  The acting is extraodinary, the writing ingenious, and the directing -- something \\"Lost\\" gets too little attention for -- is absolutely top-notch.  \\"Time\\" magazine (how's that for ironic?) compared \\"The Constant\\" to \\"No Country for Old Men\\" in an attempt to figure out whether movies or television were superior.  They concluded that, thanks to pieces like \\"The Constant,\\" television was far superior.  Brother, if you haven't yet seen \\"The Constant,\\" you are in for one heck of a treat.  It is affecting and powerful in ways one would never have dreamt television could be before recent times.    Cusick, who should already have won an Emmy, is definitely eligible for one after his turn in that episode.  He's not alone, either.  The Emmys are about as sensible as the Oscars (\\"Buffy\\" never won a THING!), but come on -- if these actors don't win anything next time 'round, a serious crime will have been committed.  First up: Michael Emerson.  Emerson has been one of the show's greatest delights since his first appearance midway through Season Two.  He brings the marvelously weasely character of Ben Linus to life in a way that no other actor ever could.  His greatest turn is in the Ben-centric episode \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\" (which, by the way, is a series highlight).  Thanks to Emerson (and almost solely so), Ben is as fascinating as any character on television today.  There are moments when he is as cruel and evil as a human being could be, but somehow we understand him, and we understand that deep down, he is good.  He is fighting for what he believes, no matter the cost to anyone.  It's hard to explain this.    Easier to explain: the greatness of Matthew Fox.  Just how great is Matthew Fox?  Jack has had his ups and downs, but Fox has been consistently great.  This season, though, Fox hits an all-time high.  He is spectacular.  Desperate Island Jack only gives Fox so much to do, but Future Off-Island Jack opens all sorts of doors for Fox's acting.  Jack's torment is palpable.  You can taste it, you can see it.  It's heartbreaking.  It takes a truly talented actor to pull that off, especially considering that Off-Island Jack is the exact opposite of Island Jack, the version which Fox typically plays.    Honorable mentions: Naveen Andrews, who is fascinatingly complex in one of the season's most intriguing episodes, \\"The Economost.\\"  Yunjin Kim gets chances to shine in flash-forwards, and shine she does.  Evangeline Lilly does some of her best work on the show, particularly in the flash-forwards.  And last but certainly not least, Alan Dale is truly menacing as Charles Widmore.  Widmore was a charmingly Scrooge-ish character in his previous two appearances on the show, but this season we become aware of just how integral he is to the series' mythology.  Dale is a perfect fit for so deviously sophisticated a character.    But wait - there's more.  The members of Widmore's freighter team are each played by knockout actors.  Jeremy Davies, the greatest character actor in the business, is just incredible as the wacky, eccentric scientist Daniel Faraday.  Supporting him are Ken Leung as the wisecracking psychic Miles, who will no doubt prove important in the future, and Rebecca Mader as the mysterious Charlotte.  Jeff Fahey is a real pleasure as pilot Frank Lapidus, who may be the most humanistic character on the entire show.  Finally, Kevin Durand.  This guy is a killer.  Well, he's a killer actor, but his character is one of the most frightening, eerie, and downright nasty villains to hit the small screen.    The crew behind the camera does not get enough attention.  \\"Lost\\" is beautifully shot and the directing is the best on television.  Jack Bender, possibly the series' most-used director, is particularly great.  This season, though, it's Michael Giacchino who really shines.  Giacchino's music elevates television scoring into a place it hasn't been since Angelo Badalamenti composed the music for \\"Twin Peaks.\\"  His music truly enhances the series.  It can be ghastly, it can be tense, it can epic, and it can be emotional, but the one thing it is always is beautiful.  Just give him his Emmy now.    At the season's end, we still don't know where \\"Lost\\" will go next.  The three-part finale is a monumental affair, offering twists and turns that are astounding even by this series' high standards.  What it doesn't offer is much of a clue where the series is headed -- and as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing.  That will be important for keeping the show in our head as we endure the strenuous eight month wait for the series to return.  It's worth waiting for, though.  Television storytelling has rarely been so grandly-plotted or clearly-executed as in \\"Lost\\"'s spectacular fourth season.  Impeccable in every way, Season Four of \\"Lost\\" is the medium at its peak.  I cannot wait to see where it goes next.
0060853980|5.0|I love this book so much!  I reread bits of it all of the time.  Very British humor, but I'd have to say that's probably more Terry Pratchett's thing than it is Neil Gaiman's, I think.  I've read all of Terry Pratchett's books after I read Good Omens (yep, the \\"bird wearing down the mountain\\" bit was definitely Pratchett's), but have only read a couple of Gaiman's (Neverwhere and American Gods..... I'll stick to Pratchett, thanks).<br /><br />Death, my favorite Pratchett character, shows up in Good Omens, with some classic Death lines.<br /><br />Did I mention I love this book?
B00164KYS2|5.0|In the HBO drama, Carrie Bradshaw wrote a weekly column, and each show was the culmination of approximately one week's worth of revelations on the pros and cons of wanting it all. The show was not about the struggle to achieve financial independence for Carrie & her friends each already had their dream jobs, rather the show was about the love lives of successful, albeit single, thirty-something women. But the show was also more than that and it gained its massive following not just because it was entertaining and witty and clever about the way the spritely-but-wise Carrie juggled her career & romance goals, but because Carrie asked the kinds of questions that were on the minds of many other women. Plus, because it was often so frank and said out loud what had not been said out loud on tv before, the show was just plain fun. Even guys, on occasion, liked it. Carrie was not Godard, or Woody Allen, but she got women and couples talking and kept them talking (Godard and Woody Allen fans probably counted the show as a guilty pleasure). It was pop culture with just the right amount of substance to keep you entertained and interested in equal measures.<br /><br />  Also, the series was cleverly constructed so that Carrie, the writer, could view the life of the single woman and the issues that concerned her from four distinct angles/perspectives. Each character may have been asking the same or similar questions about striking the right balance between maintaining an independent identity and finding (and maintaining) a lasting romantic connection, but each character answered those questions in their own way, and no single answer was ever offered as the best or definitive one. The show was always about pursuing ideals & dreams but it was also always about acknowledging that not every girl & woman has an identical set of ideals & dreams, and so personal and professional \\"success\\" was something that each was compelled to work out for themselves. The sex itself may have been the allure that brought both sexes to the tv every Sunday night, but the series allowed women that gathered to watch the show together to laugh at things that real women laugh at and it allowed men an invaluable glimpse into the dynamics of the feminine mind/mystique, and all in a provocative way. The show examined existing social norms & standards & expectations, and, more importantly, it provided women with new norms & standards & expectations. It gave women new ways to read their lives and never settled on any one prescriptive method or model for how a girl or woman ought to think, act, look, or feel: its inclusiveness & openness were two of the shows greatest appeals & virtues. It validated a new kind of women, it made the career woman feel good about being a career women, and it made women feel powerful and smart and sexy and fun all at the same time. I must admit I did not watch every episode but the ones I did, sometimes reluctantly, watch, I enjoyed. The show was a guilty pleasure. \\"Guilty\\" because guys aren't supposed to like the show and I liked it. I like smart women and at least two of these women (Carrie and Miranda) were smart. And the other two (Samantha and Charlotte) sexy.<br /><br />Opening Night: Miami. My girlfriend bought tickets for this premiere several days ago so I was there on opening night in line in jeans with my girlfriend and a lot of other very well dressed women (many in groups of four) who'd just consumed a round or two of Cosmopolitans. I'm guessing I was the only straight guy in this very lively, very eager, very excitable line. This generation of women was raised on Madonna in high school and then graduated to Sex and the City in college. I was wondering when the next paradigm shift in the world of feminist/postfeminist pop culture would occur and what that might look like when the line, finally, began to move.<br /><br />Ok, the film: I will not spoil the film for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet, but I will say that thefilm does not mess with the formula that made the series a hit. Carrie & Samantha & Miranda & Charlotte are all in their 40's now (and Samantha even hits 50), but they all still look, well, as good as they did in their 30's so age is not an issue. The revelation of the film is that there are no revelations: the same concerns & questions that Carrie was asking in seasons one through six of the series are still on these characters minds and still remain unanswered; what has changed, albeit ever so slightly, is that each of the characters seems to have learned to live more comfortably with those  questions and concerns. I will not discuss the plot, but I will say that the main difference between the series and the film is that if the series was about women in the process of defining & empowering themselves in new ways in a more open era; the film is about women who have successfully defined and empowered themselves but are still capable of self-surprise and thus still required to make life-altering decisions. I won't discuss the plot so that you can experience those moments of self-surprise and those choices while watching the film. I will say that because this film does not try to offer any definitive resolutions for any of these character's lives (or the lives of girls & women in general), but instead shows that the continued re-examination of one's life and the continually renewed effort to invent new ways to live it is what keeps life interesting and dynamic, this translation of Sex & the City from the small to the big screen is an unqualified success.<br /><br />That, added to the fact that these women can find a way to laugh and have fun in the best of times as well as the worst of times (and theres plenty of both in this film), is yet another reason groups of women, couples, and singles will find this film immensely satisfying. Yes, theres a lot of fantasy (fashion, parties, shopping) that seems like a foreign language to some of us, but theres also a lot of raw emotion too and plenty that most of us can relate to. The fantasy element (especially the outlandish fashion) seems to turn some people off, but it functions in much the same way Carrie's wit functions: it is a way of coping, a way of transcending old ways of thinking/being, and it is a way of being inventive & original. All qualities that this series and film celebrate.<br /><br />The fans love it, but the critics, male and female, apparently aren't liking it (most critical reviews have been awarding the film approximately 2.5 out of 4.0). The critics may be right to pick at a few missteps but overall I think many of them are missing the point. Sex and the City is not pretending to be great cinema/art, the show never took itself that seriously nor does the film. Sex and the City was and is pop culture, but its pop culture that occasionally sneaks in some valuable social critique. The show and film have moments where the conspicuous consumption becomes annoying and these are the moments that seem grossly excessive and unproductive and wasteful, but also moments where the characters take control and creatively produce their lives. Some critics seem only to see the icing, and not the cake.<br /><br />So, will there be another movie? And, if so, what will these characters be doing in another five years?<br />*Charlotte will probably have a whole mess of kids, some adopted and some biological. Prep schools & cute outfits (for the children) will be her main concern for the next two decades. Being so perfect herself, she will probably have issues with the more rebellious of her brood.<br />*Samantha's mellow spell will not last. She will have to think of new and creative ways to manage her appetites. Once she loses her ability to attract young men with her own wiles, she may have to resort to renting them.<br />*Miranda will tire of any man that is not as dedicated to his career as she is to hers. She's yet to meet her match, but will meet someone who she enjoys being with more than she enjoys being with the girls.<br />*Carrie the independent with intimacy/commitment issues will not have an easy go of it with Big who has the exact same set of issues.

B000002GGU|5.0|I had this cassette when I was a teenager and recenlty I couldn't get one of the songs from the CD out of my head so I had to order it.  Liked the cassette in the 80s, love the CD 20+ years later.

0385339682|4.0|Warning: Spoilers (sort of)    This isn't Grisham's best work, but I still enjoyed it.  I thought he captured small town southern life perfectly and I couldn't help but adore Miss Callie.  However, for as much of the book is spent on her life, Callie is not very relevant to the central story.  The book's ending is kind of a downer.  I was left wanting to know what became of Willie.  Did he ever see Ginger again?  What happened to the Padgitts (aside from Danny)?
B00005B4GU|5.0|I remember listening to this album while reading at the library on cold winter days somewhere in upstate New York when the sun did not shine (which was often).  These songs have a haunted feel that perhaps matched my surroundings and my mood.  I agree that this album is maybe not right for every single occasion, but I feel I have to defend some songs on this album that have been pounded on by others.  In my opinion, this is one of the best albums in terms of interesting music that you can actually enjoy listening to.  I have listened to this album (as well as all of the other Radiohead albums) from start to finish many times, and for some reason, Amnesiac is the most fun.  As for the disjointed sound, who is bothered by this now? How many people have not gotten used to listening to a wide range of music on iPod shuffle mode? I am not one of those guys who defends avant-garde art because it's daring or clever.  I actually like these songs for what they are. In terms of favorites...  1.Life in a glass house--like being drunk in an old French wine bar on a wet night walking home with your crumpled hat and clinging to a telephone pole for support.  I was shocked to see other people don't like this song.  It gives me chills every time I hear it. But hey different strokes.  2.Pyramid song--driving through an unknown mountain town on a cold still night alone. I like how this song builds into that dreamy, melodic nowhereness.  3.You and whose army--I like how weak his voice sounds in contrast to his big words--overall it gives me the feel of a weak person reminding someone who is tormenting him that we are all weak and there is strength in numbers.  Do not mess with us!  4.Hunting bears--as a post-apocalyptic source of nutrition, bears will be hunted.  It will be a sad time.  This song will make it sadder.  5.Spinning plates--probably not good enough to listen to on repeat, or maybe not ever, what the hell, skip this one.  6.Knives out--sounds more like a Radiohead song than anything else on this album, and it's good, but not as good as some of the other songs on Amnesiac.  Anyhoo, if you don't like this album I can't help you.  It's not worth trying to change someone's opinion regarding music anyway.  (Have you ever tried to recommend something you are super excited about to someone  and they are like, eh..)  I feel that way about this album.  I'm just glad I have it and can listen to it on my headphones so as to not annoy those around me.
1400063515|4.0|A little long -- there's really a single concept here and while it's important to relate to various endeavors, we get the point. But it's always erudite and entertaining along the way. And the main point is pretty important.
B00164KYS2|5.0|I have been a devoted SATC fan for years, and I was excited about the movie, but I couldn't seem to banish the feeling of dread that kept lurking--you know, the dread you feel when you are afraid that something you loved has been ruined in its transition to the big screen?  Well, the dread is gone--SATC the movie lived up to my hopes and left me satisfied--and wanting to go back to see it again!<br /><br />There are definitely some things I would change--like including more storyline for the girls other than Carrie, and giving the guys (especially Harry, who I always loved) bigger parts--but overall the film does a good job of picking up where the series left off (albeit 4 years later) and recreating the chemistry between the four women.  And the movie deals honestly with topics like aging, marital problems, and breakups, as you would expect from SATC.<br /><br />I would encourage fans of the show to definitely see this movie.  Even if you've only seen the show a few times but you've enjoyed other \\"chick flicks\\" check this out--there is a handy montage at the beginning of the movie to get you up to speed.  I hope when the DVD is released they add extras--just like on the SATC boxed set!

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This collection of songs are so romantic and so fun.  They are the perfect selections for the movie.  Who knew, Hugh Grant can sing and so can Drew Barrymore. All the songs by Haley Bennett are fun and fresh.<br />All in all very good.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|There isn't anything to like about this movie.  Although numerous aquaintances liked this movie, there is very little comedy to this movie.  The high point comes when the family has to work push the van to get get started(why? the starter isn't broken; the clutch was).  After that, it is everyone for himself.  Nasty, cyanical, and unrewarding movie.  The grandfather taught his grandduaghter an obsence dance-- right!  Horrible movie.  Keep well away
B000002C2E|5.0|An absolutly INCEDIBLE album from the master himself. Music doesn't get sadder than this!  As you go through the album from start to finish, you will just become more and more depressed. I know that sounds like a bad thing but if your like me, and you find the sadder a song the more beautiful it is, then this album is for you; simple as that. Pure desperation, and confusion of a world that has left this old man behind. I keep coming back to this masterpiece.  Love Sick, Standing in the Doorway, Tryin' to Get to Heaven and Not Dark Yet are the real killers the last being my favourite off the album maybe my favourite Dylan song full stop?  In short, if you're a Dylan fan and you don't own this album BUY IT...  If your new to Dylan, and you're looking for a great place to start BUY IT... :)

B000NDJOO2|4.0|This is a strange movie.  It seems seamlessly made and expertly done, but there isn't anything there!  There aren't characters except for the son of one of the soldiers and he is the most moving person in the story.  The movie seems empty, probably because they never really talked about the war and the battle of Iwo Jima and it isn't really understood what the experience was like for them.  The extras are better than the movie but the documentary really provides a clue to the lack of humanness in the film.  The film isn't really told from the men's point of view but of the son and the men who made the film.  They didn't have the connection to the men who fought and never really connected to them themselves.  Watch Letter from Iwo Jima, that is a great film - truly for the ages.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is one of the best films I have ever seen. Brilliantly co-written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Requiem For A Dream does in fact attack you with a dramatic and remarkably candid portrayal of what a \\"drug\\" can mean to someone--and what that \\"drug\\" can do to someone. For Aronofsky, that drug could be watching television, taking diet pills or street drugs. This film is sure to have a deep emotional impact on you; and as a former social worker I could empathize with the struggles that the three or four main characters live through as they watch the destruction of their dreams because they used drugs to achieve their dreams.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet Sara Goldfarb, a lonely old widow in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn whose only pleasure seems to be watching a somewhat silly self-help show on television. Her son, Harry, is constantly hocking her television set for money--only what Sara doesn't know is that Harry uses the money to buy heroin for himself and cocaine for his girlfriend Marion. Harry is also friends with a drug dealer named Tyrone; and they scheme to buy and resell drugs on the street for fat profits. Unfortunately, just as others have noted, Harry and Tyrone often turn out to be their own best customers.<br /><br />Sara herself is on a mission. One day she gets a phone call stating that she has already won a spot on the self-help talk show-and when Sara can't fit into her prized red dress, a problem ensues. At first, Sara tried to diet; but this goes nowhere fast. A friend tells Sara about a doctor who is rather liberal with his prescription pad; and this doctor soon has Sara hooked on diet pills that eventually have her jumping around like TWO Mexican jumping beans.<br /><br />In order to make the tragedy of it all even more human and painful for some of us to watch, we see Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone all deteriorating as a result of their respective drug habits. It's not a pretty picture; but it's brilliantly acted and portrayed by the filmmakers.<br /><br />Of course, the plot can still go anywhere. What does eventually happen to Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone? Will any of them be able to kick their drug habits--and what becomes of any of them if they can't kick their habits? The last twenty minutes of the film give us a skillful expose of their new lives.<br /><br />The DVD has extras: there is a director's commentary with the \\"making of\\" featurette; and there are deleted scenes. The \\"anatomy of a scene\\" extra is also very well done.<br /><br />Overall, Requiem For A Dream is probably one of the very best films I have ever seen. It gives us an often painfully candid look at what drugs can do to people and how people must struggle to beat their addictions. I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to study this matter. Unfortunately, the film is so frank that some sensitive people will be uncomfortable; but I believe that they had to make the message strong because that is the only way to truly deal with the issues involved.makers.

B000003GBN|4.0|First off let me say that this is a fantastic recording with very good playing and interpretation.  I think that Reiner stands out as a Beethoven conductor as he lets the music play itself, essentially.  When I listen to Reiner's Beethoven I get the feeling that he sets the tempo and lets the music and orchestra play themselves; you could say his Beethoven is very \\"straight.\\"  None of his tempos are extremely slow or fast, though of course there are ones that are faster such as Zinman, Gardiner, and Haitink (LSO), but for the most part, Reiner's tempos are well thought out.  The two overtures that serve as filler are exceptional!  They are great by themselves and I have no quibble about them.  On to the symphonies.    No. 5 is very well played, but I feel that Reiner restrains the brass in some parts-mostly the horns.  I think that because of this some of the horn calls (first movement) come off as very well mannered, where as I feel they should not be so much (but not necessarily to the point of the Kleiber Vienna recording-those horns are simply off the charts; maybe too much power there!).  Also, some of the brass and woodwind parts sound very distant, but this is mostly due to the acoustics of the hall and the recording methods.  In fact, some parts sound especially cavernous, allowing some of the bass parts to be especially \\"boomy,\\" but this fact has nothing to do with Reiner's interpretation.  In the second movement, Reiner's interpretation is on the slow side, along with the third movement, but he somehow makes it work.  Beethoven played too slow tends to become dull and boring (in my opinion), but Reiner always keeps it moving, making each line as musical as possible.  There are no complaints in the fourth movement, except that some of notes of the theme are somewhat \\"clipped\\" by the brass, but this is a small complaint.    The Seventh symphony is very well played all the way through.  My only quibble is that the when the first theme of the Allegro section (movement one) is played, the horn part is nonexistant.  The strings are playing so loud that the horns are completely covered up!  I was frankly looking forward to this part (being one of the most famous horn licks), but it was sadly not there.  I couldn't hear it at all!  Besides this, the rest of the symphony, especially the last movement, is very good.      Verdict: Overall, this is a great disc.  These interpretations are of the old style, but they are very transparent and allow all the parts to be heard (sometimes hard to do with Beethoven) and make this recording worthwhile.  I just wish that Reiner would let the orchestra play with more abandon sometimes.  For other interpretations to add to your collection (along with this one), I would recommend Gardiner, Zinman (highly recommended), Kleiber, Haitink (LSO live), or Karajan with the Philharmonia (new release on EMI with mono sound but very highly recommended!).
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|I did not like this album and her music sounds simplistic and lost. In my view she should have produced a DANCE CD, because this is her business. Her two single are not that good and are kind of repetitive. It seems to me that Donna is trying the go to Madonna's path. Don't go there Donna. You are a real singer and you can sing: MADONNA CAN'T SINGER AND IS NOT A SINGER.

B0013FDM7E|3.0|Following in the apocalyptic tradition of `The Last Man on Earth' from '64 starring Vincent Price and `The Omega Man' from '71 starring Charlton Heston we now have the '07 release `I Am Legend' starring the always impressive Will Smith in the role of a man faced with the possibility of being the last human being on the face of the Earth.<br /><br />While I reward the film superior marks on the one hand for Will's performance, exceptional production values and the message imbued within the storyline delivered through the music and philosophy of Bob Marley, I also found the film very slow in unfolding. Once the action finally got into full swing and I was getting involved it abruptly ends, leaving me somewhat dissatisfied with the distinct feeling that something is missing.<br /><br />My Rating: `I Am Legend' is definitely worth a watch but I don't think it will stand up well to many repeat viewings; -3 ½ Stars-.

B0010X73ZG|2.0|Critically acclaimed writer and director Frank Darabont (\\"The Majestic\\") has proven himself quite adept when it comes to crafting hit feature films based upon some of author Stephen King's best-selling novels. His previous attempts, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\", resulted in great critical and commercial responses upon being released to theaters, and have found a special place in the hearts and minds of many movie fans along with becoming valued parts of many movie collections. So, when Darabont chose his next film to be based upon the novella \\"The Mist\\", yet again written by horror-master Stephen King, expectations were understandably high in regards to his undeniable talent for crafting such excellent films based on novels, a task not easily accomplished by even the most gifted of writers or directors. The downside to being as successful as Frank Darabont has been in his previous adaptations is that, eventually he's bound to make one that doesn't quite resonate as strongly with his audience. Well, it seems that that moment has finally arrived with the release of the box office disappointment, \\"The Mist\\", starring Thomas Jane (\\"The Punisher\\") and Marcia Gay Harden (\\"Mystic River\\").    \\"The Mist\\" is the story of a small New England town, that one seemingly normal day becomes immersed in this mysterious mist that appeared out of nowhere. At first the local townspeople believed the mist to be nothing out of the ordinary, that is, until one of their neighbors comes storming into the local supermarket scared to death and bleeding profusely from wounds he claimed occurred via creatures hidden within the mist. Now, these ordinary, everyday people must try to stand together to fight a series of extraordinary enemies, while trying to maintain their own sanity and keep their fears from tearing them apart.    I have enjoyed Frank Darabont's previous adaptations of Stephen King novels, I found the prison drama \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" to be a very solid drama, with incredible acting and storytelling on display; although I don't consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made as some might. Darabont's next effort was the death row drama \\"The Green Mile\\", which to me, was the more superior film of the two Stephen King adaptations that he had made thus far. So, like many moviegoers I believed that his next attempt \\"The Mist\\" would be just as good, if not better, than the previous two; however, I was wrong.    \\"The Mist\\" is, for the most part, an entertaining drama with some horror mixed in from time-to-time. The story is well-paced, featuring plenty of strong character development, and very sharp, well-written dialogue, which is not surprising given Frank Darabont's acclaimed skills as a screenwriter. Where the movie goes wrong, for me at least, is in the final 30 minutes or so of the film. When the people trapped in the supermarket begin to pick sides, it seems realistic to the point that in most cases any human being is going to try to find like-minded individuals in desperate times, such as those depicted in this film; however, I find it somewhat unbelievable that after only being trapped in the supermarket for a mere two days the people would snap so easily with common sense and rationale to the point they were willing to kill over their differences rather than finding a way to survive. Also, the final closing moments of the film were a little too disturbing for me, and essentially removed any sense of entertainment I had been feeling towards this movie, thus causing me to dislike this movie a great deal. I understand that the ending was probably realistic under such dire circumstances, although I would think had I been in those characters' shoes, I wouldn't have made such a rash, and as it turned out, rather unfortunate decision until it was clear that there was no hope left, and even then I'm not sure I would have gone with it. Some of you readers out there may disagree with me on that, and that's fine, but Iwould think you'd have to admit that their reasoning for taking the actions they took seemed a little impulsive, especially when the strange noise they heard wasn't like all the previous ones, which they previously had no problem waiting to discover just what was making the noise, so the fact that they gave such a knee-jerk reaction seemed out of character for each of them in the scene. I know I'm being quite vague about my dislikes for this film, but if you haven't seen the movie, and are still planning on viewing it, I don't want to ruin the specifics of what takes place in the closing moments.    The actors in \\"The Mist\\" were very talented group, each delivering very convincing, and believable performances given the strange circumstances occurring to the characters within the movie. Thomas Jane was a great choice to portray the loving father and impromptu leader of the trapped locals within the supermarket, as he created a very realistic character that was full of strong qualities mixed with a dose of arrogance that created a very palpable tension at times between him and some of his neighbors from the town. Marcia Gay Harden was surprisingly very convincing as the religious fanatic that feeds on the fears of her neighbors, seizing an opportunity to convert them to her beliefs of God, and isn't remotely bothered by the means in which she gains followers. The rest of the cast was comprised of various character actors, which I personally don't know the names of though I recognize them from other movies I've seen them in. Each of them did a wonderful job in bringing realism and a mostly neighborly quality to their characters. The downer to having such a solid cast in this movie is that when the craziness begins to set in around the halfway point in the film, some of the actors didn't really sell the change as convincingly as others and it really stood out in places, and was a bit of an annoyance for me.    One aspect of \\"The Mist\\" that surprised me the most was theexcellent CGI work done to create the monsters. Now, I wasn't surprised that the CGI was so well-crafted, I mean in this day of modern cinema there's just no excuse for bad CGI, but for me I didn't expect there to be all that much, if any, CGI to be used in the film. I wasn't aware that there were going to be monsters hidden in the mist, so that was a very welcome and enjoyable surprise. And kudos to the special effects department for creating such creepy, even somewhat disturbing, versions of our various insects and bugs; such as, spiders, flies, mosquitoes, and so on. I thought by including monsters with the mysterious mist (which may have been in the novella, I wouldn't know because I haven't read it) was a good way to separate this movie from \\"The Fog\\" which was a movie about another small town being plagued by a mysterious fog that brought death and despair to the townspeople.    \\"The Mist\\" was an entertaining drama/monster film for the first 90 minutes, but the last thirty minutes of the movie really brought the entire experience down for me. It's sad to have a movie that is so well-written, directed, and acted, be felled by somewhat unbelievable, and in some cases disturbing, plot twists to the point that I was glad when the credits rolled so I could soon begin erasing this movie from my mind. Some people will probably still enjoy \\"The Mist\\" regardless of the problems that plague the latter portion of the movie, but for me I'd rather watch the much better Stephen King adaptations from Frank Darabont, and put this one out of sight, and out of mind.    \\"The Mist\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00005JPNY|1.0|I am a devout, strict Roman Catholic, so this movie, and the others to follow in the series...along with the books that accompany it, are garbage to me.<br />The author has said that the theme is about killing God, so I would not support him even in the slightest way.
B000O9K9EY|5.0|I know that there are reviews for this book under other headings.  I first fell in love with the movie.  I can't get enough of it.  I watch the movie about 2 times a month.  Since I feel in love with the movie I decided to read the book and see how it was different/alike it was from the movie.  This is the greatest love story ever.  If you love the movie you won't be disappointed with the book. There are several differences between the 2.  I've only read the book once but do plan on reading it again very soon.  It's all about Mary Carson and her brother and his family that she brought to her sheep ranch in Australia from Ireland.  Even tho Meggie was only about 8 yrs old when she met Father Ralph for the first time she knew that she'd love him forever no matter what.  Father Ralph new that he'd love Meggie forever no matter what.  The story developes around their relationship through out their lives.  All I can really say is \\"READ IT\\".  You won't be disappointed.
B00164KYS2|4.0|I am an avid watcher of the Sex and The City show. I have seen every episode multiple times and own the DVD set as well. I was excited to watch the movie. While I can say I enjoyed the movie, I cannot say I loved it. The movie tried to cram too much into a two hour movie. Without giving too much away, there were some parts that happened without enough build up of the topic- such as with Samantha and Smith, or about Steve's mishap etc. I feel that I would have liked more background info of the issues at hand, and not just a bunch of different situations thrown into the mix. I do recommend this movie to others, and do think it was good and worthwhile for any Sex and The City fan. However, I felt a bit let down in the development of some of the characters situations. See it, enjoy it...and let's hope the next coming Sex and The City movie is not long from now!
B0018QCXGY|3.0|In January of 2008, audiences were filled with anticipation about a newly released film that most knew essentially nothing about, other than the fact that something or someone is rampaging across New York City in the new thriller from producer J.J. Abrams (\\"Mission: Impossible 3\\") called \\"Cloverfield\\". The high expectations surrounding this unknown film had been fed for quite some time via successful internet marketing campaigns that teased audiences about what may be coming soon to a theater near them. The film's release didn't disappoint, as soon-to-be fans arrived in droves to see what this mystery film was all about, delivering the 2008 box office year an incredible kick-start. Upon release of the film, word quickly spread that who or what was terrorizing New York was actually a gigantic monster and this film was being heralded as one of the most unique monster movies ever made. Now, \\"Cloverfield\\" has finally arrived on DVD and Blu-Ray, and after viewing the film, I find myself with a decidedly mixed feeling towards it.    \\"Cloverfield\\" focuses on a group of friends gathered together to say good-bye to one of their own as he prepares to leave for Japan to take on a new executive position at a successful company. However, their celebration is cut drastically short as explosions rock the city. Filled with fear, and an undeniable curiosity regarding what could have caused the explosions the friends head outside to see what they can discover. Unfortunately for them, and most New Yorkers, what they find is nothing short of the seemingly impossible, as a giant monster, as tall as the tallest skyscrapers, is rampaging through the city destroying everything in sight. Now, these friends are on the run for their lives as they try to find any place that is safe from the creature's wrath, all the while trying to find answers as to what the monster is and where it came from; however, no one, not even the military that is desperately trying to stop it, seems to have any cluewhatsoever.    Director Matt Reeves (TV's \\"Lost\\") chose a rather unique approach to ratcheting up the suspense-filled story of \\"Cloverfield\\" by opting for a significantly limited field of vision via the handheld camera that is used as the only visual source for the entire movie. The last time, that I can recall, this technique was done successfully was with the 1999 surprise horror hit, \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", so it was surprising to me that Reeves would opt for this same approach of using only one camera to tell the entire story. Many directors have chosen the handheld camera as their camera of choice, although usually utilizing more than one camera; a recent example would be director Paul Greengrass' chilling portrayal of the sad events of September 11th in the film \\"United 93\\". Whatever the reasons, the decision worked; even giving a person the feeling of being right there with the characters in certain scenes. In the end, audiences simply couldn't get enough of this movie, although the free-moving camera caused some audience members moments of discomfort due to motion-sickness, but even those instances would prove inconsequential in this film's massive success at the box office.    The story for \\"Cloverfield\\" was written by Drew Goddard, another of J.J. Abrams' crew on the hit TV show \\"Lost\\", apparently Abrams wanted to keep things in house for this movie, a decision that may have helped keep the details of the film surprisingly quiet all the way up to the film's release to theaters. Goddard crafted a very suspenseful monster movie that managed to work even without showing the monster in full view until the film's closing moments. By relying on the reactions of his characters, and the devastation being done to the surrounding environments, Drew Goddard along with his director's choice for only using one camera managed to keep tensions high and interest piqued from start to finish throughout the incredibly fast-moving, but disappointingly short running time. This is where part of my mixed feelings towards this movie stems from, an average running time for a movie is in the range of 90 minutes to two hours; however, \\"Cloverfield\\" clocks in at 1 hour and 13 minutes of actual screen time devoted to story (which I felt ripped off by), with an additional 11 minutes of credits (no joke) that scrawl painfully slow across the screen to bring the overall run time to 1 hour 24 minutes, although considering that to be the official run time seems like cheating to me. Not to mention the abrupt ending to the film left me feeling like the movie was incomplete, which was of course a calculated move on the filmmaker's part to attempt to guarantee a sequel would be necessary to this movie, even though the box office receipts turned out to be high enough that a sequel became a no-brainer early on.    Each member of the primary cast of \\"Cloverfield\\" now has the good fortune of having such a massive blockbuster on their résumé as their first official work in movies. Not bad for a bunch of newcomers, and for the most part each member deserves any good fortune that comes their way from this film, because most of them were surprisingly very good actors for not having much, if any, prior experience in film acting. The only truly disappointing member of the cast was the friend serving as the cameraman, and this was mostly because he was just so annoying with almost every line of dialogue he had throughout the movie, and sadly he was speaking in almost every scene because he was the character holding the camera for the duration. If the cameraman hadn't been such an annoying character, making surprisingly ridiculous comments that never helped matters in the desperate situation these friends have found themselves in, perhaps I would have enjoyed \\"Cloverfield\\" more definitively, instead of being so mixed on my thoughts of it.    \\"Cloverfield\\" is undoubtedly an entertaining monster film, and I would have to agree with the sentiment that it is possibly one of the best ever made; however, an extremely short running time along with too abrupt an ending, and an annoying cameraman/supporting character leaves me feeling somewhat cheated and unsatisfied by the experience.    \\"Cloverfield\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
0452289963|2.0|I am 1/4 finished with this book and I find my interest waning. Most of the information in this book is common sensical and dumbed down. I don't know exactly what I was hoping for, perhaps something with a human element rather than an analytical approach to psychology & spirituality. I hope it gets better, but the chances of me having the interest to finish this book are pretty slim. I tried listening to the webcast of the same title before buying the book, but it was uninteresting without having read the material.
0307387178|5.0|Please forgive me if this review is a little rambling. This is my first time as an Amazon reviewer, but several books I've been into recently really pushed me to start writing reviews, just so people won't miss out on great reads, and this is one of them. As a librarian, I see thousands of books every day, and normally, people's requests don't change my mind on what I like to read - historical fiction or historical romance. But after people began continuously asking for INTO THE WILD, I thought I might pick it up a try it myself.     The author, more widely known for his book INTO THIN AIR, tells the story of \\"Alexander SuperTramp\\", as he called himself, in a strange - but immensely satisfying - sequence of events. He begins with his death by probable starvation, then goes onto account how Alex, born in a well to-do family and actually named Chris, decided to eschew life as a college grad joining the business world for a life as a vagabond. His incredible journey across the US, his survival for a time in the wild, and his sad innocence make this book unputdownable. It's a wonderful read for anyone into survival (or not) stories, wilderness stories, or just great nonfiction.    Firmly Five Stars.

1400032717|5.0|I felt the book, written journal-style, with a Flowers for Algernon tone, was a sweet and a quick read.  It does get a bit wordy in a couple places, but it's towards the end and I felt safe skimming a couple sentences.
006088732X|5.0|I passed up and read the inside of this books flap several times before picking it up and actually reading it. I was totally put off by the cover, because frankly, I thought it looked silly. Even the title sounded completely ridiculous. But this just goes to show, never judge a book by its cover! I finally decided to give it a chance, and I was glad I did. I've actually read the book several times, because each time you read it, you pick up on something new, and catch something you might not have noticed the first time around. Its full of suspense, and will keep you up all night reading it, because you'll be wanting to know what will happen next, and the suspenseful, edge of your seat, wanting to know what will happen next feeling, will continue throughout the rest of the series, so don't forget to read the following novels as well!    The book is revolves around four high school girls: Aria, Hannah, emily, and Spencer, who were once best friends, but became distant from one another after the mysterious disappearance of their best friend Ali, who went missing during the summer after 7th grade. They all hold a terrible secret, having to do with the reason that Ali may be missing, along with their own personal secrets that no else knew....except for Ali that is. They all lead seperate lives, until they begin receiving mysterious text messages from a person only known as \\"A\\" in which she reveals all their deep, dark secrets, and uses these secrets to blackmail them. Could it be....is Ali back? Or is someone else onto them? Someone who saw them the night that changed their lives forever...    I recommend this to pretty much everyone to read, because it is highly enjoyable, but I especially recommend this book for those of you who are fans of the Gossip Girl series because this series reminds me of that one. Granted, its completely different in some ways, but it has the same air of mystery, seeing as how the person described as \\"A\\" is annoymous, just as the mysterious blogger in \\"Gossip Girl\\" who always knows everything about everyone.  So its pretty much a darker, more twisted verison of \\"gossip girl\\".
B000SZLSB2|1.0|Although I loved James Blunt's first CD, this one lacks substance and is, I think, sort of a downer.  I find myself turning it off after only listening to the first half.  I keep trying to give it another chance, but it isn't his best.  (I DID listen to the whole CD a couple of times by the way.)
B000002IGV|4.0|First off let me say that this is a good album. Such songs like, were not gonna take it, i wanna rock, stay hungry, etc. Are all great songs. Now a days though twisted sister is not going on any more. Other good metal albums are like quiet riot
B00005214X|5.0|From what I've been able to understand,Harrison released this immediately upon his departure from The Beatles. These are the songs he had been sitting on during the denouement of the band,and when the band finally split,out came these songs. This shows that George,in addition to being \\"the spiritual one\\" was also a very talented one. THere are a few \\"B Sides\\" (\\"From Behind that Locked Door\\", \\"It's Johnny's Birthday\\") but there are a lot of strong songs here too. Check out \\"Wah Wah\\" (my 4 year old son's favorite).    All in all,The Dark Horse did good for his first time out!
B000YAA68C|4.0|I am absolutely in love with this movie, but I've found that if I buy a DVD from Amazon.com, instead of a used one from someone else, they don't have the movie covers on the disc. I don't know if this is something Amazon does, but I would love to be able to tell what movie disc I'm looking at without having to squint at the small print in the center. Great movie though- you should get it.
B000RZGFYS|1.0|all the songs sound the same plus they are pretty evil of a band(just look at that album names) plus the songs just have fast beats and fast guitar and thats it... and it has some singer growling really instead of singing. dont buy this album
B00065DWCW|5.0|Britney rocks and she proves the haters wrong time and time again and they still hate. Britney is a true lving legend she will be around forever. All her classic singles are here except Don't let Me Be the Last to Know. I am not sure why it's missing but it is. The Boys Coed REmix and the Darkchild Remix of overprotected are both here and they could only be found on import copies of the singles. Also features the new single My Prerogative, a Bobby Brown remake and two unreleased tracks Do Something, and I've just Begun Having My fun. This set proves that Brit is a viable entertainer worth every penny.<br />If you are going to buy this disc I would recommend the IMport version that Features Don't let me be the last to know, I love Rock n Roll, and Born to make you happy, or the limited edition version which features a bonus disc of remixes. Either way you will not be dissapointed. Go ahead and buy both you copies you wont regret it.
B00007LTIG|5.0|A great debut album. And is another one of those classic 1967 albums. The Grateful Dead were one of the first acid rock bands of all time. Some key tracks on here are, golden road, cream puff war, viola lee blues etc. All in all a great album and you should buy it today
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings to the screen Hollywood's most well known archaeologist in his latest adventure.  Twenty years after his legendary run-ins with the Germans while on archaeological digs, things have changed quite a bit with WWII coming and going, and the Soviets having made their appearance. So it is during the Cold War era that Indiana Jones embarks on a journey to Peru, South America in an effort to uncover the secret of a mysterious crystal skull which legend has it holds the secret to unprecedented power.   Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Karen Allen, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances very well, though, Shia LaBeouf was a poor choice for the role of Mutt Williams (just as he had been in Transformers).  Regarding the specifics, Harrison Ford's age really shows and naturally enough he is rather frail compared to his old self which is difficult to swallow. Moreover, it is not that easy to adjust to a post-WWII setting without the Germans around and with 1950's fashion and Rock and Roll all about. Finally, laying the foundation for a younger adventurer to replace Indy is a good thing in keeping the saga going and quite sad for seeing the end of an era approaching.   The acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire movie.  In short, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, though it will probably produce a lot of nostalgia for the younger, more sturdy, Indiana Jones that we have grown to know and love, and the years gone by. 4.5 Stars
B0000067L2|5.0|Realesed in the summer of 1967 it demonstrates Cream's expirementing with acid rock. All 11 tracks on here are great and its good old fashioned 60s rock music. Some key tracks on here are, strange brew, SWALBLR, tales of brave ulysses, etc. It also has one of the first albums with the wah-wah pedal on it. All in all a great buy and you should buy it today along with all of the other great 1967 albums. here are some classic 60s albums that you should buy,<br /> Grateful Dead(debut album)<br /> Jefferson Airplane Surrealistic Pillow<br /> Jimi Hendrix Are You Expereinced<br /> Pink Floyd The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn<br /> The Beach Boys Pet Sounds<br /> Cream Disreali Gears<br /> The Doors(self titled debut album)<br /> Jimi Hendrix Axis Bold As Love<br /> Bob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited<br /> Jimi Hendrix Electirc Ladyland<br /> Grateful Dead Anthem Of The Sun<br /> Iron Butterfly In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<br />etc.
B00164KYS2|5.0|Saw the movie today, absolutely LOVED it !!!! as a fan of the series, (have been re-watching all 6 seasons for the past few weeks to get ready for the movie)I have to say it has stayed true to the characters and the story was fantastic ! I laughed, I cryed, Michael Patrick King is an absolute genius ! I hope to see at least 2 or 3 more movies and am looking forward to seeing this movie a number of times. Thanks again Michael Patrick King
B00130UFY2|4.0|Just and Ok follow-up movie. It was nice to have some closure. Action shots  were choppy to make up for Matt Damon being out of shape as compared to the original series. Nice movie for a Friday or Saturday night at home. Would make little sense to anyone not familiar with the past movies.
B0013XS8A2|3.0|I like Oldfield, I have all of his albums including this one, but \\"Music Of The Spheres\\" is just more of the same. Oldfield has been spinning his creative wheels for over a decade now. I'd say the last Oldfield album I really enjoyed was 1994's \\"The Songs Of Distant Earth\\". Since then, Oldfield has been doing variations on the same themes with \\"Music Of The Spheres\\" being pleasant, but as another reviewer said, not innovative.<br /><br />Yes, Oldfield utilizes real instruments and an orchestra and opera singer, but when it's all said and done it's not memorable. Some tracks standout more than others, and for me that moment comes in the middle of the album with \\"On My Heart\\" and \\"Aurora\\". I know I'm going to be lambasted for what I'm going to say next, but I'd really like to hear Oldfield utilize singers again and make more pop albums like \\"Five Miles Out\\", \\"Crises\\", \\"Discovery\\", \\"Islands\\" and \\"Earth Moving\\" as much as many fans would gasp in horror. It's been almost 20 years since he tried his hand at making a pop album, and I still think Oldfield excels at making good pop songs.<br /><br />So, \\"Music Of The Spheres\\" is merely a rote exercise. Pleasant, inoffensive, average Oldfield. It did not excite me as some of his past work has. Good, but not above average or great.
B00174TKGI|3.0|An Ok movie for a Saturday night at home. Denzel has been better. Very slow movie, almost fell asleep a couple of times.
B000065BPB|5.0|Having produced music for a number of years (on and off) I finally committed to finding the ideal headphone for both monitoring my work and simply enjoying the music of others.    I listen to a wide range of musical styles, but nearly everything I listen to has high production values as a common thread.      Many headphones that I tried along the way sounded either bass-heavy or absent of bass altoghether with nothing but high end and mid-range.  Open air headphones had too much bleed, making it tough to listen without annoying others with the sound and closed ear headphones tended to sound \\"canned\\" (no pun intended).  Noise reducing headphones had various hisses and noise (in place of outside noise).     After reading many reviews on Amazon, I decided to spring for the 280's and much to might delight, they were exactly what I was searching for.  I will admit that they fit quite snug, and I *have a small head*... however, I don't mind it and the around-the-ear cushions do make them comfortable.      As a result of these headphones, my produced music isn't bass-heavy (the result of my compensation for having headphones which were sloped off in the bass range), and the music I own is much more enjoyable.   I am very happy with this purchase.  I can imagine however, that if my head was larger, aside from looking better in hats, I wouldn't enjoy these headphones nearly as much.  So... big headed folks, we finally have an advantage over you.  (which I suppose only lasts until Sennheiser re-creates the 280 for larger heads.)     Oh, and a word about price... If someone had told me that I could get this kind of sound for around $100... I wouldn't have believe them.  Hearing is believing.  It's amazing to me that Sennheiser could do this.  If I wore hats, I'd tip mine to german engineering.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|First of all I love Miss Donna Summer and the cd is wonderful just like the title of the cd CRAYONS each song is a color........
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. A story of love and acceptance and sadness. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Saw Jersey Boys - would see it again - loved it - the CD Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons was the greatest.
0152023984|3.0|This translation removes so much of what makes \\"The Little Prince\\" such a lovely story. Read the Katherine Woods translation if you can find it. She manages to keep the poetry and the French construction in a way which makes the story much more dear.<br /><br />For example, from the first page - \\"I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.\\" is hers, vs. \\"In those days I thought a lot about jungle adventures...\\" from Howard.
1423101464|5.0|If you like reading books that don't bore you to death then Battle of the Labyrinth is just the book to read, especially if your into mythology. Full of action packed fun and even a bit of humor here and there Battle of the Labryinth picks ups a couple of months after \\"Titan's Curse\\" when Percy goes to his freshman orientation and it goes terribly bad. But I won't say anymore. So if you like books with action and a cliff hanger the Battle of the Labyrinth is the book you should read. I also recomend books 1-3.
B00000255F|5.0|\\"Born to Run\\" was the hallmark of my generation.  I first had the vinyl and believe me that record served its time on my poor turntable that needed 41 cents to prevent the tonearm from skating. As soon as I could afford a cassette deck, I bought the tape. \\"Born to Run\\" was the first CD I bought when I moved to a CD player in the early 80's.<br /><br />My CD disappeared in my recent move and when I found out, I had to buy this CD again. If I could find the 24Kt version, I'd get that one instead.  This is one of those CDs that I'd call 'essential'.  Definitely one of the 100 I'd take to the desert island with me.  Every song is a classic.  I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Boss with the E Street Band in Atlanta, GA and most of the material from this CD was on his setlist--speaks volumes for this recording when he's got so many years to span live.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Guess this is a movie for die hard fans!  Great quality and sound!  Plays well in my ps3
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|So, I was very excited about this release, that is until I actually heard it.  While not a bad album, I cannot figure out why/how it took so long to come out?  This is not the Portishead of old, in fact, I can just barely tell it is Portishead at all.  Interesting to listen to, but musically, melodically lacking on most fronts.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I teach American History to lower level high school students and this series is a fantastic tool when discussing WWII.  I watched the series on HBO and the extra details on the DVDs are worth the money.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is possibly the greatest cd of all time. And to all those that say it is the greatest, you are correct. The delivery and beats from some top named producer really ends a massive hadn to NaS' story telling and extremely tight flow. Definitely a must have for all Hip Hop fans.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Donna Summer has long been typecasted and forced to remain within the ever-expanding domain and reign of dance music in all its incarnations since her arrival in the middle seventies with limited success.<br /><br />In doubt? She's been awarded grammies in four distinct, and quite different, categories: Dance, Gospel, R&B, and Rock. The legendary singer-songwriter has always been as eclectic as her latest release. However, it seems that only a handful have been able to notice.<br /><br />\\"Crayons\\" is no different than say, \\"Bad Girls\\" or \\"Cats Without Claws.\\" This new album is nothing short of a powerful and rich collection of songs ranging from the bossa-nova sounds of \\"Driving Down Brazil\\" to the inspirational opening track \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" and, from the reflection of \\"Be Myself Again\\" to the self-affirmation of the Number One Dance Hit \\"I'm A Fire.\\"<br /><br />Many already claim that Summer's \\"new\\" sound is as fresh as the latest hits on today's music scene. Her music and songs have been ever as fresh and ground-breaking because she's a true and remarkable artist and an innovator: often imitated, never duplicated.<br /><br />No sampling or remixing required: Try not to nod your head or move your feet when you hear the opening lines of \\"Mr. Music\\" and self-title track \\"Crayons.\\" Same goes for the aforementioned lead single \\"I'm A Fire.\\" For those fortunate enough to have bought the Circuit City-Exclusive edition of Summer's studio album of new material in 17 years, look no further than bonus track: \\"It's Only Love\\" (arguably one of, if not, the best track in the entire album).<br /><br />How could Donna not sound as \\"fresh\\" and \\"new\\" today as she did when she first captured our attention more than 30 years ago? She not only created but also defined the very bluerprints that many have followed and continue to follow to this day.<br /><br />\\"Crayons\\" is more than a worthy addition to a very influential and amazing body of work. She certainly \\"has worked hard\\" on this album and it shows. Her dedicating it to her fans is \\"like the cherry on top.\\" She should rest assured than her fans will \\"love it.\\"<br /><br />This Summer is hot and, so will the summer! \\"The Queen Is Back.\\" Indeed! Long live the Queen!fans is \\"like the cherry on top.\\" She should rest assured than her fans will \\"love it.\\"    This Summer is hot and, so will the summer! \\"The Queen Is Back.\\" Indeed! Long live the Queen!

B000286RKW|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple:    The Godfather is the best MAFIA movie ever.  Goodfellas is the best MOB movie ever.  Period.
B000O599ZS|4.0|An excellent transfer. I purchased a copy of the film on Laser Disc in the 1990s'. The DVD version is superior.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Definitely one of the best Coen brothers movies and one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  From start to finish it is an amazing work of art.  Just listen to Ralph Stanley's haunting \\"O Death\\" and you'll understand the power of this soundtrack.  I wasn't a fan of bluegrass before listening to this album and now I love it.  An awesome collection of music that doesn't have a single dud in the entire album.
0143143492|5.0|Eckhart Tolle explains how our minds (ego) run our lives by keeping us in the past or the future.  He then shows how to be in the present moment, in the NOW, which is the only moment there is.  His book teaches how to be the observer of the mind, and how to detach from being under control of the mind.  Excellent book.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Madonna is suffering from not being hungry any more.  Not really a worthy effort compared to \\"Ray of Light\\" and others.  She is losing what made her popular.  Perhaps this should be her last album.

0812932293|5.0|Few autobiographies have the luxury of encompassing such a fascinating topic as Richard Branson who has led a life filled with unremitting vivacious action.  Filled with modesty and a nerve that has him taking near unheard of risks (both personal and in business), Losing My Virginity reads like a roller coaster through all the ups and downs of Branson's life.<br /><br />Richard Branson has created an empire, but few would be aware of just how close he teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for much of his career due to his unwillingness to accept the status quo.  His battles with British Airways are epic, but Branson also fills the book with countless highlights of his illustrious life, most notably his near death experiences attempting hot air balloon records.<br /><br />Where this book really won me over was regarding Branson's interaction with the Jordan royalty and his insight into the first gulf war.  As a result of Branson's charitable efforts, he was privy to a point of view that most would not expect.  I will leave it to any reader to discover this on their own, but this typifies the interest one should expect to obtain reading this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend Branson's book to any enthusiast of adventure or business.

B0013J30XG|5.0|Note to reader: Strange vote totals, yes? It's just the work of a cyber stalker--<br /><br />Wow, what a start to our summer adventures!!<br /><br />\\"Speed Racer\\" the movie and \\"Go Speed Racer Go,\\" the single title song by Ali Dee and the Deekompressors, had us hip hopping out the theater door, down the sidewalk, and into the car, then jumping and spinning along, singing \\"Go Speed Racer Go.\\" They (the Pretend Children) were singing to me, the great aunt, because I was whirling and jolting in my Pretend Mach 8 Ford Escape down the freeway home. Hey, I was down for that movie.<br /><br />Watching the spinning images, neon lighted, anime-inspired, digitally produced, toons-like panels with insertion of real people in the mix was a visual feast and imminent barf all in one. Dizzying. Spiraling. Flipping. Neon lights (more). Crashing. Just to suggest the mental images of the race scenes. During a couple of close-up montages of the cars before digitizing began, I glimpsed real-time, real-life tiny model cars (my great-nephew has a huge collection). And in some of the martial arts fight-stop-go scenes, especially one with John Goodman, I was slooshed with a moment of a set-up of Goodman just standing there ready to squash the ninja before digitized action thrust him into zoom speed action.<br /><br />(Actually, if I had never digitally filmed my own video, I might not have recognized those scenes, but I have and I did. Did it take away from the movie? No way. Actually, I felt privy to a second of movie making magic.)<br /><br />As for acting, I was awed by everyone, especially the coolly suave Emile Hirsch (looking like a young Charlie Sheen) as Speed Racer; Christina Ricci, who I was sure was really Susan Sarandon's daughter with those big eyes and similar facial expressions; Roger Allam, as the big corporate villain, who played a Michael Caine-like villain almost as well as Caine does himself; John Goodman, who played, well, Goodman as Pops, Speed's father. Stealer of every scene in which he appeared was young Paulie Litt, Speed's little brother, who I was definitely sure was Goodman's real life son because the resemblance was so uncanny.<br /><br />The story line was so complicated and told in such a complicated, back and forth manner, both narratively and visually (you'll have to see the movie to understand as this is a new kind of movie making and story telling, sort of magic realism on screen), that I was certain the Pretend Children would not understand. I quizzed them as I was hip hopping down the street to the car, while the boy was laughing and beseeching me not to embarrass him. I stopped. Their answers indicated complete understanding. Either I have little geniuses or the movie told its story in a less complicated manner than I first believed.<br /><br />Is \\"Speed Racer\\" a good movie from a 9-year-old's standpoint? \\"I've had two good things happen two days in a row,\\" he said. \\"I went to Chuck E.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|\\"Does Eli Roth know pain?\\"    Well, after viewing \\"Hostel,\\" I can assure you that Roth knows pain, he knows all about it. Somewhere in his vast collection of horror movies in his bedroom-- probably right around the nudie woman pictures,  Guns and Ammo Magazines, and a framed picture of his smiling and assured, self-portrait on the mantel above his bed--  there would be a DVD of his second film, \\"Hostel.\\" Let me tell you-- this film is pain: in all its agonizing and slow, torturous glory, as if hell-bent on stupefying its audience. Yet, I still kinda like it... but it has made me dumber.    Two obnoxious Americans--perfecting the persona of the frat boy cliché-- must fight to survive torture at the hands of those damn ugly foreigners. That's pretty much all that needs to be said about plot-- the film, which is solely rooted in comedy, torture, and ti*s, is obviously not to heavy on the subtext-- yet, one still may see the film as depicting the current state of foreign views on pro-war America, as in the film, Americans fetch a high price when bought to torture and kill, and I don't think it's because they like us. Still, it would be interesting to see how the film went over in some European countries, as well.    You see, the film is silly, plain and simple: a sort of summery of all that is wrong in modern horror movies. Yet, it may go with the modern flow, and although it's rowing up s*it creek, and it may actually have a paddle, it's still s*it creek, nonetheless. Yet, again, it's still going somewhere. All these gray areas are present when speaking of \\"Hostel's\\" likeability.    Since, the characters don't develop much out of the roles of lambs to the slaughter-- but are slightly admirable if you like Roth's brand of \\"Porky's\\" like humor. Yet some may belive that the film fits into that modern term \\"torture porn,\\" but other than the fact that term is often idiotic-- how come violence in horror only gets a backlash, when other genre's/ directors (Michael Bay, anyone) are just as gratuitous-- the film is only to be taken semi-seriously, even when the horror kicks in. Still agonizing, yes. Yet, such as a scene in which a character decks himself out in armor to evade capture, it's obvious that it can't be all serious, can't it? I hope not!    Moreover, it's a wonder how Roth can make such biting--no matter how much of it may be accidental--social commentaries that tap into modern fears, so timely, but still can be such utter laugh fests. His first film was \\"Cabin Fever,\\" a film about a virus, that was released shortly after SARS broke out--and although Roth may seem little too cocksure in his films, and his films may never be nothing more than decent drunken midnight movies, there's still something oddly likeable here, even if it is mind numbing, obnoxious, and crass. That my reader, is what may have Roth's name stick out with the camp-satire of the Frank Henenlotter's (Basket Case, Brain Damage) in the horror film industry-- and that's not being shipwrecked in s*it creek, either.    4.5 (Out of 10 in 0.5 increments)
B0010358D0|4.0|A very close competition to its former movie, this one has pluses and minuses.  I liked the story line and the animation is beyond its predecessor by far. But the only minor problems I saw was the hair movement which reminded me of Final Fantasy movie from a few years back, and that the \\"Osprey\\" like C-130 was removed for the newer ships -- which are in the comic -- but I liked the old Osprey-C130.  A minor point.  This version is more CGI looking than Anime looking, but everything moves great.  There is even jaw movement when they talk, and the dubbing to English is so perfect you won't even realize it was filmed in Japanese until you watch the making videos.  Very Enjoyable.

Rules OF Egagement, [ROE's]made by someone who has never heard a shot fired, prevented them from taking measures that resulted in them being exposed to Taliban and killed.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|Another great movie that will stand out for years to come, so be sure to add it to your DVD library. Inspired by true events, Denzel does an excellent job of actually making the audience feel some 'sympathy' for a murdering gangster! Not an easy task for an actor, or the screenwriters. We are given the story of a working man who only wanted a better life for his entire family, and he does his best to provide the best for them and his wife. However, he was a killer. It is only through the most superb writing and acting that a story like this can evoke the deeply mixed emotions brought to the surface. I believe most viewers will experience the same mixed emotions I did.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000ULQV0W|4.0|If you were moved by Sean Penn's film of the Jon Krakauer book, you will most definitely appreciate Eddie Vedder's acoustic accompaniment. The songs and movie fit together like wildflowers in a mountain meadow. The music also stands on its own feet, offering an aural journey into the wild.
0743486285|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book.  Never been a Motley fan, however I listened to Nikki Sixx on Howard Stern and he sounded like an interesting guy. He was talking about his book on the show, so I decided to pick it up. The book blew me away.  I have read tons of books about bands, rockstars, and drug abuse, however this one takes the cake.  I firmly believe that nothing short of a bullet to the head could take this guy out.  I have no idea how he is still living.  Because the book is basically his actual diary from that time frame(with present-day comments inserted, provided by himself and those who were around him at that time), the book comes across as truer feeling than most books about rock stars.  The book really gives one a realistic insight to how gripping drug addiction can be, and how easy it is to come into contact with drugs and dealers when you are one of the most successful musicians in the world.  Difficult to read at times because of the subject matter, and very depressing at parts, but overall a great read.  I blasted through it in about 3 days.
B0013V33DG|5.0|There's no better way to introduce a reluctant friend to opera than this...a fun story with two superb singer/actors.  Spellbinding (and with supertitles).
B000GIW43M|5.0|I bought this book because I loved the movie so much and the book is almost always even better. Something that didn't stand out in the movie, is the author's great method of dialogue. In the movie you don't realize it, because it is cast with   actress(es) who's characters are obviously Chinese-American, English-as-2nd language, so you don't recognize the detail that went into forming the dialogue to make it sound legit because you have the visual aide. However, the book, with no visual aide, is so obviously a Chinese woman living in America, speaking English as her 2nd language just based on her dialogue and the way she tells the story. This is an impressive skill in dialogue. Outstanding! If you don't read it for the story itself, which is wonderful and well worth reading, than read it for Amy Tan's writing (story telling, dialogue) skills which are admirable.
B0013V33DG|5.0|If you are opera fan--and even if you are not--this is one spectacular performance by outstanding singers staged and produced in a most enjoyable and viewable form. Everything about this performance is first rate. Dessay and Florez are superb in voice and acting. Corbelli adds a solid performance as does Palmer. Dawn French is a great addition where it really adds punch to the staging.  Great score and arias brought to life so well.....a joy to see and pleasure to watch over and over.....
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Quite Simply, this is the order of Indy Films from best to worst:    1. Raiders of the Lost Ark - 5 Stars  2. The Last Crusade - 4 1/2 Stars  3. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - 3 Stars  4. Temple of Doom - 3 Stars    If you're an Indy fan, it's an enjoyable ride, but don't set your expectations high, like Raiders and Last Crusade; the content of those films, and writing, were well above Kingdom and Temple.  Kingdom is hokey, a bit cartoonish(as some have mentioned here), and the Family Reunion was a little over the top, and very convenient suddenly for script?  e.g. Daddy-O, Junior, etc.  However, even 20 plus years later, it still holds up well to Temple of Doom and a younger Indy.  But, it doesn't hold a candle (or a torch?) to Raiders or Last Crusade.  Simply watch and have fun, and, suspend ALL belief in the real world.  Remember, in Hollywood, heroes don't get hurt or killed, UNLESS the script really needs them to!  (And, then, do they really die?)
B0014DBZT2|2.0|I have been a fan of Nick Cave's music for over 20 years.  So far, in my opinion, this is his only \\"dud\\".  Nothing is really stinkeroo about it, it's just bland and boring and contains similar material already covered on previous albums.  I hope he hops back up on that black steed and rides again--but for now, he and his mates are just slogging through the dung.

0783226888|3.0|Director Michael Caton-Jones has created a good dramatic and suspense filled film with outstanding actors and a riveting, masterful plot. Bruce Willis plays the lead role as the \\"Jackal\\" a cold and calculating assassin. Sidney Poitier is superbly cast as the FBI Deputy Director. Richard Gere plays Declan Mulqueen, an IRA. terrorist, imprisoned in the USA. Diane Venora is cast as the Russian Interpol agent, Valentina Kostova. Scenes were filmed  in many locations in Europe, primarily Helsinki, Finland which also served to represent Moscow, and London, England; Montreal, Canada; Chicago, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Essentially, the FBI and Russian agents managed to kill a Chechnyan mobster. Unfortunately, his brother is out for revenge and hires the Jackal to assassinate a top US official ... Initially, they believe the target is the Director of the FBI. However, as time evolves, Declan Mulqueen discovers who the real target is.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is chilling and real in his role as the Jackal. He engages in multiple disguises and identities throughout the film to achieve his goals. He manages to get a computer guided high tech weapon built and smuggled into the United States undetected. He gains entry into the US via a power boat over the Lakes from Canada to Lake Michigan and there he joins a boat race in Chicago by blending in. The FBI gets permission to spring Declan Mulqueen out of jail ... in order to get his help to identify and apprehend the Jackal. He makes a deal to win his freedom, then joins in the chase to catch the Jackal.<br /><br />It turns out the Jackal has another murder in mind along with accomplishing the task for which he was hired. The Jackal has an old score to settle with Isabella, a woman from his past who can identify him. She survived his attempt to kill her. She was a Spanish terrorist of Basque origins who worked with Declan Mulqueen many years ago. They had been lovers and she was pregnant with his child when the Jackal shot her ... It seems Declan Mulqueen also has a score to settle with the Jackal. While the plot is well developed, the film drags on a bit, as much of the film involves chasing the Jackal while he deviously manages to avoid detection, When he gets closer to  his target and the deadline ... the film picks up speed and the story becomes more fascinating and complex. The ending is exciting and satisfying. Some feel the film made in 1973, \\"Day of the Jackal\\" upon which this film is based, is superior. Never having seen the former, I can only judge this film. Overall, this could have been a *more* exciting film given the action, drama, and well layed out plot but too much time is wasted in the big chase which makes one feel the film is much longer than it should be.

0374280967|5.0|Whatever you do, don't skip to the end, leave the room if a smart alek friend starts raving about this book and avoid any reviews that don't come with a spoiler warning (there are none here so don't worry!). Yes, you definitely don't want to have one of the best endings in bookdom which happens on the VERY last page of this delightful novella, spoilt for you.<br /><br />The Queen discovers reading, and pursues this new passion with much gusto to the horror of her private secretary, prime minister and others. She reads everywhere and to the point where it interferes with her royal duties. Her reading choices are remarkable, guided in part by a kitchen helper who first introduces gay-themed books for Her Majesty's reading pleasure. But before long, she is onto to other authors, one book leading to the next. I was most indignant when her royal staff ganged up to stifle this new hobby, but her royal resourcefulness discovers that reading leads to an even more interesting hobby: writing. I closed it with a satisfying chuckle, wondering if someone would pass this gem to the Queen. It definitely earns the \\"You have no idea how much fun this is\\" award.
B00003CWL6|5.0|My girlfriend bought this movie.  I didn't want to see it.  I thought it was a \\"chick flick\\".  It was raining outside, and I had used up all my options.  Now I had to watch it.<br /><br />I should have known it would be good with Kevin Spacey in it.  Everything he does it great. But I had no idea it was this good.  I can usually figure out the endings of most Hollywood movies these days.  They are all the same: the plots, the characters, the acting, or lack of it.  I knew how this one was going to end, but was totally surprised by the circumstances.  Tragedy and humor...mixed to perfection.<br /><br />Great movie.  Don't miss it.
B000HT3Q14|5.0|I first saw this movie in the 90's when it came out, but had forgotten just how really good it is.  Bruce Willis shows that, when he gets away from the \\"Die Hard\\" movies, he's a very good actor.  And Madeline Stowe and Brad Pitt  also put in fine performances.  The plot twists and turns to a surprise ending.  Highly recommended, even for those who don't normally like sci-fi.

0689865384|5.0|\\"Uglies\\" is a dystopia about the perils of beauty.  Set in a future after the death of our own culture (to denizens of this dystopia, we're the Rusties because we built so many things with metals), society focuses on becoming beautiful.  At age 16, every child undergoes a major surgery to meet the standard of beautiful: wide eyes, full lips, perfect skin, even a standard height.  Before the surgery, they're called \\"uglies\\"; post-surgery, they're called \\"pretties\\".  The stated goal of the surgery is to make everyone equal by making everyone meet a predetermined and narrowly-defined standard of beauty.      Tally Youngblood is a 15-year-old girl who is just shy of her 16th birthday.  Her best friend, Peris, has already had the surgery, and she misses him fiercely.  She makes a friend in Shay, another girl who is missing her friends.  Shay is missing her friends for a different reason.  Instead of submitting to the surgery, Shay's friends have run away from their city to go to the Smoke, a community of other Ugly runaways.  The night before Shay's surgery, she runs away too, leaving a note for Tally in case she wants to join her.      Tally chooses to stay and become pretty.  On the day of her surgery, she instead finds herself in the hands of Special Circumstances, a frightening enforcement agency that most Uglies and Pretties think doesn't exist.  Special Circumstances wants to know more about the Smoke, and they give Tally a terrible decision: go find Shay and betray her and the Smoke, or never become pretty.  Tally finally agrees to go to the Smoke.  When she arrives, she meets David.  His parents, both doctors, founded the Smoke when they discovered the horrible secret behind the surgery.  Tally, shocked, decides that she will stay in the Smoke, and destroys the homing device that she was given by Special Circumstances.      Destroying the device activates it anyway.  Special Circumstances comes, rounds up all of the runaways, and takes them back to their city.  They first turn Shay pretty, which verifies for the runaways the horror of the surgery.  Tally admits to David and his mother that she was the cause of their discovery, and sets about making it right.  The book ends there, leading to the next book in the series.    I came to read \\"Uglies\\" by a recommendation in the blog of John Scalzi.  His recommendation made me pick it up when I stumbled across it a few days later.  I started reading the novel at 9pm that night; at midnight, 300 pages in, I had to force myself to put it down so that I could get at least some sleep before work the next day.  I couldn't wait to get home to finish it, and now I'm disappointed that I didn't have time this evening to buy the next book in the series.  It's been a long time since I've been unable to put a book down.  I hope that the rest of the books in the series are as good as this!
B00169XU8I|2.0|too much hype for this cd. madonna is a good entertainer!  it will be great to see her perform some of these songs on the stage.  but, as a whole the cd wasn't all that it was suppose to be.  i did not jump out of my seat and want to dance!  to me, her first cd, madonna was a better dance cd, than this.  even her cd, music, was a better in the techno, dance area.  so, i would not recommend purchasing the special edition, it is just the cd with 2 short different versions of 4 minutes and you get a box of hard candy!  not worth the price.
B00000099Y|1.0|\\"What A Bloody Bore\\" I thought to myself and sent about fifteen pieces of hate drenched rubbish hurtling into the trash. Some obscure form of Redneck Entertainment also crossed my mind.  On a lighter note, it's just so tasteless.   And this is coming from someone who can even handle the \\"Dead Kennedys.\\" At least there is some humor and political sentiment. Gothic Metal Bands are a much more mindful alternative to this ceaseless tirade of grating noise.  If the music only matched the artwork that created the covers.

This is a very moving book that teaches lessons we should all take to heart - and they happen to come from a very articulate, funny, observant and wise dog.  Everyone should be reading this book this summer.  I couldn't put it down - read it in a few hours over two days.  AWESOME!  Thank you for this book Garth Stein!

B000NA2BEU|4.0|I own all three season of Veronica Mars. From the pilot episode first aired on television i was hooked and watched all of the season on tv. I was very bummed when i found out that they were canceling Veronica Mars. The plot lines in all three seasons were amazing. Even when they changed the format in the third season, it was still great. I recommend this show to everyone! I have hooked many of my friends (who ended up borrowing all three season) including my boyfriend. Many of my girlfriends hooked their boyfriends on the show as well. Its for guys and girls of all ages. My entire family loved this show, even the ones who don't watch television loved it. Veronica Mars is a great show with amazing actors/actresses with just enough drama and comedy to keep the audience at there toes. Its a must have in any dvd collection.

B000YABYSS|5.0|Denzel Washington plays a professor at the all-black Wiley College in Marshall, Texas during the 1930's.  He runs a debate team which is beginning to earn plaudits for its performance against other black colleges.  He chooses four young people for his team and they gain more attention through a series of victories until white colleges begin to take notice and accept Washington's invitations to debate the Wiley College team.  This movie is based on real circumstances which occurred during the mid-30's in Texas.  Racism is rampant and good opportunities for young blacks are few and far between.  After witnessing the aftermath of a lynching the young debaters grow up quickly and gain new passion in their debates.  Denzel Washington is outstanding as Professor Toleson, and the trio of Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, and Denzel Whitaker do a fine job of portraying the young Wiley College debaters.  Whittaker's father is played by Forrest Whitaker who is a wonderful counterpoint to Denzel Washington.  This is a little-known slice of history which came to have a great impact on the Civil Rights movement of the 60's.  It is a story that was untold for too long and which people today need to see and learn from.
B0014KD46W|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to!  Every track is solid and unique, and gets better and better with each listening!  The musicianship is outstanding, with each key person contributing in ways you would never imagine possible!  Every song is thought out in painstaking detail and it shows!  I feel thrilled to be listening to such a phenominal effort of diversity of music styles because any particular music style can't be defined on this CD!!!!! IT'S GREAT, AND A MUST BUY!!!!!
B0002NRQTI|4.0|Counterparts is one of those CDs that could have been made a few songs shorter and would be a lot tighter for it. I find some of my favorite Rush tunes here, such as Stick It Out, Alien Shore, Animate, Double Agent and Cold Fire, but also my all-time least favorite Rush song, the lethargic Speed of Love. If that is really the \\"speed of love\\" it's a wonder we aren't dying out as a species from lack of reproduction. It's actually ironic - the lyric \\"nothing changes faster than the speed of love\\" is buried in a sluggardly, decidedly not fast song that sounds more like your grandfather's snoring through the wall from the next room.<br /><br />OK, now that I got that off my chest, I'm also non-plussed by Everyday Glory. As for the instrumental Leave That Thing Alone, well... that flat-out jams. Great groove, listen to the Rush in Rio cd to hear this song really blown open live. All in all Counterparts is a solid, strong offering, and it was especially refreshing in 1993. I like most of Rush's 80s stuff, and Roll the Bones is very good... but hearing Rush crank it up a bit more sounded great then, and still does now. However, as hard as Counterparts sounds in places (Stick it Out), it is far less in your face than Vapor Trails.<br /><br />As for the lyrics (always a classic feature of any Rush album), I love them. Neil surprised me back then with this nearly full album's worth of relational and interpersonal lyrics. Such lyricism made rare appearances before Counterparts, such as in Emotion Detector, Ghost of a Chance and Entre Nous. Neil may not be a psychologist, but he is quite pointed with these lyrics, especially on Alien Shore and Cold Fire. The more familiar oblique, brainiac lyrics are here, as on Double Agent and what I think is the best track in the bunch, Stick It Out. Overall a very enjoyable CD, with that one clunker there in the middle... which should have been titled \\"The Sleep of Love\\" or something like that.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|The movie quite OK but not as good as others from Pixar e.g. Nemo or The Incredibles.<br /><br />A bit tool long.
B000IHY146|5.0|I first bought this on vinyl in 1972. It was so unlike anything else I had ever heard, but it immediately became a favorite. Years passed, the record album long disappeared from my collection- turntable long ago sold or given away, I've been searching for this for years. I loved the addition of liner notes and photographs of Karen Dalton. As for the music, its even better than I remembered.
B000PHX8C0|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this DevilDriver album is good, but not great. Everyone knows that Dez might not write the greatest lyrics, but the lyrics for \\"Last Kind Words\\" are definitely an improvement from their previous CD's which I will listen to once in a blue moon. Most of the songs are decently paced with heavy riffs, fast drumming, solos and no breakdowns and very few tempo changes. As someone mentioned previously, there are some deep dark grungy feeling songs and also there are some songs that in my opinion seem to be fillers. I skip over them because they don't appeal to me, though they are tolerable and sometimes I won't skip over them. This band puts on a great live show and I can't wait to hear more from them in the future.
0061562408|5.0|This is the best book I've read since Marley and Me. I know, we're all comparing The Art of Racing in the Rain with Marley and Me. Well, let me tell you, they are not comparable except for the way they reach the human heart from an animal's point of view. Marley and Me is great as is The Art of Racing In The Rain, which takes the art of anthropomorphizing into its greatest realm but in a delicious manner that makes animal lovers and researchers alike want to come home and \\"spoon\\" with their favorite dog.<br /><br />Enzo grabbed me from the end of the first page when I learn he was sitting in a pool of his own urine on the eve of his death, only to try to get his human life owner to allow him to die so that he (Enzo) could go on to become a human, and so that his owner (Denny) could go on to find his fortune in life.<br /><br />Here is a dog that has learned everything he knows from cable TV and that envies thumbs (opposable digits) and wants more than anything to come back in his next reincarnation as a human because that is what the Mongolians believe.<br /><br />Enzo. You can't go wrong reading this book. If you don't like it, I'm sure there are other books we could steer you towards.
0783116934|5.0|i just think this is a great movie. great acting. good locale. i just love it.
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the first novel in the Kingkiller Chronicles. The second novel, [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, Day 2)]], is scheduled for a release in April, 2009. This novel marks the debut of Mr. Rothfuss into the fantasy genre which may turn off some readers, after all if it's a debut novel it can't be any good right? They couldn't be more wrong, but I'll get to that in a minute. One other thing that may be of more importance, and this actually kept me from reading the book for a very long time, is that most of the book is written in first person. As a general rule, I do not read first person novels because I have some difficulty wrapping my mind around them. However, after reading this book my feelings on that may very well change.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is a little different than traditional stories. The premise of this book is that Kvothe has pulled back from his life of adventure, heroism, and killings and secluded himself in a small town as an innkeeper. A traveler, following stories, tales, and clues, is finally able to find Kvothe. He has one simple request for Kvothe. Tell me your story. Kvothe finally acquiesces and tells a piece of his story. The story starts off with Kvothe being a young lad in a traveling troupe (think a traveling circus, story tellers). For fear of spoiling even something minor I will say only this. This book encompasses only about eight years or so of Kvothe's life. This may seem like a short span, but the actual story is rich and vivid in so many ways. Within the pages of this book there is heart ache, death, contemplation, politics, out right survival, song, and over coming obstacles. Understand that the small paragraph above does in no way do this novel justice. I would rather write too little and allow potential readers to discover things for themselves, than write too much and ruin some part of this tale for anyone.<br /><br />The characters in this novel are written with extreme care and depth. Since the book focuses on Kvothe's story it's safe to say that his character is the most explored and defined. Starting off as a naïve young lad and slowly progressing to where he ends up in the novel. His character progression is beautifully written. If you are a fan of character development then Kvothe is the perfect character for you to enjoy, hopefully it continues in the next novel. There are also some other memorable characters that come into Kvothe's life along the way. Abenthy who comes into Kvothe's life and begins to open his mind to new possibilities. Wil and Sim, whom Kvothe meets during his time at the University and become very good friends with him. There is the mysterious Auri, who Kvothe befriends. Deena who becomes Kvothe's on again, off again love interest. Lastly, there is the `villain' (mean kid) Ambrose who is written very well. All in all, I love the characterization of this book. Some characters aren't nearly as developed as others, but being that this novel is written from Kvothe's perspective that makes sense. Those he spends more time with get more face time. It's that simple. These characters, for lack of a better term, are the most `real' characters I have read about in a long time, and it's so rewarding to read about them.<br /><br />A couple minor criticisms about this novel:<br /><br />1 - The ease at which Kvothe learns things and how good he is at things. It seems everything he does, and tries, he is good at for no particular reason. It just is. This is the only area of his character that seemed `unreal' to me. Everything else was as close to perfect as a debut author can get.<br /><br />2 - The character of Deena. I didn't like her. That by itself is not a reason for criticism, but I just couldn't really connect with her at all. Yet, in parts of the story she is a central figure. She just didn't work for me.<br /><br />3 - And this is about as minor as minor can get. I wish there was somewhere that explained the currency system used in this book. Currency is a very important thing for Kvothe and I felt confused at the exchange rates and knowing how much things were and which denomination was more etc. Just a minor quibble.<br /><br />Some things I really liked about this novel:<br /><br />1 - The world. I really enjoyed how Mr. Rothfuss brought me into the world with descriptions of places, smells, sounds etc. He never over describes things, but uses subtle things to really grab the reader. There was never a time in this novel where I felt bogged down by too many details, and conversely there was never a time when I felt I needed more description. It's a perfect balance.<br /><br />2 - The realism of the characters. It sounds odd calling characters in a fantasy story real, but the way they are written I can't think of a better word for them. They all have their faults, their own motivations, and more importantly their own voices. The choices the characters make during the book actually make sense. There was never a time where I felt that the characters were being led by the story.  They are just seamless and well written.<br /><br />3 - The delivery of the story. The idea of a character telling a story in their own voice and basing the novel on that is a nice change of pace. As I said at the start of this review, traditionally I am not a fan of first person stories. Yet, I never, not once, felt that the perspective took away from the book. In fact, if anything, it made the book that much more rich in detail.<br /><br />4 - The freshness of the story, setting, concept, characters, magic, etc. This is one of the few fantasy books I have read lately that didn't remind me of another book I had previously read. Almost everything about this book seemed fresh and new. I can not really put it into words any other way. This is a near perfect novel.<br /><br />5 - Mr. Rothfuss' prose is a sheer joy to read. It's fluid, expressive, and flows wonderfully. It's not overly flowery but offers up the perfect balance of what is needed at that specific point in the story. Mr. Rothfuss uses every word to its utmost ability and never uses wasted fluff. Every word is important to the story, and that makes the flow of the story that much better.<br /><br />I don't think I can really say enough good things about this novel. Within the first ten to fifteen pages I was drawn into the book and it never let me go. For a debut novel this book is awe inspiring. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. For those who are like me and traditionally do not enjoy first person book, please give this book a shot. It took me over a year to do so, and now that I have finished it I am saddened it took me this long. This is a novel that I am almost certain every fan of the fantasy genre will enjoy. I will certainly be recommending this book to many, many people. It also has a very good chance of being on my Top 5 list of novels I read in 2008. I can not tell you how anxious I am to read the next novel. Roll the dice, take a chance, but do read this book!his book. Currency is a very important thing for Kvothe and I felt confused at the exchange rates and knowing how much things were and which denomination was more etc. Just a minor quibble.    Some things I really liked about this novel:    1 - The world. I really enjoyed how Mr. Rothfuss brought me into the world with descriptions of places, smells, sounds etc. He never over describes things, but uses subtle things to really grab the reader. There was never a time in this novel where I felt bogged down by too many details, and conversely there was never a time when I felt I needed more description. It's a perfect balance.    2 - The realism of the characters. It sounds odd calling characters in a fantasy story real, but the way they are written I can't think of a better word for them. They all have their faults, their own motivations, and more importantly their own voices. The choices the characters make during the book actually make sense. There was never a time where I felt that the characters were being led by the story.  They are just seamless and well written.    3 - The delivery of the story. The idea of a character telling a story in their own voice and basing the novel on that is a nice change of pace. As I said at the start of this review, traditionally I am not a fan of first person stories. Yet, I never, not once, felt that the perspective took away from the book. In fact, if anything, it made the book that much more rich in detail.    4 - The freshness of the story, setting, concept, characters, magic, etc. This is one of the few fantasy books I have read lately that didn't remind me of another book I had previously read. Almost everything about this book seemed fresh and new. I can not really put it into words any other way. This is a near perfect novel.    5 - Mr. Rothfuss' prose is a sheer joy to read. It's fluid, expressive, and flows wonderfully. It's not overly flowery but offers up the perfect balance of what is needed at that specific point in the story. Mr. Rothfuss uses every word to its utmost ability and never uses wasted fluff. Every word is important to the story, and that makes the flow of the story that much better.    I don't think I can really say enough good things about this novel. Within the first ten to fifteen pages I was drawn into the book and it never let me go. For a debut novel this book is awe inspiring. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. For those who are like me and traditionally do not enjoy first person book, please give this book a shot. It took me over a year to do so, and now that I have finished it I am saddened it took me this long. This is a novel that I am almost certain every fan of the fantasy genre will enjoy. I will certainly be recommending this book to many, many people. It also has a very good chance of being on my Top 5 list of novels I read in 2008. I can not tell you how anxious I am to read the next novel. Roll the dice, take a chance, but do read this book!

I loved the way the author laid the book out like a series of letters to an anonymous receiver.  I read this book in about three days-I couldn't put it down!  I could relate to Charlie's character and his feelings of being 'infinite' in specific scenarios.  It was wonderful!

1596912855|5.0|This was one of the funnest, frothiest books I've read this year (along with the Shopoholic series).  Despite how far-fetched Jane's Adventures in Austenland might seem to the realist, I loved the premise, plot, and fairytale ending.<br /><br />There are so many witty literary references, that that alone is worth the read.  Jane must distinguish between what is real sentiment and what is Stanislavski Method Acting at its finest.  Is Martin, the rootbeer-drinking gardener, the real thing?  Jane is rather smitten with the 6'5\\" \\"servant\\" after a seemingly unpretentious, reality-based hook-up. Are Mr. Nobley's intense gazes and Austen-lexicon flirtations indicative of a steady paycheck or burgeoning feelings?<br /><br />Just as Jane thinks she's finally overcome her A&E Pride & Prejudice obsession (believe me, real-life women such as yours truly have a similar, though not quite as intense, Colin Firth-as-Darcy hang-up), she is presented with a pretty close proximation to the Regency-era Fitzwilliam. (It turns out that this Austenland actor was assigned the role of Mr. Darcy/Mr. Nobley because this character was closest to his real personality.) If you can call a good-looking, unemployed British actor in New York City the master of Pemberley, then of all this, Jane might be mistress.<br /><br />Wonderful, light, feel-good read.  I really would like to visit Austenland (it would be like a grown-up woman's version of Disneyland--if it only existed AND was affordable!).  Colonel Brandon and Captain Wentworth also have a special place in my heart, and Austenland encounters and intrigues with these leading men would be more than welcome.
032147404X|5.0|I've been taking photography classes since high school and been reading books since then. Everyone with the exception for a few offer the same advice, follow the rules and then take the picture. While this method offers much more depth and knowledge why things are done, it's very hard to point someone new to do \\"xyz\\" without getting confused.<br /><br />The idea of this book is a bit different, here the author \\"talks\\" to you as if you were shooting together and you simply asked him a question. I really enjoyed reading this book as it is similar how I would explain photography. Instead of explaining rules I would simply show how it's done.<br /><br />That being said, I don't think this book alone would be a good resource for a new or even experienced photographer. Scott Kelby skips over the details but as far as I know, he still explains critical items. Overall, I really like this book and give it to friends who are just starting in photography. Yes, it's not perfect but honestly which is easier to read. This book or the manual that came with the camera?
B000YXMMAE|5.0|It is new music from an Amazing Band. Don't expect Old Radiohead, if you are dissapointed just pretend this is a new Band and a new style. The truth is my first introduction to Radiohead was Pablo Honey's creep back in 1993 and they seem to have changed their style as years have passed, which is a great thing. This album comes full circle and it's amazing to experience an album like that after 15 years of the hit Pablo Honey. Among my favorites Reckoner and Weird fishes

B000060OFT|1.0|Director Baz Luhrman is quite a brazen salesman, pretentiously coining the term \\"Red Curtain Cinema\\" to describe his artistic rape of several noble stories and themes.  It seems that the defining cultural influences in his life were Sergio Leone Westerns, Hong Kong martial arts films, and Looney Toons cartoons.  The latter influence is particularly evident; it influences his editing and even his sound effects (look at his Moulin Rouge if you doubt it). Like many of the Bard's other plays, Romeo and Juliet has successfully survived many anachronistic adaptations to contemporary settings, but it can't overcome this. I've seen Lurid Luhrman's \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" shown to impressionable high school students many times (their teachers thought that teens wouldn't appreciate the story without a modern Verona Beach setting).  What they fail to understand (or understand all too well) is that Shakespeare's beautiful Elizabethan English is what hinders the student's comprehension.  It requires hard work from teacher and student alike in decipherment and contextualization. Doing less is simply a lazy cheat; placing the story in a lurid cartoon of contemporary America doesn't rectify that problem - particularly when actors rush through their lines, racing with the mad editor.

B000J10EQU|2.0|After a horrid third film and a suprising fourth, superman returns for a fifth film. Dont get me wrong i am a superman fan. but i read the comics and was very disappointed with the suprising release of Superman Returns in 2006. I was one of the first into the theater and one of the first out. The Film focuses on special effects and not story OR superman. The story is short but they maneged to twist it to last two hours. Brandon Rauth does an OK job but is not believable as The Man of Steel. I was very disappointed with its release after waiting such a long time for a new age film. this time they did it to new age and took away story for Effects.

B0011UJMK2|4.0|As a description of life in Russia in the 30's & 50's, this part of the book is mesmerizing. As the murder mystery courses on through the book, it becomes a little disjointed. I disliked the use of italics to denote a speaker, often having to reread previous lines to figure out who was talking. This disrupted my reading often. I though the ending was a bit of deus ex machina, but over all this was an interesting and compelling book. I have the movie Citizen X which parallels this book in some ways. This rendition owes quite a bit to this true serial killer in Russia in the 80's. I re-watched the movie after reading this....it's a truly chilling tale.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|I think this movie is right up there with the others in the series, if not the best.  The action scenes are great, and the main characters likeable and believable.
0743289692|5.0|I just finished reading Infidel, and I am inspired.  This is a book that chronicles the intellectual development and moral honesty of one person who has had the power to influence an entire country...and possibly world.      For anyone who questions whether one person can make a difference in this world, Ali's answer is the story of her meteoric rise from destitute, half-educated lone immigrant to a country where she did not speak the language (Holland), to a self-made woman elected to high political office at a young age, just a few years later.  And the book tells the story not in the manner of a fairy tale, but gives the details of the hard-fought battles that helped shape this woman of character and insight.      I was fascinated to see how Ali goes from accepting the dogma that religion is required to be moral, to being able to question the dogmas in her mind, and working out for herself what morality would mean on her terms, outside of religious dogmas.      Her honest questioning and thinking reminds me of another woman immigrant from an oppressive regime who became a thinker/writer and provocateur and burst on the scene in the 1940s...and who has impacted thinking in the United States: Ayn Rand.      I wonder if Ayaan has read Ayn's formulation of a full secular morality, or the serious academic books on the topic, such as [[ASIN:0521705460 Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist]] published by Cambridge University Press.     I'd be interested to learn what Ayaan thinks of Ayn, given their very different, but in a way similar, paths of independently forming their own ideas.
1892005034|5.0|The entire premise of the book is about playing nice in the sandbox.  It is unfortunate that we as human beings seem to forget that simple rule that we learned when we were very young...but we do.<br /><br />Marshall Rosenberg explains in the introduction that he has two questions that have motivated him to find the answers to:  He asks:  \\"What  happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and exploitatively?  And conversely, what allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under even the most trying circumstances?\\"<br /><br />These questions are truly profound and Rosenberg does an exceptional job of answering both of them in his book.<br /><br />Rosenberg notes that the first component of Nonviolent Communication is to observe without evaluating.  In other words, apply empathy when communicating.  This is easier said than done and takes time, patience and a willingness to change ones behavior.  There will be mistakes along the way, but change does come with the right attitude.<br /><br />The second component is to express our feelings.  It encourages conscious responses bases on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling and wanting rather than being habitual and auto responding without thinking.  In other words, Rosenberg recommends critically thinking through what to say before saying it.  Words are weapons and they need to be handled skillfully or they will be harmful!<br /><br />There are many insightful comments throughout the book.  For example, Rosenberg says:  \\"It is the rare human being who can maintain focus on our needs when we are expressing them through images of their wrongness.\\"<br /><br />This book  and other excellent books on communication help us understand each others needs better.  With a little shift in our thinking we can be better communicators!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595437087 The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking]]
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Coming to the cinema I promised myself to judge the film on it's own and not in the light of it's famous legacy, but this proved to be impossible since the movie builds heavily on this legacy and hints to it many points.    Either way we found the movie dissapointing. Some reviewers already made the comparison to Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy. I agree that in a similar way to Star Wars, the new installment lost most of it's intelligence, charm and soul. In return we get a stupid, unreasonably complicated plot, formula-based Hollywood script and dialogue, and heavy hand on the CGI.    The movie does have its good moments though. Harrison Ford is excellent and should not be blamed for this failure. The first part of the movie is actually original and interesting, placing the plot in a very nice reconstruction of USA in the 50's, filled with cold-war paranoia, youth rebellion and rock'n'roll music - this may be a jesture to American Graffiti. (Unfortunately once the plot moves to Latin America, all this disappears and we the plot surrenders itself to embarassing dialogues, jungle-movie cliches and mumbo-jumbo sci-fi talk)    Also some of the action and stunts are very pleasing and are in par with the spirit of the original trilogy (the graveyard fight, truck chase, and waterfall scenes, to name a few).     Bottom line, this is not the worst movie you will see this year, but it is dissapointing compared to what you would expect from a high-budget Spielberg movie.
B001235BBM|2.0|Sorry folks, but this suposedly silky vocalist doesn't quite do it for me.  It all sounds like another nice package with no real substance.  It's artificial, and a long way from really good singers past and present.  I promise I've tried!
140120306X|3.0|The random extracts from \\"The Black dossier\\" and 3D pages make this well worth reading. However the central plot is a little weak, and is just an excuse to fit in many pop-culture references. I was hoping for more swashbuckling adventures in the style of the other LXG graphic novels.  That said Alan Moore is an amazing writer and i don't know of any other writer who could handle the different styles of prose used in this collection.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I work at one of the largests theater chains in the US, and this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The history, acting and story keep the viewer so interested in the movie that you won't want to miss a second of it. If only most movies were this good.
B000YJ85VS|3.0|I purchased the book not simply because I was interested in the subject, but was fascinated by the author's story of having battled the pain of a severe burn injury. After the first chapter, that part of the author's story recedes into the background.  I enjoyed reading the book, but the variations of experimental design described by the author became tedious for me. I would have preferred a generalized description of the design and the results, not the modifications the experimenters made to refine their data as they went along. Divulging the results in \\"real-time\\" wasn't that exciting.  Readers can make their own judgments about how feasible some of the author's social engineering solutions are. The practical policy decisions which flow from the insights in the book are minimal, it seems to me.  Finally, I could have done without a full chapter of the who's who in author's research community and academic life.  Interesting, but somewhat impractical and I think you'll wind up skimming significant sections of the book.
B00164KYS2|4.0|More often than not, the transition from the small to the big screen is a huge disappointment.  The last decade has seen many television series made into film but very few have translated well.  HBO's hit series, \\"Sex and the City\\" is the rare exception!<br /><br />  Three years after the series left off, we find the fab foursome moving along in their lives.  Miranda and Steve have settled in Brooklyn with their son, Brady.  Charlotte is living happily with her husband and adopted daughter, Lily.  Samantha has moved to the West Coast with her hunky partner, Smith, who now has a starring role on television.  And Carrie, well, she is searching for the perfect apartment with Big.<br /><br />  All seems just a little too perfect until the complications set in---infidelity, a stagnant relationship, wedding jitters and much more challenge the four friends we have grown to love.  Over six seasons we watched as these women dealt with sex and relationships.  This movie, of course, continues that journey but also begins a new chapter in their lives.<br /><br />  Many of the familiar faces have returned; however some are underused in the movie.  Stanford, Carrie's best gay bud, is given little more than a cameo and receives about the same amount of screen time as Magda, Miranda's nanny.  Oscar winner, Jennifer Hudson (and American Idol alum), plays new character, Louise, Carrie's assistant--a young woman who loves purses as much as Carrie loves her shoes!  Candice Bergen also makes a cameo as Carrie's editor at Vogue.<br /><br />  One thing I will never understand, though, is a lot of women's desire to see Carrie with Big.  I've always found the character arrogant, narcissitic and emotionally detached.  Granted, Carrie is neurotic and a high maitenance gal but their torturous relationship has always bordered on sadistic.  Apparently, some women find that type of guy attractive or they just love the constant drama in their relationships.  Whatever the case, Big will always be the one flaw in an otherwise enjoyable show/movie.<br /><br />  Thankfully most of the elements that made the series a hit are found in the film.  Samantha's zingers provide some great laughs and, of course, there is plenty of relationship talk.  The chemistry that made these four women a regular Sunday night fixture on HBO is also found on the big screen.  During a summer of big budget action/superhero films, \\"Sex\\" is a nice addition for all those who want a little diversion from exploding buildings and flying action heroes.<br /><br />  So for all of you who enjoyed the series, you will not be disappointed!  And if you didn't watch, I think you will still enjoy the movie.  A great date night movie!  Highly recommended!in an otherwise enjoyable show/movie.

B000001DQG|5.0|Although Caribou suffered to some extent from being the follow-up to Goodbye yellow brick road (how could he follow that?), it's long been an album that I liked and this re-issue strengthens it with the addition of four bonus tracks, two of which were originally released as the A-sides of singles.<br /><br />Bernie Taupin has admitted that he sometimes writes lyrics that don't necessarily make sense but otherwise sound good, so if you occasionally don't understand them, perhaps you're not meant to. Somnetimes the lyrics read as if they ought to make sense and it's just a case of figuring out what they mean. Whatever, Elton almost invariably manages to set great music to Bernie's lyrics, whether they make sense or not, and so it proves with this album and its bonus tracks.<br /><br />Altogether, there are four of Elton's classics here beginning with The bitch is back. It was never one of my favorite Elton songs partly because I've never quite understood the lyrics, but the music is great and Dusty Springfield is one of the four backing singers, so it's a great track with which to open the album. To my ears, the outstanding track here is Don't let the sun go down on me, a song in which both the lyrics and the music are brilliant. Here, Toni Tennille and two members of the Beach BNoys were among the four backing singers. Pinball wizard (originally by the Who) was featured in the rock opera Tommy and was originally offered to Rod Stewart (perhaps in part because he had a history bof hits with cover versions) but Rod turned down the chance and eventually the chance came Elton's way. Unlike Rod, Elton rarely records cover versions (if you exclude those that he recorded before he became famous) but he made a superb job of Pinball wizard. The fourth Elton classic here is his Christmas song, Step into Christmas. Generally, I prefer Christmas songs to be kept separate from other music but I don't mind this one being added here, especially as they made it the final track. It is therefore easy to stop the CD early to avoid hearing it at the wrong time of year. Of course, anybody who is interested in Christmas music can find the song easily on a Christmas compilation.<br /><br />Apart from those four famous songs, there are ten other songs here. Of these, Solar prestige a gammon contains lyrics that definitely do not make sense; I think Bernie may have written them deliberately to see what response the critics would give. There are much better songs here, most notably Grimsby (which paints a rosier picture of the town than you're likely to find elsewhere outside of a tourist guide) and Dixie Lady (a country-flavored song about a riverboat). Indeed, there are plenty of good songs on this album.<br /><br />While this is not regarded by most people as one of Elton's essential original albums, it remains one of my favorites.

0525948023|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has written what seems to me the definitive self help book in terms of freeing one's self from those annoying little things like emotional distress, general everyday fears, depression and disastrous mood swings.  The depth and clarity of his insight and the manner in which he expresses himself in this book are deceptively easy reading.  The ease with which one can apply his direction yields amazing and life changing results, and sometimes this happens very quickly, given one's willingness to take his suggestions and apply them right now.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who has a library of self-help books, to anyone who wants to change aspects of their own life, to anyone at all.  He's not preaching, there is nothing to \\"believe in\\", it's not a religion or any kind of groupie things.  It is for me, however, a fantastic blend of psychology, philosophy and spiritual insights, made into a practical workbook for just about anyone.
B0010X745K|2.0|Nice buildup, some excellent acting, good atmosphere early on as the mystery mist closes in and people start to crack under the pressure of fear and uncertainty. But the special effects are, in a word, ludicrous: if you thought the CGI spiders in the \\"Lost in Space\\" remake were cheesy, wait 'til you see the pinstriped models attacking people in the parking lot. And while I have no problem with downbeat endings, the ending Frank Darabont cooked up for this story is simply cold and nasty. Not recommended.

Although I had a little trouble initially understanding all the new-to-me weaving terminology, I was able to follow the book step by step with wonderful results.  By the time I got to the end, I was very comfortable using my loom, understood the concepts taught in weaving the sampler, and feel ready to try more techniques.  Great book!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I think the writing for this show is wonderful even if the historical details are not accurate.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I had been reading a lot of reviews here and at Collage. I was a bit skeptical about this dvd because while most of the reviews are glowing, the ones that aren't REALLY aren't. I figured I may be disappointed since I'm an advanced exerciser (I do Jari Love 3-4x/week).    However, since it was only $14.99 I headed over to a local bookseller yesterday and purchased it to start my own June 30 day shred today. Whoa. I started at Level 2 and I can say that for the advanced exerciser, you WILL sweat and get a great workout in under 30 minutes. That said, doing this workout alone won't get you shredded results. Make sure your eating habits are healthful as well, whether it be Jillian's book or otherwise (I'm a big fan of Dr. Ian Smith's Fatsmash).    Another thing I love, but found a bit confusing at first, is that Jillian gets up and EXPLAINS what needs to be done at both levels. It was confusing because at first I thought we were done. But that's nothing that can't be fixed by previewing or practice.    The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the complaint that seems to be frequent. The unskippable intro. Remove that and it's a solid 5.
B00169XU8I|5.0|If you are a Madonna fan, it is entirely impossible to dislike this cd.  Madonna fans, by nature, love to dance and have a good time.  Hard Candy encourages you to do both.      Unlike other popsters (yeah, Mariah, Janet, Britney, I'm talking to you), Madonna doesn't hide behind the beats and jams that make her albums so fun.  Madonna isn't afraid of us hearing her imperfect voice and I really appreciate being able to hear the voice of the person singing.  If I have to hear one more whispering song from those other ladies, I'll probably lose my lunch.      Madonna doesn't have the strongest voice.  Duh.  Madonna isn't necessarily the nicest/softest person in the world.  Really?  But Madonna is creative, persistent, unapologetic and inspiring.  She is as relevent today as she was 20yrs ago and this just chaps the hides of those who dislike her.      I bought the Candy Box on top of the regular cd because I wanted something not everyone would have.  I love to dance and shake my bootay so I'll sign off now so I can crank this up and do some cleaning!  Cleaning never has been so fun!      See you at her concerts!  xox
0143113100|5.0|This book could easily be mistaken for a self-help book. It may serve that purpose for some readers, but it is actually more of a science documentary about the amazing learning powers of the human brain, complete with fascinating and well-written interviews of a number of influential brain scientists, and comprehensive end notes. Doidge is an excellent writer, making his complex subject matter very understandable and down-to-earth by adding personal touches here and there. He manages to do this without being obtrusive or annoying as some authors with an agenda do. His agenda is pretty simple: don't believe the saying, \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\\" He details a wide variety of cases where one would assume that the brain is finished learning and improving, but - surprise! - it learns. He explores the concept of \\"brain plasticity,\\" meaning its ability to be molded like plasticine modeling clay that never hardens. Here are some examples, each of which takes up most of a chapter:<br /><br />Paul Bach-y-Rita developed devices that allow the blind to see again via their tactile sense, and to restore the sense of balance to people who have damage to their vestibular system. Accelerometers send tiny electrical stimuli to the patient's tongue, training them to walk gracefully without falling again.<br /><br />Michael Merzenich developed auditory training systems that speed up processing in the brains of dyslexics and autistic children, and it seems, in anyone who goes through the course. This allows them not only to read and write better, but to listen and communicate better.<br /><br />Jeffrey Schwartz developed cognitive training, based on brain scans of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, that allows patients to \\"shift the gear\\" out of their brain-lock by practicing new thoughts, and new actions, instead of repeating compulsions.<br /><br />Edward Taub developed \\"constraint-induced therapy\\" for people paralyzed by stroke. By constraining the good limb and forcing patients to use the affected limb, new brain circuits can be called into service to replace lost brain tissue and restore movement and sensation.<br /><br />For someone whose arm has been amputated, using the affected limb is not an option...or is it? V. S. Ramachandran helps patients who have pain or other annoying feelings coming from their phantom (imagined) limb, by having them practice moving their good arm next to a mirror that somehow tricks the brain into thinking the phantom limb can move, too. After enough mirror-box training with symmetrical orchestra-conductor movement commands to their phantom and real arms, the phantom problems vanish.<br /><br />There are accurate descriptions of basic science research highlighting different aspects of brain plasticity, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation by Alvaro Pascual-Leone, and adult neurogenesis by Fred Gage.<br /><br />Doidge describes a few of his own psychotherapy cases that take advantage of brain plasticity, and reviews a number of concepts from Freud that remain useful today in getting patients to change unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors.<br /><br />This is the best book on brain plasticity that I know of, a topic that is often given marginal coverage in otherwise good neuroscience textbooks. He has done a good job of gathering and explaining a spectrum of examples showing that this is what the brain, especially the human brain, does well: change itself. Important historical context is included, showing us how the notion of functional remodeling in the brain has met with much resistance in the neuroscience community for decades. The interviewees Doidge chose are neuroscience pioneers that I often speak of in neuroscience courses I teach at Georgia Tech.<br /><br />My only criticism with the book is the inclusion of some material in the chapter on sexual attraction and love, about deviant sexual behavior. Not for kids, or the squeamish. It seems out of place, as if the editors feltit would boost sales by giving it an NC-17 rating. He did not have to appeal to our prurient side, since the book has so much else to offer.<br /><br />Readable by lay people and scientists alike, the index and end notes allow this book to serve as a starting point for further reading on all of its topics.appeal to our prurient side, since the book has so much else to offer.

B000002A3T|4.0|Of all the things that can be said about this album, just one comes to mind: Good. Good music. Good lyrics. A good album to listen to over and over again. Remembering how much much crap there is today and in the nineties makes appreciate this album all the more. In the world of music today where substance and musicianship is looked down upon and looks and singles are praised, it's no wonder why the Floyd are still relevent.    My best friend is also a big Pink Floyd fan and he thinks Division Bell is their best album. Blasphemy you say! I might not go that far but listening to this album makes me think that he might be right on some degree. This not a major concept album by any means but does have a theme: division; seperation. It comes through even when there are no words like in the instrumentals Cluster One and Marooned. Probably one of the two best instrumentals by Pink Floyd. I like how they incorporated different audio sounds into this album. Most were subtle like the sound of an ocean in Marooned or the ringing of the bell and a ring anouncer speaking during Lost for Words. Perhaps that's what I like about this album the most is the subtle things and not the hit you over the head stuff that was so typical in other Pink Floyd albums with Roger Waters. I like how different the songs are in this album. You go from a soft instumental to a funky song like What Do You Want From Me. You even hear a U2 sounding song. A lot of variety. To me if you just want to listen to good album on a trip or just relaxing at home, this is the one you should get.
B00164KYS2|4.0|Movie started GREAT but had a RUSHED ENDING!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I really liked the movie but it wasn't a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10 i'd probably rate it a 7 or 8. I thought the beginning of the movie was great and had a great pace from scene to scene. Then around 20 to 30 minutes before the movie ended, everything seemed so rushed. I know some people thought 2 hours and 20 or 30 mins is a really long movie. 140 mins for a movie ain't that bad especially if you've been a fan of the show since 1998. If you can have a SATC marathon watching 1 season non stop you can handle a movie that's a little over 2 hours. Anyways it really did start off well but towards the end i feel like the director or editor wanted the movie to hurry up & end since it was already over 120 mins that they just got sloppy with how the editing & pacing of the ending was handled etc.<br /><br />SATC is a great show & always will be even though it was only seasons 1 - 3 that had all the MAGIC & SPUNK as seasons 4 - 6 i didn't really care 4. At that point they ran out of story lines & it was time 4 girls in their 30's to grow up & finally do what the majority of people in society do, which is get married & have babies. Nothing exciting about that. It's more fun when you're on the dating circuit from hell. Overall the movie had some great highlights but of course never had the witty comedy & conversations that season 1 - 3 had. Yeah the GURLS looked really OLD, & their age was really showing and at this point and sometimes the best technology in the world can't air brush wrinkles out of a movie. Ironically their male counter parts were aging so gracefully & looked younger then the gals. I guess that's the world we live in when the ones who don't hold onto their VANITY age better then the actual ones that do. Men in their 40's will always be able 2 get any girl & the same can't be said for women of the world. I was shocked 2 see so many people in the audience crying in certain scenes. The show was obviously canceled because it lost its magic & people weren't tuning in each week for the 4 gals. But a movie in my opinion was a great idea. The audience in Manhattan last night were full of girls dressed up & rocking 6 inch stilettos and tons of gay men. There was even this Latin Spanish HARLEM mess with an awful white t-shirt & lavender pants & a purse. I guess he thought he was a lady & could carry around a purse.<br /><br />I hope the SATC DVD movie will be a 2 disc collector's edition with original theatrical release & then an UNRATED extended edition that will be 3 hours long 2 really satisfy all the SATC fans. That way we can see Steve's hot AZZ some more lol. One sad point was my GURL Samantha didn't get LAID in the movie. She's so great on the show & literally gets laid in every episode but in the movie she doesn't.

0783225881|1.0|I love baseball and have a great relationship with my father, yet found this to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.    1. Ridiculously convoluted plot.  It had promise for about 10 minutes then completely fell apart.  Ease his pain? Seriously.  What did Burt Lancaster's and James Earl Jones' characters have anything to do with the movie?  Was Jones written into the plot just to spew off a few contrived lines about baseball?  And the doctor \\"crossing the line\\" scene was a joke at best.  The entire point of the plot was to somehow lead to father and son playing catch.  Wow, what a creative, inspiring ending.      2. OVERACTING.  Kevin Costner is a marginal actor at best, and the whiny frustrated farmer role is laughable in this movie.  Should I laugh when he gets \\"frustrated\\" with the voice?  And Busfield's rant/shake the daughter scene was pathetic.  And the \\"Oh my god! Where did these ballplayers suddenly come from?\\" expression was priceless.      3. Cheesy.  Tries way, way too hard to force the father-son-baseball-bonding theme down everyone's throat.  If Jones or Costner or the doctor would have spouted off one more sappy line about baseball, I might have thrown up.  But I guess some people like the overdramatic garbage.    After watching this movie with my dad, I felt bonded to him in that we were both cracking up laughing at just how bad the movie turned out to be.  I had high hopes after Bull Durham, but they were shot down about 20 minutes into this stinker.      \\"Ease his pain.\\"  That just about sums it up.
B0017HLG4E|5.0|Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts. The first part of the book deals with that encounter.<br /><br />While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. They even go away on a trip together. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials. The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war, had tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity, as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.<br /><br />To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna. He stoically remains throughout the trial, realizing as he hears the evidence that she is refusing to divulge the one piece of evidence that could possibly absolve her or, at least, mitigate her complicity in the crimes with which she is charged. It is as if she considers her secret,  more shameful than that of which she is accused. Yet, Michael, too, remains mute on the one salient fact that would throw her legal, if not her moral, guilt into question. Consequently, Hanna finds herself bearing the legal guilt of all those involved in the crime of which she is accused and is condemned accordingly.<br /><br />The third part of the book is really the way Michael deals with having found Hanna, again. He removes himself from further demonstration and discussion on the issue of Germany's Nazi past. It affects his decisions as to his career in the law, eventually choosing a legal career that is isolating. He marries and has a child but finds that he cannot be free of Hanna. He cannot be free of the pain of having loved Hanna. It is as if Hanna has marked him for life. He divorces and never remarries. It is as if he cannot love another, as he loved Hanna. Michael then reaches out to Hanna in prison, indirectly, through the secret they share of what she seems to be most ashamed. Yet, he carefully never personalizes the contact. The end, when it comes, is almost anti-climatic.<br /><br />The relationship between Michael and Hanna really seems to be analogous to the relationship between the generations of Germans in post-war Germany. The affair between Michael and Hanna is representational of the affair that Germany had with the Nazi movement. The eroticism of the book is a necessary component for the collective guilt and shame that the Germans bear for the Holocaust, as well as for the moral divide that seemingly exists between the generations. Yet, the book also shows that such is not always a black and white issue, that there are sometimes gray areas when one discusses one's actions in the context of the forces of good and evil. There is also the issue of legal and moral responsibility. One would think that the two are synonymous, but they are not always so. Italso philosophizes on the ability to love another/a nation who/that was complicit in war crimes. This is an insightful, allegorical book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have been a Donna fan since I first heard her moan her way through \\"Love To Love You Baby\\". In the past I looked forward to the different musical influences that would be infused into her \\"disco\\" music especially the massive double vinyl \\"Bad Girls\\" release. Over the years she has recorded several full length releases after the disco craze with mixed reviews and popularity-think \\"Cats Without Claws\\" or \\"Mistaken Identity\\". While I loved most there were some that left me scratching my head and thinking \\"what happened\\"? One thing I couldn't deny whether I agreed with the direction of the music or not was \\"the voice\\". Some have it and some don't, it's that simple. Apparently that doesn't matter much anymore just listen to the slew of \\"singers\\" that have hits, it's all about the beats and or sample. One has to wonder would any of these songs be hits if it were not for the sample/hook borrowed from past massive hits. There are no samples on this release. That being said the voice is right on target as usual albiet there is some vocal manipulation on some of the tracks. The songs and lyrics range in style but all have a contemporary sound to them that can be matched head to head with anything out in the market today on pop radio. I love most of the songs and like the others. This CD as a whole is well worth the cost, she does look wonderful in the pictures (what that has to do with a singer I've yet to figure out). If you want a straight forward dance CD this is probably not for you. Look to Madonna's Confession release, Cher's last 2 releases or a dance artist that makes only that type of music. In other words save the money, buy the dance remix singles and you'll be very happy. If you want a CD of music that takes you through several moods/styles, hence the name \\"Crayons\\", won't bore you after a couple of listens and want stellar vocals this CD will give you your money's worth. There's everything from the raggae influenced Crayons to the disco loungy I'm A Fire to thearena anthemy Stamp Your Feet and even a summery breezy calypso song titled \\"Driving Down Brazil\\". Some ballads, some rock influened cuts you name it, it's on here.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I am so glad I got the Blu-ray version! The picture quailty is fantastic,as it really enhhanced the viewing experience.Will Smith did a fantastic job in carrying this movie. I was impressed. I highly recommend this movie on Blu-ray!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|While I understand the business side of the music industry and the importance of appealing to the youth obsessed world we live in there's no excuse for bad, irrelevant, juvenile writing. The beats might be there due to the use of the current \\"hot\\" producers she worked with, however, the lyrics just kind of melt away like candy in the hot sun. Madonna will of course continue to sell based on a rather large fan (me being one of them) base and the fact that she continues to have hits since her peak (Vogue) albiet the hits are fewer and farther in between. Thats not to say the candy is stale but maybe just a little past expiration date. If you're a Madonna junkie this release will be \\"your chocolate fix\\". If you like Madonna more on the dance side this candy might be a little too hard to swallow. There are some truly great cuts though like the melancholy and beautiful \\"Miles Away\\", the bouncy \\"Give It To Me\\" (what's that get stupid get stupid breakdown in the middle)...I edited it out using music editing software....much better without that), the funktified fun romp \\"4 Minutes\\" (what's with the whole Ma-donna Ma-donna thing that Justin does....I think we know we're listining to Madge...reminds me of the live audience chanting Madonna Madonna in the 12 inch release of \\"Angel\\" one of her older releases...just isn't fresh and a bit narcissitic from a woman of her age and status...not great like Confessions but solid effort.
B00000295Y|5.0|Man I can't believe it took so a long time to buy this classic album! Cypress Hill are by far one of the best Latino rap groups to walk the face of the earth. This stuff was hot as ever back in the day, and nearly 15 years later people still ride to it. This album gives a good look at the Latino and Hispanic/gangsta lifestyle. Here's my track guide:<br /><br />1. I Wanna Get H*gh / 10/10, this is real dope material that isn't made anymore! The horn at the beginning is simply entrancing.<br />2. I Ain't Goin' Out Like That / 8/10, this is a pretty cool rap, it's catchy and has smart lyrics. Cypress have got to be geniuses if sample the lengendary Black Sabbath<br />3. Insane In The Brain / 10/10, legendary material that make you want to get up and dance everytime you hear it! I love that Simpsons episode it's in.<br />4. When The S*it Goes Down / 10/10, straight up real stuff. There is also an extended version of it on the Freedom Writers soundtrack.<br />5. Lick A Shot / 7/10, this shows an agressive and more determined Cypress. It's not as good as their other songs, but it's good to listen  when your feeling hyper.<br />6. C*ck The Hammer / 8/10, I think this is one of the best songs ever made! It's repetitive beat will really grab your attention.<br />7. Lock Down / 9/10, although this is an instrumental song/interlude it still is probably one of the best songs on here. It's got kind of a classic feel to it, and could have been longer.<br />8. 3 Lil' Putos / 10/10, \\"One little, two little, three hoodlums betta hit the ground cuz here the sl*g comes!\\" This is such a tight song, and it's got a couple funny lyrics.<br />9. Legalize It / 7/10, this really throws off the album's tightness and is too short. It's still a groovy and gives you great information about m*rijuana and h*mp.<br />10. Hits From The B*ng / 9/10, a really weird and unique lyrical expression about w*ed and b*ngs. I love the line, \\"This s*it here is so bad it will straight'n yo d*ck out!\\" Funny stuff.<br />11. What Go Around, Come Around, Kid 7/10, a good song but not as good as some of the others.<br />12. A To The * 8/10, just by listening, you can tell talent was put into this track. It contains one of the best rap choruses ever made.<br />13. Hand On The G*ock 9/10, this is a classic song and a very good sequel to \\"Hand On The P*mp\\" from their previous album.<br />14. Break Em Off Some 8/10, a short and speedy song that finishes the album nicely. The little kids background vocals are funny.<br /><br />A lot of work was put into this dope album, and you can tell it all paid off well. This is real hip/hop that's way better than Soulja Boy, D4L, Rocko or any of that new stuff. It's also nice to know there aren't any lyrics that put women down, which was uncommon for back in 1993. B-Real also is stronger than he was lyrically on this album than he was on 1991's \\"Cypress Hill\\". Take my word for it this is one of the best hip/records ever, so don't be afraid to check it out!

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Let me first say that I was really psyched to see this movie.  After renting it and watching it over the weekend, I have to say this is in my top 3 of all time WORST movies.  The blair witch camera angles are my first complaint, the acting was even worse, and the story was so bad it made me want to watch a Uwe Boll film.  I will say that the monster was pretty cool looking and that was the only positive thing about the movie. Let me tell you all the bad things about the movie, first the monster appears out of nowhere and you don't find out where it came from.  The story was so bad, one of the brothers sleeps with a girl before he is going to leave for Japan for a new job.  They have a fight at his going away party and leaves with another guy.  So the monster appears and creates havoc through out the city, so everyone is crossing the brooklyn bridge to escape the monster and he receives a phone from Beth (the girl that he slept with and had a fight with at his going away party) saying that she is traped and needs help.  Right after the phone call the monsters tail knocks out the bridge and kills his brother.  After seeing his brother die guess what he does?  He tells his remaining friends that he has to go find Beth.  So his best friend, his brothers girl friend and some other chick all go with him to save his booty call.  Oh I forgot to mention that there are these little monster that I guess live in the big monster or ride the big monster, again you have no explantaion about this.  So the one girl gets bit by one of this monster and she pretty much explodes later on.  But still after seeing that he still has to go and save his booty call.  Let me say the ending is the most dumbest I have ever seen.  It ends with them in under a bridge in centrel part and saying that they love each other and a bomb hits close by and the bridge collapses on top of them, THE END.  You have no idea what happens to the monster, it just ends like that.  Please don't waste you 1hr 15 minon the film, it is so DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000GTJT16|1.0|Great movie, wrong format. HD is dead and stinkin'. I returned the two HD movies I bought because I thought they were Blu-Ray. I did not realize that HD movie format DVD's were being unloaded on the public who is dumb enough to buy them (like me),when HD is gone the way of the Do Do Bird. Got any Beta format movies? How about some 8 track tapes?
0812971825|5.0|The author has a beautiful command of the English language.I found this a slow start but I rapidly became engrossed with the characters involved.I find myself thinking about the people and the quality of their lives. It is a powerful read addressing losses in peoples lives and how they cope. I will keep this book and reread it again. I will also reread certain passages in the book...I thought they were very wise and a personal challenge to look at my own life.  I liked her first book but this is a deeper study of people and the meaning of their lives. It stimulates great book club conversations.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was really apprehensive about this video.  Although the reviews are great, I was nervous that it would be way too intense for me.  Although I used other workout videos, I basically became sedimentary for a few months.  I always start a video with a lot of excitement, but they can never hold my attention.      This video is different, though.  Not only did it hold my attention, it was completely doable - even for a person who hasn't gotten off the couch in months.  It's very tough and it definitely makes you sweat, but it's totally worth it.  It's the only video that I've wanted to get up and do during my rest day.  Jillian is very motivating in a non-annoying or evasive way.      I wanted to quit so many times during the first and second time during this video, but I knew I just couldn't.  I kept telling myself that I only had to do 3 minutes (strength) or 2 minutes (cardio) or 1 minute (abs) and if I couldn't do 3,2 or 1 minute of working out, I never would.  Next thing I knew, I was finished and drenched in sweat.  Although she doesn't give a lot of time to rest or get water, in between each circuit, I found time to grab a bottle of water and take a drink.    I know the workout is working because I not only have more endurance but my pants are looser and my shirts are hanging off of me more.  I never weighed myself before doing the workout, but I know I've lost inches.    A lot of people are having trouble with the un-skipable beginning.  However, I left mine DVD in the player and it went right to the workout.  On my computer, it skips right to the workouts too.
B00005M91K|5.0|The photography in this movie is excellent. It should be a must in everyone's collection.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Veronica Mars for its flawed heroine and story threads. Veronica was capably played by Kristen Bell, sarcastic, witty and judgmental, I cheered and commiserated with all the characters and was disappointed that the end was so up in the air. Why is it always the intelligent shows that get canned? Perhaps the 'powers that be' are asking the wrong people what they watch.
B00169XU8I|5.0|i have been a fan for 25 years.   from holiday to four minutes she has been the soundtrack to  my life.  However I could live without Kanye West - he is an obnoxious self important worthless wannabe megastar - he sucks.    but I will forgive her, god he pisses me off.  but back to madonna  - the pictures are awesome.  The songs are contagious. another priceless gem from our lady madonna

Just the right amount of tension for a little one - mommy goes away for a while - and then mommy comes back with food.  We got this as a gift because we remembered it so fondly from when we read it to our son.  It's a bit more \\"obscure\\" than \\"Goodnight Moon\\" so we figured no one else would think of it.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Holding a handheld camera during a major crisis instead of dropping everything and running for your life is arguably far fetched, but still makes for a fun way to watch a monster movie.  I know many didn't like this movie, perhaps only because of the guilt for all the time they spent participating in the hype leading up the release, but hey at least they showed the damn thing, I mean thank god they didn't go blair witch about it.  To sum this up, there is no ultimate showdown, which means like the energizer bunny, it goes on leaving you with questions that are yet to be answered.  Sorry but that's the way it is, at least for now, for a sequel and spending your own time investigating and looking for clues through out Cloverfield are your best bet.  If you just want to see a monster rampage through new york, then this should do the trick.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|[[VIDEOID:21433901]]Here's some general thoughts on this series. I ended up doing it in four parts but only one could be posted here.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Bublé's new album can be played on a loop for hours. His voice has such control and a wonderful tone, there's hardly any song he can't sing. My personal favorites have to be his original hits, \\"Lost\\" and \\"Everything,\\" since they have a nice updated sound. For a fast-paced salsa, go with \\"It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio Stasera).\\" The jazz song, \\"I'm Your Man\\" is so passionate, and all his others are right up there as well. Buy this album, it's timeless.
0385751532|5.0|While not a realistic Holocaust story, that is clearly beside the point.  The simplicity and naïveté with which Boyne portrays the main character in this story is both striking and startling.  This was a book written to elicit discussion and an emotional response from readers and succeeded on both counts.
1594481717|4.0|I'm surprised at how some people are blaming the book for not going deeply enough into the economic challeges facing the U.S. Folks, this book isn't \\"The World is Flat\\" or \\"The Post-American World.\\" The author does a fantastic job of giving us an OVERVIEW of the challenges and then providing practical advice on how to expand your thinking. The book challenges readers to get outside their comfort zone and grow. He's never going to be asked to testify before Congress on his views, but I think he should be! His ideas about the way we need to change American education are thought-provoking.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I am not a died in the wool Madonna fan, I \\"like\\" her but I don't say my Hail Madonna's before I go to bed. That said, I gotta give it to madge this time out, she crafted a very nice body of music. Unlike Lauper train wreck of Cd, this cd is good to listen to even if your not drunk on the dance floor. Good Job Madge!!!
0446402389|3.0|There are really two books here, one is a police procedural and the other is a love story.  One works, one doesn't.  As a debut writer, Smith falls into too many cliches when it comes to his love story, and more than anything else it gets in the way of the murder mystery.  The first half of the book which deals with living in Stalin's post WW2 tyranny is very well done and very authentic (except for the map on the end flaps).  The problem arises when Smith tries to work in a love story among the murders.    The story of Raisa and Leo is too forced and too pat to be interesting and doesn't add anything to the story but length.  The bad guy, Vasili could have been taken from a stock Warner Brothers WW2 Gestapo agent.  He does everything but sneer and twirl his mustache.  The connection between the murderer and the cop is way too coincidental and again adds nothing to the story but triteness.  A good editor could have made this a great book by getting rid of the saccharine scenes of the Russian Peasants and stayed on message of chasing the bad guy.
B00E5I2MCM|5.0|2008's \\"Iron Man\\" is a very good screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero. Robert Downey Jr. is astonishingly good as Tony Stark, cocky and cynical billionaire weapons inventor, who rediscovers his humanity while a prisoner of terrorists. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts, his beautiful and very capable personal assistant, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a dark role as Stark's ruthless corporate deputy. Terrence Howard is Stark's strait-laced military liaison.<br /><br />As the story opens, Stark is in Afghanistan to show off a new weapon. His convoy is ambushed, and Tony wakes up in a cave, a survivor of unorthodox heart surgery by another captive. The terrorists demand that he build them a super weapon. Instead, Tony improvises an iron suit that allows him to escape.<br /><br />Tony is a changed man when he returns to the U.S. He takes his company out of the arms business and locks himself in a lab to build a better iron suit. When he reemerges, he discovers he has lost control of the company to truly ruthless opponents. Only with his new iron man suit will Tony have a chance to set things right.<br /><br />In a movie loaded with high tech and suspenseful action sequences, Downey is entirely convincing as the man in an iron mask. Paltrow isn't given a whole lot to do, but as viewers now know, there are two sequels to watch after this \\"Iron Man.\\" Highly recommended.
B00164KYS2|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was fabulous!  I will be pre-ordering this as soon as it's available.  I can't wait.  We bought our tickets days ahead and good thing, because they were sold out that day.  The theatre was packed with women, lots bringing in their own cosmos.  The movie was such an experience!  If you're a fan of the show, you're going to soak up this movie like a sponge.  The fashion, the storylines, the whole thing was great.  You will not be disappointed.      Some people are writing poor reviews, but they are uptight, priggish women who have no sense of fun.  Come on!  Why can't you enjoy the fantasy?  It's like being with your best friends in one of the best cities in the world.  Who cares that their wardrobes are too expensive in these times of a gas-crisis and real estate letdowns?  It's a MOVIE! Just enjoy it.  If you want real life, then just stay out of the theatre.  Live your boring, plain-jane lives and leave the fabulousness of SATC to us girls who know how to have fun!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I'm always looking forward to a Madonna album. I'm a huge fan I've gone to several of her concerts and enjoyed hearing her. I've bought every album and single. This album does nothing for her, she has lost all credibility. She can do so much better than this. I love timberland and Justin but the crap they wrote and produced for her does not suit her. Madonna better produce something better than this. next time She needs to go back to her old producers and work on something better.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The music for this movie is wonderful.  We have the CD as well and listen to it all the time. The movie itself was very real--raw emotions, down-to-earth, with likable characters.  That's pretty amazing given that the \\"actors\\" were not actors but musicians.
B0015519VS|4.0|This new release by Usher is more than welcome. Seventeen easy listening, very likable R&B tracks. Less than one third of the tracks (\\"Love in This Club\\" featuring Young Jeezy, \\"This Ain't Sex\\", \\"What's Your Name\\" and \\"Appetite\\" contains more of an upbeat style, while the rest shows a romantic, whole-hearted side both lyrically and melodically. Both versions of \\"Love in This Club\\" of this record reflect these two different moods. Particularly, I prefer the second one featuring Beyonce and Lil Wayne. The last track, \\"Here I Stand\\" hides a short song, that seems to be called - apparently - called \\"Will Work for Love\\" that begins playing after two minutes of waiting, and is available as a separate track for the digital download version.<br /><br />Four Stars. This album is very good and will play on my CD player for quite a good time.
B0014KD46W|5.0|I first heard of Steve Winwood in the 80's while still in high school. He had a few hits during that time that made there way into the pops charts when videos were becoming increasingly popular and better made. I had no idea that it would take me another 20+ years before I'd actually purchase an album of his and fall in love with his perfect pitch voice and the seemingly endless array of genres of music he can play.  I downloaded the music after hearing 'Dirty City' played on the morning news on the release date. It caught my attention and did not let go. After reviewing the other samples I immediately purchased the entire album. From beginning to end you will enjoy this 9 song collection.  From the acoustic 'I'm Not Drowning' through the funk & jazz inspired 'Hungry Man' to the gospel-organ tinged 'At Times We Do Forget' I was completely thrilled with this album.<br /><br />I am someone who will rock out with Jay-Z or Linkin Park, listen to Nine Inch Nails, Celine and Mariah Carey. But every now and then I will want to relax and get a dose of Steve and his silky voice. A true music fan of any kind will enjoy this album.  Don't limit yourselves.  You will also hear Brazil and African drum influences as well.  With a great sound system you hear and feel so many colors in this music, I don't see how you can't...
076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson brilliantly weaves in American values and culture into social issues, current events, and daily lives. One of the themes Bryson focuses on is the interaction between the average citizen and the U.S. government. The government, at times, can have an approachable face; his local postal office provides free donuts on customer appreciation day, and a Social Security Administration employee calls him Bill and tells him how to get strawberry pop stains out of his shirt. In most cases, however, the government is depicted as an inefficient and faceless organization that never has a real person on the line when you call its services for help. When there is a problem, people hold the government responsible; therefore there is not a single branch in the enormous bureaucracy to blame because it is everyone's fault. American culture brands the government as a big, clumsy bureaucracy and thus heightens the sense of inefficiency and distrust of the government among the people. We should recognize the fact that the government did not intend to be labeled as an inefficient organization by questioning a five year old girl at the immigration office whether she intends to practice polygamy in the U.S and such; it genuinely attempts to improve the lives of its citizens. For example, it tried to enhance security in Milwaukee airport by training the local sheriff's deputies to detect hidden explosives, which, by the way, failed miserably because the deputies forgot where they hid the explosives.

Great and entertaining, full of stories, tips, etc.
B0015XASFS|4.0|I was able to attend this concert and it was so much fun to watch it all over again. Especially since this time I could actually see him (I could only get tickets WAY in the back) and be able to hear him (we had some VERY annoying screaming girls behind us). However, I was very disappointed to see how much of the concert had been cut out.<br /><br />This DVD mainly only showed his singing, which was beautiful, but there were SO many fun parts that they'd taken out. They took out where his guest (sorry. I forgot her name) was showing him how to dance. Hilarious! Then he also was given some gifts by the audience, including a cowboy hat and \\"Elton John\\" glasses (as he called them) and would sing as he wore them making impersonations. But my FAVORITE part was when he was signing autographs for a minute for the audience and a little girl came and sat down next to him. He had her sign autographs too and then a little while later he sang \\"Not While I'm Around\\" to her (which is one of my favorite songs). It was SO touching!<br /><br />I loved the DVD. It was a lot of fun to watch again, but I was very disappointed that so much was cut out. I wish they would've kept at least some of it in there.

0060751967|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the following books in the series. Kerrelyn Sparks is a fantastic writer, she truly draws you into the world of these Vamps. I was thoroughly impressed with the characters, and although the series doesn't centre on one particular pair, each book is dedicated to one main Vamp who finds his true Love, it is a fantastic journey that i was more than happy to undertake, and i am thoroughly looking forward to any further books in the series.
B000063JZQ|5.0|As a high school English teacher, I have shown many different versions of Shakespeare's outstanding play to my classes.  Of all the versions I've used, this one seems to capture my kids' interest the most.  I love the fact that all of the dialogue is almost word-for-word from the play, and the acting is first-rate by everyone in the film.  (I do wish someone could tell me, though, why all the \\"Scottish\\" characters speak with a British accent? :))<br /><br />While the other reviews point out some obvious areas for concern, such as brief nudity and some blood and gore, I believe this adds some realism to the film, and 17-18 year old students (this is usually included in the senior-level curriculum) should be able to view it objectively if warned of the adult content.  (However, I fully understand and respect any students' wishes not to view these scenes, and only show them if there are no objections.)  That being said, it is a fine adaptation of the classic play, and a very good enrichment activity if used after, or even during, the reading of the play.<br /><br />BTW, I also recommend the Unabridged Audio CD version of \\"Macbeth\\" by the Arkangel Company-- I found that here on Amazon as well, and it really helps the kids understand the dialogue if they hear it as they read.  The actors even use a Scottish accent, which adds more realism to the reading.<br /><br />Overall, Polanski's sweeping film is a very useful and interesting accompaniment to the play itself.  (One last thing-- that's Banquo on the cover, not Macbeth.  Just an observation....)
0312360266|5.0|I was amazed by the world that both of the Cast's have constructed in this series. The premise is quite basic - a school for potential Vamps. A college where those who have been 'marked' turn to in order to be integrated into the world that they may very soon be entering. The fact that as the story progresses you see that nothing is ever as it seems, and that although they are Vampires they are far from perfect, is an entertaining read! I fell in love with the main characters, you truly do feel for them and their predicaments, while at the same time you find yourself muttering to the ages of your book, you idiot why on earth did you do that for? Knowing ofcourse that the characters can't hear you, but you feel that bond with them as though you are a part of that closeknit group. The Casts have painted a well thought out and engaging story, and i am eagerly awaiting the release of book four! Definitely worth a read - you won't regret it!
B000TM1CL0|4.0|In an age of reality television - consisting anywhere from choosing bisexual partners, watching MTV wannabee starlets or families with swapped moms to surviving in the wilds of foreign countries - Shark is entertainment with laughs, sexuality, crime and drama. James Woods and his cast of young, attractive, savvy, intelligent lawyers battle criminals through courtroom drama while spicing up voids with appropriate sexual tensions. In short, it's worth the investment and it's commercial-free. Buy it! It's a welcome break....we're waiting for season two's release.
B00000G3I2|4.0|When I first saw Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill I was a seventeen year old high school senior and I'll admit the story did not do a lot for me. Now, some twent-five years later after the idealism of youth fades into a daily grind the movie has much more meaning.    A group of seven friends plus the current girlfriend of the deceased gathers together on the weekend of the funeral of a friend who committed suicide. The friends feel that he had no real reason for what he did and are left searching for answers. In the three days that follow they must reexamine who they are and the choices that led them to this point in their lives.    The film features an incredible script written by Kasdan and Barbara Benedek and fine performances from its ensemble cast. The disc also includes a where are they now featurette and some deleted scenes. The film quality is good for a twenty five year old film even though the picture is a little soft. The sound has been remastered into Dolby 5.1 and comes across as crisp and clean.    This is a film for a more mature audience who understands the twists and turns of fate and of friendship. It is absolutely essential viewing.
B00164KYS2|4.0|I should preface my comments - the HBO series is still one of my favorite of all time.  Not because it was consistently the best thing on Sunday nights when it originally aired, but because it was unafraid of pushing people's limits about what was attractive, what was socially acceptable and what was 'ok' for women to think, say and feel.<br /><br />I thought that the series ending was one of the best and most well-written show closures of all time so I was a little unsure of where the movie would actually go that was 'better' than the show's ending.  After seeing it (something many of you should consider doing before writing a review of it - if you want to trash the show, go review one of the DVD sets) I was nervous unnecessarily.  I think creating it was another way of pushing us out of our comfort zones.  \\"You had such a great series, why risk ruining that?\\"<br /><br />I thought that the movie was everything the show was - a realistic mix of emotional, superficial, silly, heartbreaking and, ultimately, fulfilling.  I spent many Sunday nights over 6 years of my life getting to know the characters and the movie, like the show, showed that regardless of the passage of time or the life experiences the characters would have had in 4 years, they, like us, didn't change much.  Their flaws are still there, though they all appear to have gotten better at managing them.  The friendships are still there, and the actors' affection for their characters was readily apparent as they slipped back into them with ease.<br /><br />Life doesn't have perfect endings, and it DOES go on, so I'm glad that the movie was made.  It is clear that they DID make the movie for the fans of the show, so if you weren't one, don't go see the movie.  But for those of us who enjoyed (through our frustration, disdain and ultimately acceptance of) watching these four women and their sincere and enduring friendships grow over time, save the mysoginistic insults about their looks (likely coming from non-JoliePitt's themselves) and their choices in life and let those of us who found the series - AND the movie - so much fun just enjoy the 2+ hours we get to spend reunited with them all.<br /><br />PS - if you're going to say that Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a 'foot' - at least have the character to give credit to Family Guy for the quote.and their choices in life and let those of us who found the series - AND the movie - so much fun just enjoy the 2+ hours we get to spend reunited with them all.

I highly recommend it.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Just lay your money down right now and get this album! I would be surprised that anyone who already loves Al Green, classic Soul/R&B, or just good music in general, wouldn't enjoy this album a lot - even love it. I instantly loved and connected with several songs on the very first listen, and the others have grown on me to the point of loving them as well. The guest appearances are classy, and do not in the least feel corny or contrived to appeal to a younger audience. There are no new hip hop leanings for Al, as with many other seasoned artist's albums. It's just music made the way it used to be!!!!! Just get it.
B00000DRVZ|5.0|Aerosmith ****1/2<br /><br />What a start. It is raw, bluesy, and amazing. While the production here isn't at say the level of Electric Ladyland or anything, the weak production adds to the charm of the record. Steven Tyler hadn't found his fantastic and classic voice yet (except on 'Dream On') and Joe Perry really hadn't mastered the guitar solo yet (or tuning it for that matter) but once again those minor quips seem to add something of a layer of innocence to this widely overlooked debut album from the bad boys from Boston (who are not even from there).<br /><br />'Make It' and 'Somebody' start the album, two Tyler originals. The opener being the better of the two, telling the story of a band on the rise. (autobiographical maybe?) 'Somebody' is your standard out of tune blues love song.<br /><br />'Dream On' enters by force showing the band that would come. Everything clicked on this track. Joe and Brad created one of the most amazing weaving guitar workouts ever. Tom and Joey held down the groove, and Tyler unleashed the voice, his amazing lyrical ability that is often over looked, and his great key work. For me, this is the best song of all time, untopable. And while it wouldn't be come a hit single for another three years, 'Dream On' was still a classic.<br /><br />'One Way Street' slides its way in become an early Aerosmith classic, and one of their all time best. This bluesy number features some of Brad Whitfords all time best guitar work. 'Mama Kin' was another extremely out of tune rocker with Perry's solo sounding like a bad live Hendrix performance (which Hendrix bad is better than most good) so that is saying something. 'Write Me' is standard, (no pun intended) but nothing to write home about, just a good listen. 'Moving Out' is one of the more original songs Aerosmith ever wrote, and that I have ever heard for that matter. It was the first song Tyler and Perry ever wrote together and it was amazing. The sound, the feel, the groove, Tyler's vocals/lyrics meshing with Perry's indescribable guitar work shows more so maybe than any of their other work why they are such a perfect team for one another. 'Walkin The Dog' the Rufus Thomas cover closes the album. I must say no one does covers like Aerosmith. Often they are better than the original and this is not exception. A great way to close the album.<br /><br />For a band still finding their way I would say Aerosmith is a solid debut that showed signs of what was to come, and glimmers of brilliance. Highly, highly recommended.ble guitar work shows more so maybe than any of their other work why they are such a perfect team for one another. 'Walkin The Dog' the Rufus Thomas cover closes the album.

B00005JPXY|1.0|Awlful, is giving this film more then it deserves. The first twenty minutes are spent at a party for a friend who is just being promoted and moving to Japan. It is observed and filmed by a member of the group who apparently has Parkinsons disease. The film will literally make your stomach upset and is really quite boring. Special effects are good ,but not worth the time.  The plot in non exsistant and the acting is putrid.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Bluesbreakers, John Mayall With Eric Clapton *****<br /><br />To not go track by track describing the genius of each track is going to be a challenge as every song here is worth outstanding merit. Before Bluesbreakers who knew Brits had so much soul, I know I didn't. But the music heard and played here is beyond comparison and beyond inspired. The heartfelt playing from Clapton would never be matched again, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs came mighty close but still falters in comparison to this. Mayall alone was a powerhouse already but teamed with the great Clapton and they were unstoppable.<br /><br />As you all know this was the album that made Clapton. He had the Yardbirds before this but this is what sparked the 'Clapton is God' graffiti all over England. Songs like 'Keys To Love' 'Hideaway' 'All Your Love' and 'Steppin Out' were all suspects for the cause. Even though some where covers the young kids didn't know that and thought they were Clapton originals, not that it matters because he did make them each his own. Mayall's reading of 'Parchment Farm' is as noteworthy as anything from Clapton as it is one of the top tracks on the album. Also the groups reworking of 'What'd I Say' is fantastic with a (not boring) drum solo.<br /><br />From start to finish Bluesbreakers is an energetic album that never fails to satisfy with each passing listen. After this Clapton would leave to go on to other things, and Mayall would find a replacement some would say was just as good, but it was the paring of Clapton and Mayall that made this record golden, and neither of them would ever top it ever again.
006112429X|3.0|This horrific story is well written.<br /><br />I don't like horror stories, and this was recommended by a friend. If at all Lionel starts a new genre: the soft macabre with slow suspense.<br /><br />For someone who did not know the story, it was slow to get into the rythm. Enough tips are given to keep an interest but the book gets better after the first 50 pages.<br /><br />At the end, there is a sign of rendition... Only those who have been close to a 'difficult' child can understand the difficulties of the mother. The story goes around a highschool killer who also murdered part of this family and did some other horrific things.<br /><br />The author plays with the reader, teasing us bluntly for our fascination with the horror, via the voice of the kid.<br /><br />If it was a fiction novel, I would have enjoyed it better. it is the bitter aftertaste that bothers me, the incapacity to hold the mother's missery for a while, the futility, the sorry, the confusion, the unanswered question: why?
B00004U2EZ|4.0|I love the music for the show. It is lyrical and emotional. One does not need to understand French to follow the pathos of the story. Fortunately, however, the DVD does offer the choice to have English subtitles. I have now watched this video 3 times and the parts of it I loved the first time I love even more now.   My complaint with this DVD is not the show but the editing. I have no idea what this show really looks like. I think the choreography is spectacular but, again, who knows. The film editing is done in MTV style, a cut to a different angle every 15 seconds. The staging for this show is huge which befits Notre Dame. The choreography uses the whole stage horizontially and vertically but because of the manic editing you have to watch the dance numbers several times to get an appreciation for this.   The look and style of the show is gorgeous. There is never any doubt that this is going to have a tragic ending. Don't buy this if you are expecting a French version of the Disney cartoon. (And because of Disney this will probably never be produced in the US)   And the actors... amazing, beautiful, soaring. But my favorite is Gringoire. And the actor who is Clopin is so good that I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle him myself. Ah, enjoy!   If you want a taste of this show, search for it on YouTube. Also look for the Italian version. French is the language of love, but Italian is the language of song.
0099450259|5.0|This is one of the best fiction books I've ever read.<br /><br />Unsual in the sense of the lack of connection with emotions by the main character. From the first page, you know there is something unusual, but you are not told, you get to experience the life of a boy who is just 'different'. It will keep you hooked from start to end.<br /><br />As the story unfolds the reader starts to create the story, only to change it few pages later, only to change it again. It is definitely a unique book. So interesting!
B00005Y7KX|5.0|All I can say is if you love Le Miz you will love Notre Dame. Unless you understand French or can also watch the DVD of this show, you may not get the political satire. You will, however, understand the tragic love story. The CD is well edited, the voices are rich and powerful, and the music and lyrics soar. Purchase this CD. You will not be disappointed.
0440418569|5.0|This trilogy was one of the best (quite possibly THE best) I've ever read. The Amber Spyglass was a wonderfully-written last book to the His Dark Materials.    Pullman appears to have a strong distaste for the Church--not without good reason, of course. I must say that the message I got from The Amber Spyglass was to love without limits, to question everything, and to quit preaching about the afterlife rather than helping others in the HERE AND NOW.     The story was unforgettable. The ending of this book (although slightly disappointing) made me cry..     I absolutely recommend this book.

0061537934|2.0|I love dogs, books about dogs and the relationship between dog and man. This book has a good premise. Enzo, a dog, wants to be reincarnated as a man and narrates the story of his owner Denny, a race car driver recounting years of particular hardship for the entire family.   The book has its moments both funny and touching and the narrative flows smoothly. The problem I had with it was that it was a little too predictable. Also, the characters are somewhat banal. The dog is the only one that I really cared about in the book. Denny and the other characters are developed well, but are too scripted and behave exactly as one would predict. One can predict the result of each twist and turn in advance. There are really no surprises.  It may have been interesting if Enzo's point of view was more dog like rather than a human. I am sure some dog lovers will love this book but it left me somewhat cold and dissatisfied.
006135323X|2.0|First, the good points.  The author turns our attention to some important things in human behavior. The comparison between 'social norms' (where people help each other and do good things for free) and the 'market behavior' is very interesting. Social norms in the work-place and social norms in education are very positive things.  Another very important point is the observation that young people can not make correct decisions when aroused. Thus, \\"Just Say No!\\" is really the right answer!  The negatives.   Well, many experiments and observations lack depth and scope. Most are done with students in prominent universities and therefore, can not be spread on the entire society. Young students often live in a special world of their own.  Next, the author sometimes extrapolates quite wrongly. For instance, in Chapter 11 where he discusses honesty/dishonesty in society, on pp. 214-215 the author writes:   \\"Adam Smith reminded us that honesty really is the best policy, especially in business. To get a glimpse at the other side of this realization - at the downside, in a society without trust - you can take a look at several countries. In China the word of one person in one region rarely carries to another region...Iran is another example of a nation stricken by distrust. An Iranian student at MIT told me that business there lacks a platform of trust\\".   OK, in the June 2008 issue of Scientific American there is a research article on the neurobiology of trust. On page 95 in that article we see a table 'National Trust' showing the trust levels in different countries. In this list of 30 countries the highest level of trust is found in Norway (above 60%), while China comes third (above 50%) and Iran fourth (50%), way above many European countries.   So, just because \\"An Iranian student at MIT told me\\", the author branded Iran as a nation \\"stricken by distrust\\" - and this in found in the chapter on honesty! What about the scientific method?
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|this is a solid album that lives up to the hype.  i'd have given it 5 stars, but i'm overly fond of the older portishead stuff.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|Even though my wife and I are not particularly fond of musicals we wanted to give this one a try mainly because of Tim Burton, who is a favourite director of ours. Unfortunately I have to say that this movie was just too much of a musical, we did not like any of the tunes and the movie was simply boring and awfully long drawn. A lot of blood though and Johnny Depp his usual brilliantly weird self. Will most certainly buy another Tim Burton and Johnny Depp but definitely not if it's a musical.  Chris
0670018651|4.0|I bought this book after reading a review commenting about the evocative writing.   I agree with it all.  This book is positively orchestral in the way it describes perfumes.  If you are searching for away to understand perfume options without having to be sprayed by all of the possibilities, take a look at this book.  I went out and bought small samples of 12 new perfumes after reading this book, and each one was a new experience heightened by what I had learned.  My only concern, and the reason I didn't give the book 5 stars, was that it occasionally assumed a level of perfume knowledge at times that I don't have, and I could have used a more basic introduction to terms and concepts.

B000PTYP84|4.0|For those who haven't purchased \\"Riot!\\" yet, this is definitely the version to get. Often times, re-releases of albums can just simply be a way for the label to milk money out of their bands while they're hot. However, excellent acoustic takes on \\"Misery Business\\" and \\"Pressure\\" and a good deal of live material on both the CD and DVD showcase a strong live band with fun and incredibly catchy pop-punk songs, making it one of the better \\"special editions\\" I've picked up.  The album itself showcases a youthful, energetic band with a hint of optimism that's a welcome change from most other bands in the same vein. Songs like \\"When It Rains\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\" are thoughtful with tight hooks, while the singles like \\"Misery Business\\" and \\"That's What You Get\\" are definite Warped Tour material. The band is solid and shows a lot of potential. Hayley's vocals are amazing and bassist Jeremy Davis, though perhaps underrated, is excellent on the instrument and should get a special mention.  I give this a four stars due to the short length of the DVD, but with 5 bonus tracks that could even stand alone on an EP, even more bonus tracks on the DVD and 3 music videos, it's a great buy for those who like to get a bit more than just the album.  Those who already own the album, this isn't for you unless you're a die-hard Paramore fan. But those who don't own it, get this version. You won't be disappointed.

B0015519VS|4.0|Contrary to what I've been hearing from many people, I actually like this CD. Granted, by no means is this his best work or my favorite, but I'm not disappointed at all. Perhaps its because I find I can appreciate the more mature subject matter of fatherhood, marriage, and extinguishing past flames; its all a sign of growing up. I definitely think this is a CD for a more mature audience to appreciate, and much less for the younger fans. I give Usher some credit tho, he tried to give some fan service with songs like \\"Love In This Club I and II\\", but these were the ones that were mediocre, in my opinion. This is one of those CDs that will have to grow on you. I think people will like a good portion of the tracks at first listen, but some of them might require a few spins before you find yourself liking it. I give it a solid 4 stars

B000J10ERO|4.0|My son loved this film, from the bullet bouncing off of SM's eye, to the fact that \\"Lex Luther was really a scientist\\".  He provided me an excited commentary throughout the whole film, having seen it b4, and asked me questions on supermaniana that I knew from years of reading the comic at his age.<br /><br />For myself, I thought it was a reasonably good story:  SM returns to the Earth after a mysterious absence, during which the other characters have moved on with their lives.  Lois is married, angry at him, and has a son.  Meanwhile, Lex is at his normally evil plans, which are genuinely earthshaking in this film.  So SM saves the day, with a lot of good suspense filled in.<br /><br />There is no way, of course, that I would have bought this were it not for my son.  That being said, it was such a delight to watch it with him that I was carried away by the peculiar magic of this film, which is a mark of its success.<br /><br />Recommended.

B00005JPNY|5.0|This was the best fantasy movie to come along in years. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but I found the movie incredibly enjoyable for the \\"thinking\\" person, and I'm now finding the books equally enjoyable.<br /><br />To the avid fans who complain about the adaptation - I would point out that the objective of a movie is not the same as the objective of a book. Of course some of the complexities and characters have to be changed a bit, or else you'd have a 10-hour movie. Give it a break - this was a decent adaptation, and for those who don't want to read the books, the movie stands on its own.<br /><br />And to the fundamentalists who complain about the \\"demons\\" in the movie...get an education. The concept of the Dæmonic was actually popularized by a Christian psychologist, Rollo May, in a book that was inspired by Paul Tillich.<br /><br />Also, before seeing the movie, I heard a lot about it being an \\"atheist\\" version of Narnia - it is nothing like Narnia, and the cosmology presented here, though complex, is a form of gnosticism, an early (possibly the earliest) form of Christianity. Get a brain, people. Everything outside your extremely narrow brand of right-wing theology is not \\"atheism\\" - there are a huge variety of spiritualities, consciousness movements, humanistic and transcendental belief systems, gnosticisms and agnosticisms, etc., which hold themselves to much higher moral standards than your fundamentalism.<br /><br />I actually liked this better than most of the Harry Potter movies, and much better than Narnia or Lord of the Rings. For a movie with a fraction of the budget, this was incredible. The acting was superb, the special effects were superb, and this movie actually had something to say (if you pay attention and listen). Sure, the book explains things a bit better, but the movie definitely makes my Top 5 list for the year.

It has made me stop and think about myself, my actions, reactions and the same in my relationships with others. It's so clear and simple yet so difficult. To relearn many of the ways in which we handle ourselves and situations is challenging at best!

Others, (Heaven Can Wait, Wasted Years,) had that, but something else---that something else was Mr. Adrian Smith. All I can say is that it's solid all the way through. A Great Buy!

B0011HOEY4|4.0|Scott's latest foray is about the coming to power of the black mafia in America and how it effectively put the Italian mafia into their lap because they could smuggle cheap and high grade herion out of Vietnam during the war.<br /><br />Denzil Washington plays, Frank Lucas, the gangster who made it all happen. Russell Crowe is Det. Richie Roberts a Jewish straight cop whose honesty makes his department look bad. Roberts is assigned to bust drug barons while Lucas remains low-profile and takes control of Manhattan block by block.<br /><br />As far as gangster movies go this is no Scorsese, however it is a very good drama and there is a substantial twist in the end that makes it worth while. One could hope that there would have been more screen time between Lucas and Crowe (they only meet in the last few minutes) but even apart they still hold their own. This isn't just a story about the rise and fall of the black mafia though. There is something else lurking in the background but that really is the ace card that is lurking up Scott's sleeve. By all means do watch American Gangsters but don't expect too much and you may well be watching one of the best dramas of 2008.
B0000021RB|5.0|You know what?  My original review for this album was quite bad, so here's the new and improved version-    I mostly want to say that, I have the CD version that was released on October 25, 1990 and the sound quality -despite being the original CD version- is absolutely AMAZING!  Considering the album was released in... what year was it?  1969?  I'm really surprised how rich, clear and crisp this CD sounds.  It's even MORE of a mystery that it sounds so good considering it's not a remastered version or anything.      Oh, and get this- the album was originally a double record, and this CD version features BOTH records on one disc!  So I don't have to bother with switching to the second disc, unlike Chicago II.      As for the music?  I LOVE this album.  You have the three big hits near the beginning of the album, beautiful horn jams that dominate much of the music because, as you probably know, those horns are the main part of Chicago's signature sound and style, and to my BIG surprise, most of the second half of the album features lengthy blues jams and guitar solos like mad.  Or rather, MAD guitar solos, that seriously border those Frank Zappa was doing at the time!  Just listen to \\"Liberation\\" if you don't believe me.  MAN what a wild and intense guitar jam!    I like the way these guys go back and forth from horn and guitar dominated jams, to short pop songs.  It's an interesting blend of two VERY different styles.  I love Chicago!
B000SM7QUC|3.0|A bit disappointed in the CD. The tracks I liked, I really liked. And those I don't......well, I skip them.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|No words do this film the full justice that it so amply deserves.  It is emotionally mature, brilliantly acted, superbly directed, and the production is of the highest quality imaginable.  I don't know when I've enjoyed a story told with such sensitivity and finesse.  It's all the love stories and more that you have been hoping to see.  Kudos to all the fine actors and especially to Renée Zellweger as Miss Potter, Ewan McGregor as Norman Warne, and Emily Watson.  Their mutual chemistry is magic.  For that matter, I cannot imagine how the replacement of any one of the supporting cast could have made this a better film.  They were all wonderful.  The story is a spellbinding fairytale, told in matter of fact dialog with occasional narration and flashback.  You never feel that your emotions are being manipulated by the drama, because they are not.  It is the true story itself that really grips you and leaves you breathless until the final scene.  Finally, the additional material on the DVD is well worth watching.  It documents the life of the central character, Beatrix Potter, the real astounding individual who made this film, and so much more, possible.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's sophomore album, \\"Ride The Lightning\\" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering \\"Kill 'Em All\\" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, \\"Master of Puppets\\" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and \\"...And Justice For All\\" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for \\"One\\".  Regardless of whether or not \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think \\"The Four Horsemen\\" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of \\"Ride The Lightning\\", simply read on.  \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, \\"Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!\\". Great way to start off the album.  \\"Ride The Lightning\\", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment.  \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes ofthe song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out.  \\"Fade To Black\\" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out.  \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album.  \\"Escape\\" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song.  \\"Creeping Death\\" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos.  \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer \\"Orion\\" off \\"Master of Puppets\\", but this song is definitely a great one, too.  So as you can see, \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even \\"The Black Album\\" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrashmetal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.
0393327345|5.0|this is an amazing book. if you've seen the movie there won't be any surprises, but the book goes more in depth into the concepts and such so the reader can get a firmer grasp on the ideas the author is trying to convey.<br /><br />the story starts off with this guy who's going to these anonymous groups for people with terminal diseases, but he doesn't have a terminal disease. so right at the beginning of the book we have the main character searching out destruction as a way to solve his discontent. the cause of his discontent of course would be that he feels he doesn't belong within his own society, that his individual self has no presence when interacting with society as a whole. so the individual revolts against society, reasserting its authority over itself. and this would be the reason for fight club. what makes fight club so wonderfully appropriate as a beacon for the individual to rise up against society is that society finds the concept of fight club so abhorrent, it doesn't understand the logic. society's morality dictates that we are all special individuals that are to cherished. we are all special individuals... something of an paradox, but as we all sway to society's rhythm we can see the logic. but if we take this statement apart and apply it to our own lives, because the western world believes this to be true, generation me as an example, and yet we are all alienated and desire/ are forced to be the same. one of the mantra's in this book was 'i am not a special snow flake' or something to that effect. by denying society's morality, the individual recognizes their discontent and counters it (of course in real life the contrasting extreme is no better than what caused the trouble in the first place, but one very much deserves the other... and its great for symbolic purposes:P). the members of fight club act in a way that society does not comprehend so that the individual can gain autonomy over itself, wresting itself out of the numbing grasp of society. this would manifest itself as destructive behaviour, both towards the self and towards the other, desiring the loss of the individual in a crowd, looking beneath the superficiality we create around ourselves to present as an image, and presenting something unacceptable in its place.<br /><br />besides the extreme need for society and the extreme need for the individual there is also the need for balance, hence there being three components to the novel. the aggravator, the aggravatee, and something detached from both. the aggravator would be society, whose desire is to quell individuality and can be found in characters that are 'normal' like the guy's boss, or the very motivation in each of our heads and within the scope of each character's awareness to conform to the bigger picture. the individual would contrast this in it's desire to rise up out of society establishing its autonomy over itself, and this can be found in the idea of fight club and those who believe in it's teachings. the third party would be able to see the benefits and flaws in both extremes, and that would be our narrator, or even the reader, and this person sees a need for both.. or a need for neither.<br /><br />it was very symbolic, which i enjoyed, but if you're not the type that goes for symbolism... well it'll tap into your rebellion or something.. and it has the fighting (which is you revelling in the symbolism but denying it!). great book though. i recommend.uld manifest itself as destructive behaviour, both towards the self and towards the other, desiring the loss of the individual in a crowd, looking beneath the superficiality we create around ourselves to present as an image, and presenting something unacceptable in its place.     besides the extreme need for society and the extreme need for the individual there is also the need for balance, hence there being three components to the novel. the aggravator, the aggravatee, and something detached from both. the aggravator would be society, whose desire is to quell individuality and can be found in characters that are 'normal' like the guy's boss, or the very motivation in each of our heads and within the scope of each character's awareness to conform to the bigger picture. the individual would contrast this in it's desire to rise up out of society establishing its autonomy over itself, and this can be found in the idea of fight club and those who believe in it's teachings. the third party would be able to see the benefits and flaws in both extremes, and that would be our narrator, or even the reader, and this person sees a need for both.. or a need for neither.     it was very symbolic, which i enjoyed, but if you're not the type that goes for symbolism... well it'll tap into your rebellion or something.. and it has the fighting (which is you revelling in the symbolism but denying it!). great book though. i recommend.
B00154GEFU|3.0|When I first put this CD in my record player I was blown away by the first song and thought to myself that this is Asia back to their glory days;  emotional, catchy and sing along friendly progressive rock with loads of suiting keyboards and melodic guitar part and on top of this John Wetton's warm and and melodic voice. But when I listened more to the CD I found out that it was only a few songs that held the same quality. And only two of these, track 1 and 7, can really be compared with old classics like \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and \\"Heat Of The Moment\\". These two tracks are really Asia at their best. The rest of the songs are more or less good; to many songs reminds me of John Wetton's solo work which I found to be quite boring and contains more of the old-man's feel than the edgy and warm Adult Oriented Rock. Some other songs fall in the middle; Steve Howe's own composed \\"Wish I'd Known\\" is a catchy and singalong friendly tune that increaces my good opinion about this album.    Unfortunately this album is not as good as I expected, but I still think that the quality and emotion of the really good songs on this album is worth a buy if you like what these band created in the eighties.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The TV sitcom is not dead.  Chuck Lorre has resurrected the universe of comdey with The Big Bang Theory, Monday nights at 7:00 PM CST.  Hysterically, laugh out loud, belly-bustingly funny, this show is not to be missed.<br /><br />The premise is fresh and fun:  two young, genius, nerdy, socially awkward science professors named Sheldon and Leonard share an apartment.  Across the hall, in moves Penny - a sweet, beautiful, blond bombshell who waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory.  Leonard immediately falls for her.  Penny cares for Leonard, but she loves him like a brother...<br /><br />It is a phenomenon how unbelievably funny this show is. The writing is smart, creative, and consistent.  The characterizations are masterful and avoid being over the top.  The acting and comic timing are inspired.  This cohesive ensemble cast jelled from day one, and has never looked back.  As comical and wacky as this show is, every time I watch it, I think \\"I KNOW these people.  I know people just like them.\\"  (Yes, I am a science and engineering geek.  I have a Master's Degree in physics.)  Somehow, in the midst of all the zany hilarity, the world created by these talented folks is real, comfortable, and familiar.  The details in this show are amazing, and add to the realism.  Clearly everyone involved in this effort cares, and that is what makes Big Bang work so well.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Big Bang, give it a try.  Your sides will ache from laughing so hard.  As an added bonus, the theme song is catchy and sung by Bare Naked Ladies.  And don't forget to hit pause as Chuck Lorre's placards pop up at the end of each episode.

0143142364|2.0|Readers will certainly check the hardcover book reviews for comments on the subject matter, so I only will address the CD narration, production and packaging in my review.  I must begin by admitting that I was spoiled by the very first book I ever bought on CD. It was narrated by Jim Dale, the production included supberb music to set the mood and the package was made of first class materials with fantastic artwork that carried right from the box to the CDs themselves. I soon learned that Mr. Dale is quite literally the best in the business but at the time I thought all books on CD would be like that first one. Thus, while I have enjoyed a great many narrations, I have been a little disappointed in anything read on CD by anybody else.  In the case of this book, the narrator rates 3 of 5 stars.  His \\"narration\\" voice is pleasant, clear and easy to understand but his character voices, particularly when he is portraying a \\"peasant\\" are somewhat muddy, annoying and otherwise so similiar to his other peasant voices I had problems determining which of the characters was speaking.  As for the production itself, I found it lacking, consisting only of \\"CD Number __\\" at the beginning and \\"End of CD Number __\\" at the end of each CD. Most books on CD have some sort of introduction and appropriate music accompanying it.  As for the packaging, it also is lacking. While the box containing the CDs resembles the book cover, it is made of flimsy cardboard that must be handled carefully to avoid tearing while quality books on CD are housed in rigid cardboard cases that withstand a lot of \\"pulling out and putting in.\\"  The difference is like a paperback book vs. a hardcover only in this case, one pays the price for the hardcover and gets the paperback. Inside the box are look-a-like black cardboard sleeves each containing 6 to 8 silver look-a-like CDs. I had to hunt to find the right black sleeve containing the CD I wanted to hear. Quality books on CDs often have fabulous art on each sleeve but even those that do not have the numbers of the CDs contained therein on the spine. I rate the production and packaging one star of 5.    Averaging things out, this item gets 2 stars. I think people can do better reading this material themselves rather than buying this CD.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|I had a big grin on my face throughout this entire film.  I laughed out loud in many places, and cheered the characters on in others.  After 20 years, Indy is back, and so is the fun and excitement.<br /><br />As with every film in the series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starts off at warp speed and never lets up.  Like its three predecessors, this very entertaining film is full action, adventure, excitement, thrills, chases, true love and, yes, even camp.  Did I know what was going to happen pretty much every step of the way?  Of course, but it all happened exactly the way I wanted it to.  It was typical Indiana Jones, full of references and homage to the past films, and I did not need it to be anything else.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again brilliant in his portrayal of our hero.  At 65, he is still handsome, sexy, believable, and true to character.  And as always, he gets the girl.  Karen Allen is wonderful reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood.  She doesn't look like she has aged a bit, and she is absolutely terrific.  The chemistry between Indy and Marion is palpable.  Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams does quite a remarkable job.  His high-speed sword fight through the Amazon is amazing and memorable.  I have to say the ants were an inspired choice for this film's requisite creepy-crawly scene.  We live in an area swarming with fire ants. I HATE ANTS.<br /><br />As always, John Williams' musical score is rousing and fills you with anticipation.  As the music set the perfect stage for all of the film's action, I found my self humming along with the familiar and well loved theme.  This is one that I can't get out of my head, and I don't really want to.<br /><br />Set in the 1950s, smack in the middle of McCarthyism, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings the Indiana Jones franchise into a new era. It is jam packed with classic and clich&eacute; 1950s references, from motorcycles and greasers, atomic bombs, Roswell and little green men, and the red menace. Overall, this film isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!). It is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable continuation of a well loved story.<br /><br />And I think it succeeded.  As the credits rolled, the audience applauded and cheered.  I highly recommend this film for the entire family.lm isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!).

B001AIRUOU|5.0|Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.<br /><br />And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.<br /><br />In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.<br /><br />But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and \\"Sandy Claws\\" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?<br /><br />The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque \\"Princess Bride.\\"<br /><br />Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.<br /><br />But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally (\\"My dearest friend, if you don't mind...\\"), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers (\\"There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!\\").<br /><br />But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue (\\"Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!\\"). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.<br /><br />For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy). Sometimes the dark and fun go hand in hand.ost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|After watching this movie I really was sicko. Very good eye-opening film. A must see for every American.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had ordered this DVD without too much expectation - I work out pretty regularly and consider myself to be in relatively decent shape.  My experience with DVD workouts isn't extensive, but the ones I've tried have been pretty disappointing.  When I gave this DVD a cursory watch before trying it out, I thought this would be more of the same.  WRONG.  I started with level 1, thinking I'd be able to move in a couple days and I quickly changed my mind when level 1 and Jillian proceeded to thoroughly kick my [...].  The cardio and ab segments on their own aren't that impressive (then again I'm still only on level 2) but combined with the strength training, it's a fantastic, heart-pumping whole.  The exercises are performed in supersets and Jillian tends to combine several strength training moves into one, which I really like.  I tend to neglect strength training when I workout, but this DVD forced me to start building up my muscles.  It sounds crazy, but I could feel an immediate difference after just a few days (of level 1!) when I went for a swim.  I honestly hadn't felt that good and strong while swimming in a long time.    Only downside I might see to this DVD is that there's a lot of jumping, which is pretty hard on my knees.  Jillian offers modifications, which I've tried, but it's just not the same.
0312360266|2.0|I love vampire books - blue blood, vampire academy the twilight series so I was pretty excited to read the house of night novels.  I actually bought Marked, Betrayal, and Chosen together assuming that I'd love them especially with how highly reviewed they were on amazon.  I'm a little disappointed though -just finished the first book and I found it to be way too preachy so much so that it got in the way of really getting fully into the story - about drinking, and sex and something else I can't remember at the moment. Also annoying is how stereotyped the characters are - Zoey talks a lot about how she hates mean exclusive people but then she slams other people for what they wear, how they do their make-up, accents and economic class -it's kind of lame cause it makes all the characters (even the main one) very one-dimensional.  A lot of people like this series so I'm just one opinion among many positive reviews but I wasn't all that impressed with Marked and kind of bummed cause I bought all 3 books and not really wanting to read the others -I suggest buy the first, see how you like it then go from there.
6304493681|4.0|This is the first \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" movie to have been based on the popular manga. It's set in 2029, apparently in Hong Kong, and follows the agents of Section 9 - a government agency that deals with unsavoury (and frequently criminal) elements. Life is very different : the internet plays an much greater role in life than it does now, while most people now have technology-enhanced bodies. These improvements range from controlled metabolisms to cybernetic bodies.    Section 9 has a small, though clearly very effective team. Daisuke Aramaki is is charge, though takes no active part in the missions - a rather elderly gentleman, he deals with bureaucrats, politicians and reports. (In fact, he life seems to ne so busy that her doesn't always get to read the reports submitted to him). Major Motoko Kusanagi effectively operates as the team leader in the field. Kusanagi is a cyborg - a human brain fitted in a metal body  that features some very cool optional extras. Batou is not only a very experienced officer, he is also - apparently - the closest thing the Major has to a friend. While he is primarily biological, he does have some quite significant implants - most obviously his eyes. Togusa, who has virtually no implants at all, is the most recent arrival to Section 9. He was recruited by Kusanagi herself, who views diversity as a strength. Ishikawa, meanwhile, barely appears at all - he acts as Section 9's computer expert and doesn't6 take part in any of the fighting.     As the film opens, Section 9 has been helping the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deal with a couple of difficult political asylum cases. (The individuals requesting asylum were proving to be as unsavoury as those they were requesting asylum from...Section 9's involvement meant no awkward decision had to be made by Minister Nakamura). At the same time, Nakamura is building up to a round of very secret talks...disturbingly, it would appear that the talks and the delegates are now under threat. The Minister's Interpreter has been attacked, with the technological upgrades to her brain proving her weakness. These upgrades have been hacked into, by a shadowy terrorist known only as the Puppet Master. This process is known as Ghost Hacking, and is an attack on the victim's very consciousness. It allows the hacker to alter his victim's memories - essentially destroying their very identity. The interpreter, the Monkey Man believes, would have been used by the Puppet Master to kill the key delegates at the talks - and everyone involved with these talks is now under surveillance.     There is very little to go on as to the Puppet Master's true identity. The \\"infamous Master Hacker\\", whose nickname was coined by the Ghost Pack, is believed to be American. However, any remaining details - age, background and (despite the moniker) even gender - are all a matter of speculation. However, this incident is the first confirmed Puppet Master attack in Hong Kong - and it seems clear that, for whatever reason, Nakamura's round of talks is his intended target.     The film features some great artwork and is very atmospheric. With the Major, in particular, there is a very clear and real sense of isolation. This stems from the fact she is largely technological, rather than biological - \\"cyborgs\\", she says \\"have a tendency to be paranoid about their origins\\". Ironically enough, she's not alone in her loneliness - despite how much easier technology has made it to communicate, it's a mood that seems all too common throughout the city.
B000V8A95C|4.0|Ever spring break I always go musical hopping in New York, which in my option is the ONLY place to see a good musical.  Anyway I have seen my fair share of musicals and Wicked is by far my favorite of all that I have seen.  As far as the CD I love their voices, however there are few songs that do stand out like Defiying Gravity and For Good and What is this feeling, but you do have the option of only buying the songs you really enjoyed, which is  what I did and I love all of the ones that I have.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|I guess I'm not all that surprised that not everybody loved 2003's \\"I Can't Stop\\", even though I loved it.  Stylistically, \\"I Can't Stop\\"'s bluesier sometimes funkier approach along with some tracks with a surprising amount of lyrical bite (sometimes angry, other times very emotionally tearful), was not strictly classic Al Green.  However, Green teaming up with Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson of the Roots along with other talented musicians and singers finally does recreate that seventies magic of sound and loving lyrics perfectly with \\"Lay It Down\\".      The album stands up with his classic seventies soul hits in sound and theme.  Nearly every track is romantic and sung sweetly by Green along with some quest vocalists.  Corinne Bailey Rae's accompying Green on \\"Take Your Time\\" is nice but her voice is only pleasant and not very soulful.  Frankly, I would rather one of the female background vocalists, Jaguar Wright or Mercedes Martinez, would have been the female vocal and Rae would have only contributed as a songwriter.  It's the only very minor issue with the album, though.  Anthony Hamilton is more present in the backgrounds of the title track but is not distracting in the duet \\"You've Got What I Need\\".  What is most surprising about the album that unlike \\"I Can't Stop\\", it has no tracks that really stick out because the album is really tight.  It does not go off on wild style tangents or sharp turns in songwriting.  There are no huge surprises, but only a smooth soulful, blissful journey that is a reminder of a past when real musicians and real singers....laid it down.  Green's songwriting is great but you'll notice in the liner notes that nearly every track has most of the musicacians aiding in the songwriting process, too.  This album seems to be written by Thompson along with  the other musicians on the album because the music is that important that every instrument is and should be acknowledged by its performer.  Thompson as a drummer is a very talented performer(as his history has shown) and James Poyser on keys helps in recreating the classic great sound along with the guitar works of Chalmers \\"Spanky\\" Alford, but it is the bass by Adam Blackstone that really catches my ear on the soft, soulfilled tracks.  If there is one standout track, it is the slightly funkier \\"I'm Wild About You\\" since the volume and tempo goes slightly up from the softer tracks.  The album ends with another slight twist; \\"Standing In the Rain\\" is Green's short, self penned funky stomper with bursting horns and lyrics about being a hard working man.  I can't point out many tracks as exceptional, yet that is actually a good thing.  This is what an album really should be in that it can be listened to from beginning to end and experienced as a whole.  I don't doubt that well known record lover Thompson wanted that to be the case of not having \\"singles\\" (which is sensible since, sadly, even diverse satelite radio really doesn't have a solid format that would play Al's new tracks) but in making an album that is very even and excellent throughout.  If you love Al Green, you'll find no weak spots.   The art form of the full album is not dead after all!
B000SINT52|5.0|This will go down in history as the first (of many) nails in the coffin of George W. Bush. After watching this, you have to wonder how can our country ever recover from the 8 years of mismanagement by the Bush administration. I really can't understand all the negative reviews, I guess Fox News has hypnotized these people into the \\"herd mentality\\".  The bottom line is if you hate this movie, then you should be charged with treason and banished to Greenland.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I remembered watching this program as a boy, and remembered it fondly. I had been looking around stores without luck when I checked Amazon and there it was!<br /><br />I sat down and started watching it again, and as soon as I heard the theme music and Olivier's narration was immediately transported back in time.<br /><br />This thorough history of WWII begins in the first episode with the rise of the National Socialist party in Germany in the 20's and 30's, then takes us through the Rhineland, Anschluss, Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia and leaves us looking at Danzig.<br /><br />The second episode takes us into Poland and the start of the war. Each phase of the war is discussed in detail as it navigates its way chronologically, episode by episode, through the entire conflict.<br /><br />Sir Laurence Olivier's narration is excellent, as is the archival footage.<br />My only criticisms are directly due to the age of the series - some of the graphics that are used to dramatise explanations between footage (fairly rare) are now quite dated and almost comical. Also, because the series was made so soon after the war, the depiction of historical facts is tilted towards the allies - for instance there is no mention of the genesis of the practice of bombing cities - two or three german aircraft accidentally discharged their bomb loads over London in August 1940, which was an accidental contravention of Hitler's ban on attacking the capital. This led to British bombing of Berlin, and the whole thing escalated from there. (The Hardest Victory, RAF Bomber Command in the Second World War - Denis Richards, Hodder and Stoughton, London 1995 pp82, 83). Facts such as these are not mentioned in this series.<br /><br />All in all, this series is an excellent historical record of WWII. If only someone could undertake a re-make on such an epic scale, now that many official secrets of the time are de-classified, and graphical technology has improved exponentially, it would be well worth the effort.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00139XZF4|4.0|I did not take the kids to see this when it was released at the theater due to mixed reviews and the busy holiday season. I just picked up the bluray disc and we watched it over the weekend. If you are into fantasy films or your kids are it's a must rent or own. Forget about the anti-christian political stuff, there was no inkling of this in the film at all. It was a high quality film on the same par as some of the Potter movies. It is a step above the first installement of the Narnia movies. I attribute this to the higher quality of acting and editing.     You know a movie is a keeper when your 12 and 14 year old kids want to watch it again after the first viewing. My only gripe is with the ending. As others have said it does not do enough to tie everthing together. I realize that their intent was to draw you into a sequal, but there was no sequel in production and there are no definite plans for one as of today due to poor domestic revenue. All that said it is still worth the price of a rental or a purchase for all but the last 5 minutes. It looks fantastic on my bluray player and hi def projector too!
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I sat through this whole movie against my judgement. Very unenjoyable, dark, no humor, too violent. I don't mind blood in a movie, but this was over the top.Wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone, stay away. Definitely won't make you feel good by the end.

B0015519VS|1.0|Short and simple - Usher can do much better than this.  He can't give us a great CD (Confessions) and then hand us a mediocre CD. You would think that with thre drama that's going on in his life and the 4 yrs he;s had to create a CD, he would've come harder.  Love in This Club and Moving Mountains are the only hotspots.  Better luck next time, Ursh.
B000000W5L|3.0|I like the Stones and I love raw blues and R&B but I somehow missed out on \\"Exile on Main Street\\". So, enthused by such great reviews, I was expecting something special... an earthy, pseudo-live album that, despite its origins in drug addled chaos, would grab my attention and be worth the effort of repeat listening while, on the way, delivering up some classic gems. Well I tried, but what I kept getting was a voice saying \\"look, matey, you could spend hours trying to get into this but the truth is it ain't that good\\".    Maybe, like Neil Young's \\"Tonight's the Night\\" - whose origins and chaotic structure are similar but which still grabs valued space in my music collection - you had to buy it at the time and then listen to it for many years for it to fully register or, is it in reality one of rock's greatest \\"king with no clothes\\" outings? Either way, life's too short and there's too much other genuinely brilliant music out there to waste huge amounts of time trying to work out which it is. Then again, maybe I'm simply not capable of appreciating such a complex and odd record.
B0015519VS|5.0|Minus the the theatrical Guest appearances on his previus album Confessions, Usher stands primarily alone on this album. The Bookend \\"in This Club\\" songs, contain appearaces, and in the middle Jay Z; However Usher carries this album entirely through on his vocals. A throwback to the seventies when the great Soul singers stood alone. Confident in their own skills to carry an album.

Finished the two books in three days. Loved the characters-could relate to them so much.... and I even had Thunder Road on my ipod....so to read that in the books was a \\"goosebump\\" moment. Had to then get Babyproof ....but didn't do as much for me.Took a few weeks to get through it.  Would recommend Something Borrowed and Something Blue...excellent beach reads!
B0000046KM|5.0|\\"Here's to life\\" is one of the best jazz album of the last century; it's delicate, warm, soft, sweet, well played and well sung; Shirley is in top form, and so are her musicians.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|The usual ultimate sacrifice to a pool of depression is that of Portishead.  Known for their classic older 60s and 70s and synthesized mixture, they get more acoustic at times, vary more in synthesizers, and Beth Gibbons is still her unusual weepy like voice that is Beth Gibbons.<br /><br />Some of the songs tend to be repetitive such as Hunter or have more of a pop melody, particularly The Rip. Some songs feel like they ended too soon.  Nylon Smile arguably so, Silence is a bit repetitive, but has enough of a build to flow, but ends too abruptly.<br /><br />Small puts you to sleep.
B0014KD46W|4.0|This CD is his best work in a while in my opinion. It sort of flashes me back to the more jam related work in Traffic ...

B0010X8NF0|1.0|Ugh, this movie was painfully sloooow to watch! There was some mildly funny humor here and there, but over all the movie was atrocious!!     Take three estranged & dysfunctional brothers that don't trust each other. Then place them together on a 1st class train compartment to travel across India in search of \\"Enlightenment\\". All the while each one of them goes about undermining each others trust for most of the movie. Sounds like they each have a lot of unresolved issues/baggage and an odd upbringing to boot.    Somehow or another through finally meeting up with their mother, who is a nun in India, and has abandoned them all every opportunity she can find to do so and over coming their father's death, do the finally find peace in an odd sort of way or so it seems. The movie doesn't make it clear.

B0015519VS|5.0|I'm really feeling Usher's new cd. I listened to every song on the cd and did not have to skip passed any of them. Even the hidden track is good! I know that I will be listening to this one probably more than I have listened to any of his other cds. They have all been great, but this one is different. I would recommend this cd to anyne who enjoys sitting back, relaxing and just listening to some good music that will ease the mind.
B000094HMU|3.0|I was looking forward to Turandot at the Met with Domingo!  Disappointment often follows anticipation.  The set was truly outstanding, the grandeur of the era was displayed.  This performance is over 20 years old; Domingo was in his prime - a tenor hunk!  But the magic, the chemistry between him and Marton was lacking.  The one who stole the show was Liu - Leona Mitchell.  A voice of an angel, innocent and full of emotion.  The entire opera lacked believability.  The story itself is unbelievable, so it takes a master director to make the audience be transported to China to witness this love story.  It was the first time I have even seen Calaf sing Nessum Dorma seated!  He looked very uncomfortable.  Marton was truly an ice goddess but even when she realized then end result, she was cold.  This was also reflected in her voice.
B000003CMD|4.0|This Allman Brothers album contains 2 of their probably best known tunes, Ramblin' Man and Jessica (named after Dickey Bett's daughter). Dickey or Richard Betts as he is listed so formally in the liner notes had to take over as the true lead guitar in the band after guitar legend Duane Allman was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident. Joining Dickey and his gold guitar was fellow southern boy, Les Dudek on the tracks mentioned above playing acoustic guitar. Les would later go on to play with Boz Scaggs, Cher, Steve Miller and produce a couple of decent solo albums as well. Brothers and Sisters is one of the Allman Brothers best albums IMHO. This album has a slicker sound and does not have as much Blues in the mix. Dickey and Gregg have produced a more accessable album with shorter songs than their previous releases which were famous for their long jams. Every song on here is worthy to receive the ABB stamp of approval. Later albums would not capture the Allman Brothers \\"spirit\\" in my book, but I am a true fan of these southern gentlemen. The music world will miss bass player Berry Oakley and guitar virtuoso Gregg Allman, two members of the family known as the Allman Brothers. I'm not sure whose son is pictured on the front cover or whose daughter is on the back but I think I get the message. Life goes on. - Ciao

B00000E5IH|4.0|Nothing succeeds like excess, right? That's probably the principle Elton's lived his whole life by, it's even more likely that those exact words were pinned on the studio wall during the recording of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the apex of Elton's glam period.. It's a hedonistic, eclectic, hit-filled double-album, and is probably the album to start with if you're looking for a definitive picture of Elton John. The aforementioned hits? Oh, there's plenty, the biggest of them the campy, stuttering, hilarious \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", which reached the top of the charts. The Princess Diana tribute \\"Candle in the Wind\\" was also a big hit, and it stands as one of Elton's most touching ballads; the title track, with soaring vocal hooks, also was a smash, as was \\"Saturday Night's All Right (For Fighting)\\", Elton's loudest, most raucous rocker - it almost reaches Who-level intensity. The progressive epic \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\", \\"Madman Across the Water\\" taken to the extreme, also got a lot of radio airplay. So was \\"All the Young Girls Love Alice\\", arguably the weakest song on the album - it's immaturely, irrationally homophobic, displaying all the knowledge of lesbian culture that, I don't know, a middle-schooler may have. It's songs like this that make me kind of leery to call this Elton's best album, despite its enduring popularity: Taupin's vile, uncalled-for, painfully sincere chauvinism dominates and henceforth spoils several songs (\\"Sweet Painted Lady\\"; \\"Dirty Little Girl\\"), as well as some racism (\\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\", an awful take on reggae even without the lyrics). Still, some of these songs have staying power: the incoherent but energetic \\"Grey Seal\\", a remake of an older b-side; the oddly arranged \\"This Song Has No Title\\"; \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\", Elton's take on jazz; \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey\\" has all the melodramatic pomp of his classic material, and all the melody; \\"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock `n' Roll)\\" is a ridiculous but nonetheless amusing retro exercise; \\"Social Disease\\" is entertaining but slightly obnoxious country; \\"Harmony\\" is a wonderful orchestrated ballad. I'd hesitate to call this the best Elton John album, or the place to start, but it's a great buy.netheless amusing retro exercise; \\"Social Disease\\" is entertaining but slightly obnoxious country; \\"Harmony\\" is a wonderful orchestrated ballad.

B000VJ271A|4.0|One can always look forward to the music of a Massenet opera, but when you add the voices and acting abilities of Dessay and Villazon you are in for a real treat.  Dessay can demonstrate such a range of emotion from naivete to femme fatale.  Villazon has performed many times with Dessay and their comfort with each other is apparent.  I remember many operas where the soprano and the tenor sang directly to the audience; today great acting is also a part of the opera.  The stage directing is the only thing that could use some improvement.  The placement of the chorus often seems confusing and of no particular value to the story.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|I LOVE this CD!!! I grew up listening to this music and I was so excited to see all of my favorite songs on this album.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Filled from beginning to end with powerful vocals, sad-sweet songs, and original lyrics, Little Voice is a monumental achievement that makes me long for the next CD. \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Bottle it Up\\" are by no means the only hits. \\"Come Round Soon\\" is beautifully addictive, \\"Between the Lines\\" and \\"City\\" are tearjerkers, and \\"Fairytale\\" is the most original thing around. If you're a fan of one of her songs, get the rest.

B00004RF8J|5.0|If you like musicals, you need to try this one! It has good music and a pretty good plot line even! It's very 80s cheesy, which is hilarious. It has all kinds of jokes in it that I never realized as a little kid. The movie also has TONS of cameos. It's fun to watch with friends and get a kick out of.  Buy it and see what I'm talking about!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|It is fascinating the love/hate opinion most have for this movie. It garners either five stars or one star and yet I find myself somewhere in the middle. Director Sophia Coppola breezes us through Japan, be it to witness the traditional wedding in Kyoto, dashing through the Pachinko parlors, singing karaoke, walking through shrines and temples, eating in local restaurants, riding the trains, the shabu shabu restaurant, the propaganda vans shouting their messages as they drive down the street, the ladies handing out tissue packages on the street, the often bizarre Japanese tv shows, and so, so much, this movie is at times a loving home movie for me, reminding me of so much I have seen and done during my time in Japan. For that reason alone I find myself watching it now and again just to remind me of the country that I miss so much now that I am back in the states.<br />Many people have complained of the anti-Japanese sentiment. I think they are missing the point, however. The two characters, Bob in particular, are very real clich&eacute;s of the ugly American. Rather than taking Coppola to task for making fun of Japanese people, I give her credit for showing us ourselves. The squeamishness and outrage we feel when we see these characters is purposeful. Lord knows I came across many such people in my years there and seeing this behavior in the characters made them very real to me. Furthermore, Bob's acidic attitude is symptomatic of the misery and sadness he is experiencing and the frustration that stems from such feelings which causes him to seek the most convenient scapegoats for his angst.<br />In the end, though, most of the complaints stem from the viewers being bored to death and I will agree that there is little that really happens in this movie. It reminds me in some ways of \\"Sideways,\\" both character studies where we visit with flawed and problematic people. I will also admit that before I lived in Japan I watched this movie and it wasn't nearly the same experience as it was after seeing Japan in person. It changed so much of my understanding and appreciation of the film.<br />One of the things that did bug me some was the near perverse nature of the relationship. Charlotte is young enough to be his daughter and their wavering feelings of longing for each other didn't serve the plot in any real way. The tenderness and humanity of the film could've been accomplished with a more realistic father-daughter connection between the two. I understand that they are desperate and needy for anyone to give them some shelter from their misery. But again, I think that this point could've been made without the sexual tension. Being lonely, being sad, and needing someone to cling to during difficult times in our life need not be sexual.<br />There is a scene about two-thirds through the movie where the two characters exchange thoughts on life, mostly Bob dispensing wisdom to Charlotte. This is my favorite part because we see the crystallization of what these two mean to each other. After days and nights suffering through jet lag, these two sleep-deprived foreigners finally fall blissfully asleep because at last they realize they are not alone amid the neon chaos of Tokyo. Charlotte nestles close in the security of her new friend and Bob gently touches Charlotte's foot and anchors himself for that moment to allow sleep to come. It's a subtle and tender moment and there are enough of these moments in Lost in Translation for me to forgive some of the mistakes. This is not a perfect movie but I give Coppola a lot of credit for making this most unusual and off-beat film.was after seeing Japan in person.

0307387151|1.0|In all my life, I have only ever been unable to finish two books. Atonement is the second. After having such high hopes from other reviewers and friends, I made it halfway into this book - reaching, at last, the crime - before having to toss the book aside. It is cliche, none of the characters are remotely likable, or even bearable, and the writing is over-detailed to the point that it makes a reader struggle to remember what is actually happening in the story. It is with great regret that I am forced to add another book to my \\"Unbearable\\" list, and hope that no more innocents are trapped into reading Atonement.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a long time Stargate SG-1 fan who has come and gone throughout the ten-year run of the series, and had been watching quite regularly for the last couple of years, I was sad to hear that the show was finally coming to an end. When you grow so close to characters that you feel they are as much a part of your life as the real people in your life, the thought of losing these characters can really instill an impending sense of loss within you. And in some ways, I was feeling this very thing as the show neared its end.<br /><br />And then I began hearing about the Stargate movies. While excited to see the films when they came out, I was also apprehensive, because the fatal flaw inherent in the act of anticipation is that such things can rarely live up to one's high expectations. But as it turns out, Stargate - The Ark of Truth far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />The film picks up and completes the Ori saga which had dominated the series for its last two seasons, and takes us into the Ori galaxy in search of The Ark of Truth, the only device capable of stripping the Ori of their powers by revealing the \\"truth\\" to their devout followers. The movie is classic Stargate, except it feels bigger, more grand in scale and scope. Even though it wasn't shown on a big screen, you get a bit of the cinematic experience when watching SG-1 travel to the Ori galaxy and doing battle on several different fronts, as always walking on the brink of disaster. While each of the characters get their just moments in the spotlight, Cam Mitchell (played excellently as always by Ben Browder) steals the show with some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a Stargate show. The movie is a fitting ending to the series as a whole, and also puts a nice cap to the Ori saga.<br /><br />The DVD extras are also nice. My favorites were the behind the scenes special which runs about half an hour, and the footage of the Q &A session filmed at ComicCon. Getting to see Ben Browser, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge as themselves was quite fun. And for those not familiar with the series or the Ori storyline, there is a prelude which will catch you up on the storyline and lead you right into \\"The Ark of Truth.\\"<br /><br />So if you are a fan of Stargate, or of good adventurous Science Fiction, give \\"Stargate - The Ark of Truth,\\" a try!<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, author, reader, revieweremselves was quite fun.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Facts are facts.  This is plain and simple the worst album of Madonna's career, even worse than 'American Life'.  What makes it doubly disappointing is that it follows 'Confessions on a Dance Floor', one of her best.  The beats are flat, the songwriting lacks spark and good melodies, the guest stars are just a marketing ploy, and Madonna's vocals sound phoned in and disinterested.  I'm sure a lot of the material will sound better live, but so what ?  We are judging the recorded product here, and based on that, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be the most disappointing release from a major artist in 2008.  The cover...doesn't bother me or surprise me, it is Madge, after all.  My guess is her next release on the new label will turn out to be a killer. Skip this one.
B00005NB8K|3.0|I am not a \\"diehard fan\\" of The Doors, though I do appreciate their work.  I do believe that all the actors who play the band-members do a superb job... But my positive comments stop there.      The director, Oliver Stone, fills this movie with so many drug-induced hallucinations, you cannot tell if a scene is something that actually happened or if it's the work of Morrison's drugged-up imagination.  Now, I don't like your run-of-the-mill biopic, but this unconventional biopic wallows in self-indulgence to the point of absurdity.  Stone and the producers seem so determined to make this more of an \\"art film\\" than an actual biopic, and, boy, does it back-fire.  Granted, every biopic is \\"Hollywood-ized\\", but this movie makes you wonder way too many times where the artistic license ends and the actual facts begin or vice-versa.    In short, this production showcases the leader of a rock-band - Jim Morrison - who is bent on self-destruction.  The same could be said about this movie.

0743290119|3.0|There are parts of this book that show flashes of real talent from Lauren Weisberger.  Particularly in the sections involving the expressive, scene-stealing parrot (yes, you read that correctly...I said parrot).  She has a real clever wit to her writing and, as evidenced by her chapter headings, a fiendish sense of humor.    However, the book is ultimately just not that successful at creating a compelling storyline.  Yes, the girls are making strides to change their lives, but why should we care?  If we don't particularly relate to and/or like the characters themselves, then their respective storylines fall flat.  And this is the main problem with this book.  It's almost more focused on flashing glib humor and outrageous antics to mask the fact that the characters aren't all that likable or, at times, believable.    I've followed this writer ever since The Devil Wears Prada and, while I believe this is a better offering than Everyone Worth Knowing, it still falls short of expectations.  Though, I do think it's just a matter of a writer trying to find her voice - Prada was focused on a story that she actually lived, and I think Weisberger, once she gets the hang of creating stories not based on her reality, will deliver on the promise of her first novel.  This one just isn't quite there yet.

I understand that he is different and shows his love for me in so many ways. It has taught me to appreciate his language of love and to tell him how much he means to me and how much I aprreciate what he does for me to show how he loves me. He doesn't talk about how much he loves me; but he does so many things for me and that is how he is expressing how much I mean to him. GREAT BOOK or C.D.'s

B000JSI7AI|5.0|After all the reviews written, I don't want to add anything else to the plot. So much has been said already. But I want to add a bit of controversy (perhaps) All the characters in the film apparently are doomed to failure and to unhappiness. But that's only apparent. Leaving aside the topic of social repression, constraint, conventionalities bonds, etc, which obviously made both Ennis and Jack cheat on their wives (They would never even have got married if they had had the chance to live their affection openly), the question is that, in my opinion, they had a margin, whatever small, of freedom to choose living a different life. That's the hardest reproach from Jack to Ennis the last time they are together. True, it is Ennis, the introverted type, uptight and taciturn, who never wants to take any risk, who's always full of confusion and fear. It is Ennis who gives up almost since the beginning, by accepting resignation and, therefore, failure, beforehand. Because things can always be fixed; and, if not, one can always fight and lose trying to fix them. Jack, on the other hand, is extroverted, vital, enthusiastic, idealistic and a dreamer. He may seem the weaker of both, but he's actually stronger than Ennis, because he knows what he wants and is willing to fight for it. Jack would have sacrificed anything to have a common life with Ennis, while Ennis is incapable of compromise. That's how I see it. Even if their destiny was meant to be comdemned to ostracism or to be killed by an homophobic gang, like in the traumatic vision of Ennis, even this end would have been better than being bound to live a miserable unhappy life, always shielded by lies, making miserable the people around them, bearing a broken marriage, provided that, even if their end had to be tragic, both Jack and Ennis would have shared a time of happiness living together. What was the use of living to save appearances? To lead a miserable life, as Ennis ends up completely alienated, probably regrettingtill the end of his life the wasted chances, the lost illusions. At least Jack Twist had the guts to fight for their happiness.

I have not ever read the books ([[ASIN:0375842381 His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)]]  and after watching the movie, I am not sure that I would want to.  Having enjoyed Harry Potter, Narnia, Fellowship of the Ring, this movie just seemed to steal ideas (battles, CG animals, witches.....)even Nazis....  The plot was difficult to follow, especially if it was intended for children.  I briefly looked up the controversy, and frankly if the Christrian Right had just stayed quiet, I think the movie would have just died.      Don't bother with this one.
B00164KYS2|2.0|I knew I was out of my league the instant I stepped into the theater. It was packed with people, and I could tell from their nonstop chatter that they had been eagerly awaiting the theatrical release of \\"Sex and the City.\\" Watching it, I didn't know whether to envy or feel sorry for these people, who all laughed and cheered and applauded while I sat there, idly wondering what they were finding so enjoyable. This film adaptation of the HBO TV series was one of the longest two-and-a-half hours I've spent at the movies this year, and that's mostly because it didn't need to be two-and-a-half hours. This movie is as over-inflated as the characters themselves, some of the most annoying, artificial, selfish women ever conceived of. They're not stylistic interpretations of real people, but merely walking, talking delusions of grandeur, ones we could never live no matter how hard we try.    In case you're wondering about the person writing this review, let me confirm your suspicions by outing myself as someone who hasn't watched the show. Not a single episode. I went to this movie hoping the filmmakers would take people like me into consideration, people who can enter completely cold yet still get something out of it. There's nothing more frustrating than a movie that can't stand on its own, can't distance itself from its roots and give us something fresh and exciting. What we get with \\"Sex and the City\\" is a droning compendium of witty dialogue, comedic situations, romantic melodrama, and references to fashion designers, all while showcasing people that don't even have fragments of truth in them--most of the characters are desperately needy caricatures, going through life spending money on shoes and handbags and dresses and catered affairs. Anyone can have a fantasy about living the good life, but it takes more than a montage of designer wedding dresses to actually relate to it.    Much like \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" the story of \\"Sex and the City\\" is, above all things, about love, only it takes place in New York City instead of Paris. What has become of the relationship between writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her boyfriend, John James Preston, a.k.a., Mr. Big (Chris Noth)? What's been happening with the oversexed Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), especially since she's been living with her model/actor boyfriend, Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis), in Los Angeles? Are Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) and her husband, Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler), still happy together? Are Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and her husband, Steve Brady (David Eigenberg), on the verge of divorce?    All these questions were answered at one point or another. What wasn't answered was the number of other questions that popped into my head. For one thing, how many frequent flyer miles is Samantha racking up between Los Angeles and New York City? She goes back and forth so frequently it's a wonder she has time to discuss the miracles of Botox with Carrie. And why did Samantha take Carrie on a trip to Mexico knowing it would be a painful reminder of Carrie's current situation (I won't say more than that)? A true friend would never do that, just as a true friend would never make fun of someone for an unwaxed bikini line. On that Mexico trip, Miranda has to endure Samantha's ridicule for not keeping her pubic hair in check; it was a scene that thought it was funnier than it actually was, much like when Charlotte gets dysentery and has ... well, a little accident. Most of the audience saw the humor in that, so I guess contrived toilet humor still has its place.    So do over the top sexual references. Take Samantha's dog: she lovingly adopts it because it constantly masturbates. The agent tells her that it hasn't lost the urge, despite having been spayed. This is what counts for funny nowadays? Bottom-of-the-barrel gags like this belong in teenage spoofs, not in romantic comedies. Indeed, this movie probably would have worked much better as a spoof, seeing as the main characters are too broadly drawn to be anything other than inside jokes. There are, in fact, only two tolerable characters in this film. One is Miranda; despite being shallow and cynical, she's the most realistic of the four women. She seems to have genuine life problems. That being said, her sarcastic tone of voice is tiresome at the very start: when Charlotte says that Brooklyn is the new Manhattan, Miranda responds, \\"Whoever said that lives in Brooklyn.\\"    The other character is Louise (Jennifer Hudson), who's eventually hired as Carrie's assistant. Louise is from St. Louis, and like many young girls, she's moved to New York to fall in love again. She believes so strongly in love that she actually carries a keychain of the word at all times. Can Carrie learn a thing or two from this clear-eyed young woman? I don't see why anyone would care one way or the other--the entire premise of \\"Sex and the City\\" is so phony that any outcome fails to be meaningful. There's a moment late in the film when the four friends attend a fashion show, and as we all know, runway models are nothing more than hangers to advertise the designer outfits. This movie is much like that fashion show, all façades and no depth, displaying outrageous styles that no one in the real world appreciates. There's only one thing I appreciated: the scene that reintroduces the Cosmopolitan. It's a great reminder that alcohol is the only thing that can get you through this movie.

B00164KYS2|4.0|Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte: they're all back, now in their 40's and approaching 50 but still fighting the good fight (at least all but Charlotte is)...looking for Love into which they fall in and out of on a regular basis.<br />Many of the things we loved about the HBO series are back: Mr. Big (who knew his name was John?), the 2 Gay sidekicks Anthony and Stanford, the ridiculously outlandish clothes and shoes and more importantly the enduring and refreshing love that exists between these 4 women. What is not here, as it was not there in the TV series is snarky, condescending comments about or between our Sex and the City women. These women are truly friends: caring, sympathetic and empathetic about each other. If nothing else this is what sets this film apart from any film featuring a cast of women...think \\"8 Women\\" or \\"The Women\\" and you'll understand. Men may come and go but our quartet is present both physically and emotionally for each other. They love each other in the way the best platonic friends love each other: selfishly and selflessly.<br />The story revolves around our heroine's boyfriends, husbands, babies and of course, Mr. Big. At the beginning of the film, Carrie and John (it's weird to call him that) are set to marry in a lavish wedding set in New York's Public Library Rotunda: Carrie is wearing her Vivienne Westwood gown and John is sporting a resplendent John Varvatos tux. Then all hell breaks loose.<br />\\"Sex and the City\\" is a lot of fun and it is great to see our heroines together once again inter-reacting. But there is a deep sadness at the core here. We've watched these women for years yet emotionally they are still striving to find their true place in the universe. We crave for them to find happiness because we love them and hold them close to our hearts. And by-the-way, of what other characters in films can we say this? But director and writer,<br />Michael Patrick King resists making the easy fix. He doesn't try to tie up their stories with a big red satin bow: he knows these women and owes them and us a plausible, respectful and humane continuation of their lives. King respects their past and uses it to mold their futures. And for this we thank him and for creating these terrific  4 women.a big red satin bow: he knows these women and owes them and us a plausible, respectful and humane continuation of their lives.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|First: The main theme of all the negative reviews seems to be \\"This show glorifies killing.\\" Yes, it does. But there's something very important that we all need to realize and come to understand: We have been killing each other since we first appeared on this planet. Hitler didn't watch Dexter. Genghis Khan didn't watch Dexter. The two idiots that shot up Columbine didn't watch Dexter. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that none of our history's most notorious killers and criminals have ever seen the show Dexter.    I love this show. I think it's the best show on television right now. Am I going to run out and start taking out criminals because I think Dexter is one of the best shows I've ever seen? No. Will someone else? Possibly, but that desire was already there.    I've read a lot of great arguments for and against watching this show, and I've drawn this conclusion: If you people used the passion that you put into writing your reviews for something that actually mattered, we'd all be better off.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Just a note to teachers: The boxed set clearly is an excellent investment for history and social studies teachers. But I particularly like the \\"Why We Fight\\" episode as a non-judgmental view of the Holocaust, as seen through the eyes of American soldiers. Those who teach about morals and values in Sunday School classes might also find this particular episode helpful.

After the first read, I understood it (as we were suppose to) and if I were inclined to, I would read it a second time and go \\"oooh.\\" I give it four stars mainly because of my personal taste about non-linear chronology, and I didn't see what it had to do with my class (Understanding Religious Traditions in Multicultural America). While religion is a topic in this book, I felt it focused more on class/caste systems and different cultural expectations the characters had. Tragedies are everywhere in this book; I can't find a single happy ending, but the characters are vivid and distinct. Non-South Asians may have a hard time remembering the names at first.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Forget that the film is a classic. This is a favorite of mine for what comes with it, and the beautiful artwork on the discs...If your a Floydian Overlord then this is a must have or you can't pop bubbles backwards while standing, giggling and smiling, really trying to let go...
0756404746|5.0|Some passages are excellently written - I passed them onto a friend because I found them that exciting - and the characters are entertaining. However, it does take a while to get into Kvothe's story, as opposed to Kote's life and while the questions surrounding the innkeeper's life are a bit interesting, they weren't what I was looking for. However, once it finally captures your attention, it is excellent reading material while in airports and on the flight! It's not very heavy on the magic (known as \\"sympathy\\" in the book) and fantastic elements, though a character is a member of the Fae. I hope the rest of the trilogy delves into it, then!
1423101464|5.0|My 5th grade son loves this series, and the great thing is that I genuinely enjoy these books as well.  Battle of the Labyrinth is no exception; it's a fun, modernized way to learn stories from Greek mythology, and because we're both so enthusiastic about them, it's a wonderful way to connect with him.  Sometimes we read together, but more often than not, he can't put the book down once he picks it up and I'm perpetually behind him in the story!  I'm also a teacher at a 6-12 urban school, and the students at the middle school level love this series.  A definite winner for kids from late elementary to middle school age, the books in this series have won multiple awards, including Children's Choice Book Awards, and Battle of the Labyrinth is bound to follow suit.
0048232084|4.0|This is a collection of narratives ranging in time from the Elder Days of iddle Earth to the end of the War of the Ring.  It is a book for those who have not sufficiently explored Middle Earth, its language, its legeneds, politics and kings.
B000PY52EU|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I thought \\"Oh, Please. How stupid\\" When I saw it I was blown away. This is a wonderful story about how 2 people help eachother find redemption in an unusual way I grant. It isn't what you think at all and the ending is positive. And don't even get me started on the music. I bought the sound track right away. Don't be thrown off by the title or the cover art, give this film a chance and you won't be sorry.
B000LC4TJ0|3.0|Musically glorious  if you can accept the slow pace. After this no one should accuse von Karajan of slow tempi. Visually takes some getting used to. Not the usual sumptuous period costumes, rather stark but interesting. The \\"addition\\" of the cherub character was distracting and was in whole a negative for this production. Doesn't compare well with the Glyndebourne  Opera production with Te Kanawa, von Stade etc. for total effect but musically it holds its own pretty well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Seriously the best 20 minute workout video ever.  You NEVER stop, but it is worth it at the end.  Great for the person with little time, but a desire to make every minute count.  NO RESTING!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|There is nothing I can't say that hasn't been said already about this one, except to say that this one is NOW on par with \\"Enterprise\\" & \\"Next Generation\\" just as it should be, after all it is set between these two, & the visual effects are stunning & not overdone, If you want consistency in the way of visual effects, than this is the one to get hands down!!!!
B0014KD46W|5.0|No pop hooks here but an outstanding assortment of musical genres and grooves. This work captures the essence of the artists roots as he continues to branch out and explore in a sort of eclectic worldly diversity. Call it a blend of what Traffic or Blind Faith would be in 2008. This collection of songs will certainly stand the test of time...catch the Groove!
B0013V33DG|5.0|I puchased this DVD to hear Juan Diego Florez, I was not disappointed but also fell in love with Natalie Dessay and the entire cast. An extremely entertaining program.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD.  I have not been very consistent with exercise videos in the past but this one is really good.  I am still on level one and it really kicks my butt!  I love the fact that there are 3 levels on the same DVD and that they are all less than 30 minutes each.  It is very easy to fit this in during the day and you feel like you got a really good workout in just 25 or 30 minutes.  I love the circuit training aspect of the DVD - 3 sets of strength then cardio then abs.  This really gets your heart pumping but the constant change up of the exercises makes the time go by quickly!  I will be buying more of Jillian's videos!!
B00003CXFV|5.0|I saw Erin Brockovich a couple of years ago and a recent episode of \\"Shark\\" on CBS reminded me of it so I bought it to see again.  I am so very pleased with the movie and the persons I bought it from - it came lickety split and I couldn't be happier.

0974872407|5.0|Great novel, will tell you about the history of Barcelona and very entertaining and well-written, a must-have of the current Spanish literature.
B000007R1E|3.0|Unfortunately, this is a DTS 5.1 CD, not a DVD-Audio as claimed.  Having both this version and the SACD multi-channel release, I can tell you that the SACD sounds vastly superior.   The high end on the DTS disc is highly exaggerated.  If you do not have a 5.1 SACD player, you may want to go ahead and get this DTS version as the music still gets 5 stars.  BTW, both the DTS version and the SACD are derived from the original quad masters, so don't expect to hear a center channel.  Also, the SACD offers some interesting bonus tracks.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|George Lucas and Steven Spielberg team up once again for the 4th installment of Indiana Jones.     As expected, they have gone overboard with the CGI, however... you may feel that aliens and telekinesis powers and zombies are just too unrealistic for the Indiana Jones franchise, but then again, I suppose a fictional holey grail, and ancients who rip hearts out was over the top too, so Indiana Jones has never been on the non-fiction side of the real world.    I did not like this one as much as the 1st and 3rd Indy, but it's better then the second one for sure.    Indy is back, 20 years after the last movie, his father and Marcus have died. But his girl is back, and he has a son this time. Indy is first brought to Area 51 in 1950 something, and he is to help the bad guys find an alien skull that is made of crystal and magnetic. Then the rest of the movie is him escaping them, the FBI and trying to return this skull to it's rightful place.    I guess Spielberg and Lucas decided to blend some of there old movies together, some felt like American Graffiti mixed with Close Encounters meets the X-Files.    Overall, if you go in not expecting it to top the last movie, then it is kind of a fun ride. Just remember to suspend belief in reality, and the movie is ok.     It just seemed some things where rather rushed, and not expanded upon, tho, maybe they cut out a lot of scenes. So it will be interesting to see the deleted scenes when this comes out. Provided they release a proper edition when they release it on DVD and not release a single disc, then a special edition later, then a gold edition, then the 2 year anniversary edition etc..    Just watch it in expecting to see something very different from previous films a long with a little of the old Indy feel mixed in.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|very sexy movie with lots of dancing!one sad part that will put a tear in your eye!
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I only vaguely remember the prime-time tv series this movie shares its title with, but I'm quite sure it was nothing like this ham fisted Too-Fast-Too-Furious style \\"cop\\" drama.  Where do I even start with this one?  How about a basic plot summary: a couple of super-cops, who are best friends, one black the other white, are approached by shadowy FBI or DEA or Government type guys.  Apparently the FBI/DEA/whatever agents fudged up so obviously these super cops, who speed around town all day in flashy sports cars, are the only ones awesome enough to infiltrate the drug lord's inner circle.  Invariably the cops succeed, but have to deal with complications and one of cops nearly loses his way, being seduced by a woman... the drug lord's girlfriend.  Sound familiar?    One of my favorite exchanges was halfway in, when Foxx says to Farrell, \\"So what's going on?\\" Collin says, \\"As in?\\"  Fox: \\"As in there is undercover and then there is 'Which way is up?'\\" Collin replies, \\"You think I'm in so deep I forgot?\\"  Fox says \\"I will never doubt you.\\"  Then, if I remember correctly they kiss.  I could be mistaken about that last part, but such trite Tv-cop dialogue is all this movie offers.  I'm dead serious.  Every line is terrible.  In fact, every minute of the movie is so laced with cliche you'd swear you're watching a farcical send-up of the genre...  except that the movie takes itself so seriously the dvd might have a stick up its butt.  There is at least one rather grotesquely violent scene early on, and elsewhere I got the impression Michael Mann was trying hard to make this film seem \\"gritty\\".      Even so, most of the time I spent watching this pile I was laughing out loud at the inept writing, acting and forced chic of costumes and accessories.  The editorial reviewer here called it 'stylish,' but apart from the fact that everyone in the movie wears expensive suits, drives fast cars and has a hot girlfriend, there really is no style in evidence, only thin artifice.  I really don't know who would appreciate stuff like this, but apparently someone does, because every year Hollywood coughs up inane, expensive looking dreck like this.  Please don't waste time or money on this garbage.  Try Hot Fuzz instead.  It's genuinely funny, stylish in an English kind of way, and is smart enough to realize and even mock the inherent cliche of cop-buddy movies.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This album gets kind of lost between the masterful comeback Time Out of Mind and the recent, magnificent Modern Times, but it's just as good as those two albums, and it's a masterpiece on its own terms.<br /><br />It's probably Dylan's most eclectic album musicially.  It's all over the place, with hard guitar driven rock (Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, Honest with Me), hardcore blues (Lonesome Day Blues, Cry a While), swing (Summer Days), Hoagy Carmicael balladry (Bye and Bye, Moonlight, and Po' Boy), spooky blues (High Water and the closer Sugar Baby), and beautiful, moving ballads (Mississippi, Floater).  Dylan's voice is pretty croaky here, but somehow it suits the material quite well, even on the lovely ballads like Floater and Mississippi.  Mississippi is quite a beautiful song, a leftover from the Time Out of Mind album, but it fits here quite well.  I love Summer Days.  Hearing Dylan do a magnificent swing song (at 61, with his backing band going full tilt) is wonderful.  Dylan's band here is arguably the best he's ever worked with.  They're incredibly tight and intense throughout, showing their dexterity by playing in almost any style.  The rockers (especially Honest With Me) really showcase the band at their peak.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album is quite silly at times, yet Dylan's sincerity really carries over such sentimental songs like Moonlight and Bye and Bye.  Floater (Too Much to Ask) (great title) is one of Dylan's most unique and interesting ballads ever.  It's awesome that Dylan keeps surprising himself, as well as us.<br /><br />This is amongst my favorite Dylan albums, as I break it out a lot.  Musicially, it's his best and most varied, and lyrically, it's wonderful.
B00002E233|2.0|Genetically engineered sharks make a meal to go out of their keepers.<br />This movie even has the skinny English actress star disrobe to shock a shark. I suppose some people like this kind of movie,<br />but actually drug companies are more into killing chimps than<br />sharks. Anyway every body thinks they may have been paying for<br />bad experimental science. As far as I know very few scientific<br />projects get out of hand like this<br />and the ones that do are government ones and they are covered up good?<br />Drug companies are more into frog skins, tree bark and native herbs,<br />than genetically engineering the sea equivalent to<br />tigers.
0756404746|5.0|I pick fantasy novels by their covers which is a horrible system that has left me with a teetering stack of paperbacks with bent corners somewehere in the middle of the pages indicating the exact moment in time at which the small thin needle indicating the real time position of my time and an author's story lost its delicate metastability and fell into the black hole of disinterest.  This book conquered the scrum and joins [[ASIN:0765350386 The Final Empire (Mistborn, Book 1)]]and [[ASIN:055358202X A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire)]]in the exclusive club of half grown branches impatiently tapping their twigs awaiting the next installation to be budded.      A great book well worth your time.

B000127LW2|3.0|The packaging for this DVD set was awful.  After I played the second disc for the first time the hub in the case broke off when I gently placed the disc back in.  The DVD's played all right and were of average quality for sound and picture. I would recommend buying your own cases since the discs may be damaged if you store them in the one that was provided with the set. The Memorex twin cases, sold here at Amazon and in many stores, are a good replacement since they offer much better protection for the DVD's.  Fortunately, Amazon greatly reduced the price of this item (it's now at $34.95, fifty percent off the regular price), although it doesn't appear to be something of great quality for your money. Unfortunately, Star Trek fans don't have any other option than to purchase these sets since they are the only selection of Voyager available. If you are a fan of the series as I am you'll want this collection for the episodes, but you might be very disappointed in the quality of the set.

B0012SCHZK|4.0|I liked this movie enough to buy it. It is so close to being real actors that it is hard to tell the difference. The story itself is enough to sell it. People who give it bad ratings are just hung up on animation to much. I have talked to friends who think this is a great movie also. Its different from regular animation to the point of almost being real. I can't wait to see more of this genre.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This was such a great movie. I don't usually cry in movies but I was sobbing in this one, but don't let that turn you off because this is the type of movie that makes you laugh and cry and the same time so while I was sobbing I was cracking up. It is so good and I recommend that everyone watch it.
B000F8O4DQ|4.0|I heard this album in the first time, in this first issue, a vinil record, in 70's. It was from a friend o' mine, and he said that the songs was like a Beatles song. I agree. The people who have ELO's \\"the best of\\" albuns, must buy this catalogue album, because the entire album have the same level songs.
B000244EMO|5.0|Watching the 2 disc collector's edition of Predator I was amazed how well this film has held up! I think I liked it more now than when I saw it in a theater. This edition boast a nice DVD transfer and enough extras to keep me happy. Commentary, 'making of' with all the stars (old and new footage), deleted scenes, Predator profile, etc...etc. This is a tense good old fashioned Sci-Fi monster movie and there is a lot of restraint used as we don't get to see much of the 'Predator', until the memorable finale. The FX still look great and this has got to be one of the best creature designs in the last 20 or 30 years! I forgot how good a movie can look without any CGI in it!<br /><br />If the movie has any flaws, it's that there isn't any \\"real\\" depth to the characters, but it's an action Sci-Fi movie, so who cares. It's a lot of fun with a great monster and excellent pacing! Grab some popcorn and buy this 2 disc set!  It's out of this world........how cheesy can ya get! :-)
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is her best album in years. No political statements, no introspective narrations. It's all about getting it's listeners moving to the beat. It's a nod to her early 80's work with a hip hop flavor mixed in to spice things up and give it a modern edge. It works for her. A must buy for turning up loud in your car, on your patio, or on the dance floor. Way to go, Madge.
B00009MGR6|5.0|This is a great album! The first 3 songs on the album \\"Heatseeker\\", \\"That's the way I wanna Rock 'n' Roll\\" and \\"Meanstreak\\" are songs that will get anyone tapping their feet. Brian Johnson has a great sense of humor and it shows with songs like \\"Go Zone\\", \\"Two's Up\\" and the before mention \\"Meanstreak\\".. And how could you not help but play air guitar during the fastest song on the album \\"This Means War\\".. If you like AC/DC, this is a great album to listen too..
074325144X|5.0|I've been stuck in the novice mode of running for years, and I always thought that it was because I just wasn't trying hard enough or that I had the wrong shoes. I started from scratch several times, but I consistently got pain in my shins or knees   whenever I ran more than a couple miles. This book has helped me focus on my form and I've made consistent progress.   Now, I must admit, I always just thought I could run and that it would be a  natural, easy thing to do.  I'm not sure why it never occurred to me to practice running the way I practice yoga: to focus on tiny, incremental changes in your body to free yourself and become better.  I had seen this book in the stores before and thought it sounded just a little too new-agey  for me. The technique does borrow some of its ideas from tai chi, but the author is a serious runner who has an incredible amount of mileage under his belt and, while the approach may not be entirely scientific, it works.  I think it's really more grounded in common sense, ie. if what you're doing hurts, you're doing something wrong.  This book has made me excited about running.  Instead of thinking exclusively about how many miles I'm going to do on a given day, I think about how I'm going to get better and make myself feel good.  I feel free!
0451450523|5.0|this is a really good book but the movie was really good as well and faithfull to the book.
B000063DI9|5.0|This was Iron Maiden's last studio album of the 80s, a decade they ruled the metal scene with their classic string of albums. The golden years of Maiden would end with this album, as guitarist Adrian Smith would jump ship, Bruce Dickinson would begin to change his voice slightly, and the bands overall songwriting would begin to dip.     This is, possibly, Iron Maiden's best album. However, those 1st seven albums are all fantastic, and I really don't have a favorite. It depends on what kind of mood I am in.     This album has a remarkable feel to it. They keyboards and music go along perfectly to the storyline. Oh yeah, this is Maiden's great and only concept record, and it stands as one of the best metal concept albums ever. Highlights are basically every song. The lyrics are fantastic (just read the lyrics to \\"The Evil That Men Do\\") and Dickinson really belts it on this one.    This was a fantastic way to close the decade for the band. The 90s would prove difficult for Maiden, going through the dark age of metal and the departure of Dickinson. They would make one truly great album in that entire decade (The X Factor) and then Bruce and Adrian would return, going into the 2000s as they were in the 80s: GODS.    Go buy this one. You will be doing yourself a favor.

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I haven't played the game version, but I'm certainly hooked on this action/horror/sci-fiction story that moves along at a great pace. When experiments by the Umbrella Corporation result in an out of control, mutating T-virus, Raccoon City suffers the consequences. Alice is a highly trained super-chick who fights Zombies as she tries to get the secret to the surface of 'The Hive' to warn the innocent people. A mad scientist has more sinister plans for Alice and her fighting skills, not to mention the computer run 'Red Queen' who doesn't want to risk letting anyone out and taking a chance on spreading the virus. Of course, it's already too late for many of the living.  Can't wait to view the next in this series!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I'm very surprised - shocked even - by all the negative reviews.     Yes, the camera was constantly shaking and many scenes had to be followed extremely closely - but the overall effect of the movie was breathtaking.     The first 20 mins was a pain but (just like the Deer Hunter to be fair) it set up the rest of the movie perfectly. I can't remember seeing so many clever ideas and creative concepts thrown at the camera in such a short period of time, amazing. And well done to the writer/producer/director for having the guts and skill to get this cut past the studio without 'explaining' every last single detail - the answers are there if you look closely enough (spoiler... ish  watch the end scene at Coney Island VERY carefully).    My only moan would be the monster seemed to be stalking the lead actor relentlessly out of every person that happened to be in Manhattan - but on the overall scale of things a minor gripe in what was one of the most satisfying movies I've seen in ages.

B0013BNY2Q|2.0|First of all, I have to say that I love this band. Albums like Murmur, Reckoning, Life's Rich Pageant and Automatic for the People have to put REM in the top ten of late 20th century bands. They created the minor key driven genre that is alternative music today. No REM, no Wilco.<br /><br />Having said that though, who knew that it all ended for REM with Automatic for the People? Everything these guys have put out since that album has struggled mightily to measure up to their earlier discography.<br /><br />I do have to admit that Accelerate is a slight step in the right direction however. I'm not going to bother with a song-by-song description of this disc. Other reviewers have done a good job of that and doing so would be an even greater waste of time than listening to this album.
B000001C6M|2.0|Slayer's first album has not held up all that well, especially if you're cruel enough to judge it relative to their next few records.  They're a bit larval here.  Their musical growth and, uh, evil satanic menace growth or whatever between this and Hell Awaits is absolutely amazing.  By my count this ten-track debut has only three good songs on it: \\"Die By the Sword,\\" \\"Black Magic\\" and \\"The Antichrist.\\"  And on that last I just have to laugh aloud at how petulantly pubescent Tom Araya sounds while screaming, \\"I am the antichrist!\\"  To take the song at all seriously you have to listen to the live version on Decade of Aggression.  On the plus side, the part at the beginning of \\"Metal Storm\\" where King and Hanneman play the same riff over and over together with no accompaniment sounds pretty cool, even if the rest of the song sucks.  So if you're not much of a Slayer fan don't bother; they have some much better albums.  But if you're like me and you loves you your Slayer, then it's worth satisfying your curiosity about their first album.  It's kinda fun.    Song by song:    A1 Evil Has No Boundaries **  A2 The Antichrist ***  A3 Die by the Sword ***  A4 Fight Till Death **  A5 Metal Storm / Face the Slayer **  B1 Black Magic ***  B2 Tormentor *  B3 The Final Command *  B4 Crionics **  B5 Show No Mercy **
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|After slurring the blues on the three-disc &#34;Live in Boston,&#34; Jim Morrison comes alive for this remarkable Doors concert. Recorded on May 2, 1970, &#34;Live in Pittsburgh&#34; may be the group's finest live album to date — even better than the Detroit and Philadelphia releases. For 79 minutes, the Doors  deliver the goods with excellent versions of &#34;Back Door Man,&#34; &#34;Roadhouse Blues,&#34; &#34;Mystery Train&#34; and &#34;Light My Fire.&#34; The 22-minute &#34;When the Music's Over&#34; is simply astonishing. Throw in a rare performance of &#34;Someday Soon&#34; and you have a definite keeper.
B000009QPE|5.0|Reign in Blood is start-to-finish thrash metal nirvana; you need to own it; and anyone who says a word against it is wrong.  Unless they're just squeamish with a song about Josef Mengele that you have to read with moderate care to realize it's anti-Nazi, I guess I can understand that.  Structurally, the album starts and ends with \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood,\\" which are between four and five minutes each.  Those longer, rather more elaborate songs bookend eight vicious, hardcore-influenced middle tracks, all but one of which is under three minutes.  I've read that the reason this album had such an impact was that it combined an extreme thrash metal sound with hardcore punk song structures, but I don't know the history anywhere near well enough to pass judgment on that claim.  I do think that part of the reason the thing is so compulsively listenable is that most of it whips by so quickly that when it ends you're like what, it's over already?  I have to listen to that again.  Lyrically it's wall-to-wall evil killing of course.  \\"Necrophobic\\" makes a nice contrast with \\"Necrophiliac\\" from their last album.  \\"Altar of Sacrifice\\" could almost be describing some sort of modern art installation.  \\"Jesus Saves\\" has one of their more defensible anti-Christian messages and is among their fastest songs.   \\"Reborn\\" is about a witch who will come back from the dead to wreak vengeance on the priest who's burning her at the stake, so without compromising the evilness one iota this album actually has a sort of a feminist song on it!  What other thrash album has that?  Not only is \\"Raining Blood\\" a splendidly wicked song with a great riff, but on youtube you can see them play the song live while blood actually rains down on them during the song.  How cool is that?  Gods I love this album, why can't all metal be this awesome?    Song by song:    A1 Angel of Death ****  A2 Piece by Piece ***  A3 Necrophobic ***  A4 Altar of Sacrifice ***  A5 Jesus Saves ***  B1 Criminally Insane ***  B2 Reborn ****  B3 Epidemic ***  B4 Postmortem ***  B5 Raining Blood ***
B0006ZFQP8|3.0|I do not like recordings where singers appear that absolutely could not sing their roles on stage. An example is Turandot on Decca, with the marvellous Joan Sutherland - a coloratura soprano as the icy princess. I have experienced Dame Joan live on several occasions and I know she had a marvellous and very big sound all the way up in the strasosphere, but why do you think this clever lady never sang Turandot on the stage? Because she knew that it possibly could have damaged her highest notes. For the same reason she never sung or recorded Abigaille i Nabucco. Here, as Isolde, we have the most beautiful voice of Margaret Price, a skilful and lovely artist, but surely, she could never have sung the role of Isolde on stage, beeing a wonderful Mozart, Verdi and even Strauss singer. She did never take part in a staged performance, certainly knowing that she could have lost her voice after the dramatic first act, just as Helga Dernesch did, during an actual performance. Dernesch also losed her top notes all too early in her career. For long, Carlos Kleiber tried to get the Swedish Wagnerian soprano Catarina Ligendza as his Isolde, but she denied, meaning - after her experiences with the recording of the DG Meistersinger - that the way recordings nowadays are made, on small pieces of tape put together without any feeling of continuity in the making, was so unnatural that she could never more take part in studio recordings. Kollo is acceptable as Tristan, no more. It is well known that the conductor wanted another tenor. Kleiber conducts wonderfully and the sound is clean, the orchestra in top form. But because of the singers in the main parts, this should never be your first choice of a Tristan recording. It could, however, fit in as a beautiful second or third choice, perhaps after Nilsson and Flagstad.
B000002UR7|2.0|(Actually **1/2, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars.)    Pablo Honey isn't actually a bad album per se.  It's just that, in comparison to the rest of their discography, it has two major problems.  First, this is the only Radiohead album that could have been recorded by any competent band of their time, place and genre.  Apart from the memorable single \\"Creep,\\" there's nothing unique or special here, which is why \\"Creep\\" is the only thing most people know from this album.  They're not wrong.  Second, only about half the songs are any good.  \\"How Do You?\\" \\"I Can't,\\" \\"Lurgee,\\" and especially the lovely \\"Stop Whispering\\" are nice enough, kinda pretty mid-tempo pop rock songs with decent melodies.  There's \\"Creep.\\"  And \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is a damn fine, catchy number where you get to hear Thom Yorke yell that he wants to be Jim Morrison (!), which is so funny it makes the whole album worth hearing at least once.  But then the rest of it is boring and/or annoying.  If Radiohead would have kept writing songs like this they would have been a one-hit wonder and an early-'90s trivia question, but fortunately they got a whole lot better real soon.    Song by song:    1 You **  2 Creep ***  3 How Do You? ***  4 Stop Whispering ***  5 Thinking About You **  6 Anyone Can Play Guitar ***  7 Ripcord **  8 Vegetable *  9 Prove Yourself **  10 I Can't ***  11 Lurgee ***  12 Blow Out ***  13      Creep [Clean] **

B0009MAP9A|5.0|(Actually ****1/2, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars.)    This album stars Robert Zimmerman as one Bob Dylan, a homegrown American protest folksinger coming out of the backcountry with a keen eye for injustice and a keener ear for memorable, plainspoken lines to expose and excoriate that injustice.  Of course on his very next album that same Dylan turned his back on the civil rights movement at the height of its prominence, influence and power to change the country, which to me does cast just the tiniest bit of doubt and suspicion on the sincerity or at least the fervor of these songs.  But with that said, at this point in his career Bob Dylan happened to have a still unequaled ability to say big things with small words, and these songs are the best of their genre.    The title track is Dylan's second epochal, anthemic album opener in a row, and it's just as irrevocably tied to and representative of the early '60s as is \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" from the last album.  \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" is a raspy little ditty all full of lovely imagery all built around a ship's arrival as a metaphor for victory, presumably a victory of the civil rights movement.  The moving and rightly classic \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" captures Dylan the protest singer at the absolute height of his powers to tell a story, paint a picture and a stir up outrage.    \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" should be a terrible song.  In it, Bob uses the recent assassination of Medgar Evers as a jumping-off point to argue that the white Southern elite inculcates and exploits racism among poor white Southerners in order to keep them hateful toward and divided from the poor black Southerners who should be their class allies against that elite.  Now that's a theme that sounds like its natural venue is an essay, a political speech or perhaps a scholarly book.  So I would expect the thing to turn out as one of those really awkward, unenjoyable folk songs with too many syllables that make me want to throwa typewriter at the singer.  But Bob Dylan in 1964 had the lyrical chops to make it work, and it ends up being one of the best songs on a nearly perfect album.    I say nearly perfect because \\"Restless Farewell\\" is a subdued, unimpressive good-bye that just sort of drags along without ever grabbing or rewarding my attention.  But apart from that, my gods, if he would've kept on like this maybe we could have had a revolution.    Song by song:    A1 The Times They Are A-Changin' ****  A2 Ballad of Hollis Brown ***  A3 With God on Our Side ***  A4 One Too Many Mornings ***  A5 North Country Blues ***  B1 Only a Pawn in Their Game ****  B2 Boots of Spanish Leather ***  B3 When the Ship Comes In ****  B4 The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll ***  B5 Restless Farewell     **
0689835604|4.0|I had low expectations for this book but my 6 month old loves this book.  She giggles every time I lift one of the flaps!
0345350499|2.0|This book has long been recommended to me by friends for its wonderful story and character development.  While the first-half of the book is masterfully plot-driven, it is not enough to cover for editoral mistakes.  Further in the novel, the hypocrisy of the characters really grated on my nerves.  Bradley quite obviously hated Christianity, but after reading this novel, how could anyone ever consider neo-paganism seriously?  She completely destroyed her own thinly-veiled objectives.  Additionally, the characters were not really developed at all and popped in and out of the story-line like soap-opera characters, without attention to previous plot.  Not glad i spent the time on this as my first foray into Arthurian legend.  NOT RECOMMEDED!!
B0010358EE|4.0|Even if you are not an anime fan I think you can enjoy this film. Stunning visuals, cool story and killer action make for a great hi-def experience.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|I love watching this movie! Ricci and McAvoy worked so well together and it was nice to see Witherspoon play a supporting role and a character different from her usual. This is a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and one that teaches a great lesson: to love yourself as you are.
B000002ZR7|5.0|Tatiana Nikolayeva -- whose Bach playing on the piano so impressed Shostakovitch that he was inspired to compose his own preludes and fugues, op. 87 and dedicate them to her -- surpasses many of the best recordings of the \\"Goldberg Variations,\\" including those by Tureck (VAI)and Hewitt (Hyperion). Her \\"Art of Fugue\\" and \\"Musical Offering\\" -- also on Hyperion -- are also outstanding (Desert Island Disc category).
B00154GEFU|5.0|I think this is the best ASIA album yet!!! You can hear and feel the experiences of life through the words of the songs. These four musicians, like a fine wine,  have gotten better with age. If classic bands were able to get the radio airplay as they did in the \\"good old days\\" then this album would skyrocket to the top of the charts.
B0000C6K09|5.0|He's the best....the music of John Williams all in one awesome set...always amazed at the amount of work from this talent.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|On the surface, this film sounds like a great idea, if trying to be innovative and original.  But, as it plays out, it is not very appealing to watch.  And not just because it's shaky, but because there really is no written story.  It plays out as if it's just something that got captured on an amateur video recorder.  It has us sit through about nearly 20 minutes of  a casual party scene in someone's apartment which is boring as hell even for only 20 minutes.  Finally, the element of shock kicks in and the non-reality finally comes into play. Suddenly, there are monsters in the street and everyone is scared for their lives.  Even the guy with the camcorder seems to think it's more important to keep the video camera running, than to save his own butt which would represent more of a reality in its truest sense.<br /><br />And just like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", a raw looking camcorder based film is sickening to watch on the big screen.  And when it's all over, who would want to watch it again?  Once the \\"shock factor\\" has passed, the film can no longer be interesting, if it was at all.  You're not going to be shocked again so that one thrill that was there will be lost forevermore.<br /><br />Like I said, the whole concept sounds interesting, but the end result is  nothing great as you watch it.
0671042858|5.0|Once again Stephen King has come through for us!  This book was a real page turner. It was very rich in details and suspense.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|There is absolutely nothing special about this movie. The acting (if you could call it that), story, and handy cam gimmick are nothing new. The movie is short and trite and has the feel of a bad TV movie. Sure they spent a few extra dollars on special effects but they are few and far between and have nothing that stands out. Most are dark half glimpses of the bland looking monster hiding behind a building. I cannot see why anyone would give this movie more than a quick glance, unless they are 14 year-old youtubers who think horror remakes are the s--t.
B0014BECF8|5.0|Songs for Living and Songs for Loving: This is a beautifully arranged collection of many of George Michael's classic recordings, along with new releases that confirm his voice remains one of the most exquisite in popular music. Duets including the Stevie Wonder classic \\"As\\" with Mary J. Blige and the new release \\"This is Not Real Love\\" with Mutya, as well as GM's stunning cover of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", make this CD set truely special. If you have all of George Michael's previous recordings, Wham through Patience, your collection is not complete without this one.
0451169514|5.0|I would consider myself a pretty big fan of Stephen King's work, and I can confidently say that this book basically defines the horror genre. I guess a good (although somewhat unfair) way to gauge the genius of this story is to compare it to \\"The Stand\\" (my personal favorite work of King's). Where \\"The Stand\\" is slightly different than the rest of King's work in that it's not so much horror but rather a horrifying yet believable \\"what if\\" situation, \\"It\\" truly perfects the \\"monster under your bed\\" kind of horror. While it seems slightly more juvenile than \\"The Stand\\", it paints the images in your mind that haunt you as you lay in your dark bedroom trying to go to sleep. King did a terrific job of developing some very interesting characters and traits. It is not my favorite book of all time, but I'm sure I will pull it out every few years to read it again. If you are a fan of horror, \\"It\\" is a must read.
B0013J30XG|5.0|I had forgotten how much I loved this show, but the movie brought it all back to me!<br /><br />I admit the first time I saw it, the editing was SO different it shook me, but after 4 times now I'm loving it more and more.  Everytime I see it I see something else I missed before and to see it on IMAX....do it if you have the chance!<br /><br />It's such a shame this movie is doing so bad in the boxoffice, I hope it makes up in the DVD release, I know I'll be getting it!<br /><br />Wonderful cast and crew...don't know much about those directors, never saw any of their work....yes, I have NOT seen The Matrix films, but I hear they want to do another Speed Racer movie, this time in 3-D.<br /><br />But DO see this movie!
0671042858|3.0|This is a great book for a quick read, and does effectively capture a very common fear: getting lost in the woods and being stalked by a giant, unknown creature. This probably would have been better as a short story, but King did a great job pulling you in and relating with the main character. Most people who have read some of King's other works will probably not enjoy this that much, but this is tame enough that some younger readers (teens) would probably enjoy it quite a bit.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|I am a Janeite, and I love Austen's books AND the movies that have been made from them.  I have seen just about every tv and movie adaptation, and this is my favorite version of Sense and Sensibility.  The acting and cinematography are a delight.      If you are a purist, it seems that Emma Thompson or Ang Lee chose to make Edward Ferras (played by Hugh Grant)a bit more sympathetic in the movie than he is in the book.  However, I found this to be thoroughly forgivable and not distracting.     This movie sticks closely to the Austen plot, is historically accurate, and has fascinating characters brought to life by extremely talented actors. If this genre of film holds any interest for you, this is a winner!
B000ESST6U|5.0|Just a quick summary: Visually stunning: at last a set with perspective and depth, if not decoratively rococo. The period has been shifted forward to the late end of the 18th, beginning of the 19th century--sort of Lord Nelson in Egypt. A DVD of a live production with satisfying camera work for those who love opera in the theatre first  (unlike the Sellars Cesare, with its close-in camera and crotch  shots with no sense of the stage as stage). Use of choreographed movement during ritornellos is clever, satisfying, and musical (though not 'historical'). Musically wonderful, forward-moving, as we've come to expect of Christie. Overall MUCH better singing than in the Sellars film or the Opera Australia (Francisco Negrin) production on DVD. Perhaps in Connolly as close to a satisfying woman singing the role of Cesare as we will get. Still some sillinesses, but apparently successful silliness judging by the audience chuckles. The singing in the other Negrin production (conducted by Mortensen) is also to treasure, if you prefer this opera in fatigues and more emphasis on cruelty.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have to admit this set is awesome! They have like 6 DVDs per season I think and two books that are slam packed with info. One book is has all of the GG's -isms. The intelligence of the writers is shown throughout the books.
B00005JPNY|3.0|Overall the movie wasn't bad, I just think that they were too focused on the special effects and not the story. The overall story seemed rushed and what was probably pivotal plot points in the book seemed to be missing from the movie.
1897299214|4.0|Unfortunately I do agree with the person who felt slight disappointment with the artwork - and I found depth of penetration of the subject slightly disappointing too. And yet the book did leave a deep impression on me, of shock, and so I would recommend it. it's educative too - I knew nothing of N Korea before. There are some other artists' work in this book, which form part of the narrative for a few pages, and their work is vv impressive. But maybe the stark style that G de L has plumped for matches the subject matter, stark, and kind almost sterile. Still v well drawn though, just basic at the same time. Def worth a look though, v interesting indeed.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This was an excellent adaptation of one of my favorite Stephen Sondheim musicals. I have loved the story of Sweeney Todd ever since I saw the DVD recording of [[ASIN:B0013Z7RUC Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase)]] starting Angela Lansbury and George Hearn.<br /><br />If anything I think Johnny Depp was a much better Sweeney Todd than Hearn was. As for the part of Mrs. Lovett? Carter and Lansbury both bring something special to the part that I would have a hard time telling you which one I really enjoyed in that part.<br /><br />Sure the movie gets bloody, but come on, this isn't a light hearted Wizard of Oz type musical. It's a story about a man unjustly imprisoned and seeking revenge.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to my family and friends.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Finally!  I've been waiting for this movie, because I thought there were too many unanswered questions at the end of Season 10.  This movie was a very satisfying conclusion (with an exclamation point or three) to the Ori storyline.  Looking forward to more SG-1 movies!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|I bought this item as a gift. The receiver says... \\"I love this movie!\\" Well that sums it up.
0316776963|5.0|By far the funniest novel I have ever enjoyed. Sedaris turns our everyday occurrences into side-splitting laughter. I remember reading this book in a quiet setting and by time I was a chapter in people around me were staring because I could not contain myself. Sedaris delivers comedy in a simplistic style. Buy this book! You will not be disappointed.

B00006I53S|5.0|I have been using this lens for around 3 months and I am very pleased with it. A lot of my friends told me to buy 3rd party lens with greater range (18-200) etc. but in the end I beleive I made the right choice.   Image quality is great, but the best is the affordable Image Stabilisation function. I would recommend this lens for all the first upgraders from the kit lens
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I first heard of Melody Gardot in a music review on our local Sydney radio station ABC 702.Worrisome Heart was played and I was immediately taken by the beauty of her voice and lyrics. I had to have the CD then and there, so as it wasnt avilable in Oz just yet got it straight way from Amazon. Yes her voice and song structure does sound very much like like Norah Jones...but what a voice. I love her songs and would highly reccommend this album to anyone who does like Norah Jones, or just wants cruisy, sweet, melancholy music...you will not be dissappointed.
B00004W221|4.0|Released in '93 the film `Rudy' is without question one of the most loved sports films of all-time. Based on the true story of Rudy Ruettiger and his vision quest to play football for the Fighting Irish at the University of Notre Dame, it's a story that Sean Astin was born to bring alive on film. He's absolutely perfect as the not so talented athlete with an unquenchable spirit that will not be denied.<br /><br />This movie certainly knows how to push all the right emotional buttons just when needed and the superb production values and soundtrack create a wonderfully inspiring and nostalgic atmosphere that will pull on the heartstrings of even the most cynical amongst us. If you're a sports fan or not you'll certainly enjoy Sean Astin's magnificent performance.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.
0671027387|4.0|The repeated references to \\"Westbrooke Place Luxury Apartments\\" or a variation thereof.  I lost track of how many times it was mentioned, and have to conclude there's some reason Dan kept doing so over and over and OVER, e.g., some kind of promotional placement kickback or free rent deal.  Example:  No *way* is anyone in DC giving a taxi driver \\"Westbrooke Place Luxury Apartments\\" as their destination vs. \\"23rd and N\\" or \\"2201 N Street\\" or refer to a fixture in their own apartment as a \\"Westbrooke Place mantel\\" (or something like that anyway).  Come on, Dan.  You don't have enough money??<br /><br />Otherwise, I found the book pretty enjoyable.  :)
B00004NRWH|3.0|not as good as their \\"reason\\" cd. This one is sort of like a bunch of racket. Gets better each time one listens to it
B00005JPNY|5.0|This is a GREAT movie!! It's a story that you can sit down with anyone in your family, sit back, and enjoy! Not many of those left these days. An excellent movie to own also!!
006145785X|5.0|I found the narrator amusing; he added enjoyment to listening to the book. The information in the book was insightful.
0143038419|3.0|This author is clearly talented and I enjoyed the beginning of the book but like other reviewers found it became way too tedious.  I read over 200 pages but then simply could not bring myself to finish.  I got tired of the constant whining. And yes for somebody seeking enlightenment, the self obsession is hard to take. After a hundred pages or so, it becomes very repetitive. My girlfriend wanted to borrow it when I got done.  I'm afraid I'll have to tell her not to bother with this one
006056251X|5.0|I can't begin to tell how perfect this book or this book's hero is. After reading a lot of romance books, some of them quite good, I had given up that I could ever feel the way I did when I first discovered historical romance, about 6-7 years earlier. Books like Whitney my love, Something wonderful, the dangerous gentleman, the hostage, the bride thief, whirlwing wedding, because you're mine, were the ones that introduced me to this genre and had me hooked. These books left me dreaming of the heroes for days and nights after I had finished them. Lately I was beginning to feel jadded, that nothing I read could impress me that much anymore. Of course I've read some good books, but nothing so intense that stayed with me for long after the end was reached. Well, leave it to Kleypas to hook me one more time!<br /><br />'It happened one autumn' was my first Wallflower book and it was not my cup of tea, so I gave up on the rest of the series. Seeing Sebastian St.Vincent in many of Amazon's forums as one of the best heroes ever, I decided to give the Wallflowers one more try and, boy, am I glad I did! This is perhaps the best book I've ever read about a rake's reform.<br /><br />The story, as many others have already described it before is that of a marriage of convinience (which has to be one of my favorite plots anyway!). Evie, St.Vincent's wife is a shy and stammering heiress, while St.Vincent is described as the handsomest man in the ton and perhaps the most promiscuous one. Their surroundings are not the ton's spacious ballrooms or country estates, but Evie's gaming club that she inherited from her father.<br /><br />Don't let the much used plot make you believe that this book is just one of the same. The feelings and passion these two unlikely matched people feel, are flowing off the pages. I read the whole book in a couple of days with a stupid smile on my face the whole time. My husband's remark, when he saw me, was: \\"THAT GOOD, EH?\\" Yes, it is THAT GOOD.
0143038419|5.0|Everyone I know has loved this book, so I was shocked to read some of the truly hateful reviews. Each to her own I guess. I found her insights accurate and her personality endearing. Her writing was excellent and made her story come alive. I wanted to move to each of the places she described! Her take on spirituality was interesting to me as well as I've been searching for a non-religious way to be spiritual. I highly recommend this book, I couldn't put it down and learned alot from it.
B00004WKII|5.0|The first song Purple Haze was the same arrangement Jimi Hendrix did when I saw him in 1967.  What an incredible compilation.  Exceptional for any Jimi Hendrix collector!

B0015519VS|3.0|As a longtime Usher fan since he was 14, I can truly say that after playing this new album about 3 times, the \\"highly anticipated\\" album is not what I expected. Sadly, I did not rush to the store to buy this album on its release May 27th. I purchased it May 31st. As I went through the tracks, I honestly can say the only song that has impressed me (as far as making me hot and bothered) was #9 Love You Gently. Other songs that were Okay, were #4 Trading Places, #5 Moving Mountains and #12 His Mistakes.    To be honest, I haven't really grasp this album. I am not truly disappointed however, I do believe the album is based off Usher's marriage and new family. Prior to his decision to marry Tameka Foster, while in the studio working on this album, I am sure the tracks were similar to the Confessions album.    Now, I am not sure what Usher was thinking but after having a 9x platinum album like Confessions, there has to be a strong album to follow that. Here I Stand, is not the album. It's a grown up album, indeed and more of a mixture of Case and Carl Thomas (people no longer important in the music industry). If Usher is serious about continuing to croon his fans and not let Justin Timberlake get the best of him, then I suggest Usher think about re-releasing this album in the next 6 months with some hotter, \\"shaker & move\\" tracks. All I can say is thank goodness for \\"Love in the Da Club\\" but I am not sure this album is Grammy material.     Thanks again Usher. No disrespect to him and his \\"new family.\\" When he tours I will be there, because he always does an outstanding show.     Leah
B0002XV30Q|5.0|I rather enjoy this collection of piano concertos by the wonderful Camille Saint-Saens.  Each one is quite different from the others, and it makes it a lot of fun to go through all of them.  Of special praise is the inclusion of the Wedding Cake and the Africa Fantasy.  All of this together with superb performances by Collard and the Royal Philharmonic makes for a fantastic experience.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|My wife hated it. I expected pretty much what I got. A far-fetched, cheesey Indiana Jones film, chock-full of car chases, over-the-top bad guys, unbelievable sequences that can make your eyes roll with the extreme cheesiness of it, but a decent film for what it is.    I would have liked to see this franchise grow-up a bit more.
0425107469|2.0|Maybe I don't have the same youthful imagination I had in my younger years, and call me a no-fun-nelly, but the idea of a dog that wags its tail when it wants to say yes and bark when it wants to say no is just not all that inventive to me.  Put a killer baboon into this mix, and you pretty much have the premise to the Watchers.  Yes I'm being serious.<br /><br />If this thoughtful plot wasn't enough to keep you engaged, then surely the Shakesperianesque communications will seize your attention, as this completely random portion of the book will demonstrate:<br /><br />\\"Cake and Pie,\\" one of the young men said.<br />\\"Cake and Pie,\\" the other echoed.<br />Nora frowned, not understanding.<br />\\"Piece of cake,\\" one of them explained.<br />\\"Easy as pie,\\" the other said.<br />\\"Cake and pie,\\" Nora said, nodding.<br /><br />For all the comments that are sure to attach to this review, keep in mind, YES I do think I can do better, and hopefully one day I will.<br /><br />~ActionSam
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is not just a \\"chic\\" flick.  After my 27 year old son recommended it, I watched it with my husband and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a beautiful story to be enjoyed many times.
1932907009|5.0|No, I am not a homeschooling mom, that's my wife and this is her account that I am using.    I just finished reading STC and I really enjoyed it.    I teach screenwriting at Drexel University and University of the Arts in Philadelphia. I had a low budget indie feature produced in NYC last  year and another one set for a shoot in Philly later this year.    I agree with so much of what Snyder says in the book because much of it is stuff that I say in my classes. In fact, I always show that opening sequence from \\"Sea Of Love\\" to demonstrate dissonance in the character.    Next, I love the tirade about \\"Memento.\\" My young whippersnappers are in shock when I tell them why I so disliked that film, that, yes, I actually did sit there in the theater, look at my watch after 25 minutes and say to myself \\"Okay, great, now when does the story begin?\\" Also, has exposition ever been handled as badly as it is in this film, with Guy  Pearce blabbering on and on into the phone, zzzzz. \\"Memento\\" isn't a film, it is a special effect.    Like you, I also mention that Picasso learned how to paint \\"straight\\" before he became a cubist. I take it further when I also mention that, for a time, The Beatles spent 6 or 7 nights a week, on stage for 7 or 8 hours at time, banging out covers of 2-3 minute pop tunes, then recording a few albums of 2-3 minute pop tunes before they revolutionized the form. You have to know the rules inside out before you challenge them and Snyder lays out the rules in crisp, coherent fashion that anyone can understand.    What I like so much about \\"Save The Cat\\" is that it is about constructing stories for the screen more than it is about banging out a script. Anyone can learn proper formatting but coming up with the story for a film has always been the hardest part for me. Reading the book really re-affirmed my approach to writing and to teaching students how to write for the screen. It also gave me new ways to look at the process of coming up with idea, plot and story. Seeing Snyder's sharp insights and frequently entertaining examples of good and bad writing got my to re-focus on the craft in a way that I had been promising to do for a long time.    So, I think \\"Save The Cat\\" is valuable for both the novice and for the seasoned screenwriter, clearly written, user-friendly and, ultimately, inspiring.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is a great movie, great story with wonderful casting.  No matter what your age or race, there is something meaningful to be gained from watching this bit of history.
0792844882|1.0|This movie is now promoted as being \\"camp\\" but not so when it debuted. Even Gina Gershon thought the script was camp, only realizing it wasn't shortly after filming started. Bless her professional heart for not quitting. Liz Berkley is not only an awful actress but a horrible dancer. I lost count the number of times she flung out her arms, either in anger or \\"dancing.\\" Fries over here, ice over there. Her character is supposed to be irrestitable to men & women alike but she looks like a cheap hooker throughout the whole film. Blonde is not her color. And that overbite is not Gene Tieney sexy at all. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; her body doesn't look so hot when she's naked, which is frequently. I don't know why Joe Eszterhaus hates women so much. His films are very mysoginistic. I will give it credit for one of the best (unintentionally, of course) movie lines ever. I use it as a joke all the time. \\"It's a versase.\\" Versace

0307383415|5.0|When I watch shows like the McLaughlin Group (and the American Media in general), I'm struck by how little the literary stockjobbers actually know about Senator Obama.  Worse yet, I'm appalled at the perceptions that are  as put forth as fact.  On the other hand, I'm convinced that Obama is a new type of politician, of equal stature with Washington, Lincoln, and both Roosevelts.  If you don't vote for this guy, your loss.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I agree with the brutal expression chosen for describing this movie.  It is very hard to wacht.  But if you were familiar with 70's cinema(a new form of classics) this is the movie to pay attention to.    Full of what is called intertexts and references, it is produced as many of what I call the \\"new movies\\": composed in the form of related spots which are unified but have an unity by themselves.  Even very well known actors (as Cuba Gooding, Jr.) protagonizes one of the spots.    I disagree with the view that Russel Crowe do not play his part well.  At the contrary, he, a Ridley Scott favorite, shines in some of these spots. It is amazing how this guy, who came from Australia, fitted so well in American movies.    And Denzel, what can be said? he is a bombshell, born to be an actor since the first Spike Lee's movies.

B000N6TYLW|1.0|I have loved this show from the begining, and up until just now after watching the very last episode, I am Extremely sad over the end. This was such a beloved show for me. I just cant get over how this ended.  Why the show ended the way it did makes no sense, it felt like everything that was going on good for these girls was being sucked out of them towards the end of this season and finally did get sucked up completely by the end credits. I just dont get it. Why was it so hard to let rory stay with Logan, why the build up between the two and then the lame break up. Huh? And Luke....? What kind of ending is this?    Ugh....Can anyone end a TV Series right?
0471603864|5.0|Like Griffiths' Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, this book is aimed at the undergraduate with only a limited background in math and physics. All the math and physics required beyond basic freshman calculus and physics is developed in the book in a clear, straightforward way. The book starts with a brief introduction placing the field as a whole in perspective, then follows with a longer overview of the history of the field. Then begins the fun! First the forces and particles are introduced. Then there is a detailed treatment of special relativity and relativistic particle kinematics. Following this there is a chapter on group theory and symmetries in particle physics. Then bound states are discussed, including relativistic corrections to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, positronium, and charmonium. Then the Feynman approach to quantum field theory is introduced, using a toy theory which simplifies the basic concepts. Following this quantum electrodynamics is discussed, including the Dirac equation, spinors, the Feynman rules, etc. Everything is clearly spelled out so the reader doesn't have to fill in any gaps herself. Techniques for doing calculations are reviewed, followed by some basic important calculations which show how the theory gives results expressed as cross sections and lifetimes. Following this there is a discussion of the electromagnetic and chromodynamic interactions of quarks, electroweak theory, gauge theories, symmetry breaking, the Higgs mechanism, neutrino oscillations, and possible future developments.<br /><br />This is the book to get if you want to learn this subject on your own with a limited background in physics and math. Nothing important is left out, the explanations are clear, there are numerous problems at the end of each chapter which are very illuminating, the text is carefully proofread and almost error-free. This book will equip you to tackle more advanced books on quantum field theory or the Standard Model of particle physics if you have such an ambition. It will allow you to begin to grasp this field at the level it really lives, i.e., the mathematics, rather than having to rely on verbal descriptions in books for laymen which ultimately raise more questions than they answer.you have such an ambition.

B000UR9T7I|4.0|This is a Blu-Ray, right?  The disc has tons of space, right?  So, why didn't they cram in more extras?  Loved the movie and loved the commentary tracks while seeing it in all the HDMI Hi-def glory.  It is hard to say \\"no\\" to.  Considering the limited quantity of decent titles on Blu-Ray, currently, this is a good place to start with a Blu-Ray collection.  If you're a Spidey fan and you didn't agree with this flick then just wait for Spidey 1 and 2 to get on Blu-Ray, if it hasn't already.
B00008AWNY|5.0|I had this album when it 1st came out 35 yrs ago - damn near wore it out,  but ended up losing it when our basement flooded some years ago. Since then I have owned the Audio cassette and the CD versions but neither compared to the sound of the Dark Side of the Moon on vynl. There was just a seminal sound of the early vynl version that reached into my head  or maybe it was just the weed back then, anyways, I now own it on vynl again and it's just as good now as it ever was.

0767802470|5.0|This is the best submarine movie ever!  The directors cut, even at over three hours, just flys by - you don't realize you've been watching so long.  The action grabs you and the tension holds you in the story.      You must watch the German version with subtitles - the English over-dub is terrible, you lose the feeling of being in the sub with the story, which is the best part.      Enjoy!
0061537934|5.0|I lost a lot of sleep over this book.  I read in a weekend.  Staying up for till the early morning hours lost in narration.  It is at times laugh out loud funny and alternately tearfully touching.  When I finished it I sat on the floor with my dog and thanked him for all the times he quietly supported me.  A great read, period.  But a must read for dog lovers.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|De Niro makes a surprising move here into spy territory - not modern Bourne type stuff (despite the presence of Matt Damon) but more like an American John Le Carre type story, in its understated events and emphasis on character.  It's a noble endeavor, at times wonderfully shot - however, it is ultimately too flawed to succeed as entertainment.  The story revolves around the creation of the CIA, seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson (a composite of several real life characters).  It plays as a character driven story showing what can make a man choose a life of permanent paranoia and secrecy, and the impact that has on his life.  In this way the atmosphere around the time of the new Agency's genesis is portrayed rather than a strict blow by blow account of how it came to be.  A superb and committed cast have been gathered, (including a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Joe Pesci), and there is a clear feeling of the proceedings oozing talent, from art direction and photography, through to actors and music.  However, there is something about the pacing that is not quite right - at 160 minutes, we should have some significant moments of drama to drive our interest on, but somehow we are left with a spy story of non-people and non-events... a spy movie without suspense.  There's an interesting enough story arc for our main character, and the audience is asked to be intelligent enough to fill in some gaps - but the padding has turned what could have been an atmospheric and informative movie into something bloated and dull.  This is no epic or definitive account.    Regular readers of mine will know I am no huge fan of rapid fire MTV style editing a la `Armageddon' and its ilk - but a movie still has to have some drive and entertainment value.  That's missing here, despite the core having some very interesting things to say about the disease of loneliness and what it does to a man.  Sad to say, no endorsement from me on this one, even though it has moments that reallymake me want to like it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Standard PS controller design, back with Dualshock.  What's not to love?  Little heavier than 6 Axis, but in a good way.  Seams strudy.

1592533868|3.0|This book has absolutely beautiful designs of paper quilling.  There are many styles of flower that are completely different than I have ever seen.  However, as an experienced quiller I do not think this book will be very helpful for beginning quillers.  The author uses strips of a length which are not, to my knowledge, available in either Canada or the United States (10 5/8\\").  In addition, some of the lengths she says to use for certain designs seem very suspect.  In some cases short lengths are used (according to her instructions) but the picture shows an item clearly made from a much longer strip.  In addition she mentions widths of paper which I have never seen here (3/16\\", 9/32\\", and 5/16\\").  Finally, her names of the colours of the strips in her book are names which I have never seen here.  If I was trying to follow her instructions and was looking in the stores for \\"dusty grape\\" strips that were 10 5/8\\" long, I think I would be very frustrated when I couldn't find them.  Therefore, overall I am somewhat disappointed in this book, even though I do love the designs.

0440238609|3.0|I ordered this under the impression that these were trade paperbacks, not mass market paperbacks.  (In the list of similar items, this set is listed separately from the specific \\"mass market paperback boxset\\".)    I guess I didn't pay close enough attention, because indeed these are mass market paperbacks. (If you take the time to look over the full listings for His Dark Materials, you can see that the covers are the same as the individual mass market volumes.)    It's a fairly nice set, for mass market, and a good value -- just not what I was expecting.  If you want to buy the series as separate volumes and on the cheap, it's a good choice.

B000LC4TJ0|5.0|If you are really patient, read my whole article cause I've worked hard on it, however, if you need fast answer to decide whether to buy or not this DVD, just read a few more lines.    If you are ready for a new Figaro (this doesn't mean you are gonna replace your old Figaro versions), buy it.  If you like good graphics and good sound. Buy it.  If you are looking for a good orchestra with a huge conductor and good (not best) singers, buy this.  If you are looking for something new in Mozart's Opera, without changing the libretto, just with a new reading of it, buy it.  If this is the first time that you are coming to \\"Le nozze di Fígaro\\", don't buy it.  If you are not ready to see your Figaro slow and sad. Don't buy this DVD.      I got myself crying at the end of this \\"Le nozze di Fígaro\\", when Rosina sang \\"Piú docile, Io sono, I dico di sí\\" and my ears could not believe in that slow and strong march at the end.  Actually, I must admit that my favorite Fígaro will always be the \\"comedia\\", but this \\"tragedia\\" was very well done.  Harnocourt's task here was to turn a very soft and funny opera into a very complex human being's relationship. He did it very well.    Before listening to this Opera, I could never have imagined a \\"Figaro\\" in a Drama, but this opened my eyes and I wait anxiously for new versions of it.  This, rather than ruinning Mozart's music shows that it is so sublime that with a bit of slowness and pushing it (without blinding the singers) a little you can, with a lot of wit, change the spirit of the thing.  By using dark and big scenarios, the director brought a sadness to the house. This , I think, fits very well the idea of transposing the opera from the 18th to 20th century.    All is right here, in the 18th century, the treason was something more common and funny. In the 20th it had changed. To betray your husband/wife was something really ashaming. You can see that Susanna (in this version) really betrays Figaro with the count and that she is divided. Ana Netrebko says, in the making off that a person can love two people and this, I think, is true.  You can see here an anger \\"Contessa\\" and a very violent \\"Conte\\". The only carachter for me that looses its strength is Figaro. Here he looks like a man, commanded by the 2 women and this is a bit concerning, couse the name of the Opera is The marriage of Figaro, thus, he should be strong and I didn't like this submission.  Well, with all this, I just wanna express that I enjoyed this production, though it is not the usual way this opera is done.    The good points for me are: The strings in the orchestra. They are really impressive and you can notice it in the 4th act arias, where they are demand to be great. The winds are not in the same level, but are ok;  The inclusion of the Marcelina's Aria, which is sometimes cut off from the opera, but in this case, is very important for the plot, cause explains what women are feeling there.  Harnocourt know how to conduct one good orchestra and he does it very well here. Some reviewers said he is too slow here, but this is part of the make up.  The Finale in the fourth act is great and combines with the DARK air in the whole Opera.    Scenario and Filming are amazing. The \\"Cupid\\" is also a very enjoyable additional.    On the other hand, there are bad things: The choreography is ugly. If they tried a realistic Opera, why to use these ugly dances?   In the wedding I got disappointed, the scene does not work. The women's choir is terrible. They turned a beautiful girls' crew into a German female army.  Don Bartolo is not well played here. The first scene of him, in a wheelchair causes anguish.  I didn't like d'Arcangelo like Figaro. You cannot notice him in the stage. His voice, on the other hand, is nice and his Italian is perfect (off course) .    I hope to have helped and I rated it 5 stars cause it is in most, really beautiful and new. Nevertheless, I would never change my \\"Ópera Buffa\\" Figaro by this one.
0525950079|4.0|Follett does a good job in this sequel and if you liked the first book then be sure and read this one.<br /><br />A couple of points.<br /><br />The strength of this book, like the first, is the interesting details that give the reader a real sense of \\"being there\\" in a time long past.  It is not so much the human interaction, Follett's characters are probably more \\"modern\\" than \\"medieval\\" when you get right down to it, but the staging carries the day.  It is a delight to pick up a tidbit such as the common currency being a \\"florin\\" because minted coins from England were not prevalent at the time.  Gaining a sense of the life of a peasant as they struggled for existence and yearned for respect provides other such joys.  Good stuff.<br /><br />In this book Follett falls back on a \\"stock\\" figures - there is the \\"free thinking woman\\" and the churlish, sadistic oaf of a knight, as well as the brilliant innovator, etc.  Religious figures in this book are not as balanced as in the first.  Here the \\"true saints\\" aren't very important and the hypocrites are everywhere.  As with the first book, Follett tends to let his characters accomplish too much and thereby strains their credability.  The heroine Caris not only transforms industry by introducing an indigenous scarlet dye, she also revolutionizes medical care in a time of plague.  Similar statements can be made about the male lead in his building accomplishments as well as his business acumen.<br /><br />But, front to back, the story, though some what predictable, draws you in  and there are some spots that genuinely sparkle.  When a character, Wulfric turns to his wife after she interferes with his intent to kill a man, he tells her... \\"by doing that you proved that you understand neither me nor your father!\\"  Since her father was a genuine cad and Wulfric is essentially noble - that line opens up an entire different spectrum in Follett's character developments.  You have to read the book to understand what I mean but there are several instances like that which give added dimensions to what could otherwise have been fairly shallow characterizations.<br /><br />Follett has proven himself to be more than a detective story hack.  Good Job.that which give added dimensions to what could otherwise have been fairly shallow characterizations.    Follett has proven himself to be more than a detective story hack.  Good Job.

B00012FXAE|5.0|\\"Aliens\\" Directed by James Cameron<br /><br />Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) barely escaped an encounter with an Alien. All of her crew and her ship were destroyed while fighting it. When the encounter ended Ripley places herself in cryogenic sleep for the ride home. Something goes wrong and Ripley remains in cryo sleep for over 50 years and is luckily found by a deep salvage mission. Instead of a reward for heroism Ripley and her story are met with skepticism by the company who owned the ship that was destroyed by the Alien. Her story is in doubt due to the fact that the planet from which the Alien was picked up is currently colonized and no Alien encounter has been reported. Ripley attempts to deal with what happened and the scrutiny and doubt she has received from her former employer. Contact is suddenly lost from the planet and the company request that Ripley accompany the military back to the planet to supervise the situation. It is promised that her pilot's license will be reinstated is she goes. Ripley can't seem to put the event behind her and needs to see it through to the end. Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) assures her that she has nothing to fear.

0312263511|5.0|When I started to read The Last Man on the Moon I wondered: What did it feel like to walk in space and on  the moon?  I got more than I bargained for.  I enjoyed one of the greatest true adventures of all times when Cernan removed the shackles of the earth and took me to places where few have gone.<br /><br />Cernan's book is exceptional at describing what it felt like to be an astronaut in the 1960s and what it was like to walk in space and on the moon.<br /><br />One of the parts I could relate to best was his descriptions of a space walk during a Gemini mission and his moon walks.  His descriptions of a pressurized suit that was tough to move and navigate in were amazing.  As a diver who has been to places such as the Galapagos islands (with cold waters) I know what its like to have a life support system and bulky suit.  Cernan's descriptions helped me understand (just a little) what it is like to walk in space and on the moon.<br /><br />There were many close calls in the space programs that were truly nail biters.  For example, during the Apollo 10 mission Gene Cernan discusses Tom Stafford and himself spinning out of control while just above the moon.  The countless hours of training and razor sharp skills of the astronauts saved them.  Stafford pulled them out at the last couple of seconds just before they would have crashed into the moon.<br /><br />There were also stories of tragedies such as the loss of the three men in the fire of  Apollo 1.  Everyone on the space program was deeply saddened. Afterwards everyone's resolve to go to the moon safely reached a new level of commitment.<br /><br />The book is definitely a page turner with many amusing antidotes. One story that sticks out in my mind is when Cernan explains that the early astronauts were like rock stars (they could do almost anything they wanted to).  For example, they would let there wives know they were coming home in the evening by flying right over their homes with their jets before landing at a local base (a true flyby).  Then they would jump into their Corvettes and drive like a bats out of h**l to their homes screeching into the driveways.  This is stuff that legends are made of.<br /><br />Cernan writing style is engaging and fascinating.  He is both a strong Critical Thinker and philosopher rolled into one.<br /><br />For example, in one telling excerpt he discusses the importance of going to the moon as a commander, not just walking on it.  His thoughts are summed up when he says:  \\"I have always believed that destiny is a matter of personal choice, where you carefully think out your decision, consider the downside, accept the risk of being wrong, and press on.\\"<br /><br />Cernan eloquently writes about his passion for space travel when he says:  \\"Our legacy is that humans are no longer shackled to the Earth.  We opened the door to tomorrow, and our trips to another celestial body will rank as the ultimate triumph in the Age of Achievement.  And for the price, it was the biggest bargain in history.\\"<br /><br />He goes on to say: \\"Sometimes it seems that Apollo came before its time. President Kennedy reached far into the twenty-first century, grabbed a decade of time and slipped it neatly into the 1960's and 1970s.\\"<br /><br />I have been fortunate to meet Gene Cernan on a few occasions at Astronaut gatherings in the past couple of years.  He is one of the greatest advocates for the space program and is a gentleman and a scholar.  He still has a bounce in his step and a twinkle in his eye...and I wouldn't be surprised if he has a little mischief in him as well.<br /><br />Once at a dinner I was sitting at Cernan's table and someone asked him whether seeing the moon was different from earth orbit or from the moon.<br /><br />Gene Cernan got very quiet and thoughtful and said that it was entirely different.  He went on to say that from orbit the earth is beautiful with its blue oceans, majestic large land masses and more.  Then he paused and got veryserious. He said from the moon the view of the earth was unbelievable.  He went on to say that seeing this little blue ball that hung in black space by an invisible string (axis) that it turned on was unbelievable.  You could see in his eyes that he had a life changing experience when he saw it from the front porch of the moon many years ago.<br /><br />There are several excellent books on the early space program.  The Last Man on the Moon is one of the best of the best.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595437087 The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking]]He went on to say that seeing this little blue ball that hung in black space by an invisible string (axis) that it turned on was unbelievable.

I for my own did't care much for \\"Confessions\\", despite two great songs \\"Let It burn\\" and \\"yeah\\".    \\"Here I Stand\\" is much more balanced and doesn't disappoint at all. Check out \\"Moving Mountains\\" , \\"What's Your Name\\", \\"Something Special\\", \\"Best Thing\\", \\"What's A Man To Do\\" and of course \\"Love In This Club Part II\\". The hits are all over this CD, so please don't hate on Usher because of the maturity he gained within the last three years.

0452289963|5.0|I have been a Christian 50+ years and I don't understand the hullaballoo surrounding this book and Oprah.

1430300612|4.0|This was an interesting glimpse into the workings of the brain hemispheres. It's a small book so it's an easy read, even in the overview of the brain function sections. Stroke runs in my family so seeing it from the stroke victim's side was very valuable. I plan to put the checklists provided with my medical power of attorney. I had also read Eckhart Tolle's \\"A New Earth\\" and this gave additional insight into the benefits of quieting the left brain and allowing the right hemisphere's intuition to flower. Bolte-Taylor can do that effortlessly now, but I haven't found it as easy to do.
B000G73U5Y|5.0|This music is soft rock from the 70's. Steely Dan had mutiple hits in the 70's and they are compiled into this cd. If you enjoyed their songs in the 70's then you would do yourself a favor if you purchase this cd.

B000001F29|4.0|This is a fun music track and brings back fond memories of when this CD was first introduced to me.  My husband and I drove from So. CA to Seattle to stay with friends.  Our friend played the song, \\"Friends of Mr. Cairo\\" for us and we were entranced from the first moment.  It gets you involved cos they're telling a story and it's lush with visuals.  The opening grabs you and holds you through the entire song.  This is our second purchase of the CD...my husband let a co-worker borrow it and we haven't seen it since!
B000JIJPZY|3.0|This gym is OK for a little while, but once your child gets to exploring (4+ months) and needs more room to roam, this Gym is useless.  It's very small, and only functions for the minimalist.  In other words, the baby will grow bored rather quickly.  If I could exchange it, I'd get the larger fisher-price baby gym with more toys on it.
1596061049|5.0|This is the best book I have read in some time.  I picked it up on a recommendation from George R. R. Martin as reading to do while awaiting the next installment of his epic series.  I am so glad I did.  I recommend it to everyone I know, and they do likewise.  I could go on forever about all the things that make this book exceptional, but I don't even know where to begin.  Lame review, I know, but good lord.      An outstanding product from a new and promising talent.      Why are you still reading this?  Buy it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a breathtaking documentary, for anyone with even the slightest interest in nature! Looks AMAZING!
B000XA5K48|4.0|If you intend to watch this movie the first rule (and you really must adhere to it) is DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING IN THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY. If you forget that part, then you might as well turn off the tv. Trust me.<br /><br />Ah, what to say, what to say....this is one of those mindless action movies full of death and destruction, where the guns have many more bullets than logically possible, the hero is -- heroic, the leading lady is a knockout (kudos to whomever is responsible for hiring Monica Bellucci in this roll. It was refreshing to see an incredibly gorgeous woman over the age of 40 and she was terrific in it) and the main villian, Paul Giamatti, is very good.<br /><br />In fact, I was truly amazed in the calibre of acting in this type of movie. Like Star Troopers of yore, none of the bad guys -- and there are hundreds -- can shoot worth a darn, while the good guy fells them right and left...and back and forth.. and so on. Can we just agree there is a LOT of violence in this thing.  A ragged story line exists, but is slapped around by the shear amount of action, not to mention the almost psychic ability of Giamatti in finding Owen and Bellucci every few minutes no matter where they run.<br /><br />This is a popcorn and friends type movie. I wouldn't recommend it for the kiddies by any means, but if you're into truly unbelievable action, then you might have some fun with this one.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars: 3 for the fun, 1 just for Monica Bellucci.
B00009MGGP|5.0|Another brilliant production from the BBC!  Ian Richardson is superlative in the role of a man you'll love to hate.  He charmingly lets you in on his machinations, enticing you almost into conspiracy with him. This works well with a young female journalist, too.  The plot is not very realistic when you think of how easily the villian, Francis Urquart, gets away with his crimes.  But it is so well done that it will hold your interest throughout.  I'm tempted to subtract one star for the cyncism of it, but Richardson's performance makes up for any lack.  Shakespeare would have loved it!
B0015519VS|4.0|I have been waiting for Usher new release forever and now that it is finally here all I can say is it's not confesstions it's a more mature sound a cd that people of all ages can enjoy I don't regret buying it I listen to it everyday every since the first day I got it in the mail. And so what he's married he took a step that most young men seem terrified to take so I wish him the best.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Rockferry is an excellent release from Duffy, a great, Welsh vocal talent whose style is deemed as reminiscent of Dusty Springfield. Mercy and Warwick Avenue are perhaps the strongest tracks present, but these two tunes are among very great numbers. From the title song at the very beginning to the conclusion with Distant Dreamer, everything is quite listenable from start to finish.      If you love contemporary tunes with a touch of mod fashion retrofitted with occasional touches of cocktail lounge sceneries that will likely come to the mind's eye, Rockferry is definitely a must have. However, to portray Duffy as a nightclub vocalist would be an insult; for she is a potential star that can bring back the white soul that marked Dusty's career some forty years earlier and with a twenty-first century flair.    I hold this new star from the UK in high regard and hope that she will at least land levels of success in the US as did Dusty Springfield and not fall so short as, say, Cilla Black.
B000C13Y2S|2.0|Cute gag gift but not useful.  Look at the key ring in the photo to get an idea of the size.  The tripod is too small to be usable; it just adds bulk to your pocket.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Cloverfield is definitely a movie that does things differently. Some people see that as an asset, others want the camera to be steady or for everything to be explained, etc. It's made clear from the very beginning that what we are looking at is supposed to be \\"found footage\\" and not professionally produced. I think the makers of the film were very clever in the way they conceived Cloverfield and put it together. But the negative responses prove that the easiest way to please as many people as possible is to give them the same old thing that they're already used to.    I'm especially surprised at people who don't like the ending. The ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but if you really understand what is happening at the end, it makes PERFECT sense.     So, the movie is not for everybody, but those that do like it seem to like it a lot. I prefer that to same old, same old.
B00004UHZR|3.0|Not one of Santana's most well-known efforts, but there are a few gems on here that I had to have. Summer Lady is a treasure.
B0006IINSW|5.0|The Pineapple Thief are generally labeled as a \\"progressive\\" rock band, although this label is commonly misconstrued as meaning, \\"sounds like old Genesis, E. L. P. and YES music.\\" I think many people forget that Pink Floyd were labeled a progressive rock band, and yet they sound nothing like Genesis, E. L. P. or YES. The progressive rock tag was actually meant to imply that the band were not just writing simple three minute tunes about something mundane like the most trivial aspect of a boy meets girl relationship. Being Progressive meant literally to progress song structured concepts, musically and/or lyrically, into something with perhaps more depth and meaning. Sometimes this simply meant that there were more layers to the music, or more meaning behind the lyrics, so that even if the song did happen to be about a boy meets girl relationship, there would be more exploration into something like the psychological aspects of that relationship rather than just how they want to kiss each other and/or bed each other down for the night. Progressive also meant that the music itself was presented in a different way, sometimes taking the full spectrum of what is out there musically and molding that extensive range of sound, shape and colour into something unique. With this in mind you could easily say that The Beatles did their share of progressive rock music (think Tomorrow Never Knows. Eleanor Rigby and all of Sgt. Peppers to name just a few things). Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree seems reluctant to label his band as progressive, but again I think he sees the tag having that same old archaic reference to Genesis and YES. There is no question that Porcupine Tree progresses the concepts of rock music by exploring the many different styles of rock and forging music from it that is their own, as does Radiohead, who also explore new ways to present musical ideas (they also feel disinclined to be associated with that old Progressive rock label). Regardless of what they feel, the label applies. The Pineapple Thief also fall into this same category, and I used both Porcupine Tree and Radiohead as examples, because it is with those two bands that The Pineapple Thief share the most in common. The Thief do not constrain themselves to one musical idea, but rather take in the full spectrum of what is out there and mold it into their own image while always searching for new ways to express those musical concepts. Songs like \\"Subside\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\", do not follow any conventional means of communicating musical ideas in a radio friendly manner, and yet they manage to just as successfully convey their tunes, without sounding like they are trying to force them into some different mold, like trying to fit a jigsaw puzzle piece in where it doesn't belong. The Pineapple Thief's songs sound natural the way they are, not contrived in such a way as to be different just for the heck of it, and that is the sign of a truly great progressive band, which The Thief certainly are. That said I do not hold to the opinion that Variations of a Dream is their best record. While it most certainly is an excellent record (CD, whatever), I feel that their 2007 release, \\"What We Have Sown\\" is better. Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with a Pineapple Thief album, and Variations of a Dream is a worthwhile addition to any music lovers collection who wants more from their music than the one dimensional, same old same old.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|When I first listened to this my initial thought was 'What the ...'. It is quite different to their earlier works, less cohesive, more like a work in progress where there is a mix of ideas waiting final editing.   There are some extremely fine songs on this CD. In fact some of the best ones Portishead have made.   No-one that I have played this CD for has been impressed on the first listen, but after listening to it a few times it becomes a favourite.
B000O02W8O|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author, however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare, elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a sixteen year old Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable. It is, therefore, not surprising that the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|After nineteen years since he rode off into the sunset, the James Bond of archeology returns in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" And overall, the wait was worth it. The film once again includes the wit, humor and excitement fans have come to love. Where the film's weakness lies is in the last forty minutes, which features some truly outlandish moments.<br />The film's weaknesses are made up for by a terrific cast. Harrison Ford still embodies the role of Indy, and adds some great emotional impact as he discusses the passage of time. Karen Allen is again fantastic as Marion Ravenwood, while Shia LaBeouf is really good as Mutt Williams. Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and John Hurt give great supporting performances. The visual effects, action sequences and exotic locales are all impressive.<br />Overall, this is a welcomed return to the world of Indiana Jones. While it does feature some truly bizarre moments, fans will find much to enjoy in this film.<br />Grade: B+
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I have been a Jane Austen fan since I was a teenager (I am now retired), yet never enjoyed Northanger Abbey until now.  Finally, someone has made this story pleasurable. At last the heroine, although still somewhat foolish with her overactive imagination, is believable.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Most films that deal with life in the Soviet bloc focus on the large and the loud -- escapes, car chases, beatings and close calls. \\"The Lives of Others\\" draws our attention to the small acts of oppression and resistance, cowardice and bravery that made up the lives of ordinary people during this sad era.<br /><br />Grim-faced Hauptmann Wiesler (brilliantly played by Ulrich M&uuml;he ) is the chief of surveillance for the Stasi, the East German secret police. He is a serious and efficient true believer in the socialist state, devoted to catching and punishing those whose ardor for the government was insufficient. Eternally suspicious (usually for good reasons) he is given the job of surveilling Georg Dreyman, a successful playwright whose popularity in the West makes him suspect. But the corruption of GDR officials eats at him, as does his attraction to the beauty of the playwright's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Monitoring bugs planted in the playwright's apartment, he gains a peephole into the tortured world of artists under pressure form government to conform. Listening in on careful conversations and lovemaking, Wiesler begins to compromise his hard-line stance, getting caught up in the same skein of lies and evasions that has caught his targets.<br /><br />The film is a masterwork of understatement, and intelligent look at a totalitarian system that controls less by outright violence than by threats of lost opportunities to attend college or work at one's chosen occupation. A chilling vision into a dystopic and very depressing political system, into the lives of those trying to survive in it, and of the awakening of conscience on both sides of the surveillance microphone.

B0013L2EDQ|5.0|This is my first James Rollins novel, and definitely not my last. This book was part National Treasure, part Indiana Jones. Loved it! The author's use of suspense and brink of disaster moments was thrilling, and this writer's style was intelligent yet easy to read. Some say it was a bit silly; I loved the occasional comedic phrase (it's partly why we all love Indiana Jones so much). I was impressed by the amount of factual medical, historical and biological data, as well as the detail of the international scene locations (having spent time in the Hagia Sophia, his descriptions were spot-on). The action never ended, even to the last page. Would LOVE to see this as a movie!
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indiana Jones leaps into the fifties and captures every meaningful bit of life during that era.  Aging only slightly less than his onscreen character, Harrison Ford seems every bit fit and spry as the time-lapse could possibly find him.  At his side is a new adventurer, Henry \\"Mutt\\" Williams (Shia LaBeof), as likely as any successor to fill his shoes as the next matinee idol.  Noting Shia's screen presence in everything from `Transformers' to `Disturbia,' it has already happened.      Still reinventing the tricks from the serial adventures of old, Director Spielberg and Executive Producer Lucas have teamed up to dazzle us once again.  This time the \\"Red Scare\\" is given a `[[ASIN:0792838289 The Manchurian Candidate]]' balance by offering an unvarnished Soviet menace matched by an overzealous FBI investigating Professor Jones' and his university.      Set in Nevada in 1957, Jones and his sidekick \\"Mack\\" (Ray Winstone) defend a military facility being overtaken by the Soviets in the desert.  At the compounds' storage warehouse, we find out early that \\"cliffhanger\\" is going to be as potent as any Jones has taken so far.  Leading the enemy is Col. Irina Spalko (played expertly by a steely cold Kate Blanchett, who has truly earned her own gold by her multi-faceted acting ability).  Once Indiana escapes, he finds himself on a model test city that's about to be detonated by a test atom bomb.  An asset of quietly cheeky satire, we see him going across a linoleum kitchen floor until he finds a \\"model\\" (as in mannequin) family in the living room.    Once he regroups, he runs into leather-jacketed motorcycle Mutt who leads him to find Jones' lost colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who has been kidnapped along with Mutt's mother down in the Amazon in a lost Mayan city of gold.  This time instead of a lost ark or a lost holy grail, Indiana and his new friend head to South America in search of the loved ones along with a precious artifact in the \\"crystal skull\\".  Here they sort out clues and translate an ancient language to find the lost treasure before the Soviets can.    I can't help but make comparisons to recent DVD release '[[ASIN:B000YABYPQ National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]'.  Both sport likable characters and able actors, and both stories are about deciphering clues that bring both entourages to a lost city of gold.  What wins out in this adventure is the suspense and entertainment:  The danger is more immediate; the timing is nearly flawless; and the jokes are far more formidable.  What separates 'NT2' from '...The Crystal Skull' is that this one is more stimulating with peril and revelations that are surprising; the other is more breezy and only lightly entertaining. Between David Koepp's screenplay, the right touches by Spielberg and Lucas, Michael Kahn's excellent editing, and, of course, the right feel by John Williams, this film makes a world of difference.
076790382X|5.0|This is my 3rd Bill Bryson book and possibly my favorite of his so far. The super short segments (compiled from past published articles) make this book extremely easy to pick up, put down and pick up again. His writing style is exceptionally intelligent, and he finds hilarity in the most mundane of situations. He has a way of making the reader reconsider just how silly much of our lives actually are, while interjecting a few heartwarming and philanthropical comments here and there. Would love a second edition of this!

B000P12LWY|4.0|The perspective and/or the rather lengthy critique of the show by   Ms. Rheinwald gives way to a rather historical and scholarly interpretation of what actually happened during that historical time period.  Unfortunately, Showtime is not really concerned with historical accuracy; portraying the show as a scholarly docudrama.  When you review their show description, they say The Tudors is loosely based upon the life of Henry VIII; subsequently, the show is strictly for entertainment purposes.  Showtime never intended to follow the lives of Henry VIII and Anne Boyelyn exactly as they lived.  Most viewers view Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a good actor and an attractive man.  The average fan of Showtime would not enjoy watching an actor, who closely resembles the physical characteristics of Henry VIII.  Sex, murder, lies, deceit, etc., is what sells or draws in the viewers who patronize Showtime, that is, pay the extra money for the cable channel.        If you look at the reviews, most of people enjoy the show and it has been picked up for another season.      What's important is the show causes the viewer to study, do their own research into that time period.  Maybe it will inspire some people to take a history class or read an accurate textbook on this time period.        Television and movies are not accurate, if they were, the character of Moses would have been played by an African-American actor, not Charlton Heston.

B00004YZFR|4.0|I have written elsewhere in this space that when it comes to musical influences in my youth that the Stones played a key role in developing my tastes. I have also mentioned elsewhere that my youthful alienation was reflected in the language and sound of the group. I mentioned Street Fighting Man and Tumbling Dice, as well as an earlier cover of Little Red Rooster as important. All this is by way of saying that I looked forward recently to re-watching the old Stones documentary Gimme Shelter reviewed here, despite my knowledge of the tragic incidents that occurred at Altamont and marred the whole experience.    If one is to recount the high points of the too short counter cultural explosion of the 1960's one could arbitrarily assign the Summer of Love in 1967 as the height and Altamont as the start of the decline. We can argue that point endlessly but clearly something or some things happened at Altamont that exposed the ugly side of the dope/ counter cultural scene. Moreover, on reflection no one can deny the unreasonableness of having the notorious Hell's Angels, despite favorable press from Tom Wolfe in Electric Kool Aid Acid Test and Hunter Thompson in his classic study Hell's Angels, as security for a 300, 000 person event.    Now, we finally get to the music and the film. And I think that this is about the right place for such comments in the scheme of things. There have been many, many Stones concerts during the past forty years but none have had the cultural significance of Altamont.  Most of the film is about how they, good-naturedly if ultimately naively, tried to put the event together. A fair portion of the film is footage of the reaction by the Stones to the events that they witnessed and interspersed in between are parts of the performance.     This film has not aged well, although Mick has. His voice comes off tinny here reflecting an earlier, more primitive sound technology that does not do justice to how Mick and the boys could whip up an audience. Anice surprise though is a very sensual Tina (and Ike) Turner performance. Unfortunately, the Jefferson Airplane afternoon performance is marred by the violence that doomed the event.  But here is the skinny. If you need to look at rock and roll history watch this one and one half hour documentary. If you want to hear the Stones at their best then purchase any one of about ten greatest hits albums available. That's the ticket.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Only rarely does a sequel equal its predecessor for entertainment value. Very loosely based on a Robert Ludlum novel, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" does that, with a breathless stream of action sequences featuring the amnesiac but lethal former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (again played with a pitch-perfect combination of restraint and intensity by Matt Damon).<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne is hiding in a seaside village in India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente from the first movie). He suffers from flashbacks of which he can make no sense, but he and Marie have built a life together.<br /><br />Four thousand miles away in Berlin, a CIA black operation supervised by CIA Deputy Director Pam Landy (a cooly precise Joan Allen) goes sideways when a mysterious assassin intervenes. A fingerprint left behind leads Landy to Jason Bourne's identity. Landy will mount a major operation to hunt down Bourne, enlisting the aid of TREADSTONE veterans Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nikki Parsons (Julia Stiles) from the first movie.<br /><br />In India, the mysterious assassin from Berlin materializes to hunt Jason Bourne. He narrowly misses Bourne but kills Marie. A stoic Bourne returns to Europe on a collision course with the CIA and a shady plot involving a Russian oil magnate and a corrupt CIA insider. The action will spin from India to Italy to Berlin and finally to Moscow, where a thrilling car chase will bring Bourne face to face with his Russian nemesis.<br /><br />The frantic, grainy, realistic cinematic style of the first movie is duplicated here, building suspense fasther than the viewer can worry about plot holes. The core of the movie is Bourne's relentless pursuit of his objective, slowed only by his struggle to make sense of flashbacks and the need to bandage the odd wound. The ending leaves plenty of room for additional sequels.<br /><br />This DVD version contains some interesting extra features about the making of the movie. \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is highly recommended as an very entertaining action movie.commended as an very entertaining action movie.

It made reading the book kind of like reading it with a friend who loves the story too.  In fact, at times I wished they had given more annotation.  Examples of the annotation include information about the different carriages families travel in (comparing it to modern day cars).

B0002OXVDW|4.0|We have most enjoyed these memories of such extraordinary entertainment that have become of a faded caliber today.  Through the many snippets of movies, interviews, and incredible talent in choreography, singing and dancing, we comfortably submerged into a generation that seemed to genuinely embrace life with such a 'simplicity'. Experiencing the humor, values, and sense of work ethics of this generation is a tugging of the heart in how far we've come and how far we've lost touch with the meaningful perspective of life...  A wonderful work of art...
1932100660|5.0|The China Study is indeed the most comprehensive book on nutrition, health, diseases and well being. Not only is the book informative and educational, it is written in a way that every reader can easily understand the content.    I am particularly impressed with the explanations about the diseases; it is medical knowledge made easy.    I have recommended the book to many friends and relatives and have sent copies to my sons.    After reading the book, I have started a process to gear my diet to a plant-based diet.    Campbell's bold remarks on government, industry and even the health organizations should be publicized for all people to become aware of the reality.
0061150142|5.0|I only discovered this author a few months ago by happening to pick up My Sister's Keeper.  I was then compelled to purchase every book Jodi Picoult has written.  The Pact is touching and so real to life.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  The characters are believable and the test of family and friends is that to real life.  I enjoy being pulled into the books I am reading and have the same emotions I would watching an Oscar winning movie.  Kudos to Jodi, she is an amazing author.
0743486285|5.0|If you love Motley Crue and followed them all these years this book will intrigue you.  Also, if you have every known or know some who is an addicit it gives some insight into their mentality.  They always have some rational excuse as to why they can't stop or put the blame on others. Nikki Sixx is one lucky person to come back from the dead as many times as he did others aren't so lucky and to over come such and addiction I give him credit for owning up to his feelings and taking control of his life.
B000000W6F|5.0|I think that Nirvana's Nevermind completly overshadowed this beautiful album from a band that sounded unlike anything else at the time. When I listen to Gish I wonder to myself how tis posible that they werent the ones overshadowing Nirvana? Anyways I think the smashing pumpkins in general deserve alot more credit than given!
B00000JMG7|5.0|I had read of Rory Gallagher in different guitar magazines but had never heard his music. I was in a local music merchant and found this 2 cd set in the bargain bin. It was a bargain indeed. From the liner written by his sister to the 2 different settings he is presented in you will be amazed by the the personality that comes through his playing. If you really want to see it then purchase the 2 dvd set of his Montreux performances put out by Eagle Rock. FIVE STARS
B000006NPY|5.0|I dont care what other people think about this album because i know its awesome. Adore is darker and more beautiful than their previous albums and if you can apreciate good and beautiful music than you would appreciate Adore!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller makes you feel like you are in the actual game. It allows you to feel movement to your character along with its environment. Its just like the Dualshock2 but having Dualshock3 for the PS3 is great because it just goes along with the gaming system.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This is the album of the year 2008 ... Donna is really fantastic ... all songs are so special and so great ... This is the soundtrack for Summer 2008!  Enjoy ....
0810993139|5.0|...like my son, let him/her try this book.  My son loved it and actually looked forward to \\"read aloud\\" time instead of procrastinating. He found it quite funny, which helped, I'm sure. I'm still amazed.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|I will start by saying that everyone has their own opinion....    That being said..I went into this album with an open ear, not rushing to judgement and not expecting the Testament of old.     I have appreciated everything they have ever done as they are THE BEST thrash band in my eyes..even Demonic which wasn't completely my thing had some killer tracks on it.    As for this album....It freakin' blew me away. There is not one bad song on this album as far as I am concerned. The lineup is tight..Alex still shreds...Eric is by far the best rhythm player I have heard....Greg still brings the thunder....Paul has always been a solid skins man....and Chuck has one of the best voices in metal...    It is very refreshing to hear metal that grooves while it pounds and to hear vocals that don't sound like dogs barking...    I am pleased that it takes on the old style with a new sense of heavy. Alot of the old thrash bands just aren't what they used to be and it is cool that Testament stayed true to their roots and released another great album.    I was listening to the new Death Angel (which is very cool) before this came out and then once this launched I almost had a flashback to the Thrash days as it seemed the cool thrash was coming back around.    Thanks guys for an amazing release. Hope to see you on tour.
B000065BPB|5.0|Great headphones for the price , I use it on my laptop and ipod and the sound is amazing.  Good job Sennheiser.
B000002MX7|4.0|Chaka Khan has a sensuous and lovely vocal range. The songs in this collection include \\"Ain't Nobody;\\" \\"Papillon (Aka Hot Butterfly)\\" (great song and sound); \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" (great song, reminds me of an episode on that \\"70's Show;\\" \\"I Feel For You\\" (introduced Chaka Khan to my generation); \\"I Know You, I Live You;\\" \\"I'm Every Woman\\" (beats Whitney Houston's any day); \\"Love Me Still;\\" \\"The End Of A Love Affair;\\"  \\"And The Melody Still Lingers On (Night In Tunisia);\\" \\"Through The Fire\\" (my absolute favorite Chaka Khan song); \\"What Cha' Gonna Do For Me;\\" \\"Everywhere;\\"  \\"Never Miss The Water;\\"  \\"Somethin' Deep;\\" \\"Your Love Is All I Know;\\" and \\"Every Little Thing.\\" This disc has captured the soul of one of America's best known singers, Chaka Khan. Today's generation could learn a thing or two from her if not more especially about endurance and longevity.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This CD is amazing.. all the tracks are 10's except for tracks 4 and 7, which are still good, but a notch below the other ones.. i'd never heard of the band until i bought this CD.. i want to buy the previous CD but my fear is that it can't be as good as this one.. so that is the only reason i've hesitated in buying it.. anyway, grab this album as it will quickly become one of the best in your collection.. it gives you chills
B00005JPNZ|5.0|The man in the hat is back.  That's almost enough for me.  Indy is one of the great characters in american cinema.      I think the rest of the reviews have covered plot, so I will justify my rating.  I thought it was great how there was continuity between the films.  For example, there was a great little moment in which Indy looks at a picture of his father and some music from Last Crusade plays.  It was great to hear Indy take on some of the mannerisms of his father which is believable and appropriate given the circumstances in which they are at play.  The characters behaved how they should have.  I know there is much criticism here, but realistically, people change when they age and I think that Indy and Marion were both very much in character.  The score was excellent and that old familiar Raiders march was missed for many years.    I've heard much flack about the plot, and I guess my own feelings about that were that it wasn't that much more difficult to swallow than that of the previous films.      I really hope there will be a 5th movie.  But if not, this was a satisfying end to a spectacular film series.  It was just absolute giddyness to see Indiana Jones crack that whip again.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am a BBC miniseries fan but I don't feel compelled to own many of the series that I watch. North and South was an exception. I rented it and ordered it promptly upon finishing my first viewing. This will be adored and watched repeatedly as will my copy of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice. Enjoy!!
0743496728|4.0|I purchased this book for a book group reading. Although it was a difficult subject (school shooting), it was well written and helps to understand how something like this could happen (motivation).
B0015AARJI|5.0|My original controller was getting cranky, so I opted for this one. It works as intended, and the vibration adds a lot to the game. At first, I didn't realize how much, but when I accidentally used the original controller after several months of using this one, I realized that the vibration really enhanced my gaming experience.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I have been wanting to watch this series and was gonna rent it on netflix until I saw another customer comment that the pilot episode is missing from the regular Season 1 disc. So I figured it was pointless. Then I saw that this special edition was being released with the pilot episodes but everyone is complaining about problems with the discs and scenes being missing. My suggestion, and this is what I am gonna do: You can find *ahem* unofficial copies of the pilot episode on ebay and such and just buy the regular season 1 and 2 discs. I guess you will miss out on extras and deleted scenes but at least you will have the full series with nothing messed up. Just a suggestion.
B00136Q6DA|3.0|It is quite rare that I say or think this, but I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the entire album rather than the big single on it. Check out Youtube mixes of the other tracks, such as the dull self-important Vegas song, before making your purchase.<br /><br />Also, note that Amazon'unlike eMusic et al) only allows one download of a set of MP3s, so be sure to back it up as soon as you get it and/or buy the actual CD and rip it.
B0015519VS|4.0|Usher's long awaited fifth CD \\"Here I Stand\\" was finally released in May 2008, four years after his almost diamond selling, Grammy-winning blockbuster, \\"Confessions.\\" Needless to say, expections were through the roof for \\"Mr. Entertainment\\" to deliver another knockout CD. He mostly succeeds with this latest effort.    Usher, when \\"Confessions\\" was released in 2004, was a newly single 25-year-old man who had recently broken off a long-term relationship with Rozonda \\"Chilli\\" Thomas of famed R&B/Pop group TLC. There were speculations of cheating and even the possibility that Usher may have even fathered a baby with a woman other than Chilli, leading to the breakup. Usher later stated that the baby rumors and the affair were untrue, but the \\"Confessions\\" album turned out to be one of the most inspired, solid and successful discs of the decade, turning out 4 consecutive Pop & R&B #1 hits, \\"Yeah!,\\" \\"Burn,\\" \\"Confessions Pt. II,\\" and \\"My Boo,\\" plus the top 10 hit, \\"Caught Up.\\" Usher, along with R. Kelly, were now the reigning Kings of Music. While Kelly kept turning out CDs almost every year of the '00s, and new upstarts like Chris Brown and Ne-Yo rocking to fame and threatning his status, it was Justin Timberlake that almost seemed to sneak in and take Usher's Music King crown with his #1, critically acclaimed, Grammy-winning second album, \\"Futuresex/Love Sounds\\" that sent the TRL and 106 & Park crowds into a tizzy. Usher's extended break was doing him no favors.    Since \\"Confessions,\\" Usher has grown up. He became part owner of the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers, starred on Broadway in \\"Chicago,\\" started his own media company, but most importantly, became a husband and father. He married his former stylist Tameka Foster, a divorced mother of three, that caused some media controversy. In November 2007, Tameka gave birth to she and Usher's first child together, Usher Raymond V, whom they call Cinco. On \\"Here I Stand,\\" Usher wants to convey to his audience that he has since movedon from that swinging single on \\"Confessions\\" and is now a loving and devoted husband and father, who on occassion still likes to get freaky.    Most of the record is ballad heavy, with few uptempos. \\"This Ain't Sex,\\" and the will.i.am produced and featured \\"What's Your Name\\" are the fastest records on the disc. If you're looking for something like \\"Yeah\\" or \\"U Don't Have To Call,\\" look elsewhere. Usher's prior uptempos were club friendly, but the uptempos here are more smoothed out. Usher teams with that other recently married Music King Jay-Z on \\"Best Thing,\\" in which to two talk about the joys of being in stable relationships. He pledges his undying love for his wife on the title track and the CDs latest single, the Tricky Stewart and The Dream produced, \\"Moving Mountains,\\" and sings a touching prayer for his son on an interlude halfway through the album. But Ush isn't all grown and sentimental. He still shows his randy side as well. The first single, the #1 smash \\"Love In This Club\\" talks about Usher getting down in a club of all places. The remix featuring Mrs. Jay-Z, Beyonce and the other Mr. Carter, Lil' Wayne is included as well. \\"Love You Gently,\\" \\"Appetite,\\" and \\"Trading Places\\" all show that Ush still has a little sex on the brain.      \\"Here I stand\\" overall is a solid CD. What's lacking is true musical inspiration. True, the CD has sexy songs, love songs, relationship songs, and heartbreak songs, but some of it seems forced. What happened to bangers like \\"Yeah,\\" and \\"Caught Up.\\" Also at times, it seems Usher wants to drill his point that he loves his wife and child, which is great, but it starts to become a little boring over time. But, the songs are solid. There's no doubt this CD will sell a gazillion copies and Usher will begin to cement his MJ, Prince, and Stevie Wonder legend status. Those other guys might be successul, but Usher still has his King status on lock.

006109594X|1.0|I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Political, racial, and historical implications aside, I love 300. It's one vicious rip-roaring firestorm facecrusher of an action movie. It's raw and wild and exciting and heroic, and at times it feels absolutely epic. The story- lifted from Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name- is a gloriously violent retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae (in which 300 Spartans held of a gargantuan army of invading Persians for three days) actually sorta threatened to push me away from the movie (not a big historical fiction fan). But that was before I saw the action scenes. They're incredible in every sense of the word, dripping with tension and violence and anger and testosterone and blood. Watching those godlike Spartans threaten to lay waste to their ridiculously well-staffed opponents is a visceral rush, and the movie's intensity only gets stronger as the story wears on. And then there are the visuals, which are raw and dream-like and dripping with dark color. We've also got larger-than-life characters, villains that are fun to hate, heroes that are fun to root for, and a climax that'll melt your skin off. Wicked, wicked cool.
0803730470|5.0|My kids love this book! We initially checked it out from the library but we had to renew it so often that I finally bought a copy. It is fun to read because of it's sing-songy rhythm.  The story is fun, too. This is a family-favorite.
B000002VQQ|5.0|The word that comes most readily to mind is \\"catharsis.\\" That's what this album, Patti Smith's masterful 1975 debut, is all about. Catharsis. A wave of tension being ripped from your spine, from your blood, from the cords of your bones and the fibers of your nerves and the red streaks in your eyes, love and sex and fear and hate and joy suddenly uncaged. Release. It's a forty-five minute scream. Articulate, poetic, emotive, and gorgeous, but a scream nonetheless. And there's a 60s garage rock cover! Two of `em, actually. This is rock `n' roll at its gutsiest and its brainiest, and no music fan should ever be without it.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|There's something about the youthful energy of MGMT's album \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" that makes me think of a person's college years. It's a time in a young person's life when they're experimenting, expanding their horizons, exploring different cultures and ideas, and trying to imagine what their adult life will be like. The album may not be the most consistent or polished of efforts, but it's playful, inventive and inspired. The vocals, lyrics and overall spacey-ness of \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" sometimes recall classic David Bowie. The multicultural, anything-goes production style has more in common with of-the-moment artists like M.I.A. or Hot Chip. Clearly this is a group that finds inspiration in music of both the past and the present, as well as different genres and cultures.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this album is a fresh and skillful debut by a promising new act.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Interesting presentation.I greatly appreciate it and will like to share it with all my friend who know me:D

B0012YYZYK|4.0|The classic \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" finally made it's way to Blu-ray. I couldn't be happier. The audio portion of this film has been greatly upgraded and sounds amazing. The video portion looks a hell of a lot better than the old VHS copy of this film I was watching it on. It looks great. There is only so much you can do with the old video footage but in no way does it look degraded at all. Maybe a little better than a new VHS copy. Seriously though, it's Zepplin! Need I say more?
B000L212HC|5.0|This movie has an old film feel that adds to the intrigue.  I truly enjoyed this film, and it definitely puts Bale and Jackman on my short list.
B000005HFH|5.0|Chet Baker was a fine trumpet player, had a cool West Coast jazz style that fit well in the clubs and was well respected among his contempories. He blew sweet and short, not necessarily long blown out improvisation. For those younger, he was like George Harrison, he hit the right notes at the right time with a sense of melody and a knowing of the song. He didn't have to strut, he strolled the street like he owned it, happy as could be.    What happened was, Chet was asked to sing a tune or two. He got drunk, sang, and was as flat as a soaked Manhattan coaster on a two drink minimun table for two. He sang off key, off the shoulder, off the edge, and weary eyes blinked. Couples snuggled. She kicked her shoes off under the table, her \\"friend\\"  threw dollars at the waiter and they both knew somethin' new. Possibly another drink or two...    Chet sang in a smokey voice, winked at them, coughed and sang...  \\"My Funny Valentine\\"  worse than boyfriend could as he whispered...eager and excited and as \\"whoops\\" as the snap of his H C major coda.     This CD is a fine introduction...  Explore more

0446402389|4.0|Russia under Stalin: dreary, dismal, oppressive. Paranoia rules the day as citizens inform on each other, each of them guilty until proven innocent -- except that any proof of innocence is ignored, since that would imply that the state erred in its original presumption of guilt. A healthy dose of Catch-22 thinking rules this murder mystery, as Leo, our main character and an officer of the MGB (forerunner of the KGB), confronts evidence that a serial killer is on the loose. But according to the government, such a thing is not possible, as it would imply that such a perfect system as Communism has created something as imperfect as a murderer run amok. Will Leo risk his career, his life, and the life of his family, to pursue the killer?<br />Child 44 got off to a very slow start. For over 150 pages, I read on, feeling blanketed by the dark and dismal portrayal of life in the Soviet Union. For those first pages, I admired the writing but felt a little suffocated by the suffering being portrayed without any sense of just where things were going. Finally, though, the plot began to take a more substantial form, and the book became a real page-turner. There is plenty of character development and a real sense of peril, and some twists and turns that, even if they don't come as a complete shock, still make for an affecting read.<br />I recommend Child 44, but you do have to be prepared for some pretty depressing extended setup. With patience, you will find that it pays off.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I experienced a visceral reaction to Mad Men unlike any response I've had to a television show for a long time.  The show elicited a feelings of security and insecurity, comfort and discomfort.  The rigid social structure had me reflecting on a time very early in my life but had a continuous effect in shaping the adult I would become.  As a kid in 1960 I was very aware of racial prejudice and remember the subservient roles played by men and women like the ones cleaning the offices and running the elevators or so told to me with anger and disapproval by my parents and other adults.  I remember my mother dressing in the style of Betty Draper and learning lessons on \\"proper\\" comportment.  I remember how tall (like Dan Draper) my father was and the uneasy but comforting smell from my father's cigarettes. I remember how cute my mother looked in pedal pushers and how we went on family picnics together.  Only as I have grown older can I relate to Don Draper's darkness and the darkness of racial and gender prejudice in American society. Are we so different now?  A loaded question to which I will not speculate.
1400064627|5.0|I loved the movie \\"Fried Green Tomatoes,\\" and am very glad that I saw it before I read the book, as I believe my opinion of the movie would have been much lower had I reversed the order. The book is fantastic; Fannie Flagg has truly captured the many different eras that this book covers. One would think that her narrative would be confusing, the way it constantly shifts in time; however, it makes perfect sense when you are reading it. 80-something Ninny Threadgoode is living in the Rose Terrace Nursing Home to keep one of her friends company. Evelyn Couch is a depressed housewife who visits her mother-in-law, also a resident of Rose Terrace. While Evelyn's husband Ed visits his mother, Evelyn is befriended by Ninny who tells her tales of Whistle Stop and its cafe, and the assorted characters that were part of her life. Evelyn is eventually lifted from her depression by the positive, spiritual, and spunky spirit of Mrs. Threadgoode.<br /><br />There are many differences between the book and the movie, although the overall theme of living a moral life and being just plain nice to people is central to both. The book is much more frank in the lesbian relationship between Ruth & Idgie, whereas the movie only hints at it. The ending is different between the two, and I actually found myself moved much more by the book version than the movie's version. I also found the courtroom scene of Idgie's trial to be much funnier in the book; Fannie Flagg's descriptive language of the characters brings them to life and you can picture them very easily in your head.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book, even if you don't feel it is necessary because you've seen the movie. It is a rich experience that will make you want to get out your 5 pound skillet and fry up some green tomatoes!
B00006JIA4|5.0|Absolutely OUTSTANDING.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the musical genius of Freddie, Brian and the band.

0743486285|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!!!  I wished it was longer when I got the end. While reading this book I was at times discusted, shocked and yet moved. There were some parts of the book that I got a good laugh at but, there were also MANY parts that made me just want to reach out and hold the guy!!!  It's amazing what drugs can do to a person's mind.  The book has some great pictures of Nikki that shows you what a handsome guy he was when he didn't have his face painted up.  To anyone that is a fan of Motley Crue I think you will really enjoy this book.  Nikki Sixx is a very talented and creative artist and really was the glue that held it all together. I love you Nikki!!!
0895260131|5.0|Fantastic and eye opening book!!  When i was young, i was taught in Catholic school that we were brothers and sisters with Jews and Islam.  But as i have gotten older, i started to discover the Islam part was totally incorrect.  This book bring it all together to show the truth about Islam  and how it compares with Crhistianity.  the other gives a fair account, even telling where Islam is good, but that sure isnt often.<br />The biggest \\"truth\\" i found in the book was the subject of lying.  Jesus taught that if you lie, you speak from the devil.  God Cant tell a lie.  But Muhammad stated in the Koran that lying is ok if it promotes Islam.  The other eye opening thing was how Muhammad hated the Cross and banned it.  Only the devil hates the cross.  Both those convinced me that Islam comes from the devil.<br />This book should be required reading in high school to take a serious look at Islam.  We all need to wake up before its tooooo late....After reading this book i would die before ever being \\"FORCED\\" to convert!
B0018J48QO|5.0|Wasn't too sure I wanted to watch this series, given the premise - but quickly got into it after the first episode and can't WAIT for the Season 2 on DVD!<br /><br />Smart, well-cast, and draws you right in.
0452289963|1.0|Eckhart Tolle is the biggest hoax since the Lochness Monster.  His whole philosophy is a smorgasbord of Buddhism, Yoga Sutras, segments of Hinduism, New Age and Christian Theology.  There is nothing new or \\"awakening\\" about this book.  But of course, we Americans tend to be suckers, especially when Oprah says it's good!  Well I love being human and experiencing the DRAMA of my existence.  His constant preaching of experiencing \\"neutrality\\" in every possible way is banal, boring and Buddhist.  That's why I'm a \\"gay Catholic\\" and love every minute of it.  Yes, there is evil.  When war and genocide occur, violent crime and oppression of an entire group (i.e. homosexuals), then there is a greater power behind it all rather than just the collective, unconscious beings.  Evil is behind it.  One book in 2008 can't change 2000 years of Christian theology.  But it's okay to be a Buddhist, Hindu, or a Tolleist.  But call it AS IS and stop making everybody believe that you have all the answers.  The TRUTH is only revealed once you have passed on to the after life.  In the meantime, savor the drama of human life and learn from it.  If you suffer, be stronger.  If you are comfortable, share your wealth.  If you are in love, then love, love, love!  We are not robots!  We are passionate \\"human\\" beings and yes, I do practice \\"material detachment\\" to reach enlightenment, which we both agree on.  The difference is, you are sitting on a billion $$$ from your workshops.  How about sharing your wealth and giving me some money to market my book?  Unlike \\"A New Earth,\\" in my book \\"The Suburban Inmate,\\" (also on amazon.com, yes this is a plug), I discuss the importance of universal spirituality and tolerance, based on your origin of faith.  I'm only intolerant now because you are misleading an enormous amount of followers.  Now once you admit to them that you are a new prophet for Tolleism, then I will respect your new \\"religion\\".
B000VWYJ86|5.0|What an adventure this trilogy has been! Matt Damon is exceptional is all three movies. This one does not disappoint. If you are new to the Bourne Trilogy then do yourself a favor and start with the first two before you watch this one. It wouldn't make much sense to you if you did not. Answers all the questions left from the first two movies. A must see if your into spy, conspiracy or action films! I will watch this one several times.
B0007X6ST2|4.0|Compared to the original CD issue, the remaster shows a noticeable improvement in audio quality (surprisingly, that's not always the case with remasters). The bass, in particular, is much improved. The high frequencies, particularly cymbals, are also much cleaner in the remaster.     The remaster does engage in one \\"trick\\" - it's considerably louder than the original. But after correcting for the difference in levels, the audio quality is still clearly improved. I did my comparison using a Mark Levinson 390S CD player, BAT VK-300SE integrated amp, and Quad 988 speakers.

B00005JPO1|4.0|As the credits rolled and the 4th Indiana Jones movie was over, I walked out with a smile on my face. I had a great time and I want to see another Indy film. Yet, I couldn't ignore the several embarrassing moments that this movie had.<br /><br />The movie wastes no time getting started when we that Indy has been captured by \\"Reds\\" to help them find a very magnetized crate containing an alien who has a crystal skull. This skull has special powers and there may be more of them, which then starts the race between them and Indy to find it first.<br /><br />Despite adding some uneasy sci-fi elements to the Indy universe, I didn't mind the plot at all. The ride from start to finish was fun and I laughed out loud several times and the suspense scenes had their moments.<br /><br />Harrison Ford got back into the role just fine. Despite seeing some age in his face and his voice, he was Indy through and through. It was nice seeing him crack the whip, pull down his hat and sleep and many of the other things that made his character so enduring.<br /><br />Now, I have to comment on the many disappointments and outright embarrassing things about this film. Where do I start? Enough had been said about the \\"Nuke The Fridge\\" scene that I won't elaborate further except to say that it wasn't as bad as some of the other problems. I was looking forward to John Hurt being in the film but whoa, what a disappointment. All he got to do was babble and he was comedy relief by accident in most scenes. Why bring Karen Allen back to give her little to do but have one good argument scene with Indy and then just smile a lot? The vine jumping scene might have been better if the effects were done with more skill. And the three waterfalls may have been pushing it some.<br /><br />I love \\"escapist\\" movies and this was another enjoyable Indiana Jones film. I only hope that it can overcome the embarrassing moments and come back for another movie in a few years.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I thought this was a valiant comeback effort.  Donna is in great voice and it was an impressive feat co-writing all of the music.  It took me a couple of listens to get the \\"Crayons\\" concept she was trying to convey with the variety of songs on the CD, but I think that it largely worked admirably.  One of the critics said that Donna sounded like a grandmother trying to act hip to impress her grandkids.  At times maybe that is somewhat true (i.e., when she references I Pods) but the bottom line is that she remains impressive and self-inventing.  Sure she could have done another album of rehashed standards, but bravely that is not what Donna chose to do.
0140277447|4.0|In the years since World War II era China, much has been done to cover the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanjing.  Relatively few people know about what happened during this horrific time, and even fewer understand the many years of persecution which led to this event.  Japanese aggression was not limited to this event, nor was it limited to the era: decades before this Japan was attacking and manipulating China (as were other foreign powers).<br /><br />For understanding exactly what happened during this event, this might be a helpful place to begin.  I sensed some bias on the part of the author, though it didn't seem so overwhelming to discount the facts of what happened.<br /><br />Anyone who has traveled to China probably wonders why the Chinese people are so adamantly opposed to the Japanese.  They think, \\"Even if these events were terrible, they were so LONG ago!  How can they still be upset?\\" There are two answers for this.  The first is a long history of government censorship and manipulation of information in China.  This is self-explanatory.  The second takes a little more thinking.  From what moral platform do we say, \\"they should just get over it!\\"?  Are we speaking from experience?  Because the last time I checked we have not been invaded by a foreign government in the last several hundred years.  If we are alluding to our ability to \\"get over\\" WWII, the fact is, we were not being invaded, raped and pillaged.  I guess I'm saying not to compare apples and oranges when you make an argument that the Chinese are out-of-line for still feeling such anger.<br /><br />Another lesson I was reminded of in this book is that governments manipulate their people.  It is in their interest to deceive and take advantage of people for many reasons (not the least of which is survival).<br /><br />I wish the author would have gone into more depth about the reasons behind Japanese criminality at the time, but otherwise this book is the perfect beginning to help you understand this tragic event.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is probably my favourite of the original \\"Raiders\\" trilogy.  It begins with an event that gives us the details as to why Indiana has a chin scar, where he got his passion for archaeology, his hat, his whip, his hatred of snakes and ultimately his name. Excluding Ford, there are two stars in this film, the well-written story and Sean Connery as Indie's sometimes bumbling, but always loveable father, Henry Jones, Sr. - a man lost in his obsession of finding the Holy Grail.  Some commentators say the father and son relationship is not fleshed out - I disagree and provide the following to make my point(warning spoilers):    1. In his attempted rescue of his Dad, merely hearing the sound of \\"Junior\\" brings Indie back to the \\"Yes sirs,\\" of his youth;  2. Indie's anger when speaking of his deceased mother never understanding Henry Sr's obsession with the Grail and perhaps secretly how Indie blames his father for her death;  3. Indie standing in awe of his father when in the nick of time Henry Sr remembering a quote from Charlemagne saves them both from peril.    4. Henry Sr, nearly squeezes the life out of his boy realising Indie didn't miss the cliffhanger;  5. the pairs' conversation in the lounge of the zeppelin; and  6. the seemingly shared thoughts between them when Indie faces the \\"Devices\\".     Each of these scenes resonates of real-life experience between parent and child; a distant and rocky relationship due to personality, obsession and circumstance and yet an existing kinship. The comedic timing between Connery and Ford is perfect! I'm sorry that Connery never got a chance to do more comedy because he was certainly adept at it in this film. And what about that hat that Indie can never seem to be rid of?
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Or $66.95. Great season and it will be fun to watch especially when all the seasons have come out. This is one of those shows that is really setup for Blu-Ray. Oh and the new additions this year in characters along with great storytelling really put this series back on top! I was a little disappointed with Michael's character development but hey you can't have everything and we still have to see where they are going with that.    Looking forward to the release too bad we have to wait till December.
B00005JNJV|5.0|It used to be Michael Keaton's version that was the ultimate Batman for me: dark, brooding and troubled... until I saw \\"Batman Begins\\". Scrapping all previous Batman story lines, Christopher Nolan starts all over and brings a unique background to the Batman character - one that is more believable and convincing. The creation of Batman is laid out without patronizing the audience; the back-story is gritty and realistically (enough) explains how Bruce learned to do all his stunts and terror tricks. Nolan's treatment of Batman allows Bruce Wayne's true identity to be completed obscured, something other Batman actors didn't fully achieve. There are no comedic alter-ego slip ups in this version; Bruce Wayne has no bumbling moments that would cause anyone to suspect that he had a secretive heroic night-life.     Additionally, while Keaton's, Val Kilmer's and George Clooney's Bruce Waynes were very obvious under the batman mask, Bale and Nolan created a twist by having Bruce Wayne distort his voice as well as hiding his face behind a much more concealing mask than previous Batman incarnations, enough so that you really can't tell it's the same person. The terror Bruce Wayne learned to instill in his opponents works impressively in this version, seen especially in Batman's first encounter, with the crooked cop, which is convincingly frightening ... with great lines.    Fun elements are brought to the story by Lucius Fox, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman, who works at Wayne Enterprises and supplies Batman with his arsenal of awesome military toys, my favorite of which is the new \\"bat mobile\\", which is probably the coolest tank ever created for the screen. It is a refreshing change from the outlandish and over-the-top batmobiles which worked just fine in the other films, but would simply be too cartoonish for this one.    Many fans complained that the character of Bruce's best friend Rachel Dawes is the weak link in this film. I didn't mind her character so much, but feltshe was rather under-used and not as strongly acted as she could have been. I saw the role of Rachel Dawes as a humanizing element that added some vulnerability to Bruce and Batman without being a shrieking damsel-in-distress like Vicky Vale was, or a desperate hero-chaser like Dr. Chase Meridian.    Notable performances come from Michael Cain's Alfred, a capable man and lovable old friend, truly concerned for his master's well-being and not just a buffoon full of one-liners, Gary Oldman as the good-hearted office Gordon, and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, a sinister psychiatrist that never falls into the cackling, maniacal cartoon villain role. Liam Neeson's mysterious Henri Ducard even proves to be more than a two-dimensional character and there is a reason for all he does.    Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard majestically reinvent the score, with no traces of the classic comic book hero march created by Danny Elfman, creating instead a pulsating, dark score with occasional rays of lightness.    If the Joel Schumacher treatments (shudder) turned you off from the Batman series, you'll find this one will greatly surpass your expectations and may just become a favorite. Batman Begins is a wonderful blend of its comic book sources with realistic elements. It is slow to start, because it's starting over, but there's plenty of solid action, a great storyline and some witty and memorable dialog. This film is a gem in the Batman canon.

For those who are watching for more than mere entertainment purposes, this movie may not live up to your standards.
0743277708|5.0|This is my favorite book.  I know that it's about rabbits, but really it's so much more.  This book is about civilization and community and survival.  It's about friendship and freedom and mythological stories.<br /><br />I first read this book as part of my High School Freshman English summer reading requirement (Thank you Mrs. Gollander).  I dreaded it then because all I could understand was that rabbits were talking and running around.  Later in my life I read it again.  And then again.<br /><br />Watership Down is the greatest book written in the English language.  There are some basic reasons for this:<br /><br />(1) Adams uses rabbits to express his themes of leadership, loyalty and friendship, and society.  In other novels, or in real-life, we see ourselves as having much control over our environment, when in fact we have very little.  By making rabbits the centerpiece, it's easier to see the large external factors.  These factors are very difficult to see when we are engaging in our everyday lives.<br /><br />The rabbits are also quite innocent.  The picture we get when reading the novel is that, despite the fact that there are good and bad rabbits alike, all rabbits are ultimately innocently pursuing what they think is right.  Even General Woundwort is pursuing a conservative, fascist agenda in an attempt to preserve his society (and his power).  This is true to life.  George Bush wasn't trying to kill thousands of Iraqi babies, but it happened.  We can't lay the additional blame of intentional murder, no matter how bad the accidental results were.<br /><br />(2) The society is a combination of 3 important aspects: religion or spirituality, dreaming for a better life, and surviving forces beyond our control.  Aren't these the very same that we face in our lives?  By exploring these themes, Adams is giving us insight to how important they really are.<br /><br />(3) The eclectic.  The vast rabbit knowledge and interwoven rabbit lore, vocabulary, and actions indicate a parallel society that has its own unique aspects.  It removes the rabbits from the human world enough to pursue a comparison between human society and these rabbits without stating the obvious.  Had the author used rabbits without the unique aspects of their society, it would have been rather like a weak treatise on society written by a college student for their senior thesis.<br /><br />(4) Readability.  This book was assigned to me as summer reading during my transition to high school.  I didn't fully \\"get it\\" then, but I certainly understood what I was reading.  Better readers than me would certainly grasp the full meaning of the novel at around the same time in their lives (7th or 8th grade), though coming-of-age novels are probably more applicable at that time.  This is probably a book for college students and beyond; the novel is thoroughly accessible to people who are interested in the 3 important themes listed in number 1 above.<br /><br />(5) Lack of Dogma.  There is no centralized dogma about society, other than the obvious notion that fascism is probably a bad thing.  The author doesn't argue that one specific style of government is best for people, but that people who work together for a common good can lead society in the right direction.  Of course, it's up to you to decide what kind of government best espouses this notion.<br /><br />This book challenges us to face the things that threaten our way of life.

0684830485|5.0|The ur-text for today's wartime adventure novel, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" remains a standard bearer for pulse-pounding action fiction, and one of the true masterpieces by the most celebrated American author of his time.<br /><br />Robert Jordan is a Spanish-language instructor from Montana who, now in Spain, has a job of another kind: blow up a critical bridge under enemy control before his comrades, the Republicans of the Spanish Civil War, mount a critical attack. He falls in with a band of motley guerrillas, discovering the joy and passion of life even as he must make peace with the real possibility of his death.<br /><br />When published in 1940, there was little need to explain the title: the bell was tolling pretty loudly for just about everyone outside of Sweden and Chile as the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany rolled up giant chunks of the globe. Germany's three-year dress rehearsal had been the Spanish Civil War, where they helped Spanish fascists and monarchists overthrow the Marxist-led Republicans while Western democracies watched idly. Ernest Hemingway, a strong supporter of the Republican cause, lost arguably the only country he ever really loved.<br /><br />\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" could have been an exercise in told-you-so or score settling with the right-wing victors Hemingway despised. Yet the story is so engaging - so raw and sweeping in its style, so visceral in form, and undogmatic in outlook - that it is hard to know from reading it just how bruised a champion Hemingway had been for the losing team. The most drawn-out, brutal section of narrative deals with atrocities committed by Republicans, not fascists. Rebels and Republicans alike appear oddly human.<br /><br />\\"Do you think you have a right to kill any one? No. But I have to. How many of those you have killed have been real fascists? Very few. But they are all the enemy to whose force we are the opposing force. But you like the people of Navarra better than those of any other part of Spain. Yes. And you kill them. Yes.\\"<br /><br />That's one of many internal monologues Jordan has with himself in the course of the book, which may annoy some expecting more wall-to-wall action but works fine by me. It's easy imagining oneself pondering similar questions in similar situations, and the running stream-of-consciousness adds to the nail-biting tension.<br /><br />Hemingway also does very well by the secondary characters, especially the guerrilla band Jordan takes up with. Their leader, Pablo, was a once-ruthless killer of fascists now reduced to drink and train-robbing. \\"There is not enough of you left to make a sick kitten,\\" says Pablo's bitter woman, Pilar, herself a tigress and Jordan's chief ally. Pilar is both supporter and scoffer of Jordan's budding relationship with Maria, a teenaged rape survivor rescued by the guerrillas. This is not a merry band of outlaws; their very fractiousness draws you in.<br /><br />As a Sam Peckinpah fan, I was struck by how pleasingly similar \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" was to the classic Western desperado saga \\"The Wild Bunch\\". Both are straightforward action yarns with a lot of backstory, vivid characters and setting, and a storyline that cleverly pulls you in even as it seems to ramble.<br /><br />\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is less concerned about the bridge itself (where or when precisely this action is occurring is never spelled out) then the feelings that surround warfare, and how and why one man must do what he can, for as Rick said in \\"Casablanca\\", the problems of one man don't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy mixed-up world.

0143113100|5.0|The BRAIN that changed ITSELF is a unique book that in clear and concise terms explains the remarkable healing and reparative properties that our brain possesses. It can be read and understood equally well by both the medical specialist and the general public. It is detailed and yet is an easy to read book that reveals what is being re-discovered about how our brain can heal itself.     It refutes most of medicine's long held tenets that the brain has highly specialized nerve cells that are located in certain physical areas. And if an area is severely damaged, those damaged cells frequently die and the function that they performed is lost forever or severely diminished. This book reveals that the contrary is true!  The brain in fact is filled with neuronal stem cells that appear to be able to reproduce themselves almost indefinitely without any appearance of aging. These new nerve cells are then able to \\"rewire\\" the damaged area. The degree of healing and \\"rewiring\\" will vary with the healer's understanding of this process and what is the correct paradigm that needs to be applied for optimal physical and mental rehabilitation therapy.     In its simplest form the average, intelligent, curious and imaginative lay person could be of the greatest assistance to a receptive physician in offering suggestions as to how therapy might be approached.    It reviews how the somehow forgotten and yet precise brain research done years ago, which could not be explained or understood at that time due to limitations in technology has been re-discovered and proven by our new capabilities in dynamic brain imaging.    It gives new hope to anyone that has sustained brain damage and who has been told in recent times that nothing further could be done for them. This also includes many types of memory problems and mental decline due to aging.    I am chagrined and sad to say that too many of those in the practice of medicine today are unaware of some of these practical developments in ourunderstanding of the brain's plasticity and due to many reasons may not have the time or be open to hear from their better informed patients what this book has to say.     In addition to this book I would also highly recommend the PBS program: The Brain Fitness Program by Dr. Michael Merzenich. As well as Dr. Doidge's brain training program - \\"Brain Fitness Program 2.0.\\"  A second program - \\"Insight\\" - is designed to help a person to increase the speed that their brain can process things (data) that are occurring around them as it is happening. Both of these programs will help an individual of any age improve their memory and awareness of their surroundings.      Patrick J. Donley, MD
0670018651|5.0|This book is a delight to read. Both writers know thier stuff and make a convincing case for taking perfumes seriously, and when not to take them so seriously! They are lyrical when reviewing masterpieces, and deliciously catty when confronted with a dud.     I will certainly take this book with me next time I go to the perfume counter.     I would have liked some more comprehensive indexing, and it would have been handy to group perfumes by type, rather than strict alphabetical order.     Apart from that this is both an essential reference guide for getting exactly what you want in a perfume purchase, and a pleasure to read in and of itself.

0393324818|5.0|This book has become the cliche for the transformation of the way that baseball is approached over the last decade or so.  This book explains in a detailed but highly readable manner how baseball went from simply a business to a quantitatively analyzed (and analyzable) science.  Given the large amounts of money in baseball over the past 20 years or so, it isn't surprising that baseball has undergone a transformation so that the computer nerds have taken over.  I'm a fairly big baseball fan, and was turned off from reading this book for so long because it has become a `cliche' and I believed that it would be shallow and trite.  It is anything but.  This book is an absolute must read for anyone who wants to understand how `professionals` view the game today.  It is easy to read, but packed with details about the new way of looking at baseball.  There are also detailed character studies of some of the players (like Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford) and front office people (primarily Billy Beane and John DePodesta of the As).<br /><br />The central theme of this book is why the As were able to remain competitive year after year even though they had a total team salary that was 1/3 or 1/4 of the big players like the Yankees and Red Sox.  Judging from the reviews I've read on the Amazon sights, many of the reviewers still don't fully appreciate the arguments in this book.  The goal of Beane and his cohorts was to bring a mathematical approach to the game and find out which aspects of the game were overvalued (from a mathematical and financial perspective) and which were undervalued.  Beane wanted to quantitatively determine which traits were most important (and not rely simply on scouts judgment), but also determine how these traits were compensated in the market.  Many have said that Beane and company look at OBP, slugging, OPS, etc., and disregard batting average and defense.  This is true, but the key point here is that these traits were also undervalued by the market (at least when Beane got started).  It is this point that allowed the As to remain competitive.  They could trade players who were overvalued (like closers) and pick up inexpensive, undervalued, but highly productive, players in return.<br /><br />The first part of the this book details the development of Bill James and his mathematical approach to baseball.  There was apparently a small community of baseball fanatics who had, in the 70s and 80s, analyzed the mathematical details of baseball and determined that things like OBP were key factors, and not BA or defense.  It took the major league clubs another decade or more to realize (or accept) this.  Subsequent chapters deal with Beane's maneuvering to get players that fit into his philosophy, detailed accounts of some of the players Beane acquired (like Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford), and lots of inside details about the messy business of the day to day workings of a baseball front office.<br /><br />One of the thing that is stress over and over again in this book is that Beane and his cohorts stress process over outcome.  They don't care if, in any individual case, their decision works out.  They are confident however that over the long haul they will be right.  They are playing the averages, and this is what is keeping them competitive with the big-payroll clubs (it is also why they really can't compete in the playoffs with the big payroll clubs - they are beating the `league average' in the long run, but the teams in the playoffs are far from `league average').  Beane and his cohorts have often been wrong (one obvious example taken from the book is Scott Kazmir - they wanted nothing to do with him in the draft as he was a high school pitcher and their process said that the risk on high school pitchers was too high - I wonder if they would like to have a do-over on that pick?), but because they are playing the averages, their system keeps them in contention year after year.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ forany baseball fan, whether you agree with the conclusions or not.  It is well written, contains lots of detail (and will keep the nerdiest computer geek happy), but is also highly readable and doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.  There is so much fascinating info in this book, I couldn't put it down (read through it in a day).gree with the conclusions or not.

B000002H97|4.0|This is album is Metallica being commercialized to have shorter songs for radio/mtv friendly play. This is Metallica's first album with producer Bob Rock, leaving their past producer during the glory days Flemming Rasmussen. Rock also produced albums with artists like David Lee Roth, Colin James, and Motley Crue. On a side note Metallica's James Hetfield said that the band was suppose to be the anti-Motley Crue. So I just find it odd that Metallica asked the same producer to did a Motley Crue album to do their own album. One more side note, a year after Rock produced the Black Album he produced the Cher \\"Love Hurts\\"... Bob Rock was such a bad choice for the band. I don't blame Metallica for their downfall in music after this album, BLAME BOB ROCK! Rock continued to produce Metallica albums up to the travesty that was St. Anger. So go figure once Rock began producing Metallica's music quality began to decline... see the connection. So to summarize Bob Rock tried to kill one of the greatest bands of all time, but thats to the loyal fan base they are still alive and kicking. Now all-star producer Rick Ruben is doing Metallica's new album, set to come out in September, prepare for a Metallica revival!

Bruce and the E Street Band have already established themselves as the greatest live rock band ever, and only Dylan rivals Springsteen's ability to craft songs from the heart with a keen social observance.  Even when Bruce goes off the trail with introspective, folk-oriented efforts like 'Devils and Dust' or the delightful, uptempo 'Seeger Sessions', the results are always pleasurable and successful.  He's never made a less-than-worthwhile album.    'Magic', I would argue, is his best since 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'.  Like 'Born in the USA', the album is deceiving in a way, as others have commented here, because the music is so friendly and rocking and yet the lyrics are full of anger and sadness.  'Radio Nowhere' explodes out of the speakers and just trashes the state of contemporary FM American radio.  'Last to Die' blasts the Bush Administration's Iraq war policy.  'Magic', the title track, seems to lament collective selfishness in society and rising racism.  'Gypsy Biker' documents the lost soul of a returning war Vet.  The hidden track, 'Terry's Song', is a moving tribute to a departed, loved friend.  Its poignancy is doubled by the fact that it could just as well been written for recently departed E Street Band organist Danny Federici - \\"when they built you Brother, they broke the mold...\\".  Undeniably, this is American rock songwriting that simply doesn't exist anymore, with the exception, again, of Dylan.     I don't understand the criticisms I've read here of Brendan O' Brien's production.  No album I've heard in the last couple of years booms so proudly or invites you into its wrath.  Case in point - \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" sounds like Brian Wilson with modern technology, highlighting the friendliest Bruce vocal performance since \\"Hungry Heart\\", and enrapturing a wonderful tribute to lost summer innocence. If you're going to criticize production, try Madonna's latest, 'Hard Candy', which sounds like a mechanical disco-meets-going-out-of-business-porn-shop.    As you can probably tell, I love this album.  If you are sick of manic-depressive techno bands with their hair hanging in their faces and hip-hop artists going on-and-on about urban ruthlessness and just want to hear music that makes you feel human again, 'Magic' is your choice.  It is indeed magic.
0446577391|4.0|Author Jan Dynes who wrote Refraction, suggested that I read this author and she was right, I really enjoy David Balducci. His style is very similar to my other favorite novelists. He builds the characters and involves me as a reader, in his plot. It is what I loved about Refraction. I think that they are both at the top of their field. Must reads!
B0014KD46W|5.0|This is Steve's best in years! A lot of it is remenicient of classic Traffic. His vocals are still as good as they were 30 years ago. The music is classic rock brought to the new century.
B00111YM5G|1.0|Normally, I like movies that deal with angels. The plot for the movie \\"Gabriel\\" sounded good. I was VERY disappointed with this movie. I thought it was overly bloody, no special effects of angels with wings or flying (like the mini-series, \\"The Fallen\\" based on books by T.Sniegoski, which I thought was an awesome plot of fallen angels & their offspring). The scenes in \\"Gabriel\\" were dark (supposedly because the earth/mankind had fallen to evil and darkness). I think it could've been better done. Somehow angels with (man-made) guns doesn't quite fit right, maybe mystical swords would've been better. But supposedly when Gabriel became human he lost his powers, so I guess he had to resort to guns? But somehow he still had \\"some\\" powers evidenced in his ability to sense things, forcing people to tell him what he wanted to know, or healing, etc. In general the story line itself was poor: the story of an angel trying to bring light to mankind, without subcoming to the \\"human\\" vices. He searches for other angels who came but failed at defeating the darkness and evil angels, he tries to remind them of their mission and purpose. Personally I found that there was very little depth to the characters, it was hard to identify with anyone. Maybe some people might actually like it. I for one, think it was a waste of my money, I should've rented it first . . .

B0015519VS|2.0|I love Usher. His last album is one of my favorite CD's. But this CD is not the business. I only like 2 songs. \\"This aint sex\\" & \\"Love In This Club\\" The Remix.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I hadn't heard of this group before. But now that I've listened to this disk I'm a fan.<br />The lead vocalist (Guy Garvey) is great. The lyrics and music are well written, and<br />beutifully performed. I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from a group called<br />elbow but I was richly rewarded. All the songs on this disk I found to be worth putting on<br />my iPod, and for me thats rare. Some of these tunes are hauntingly done ie. One Day Like This,<br />and The Bones of You.<br />A really fabulous album. Listen to some of the clips and you will be hooked.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a stimulating series.  Your emotions vary from being scared to excited to absolute fear in a roller coaster ride with the characters in this series.  I give it high marks.
1416550518|3.0|Reviewed by Kathy Smith (formerly Bob's wife, soon to be ex wife, and humongous fool)    I know this book has been loved by a lot of people.  I had high hopes for it.  Alas, it moves rather slowly.  Also I just couldn't get *really* into it.  I am an avid reader...it's a rare book that doesn't captivate me.  Unfortunately, this one didn't.  The characters didn't suck me into their lives and stories.  The suspense of the \\"big secret\\" just got annoying while I was waiting to find out what the secret was.
B00164KYS2|5.0|I became a fan of the series not too long ago and have bought all dvds. I simply fell in love with the show. Therefore, I had to go and see the movie. The movie is what it was  meant to be another serving of \\"fun, laughter and tears\\". However, one walks away with a clear message about the importance of true friendship. Friendship that prevails through time and distance. These characters provide us with glimpses of how throughout life there are always those unique friends/loved ones who will see us through the worst and best of times. Friends who support us  no matter what. It is a great movie!
B000O77SRC|5.0|Die Hard is the action movie that reinvented action. Before Die Hard there really wasn't any action heroes; I mean besides Rambo, Die hard created the Epitome of the new era of action. And this can be proven with the many imitations that followed Die Hard's success. Such titles include Speed (Die Hard on a bus) Under Siege (Die Hard on a boat) and Passenger 57 (Die Hard on a plane) all of these movies were made prior to the success of Die Hard<br /><br />Die Hard's story is known by practically everyone. But for those who are unfamiliar here it goes. John McCLane is a New York Police Officer, he is on his way to Los Angeles to visit his wife and children to celebrate Christmas together...but there is something wrong, a group of professional terrorists...Or better say thieves are taking hostage of a whole building. And in this building McLane's wife is also among the group. The thieves are prepared and have everything planned out. They have weaponry, technology, and professional men...but there is one thing they weren't counting on...John McClane. He is in the building and ready to rock. Die hard till this day is one of the best and probably the best action movie ever made, and it's probably because it's a fresh story, we can relate to the character. He is a character who gets the job done but doesn't want to be there, he just does what he has to do because there is no other choice. And also we have someone who bleeds; we see every bruise, every cut. The character is human so it feels real. These are the qualities that make die hard till this day one of the best action movies of all time. This is a must own by all movie fans out there. \\"Yippee Cay-Yay.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING:  5 OUT OF 5
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I was introduced to the wild, dark, and frightening world of David Fincher when I was in middle school. I went with a friend of mine to see SEVEN. It stayed with me for years, and still manages to give me the creeps. THE GAME. What can I say about THE GAME? One of the greatest mind benders of all time, also featuring one of Michael Douglas' best performances. FIGHT CLUB was marketed as a run of the mill action flick, when in actuality it is a deep, philosophical masterpiece that I loved. PANIC ROOM held me in suspense as well. I remember seeing it in Charlotte, amongst a very interactive audience, who were all screaming and hollering at the screen - \\"RUN, JODIE, RUN!\\" It was one of the most memorable - and one of the loudest - experiences that I have ever had at the theatre...    And here comes ZODIAC in 2007. I missed the theatrical run, but I do remember that it opened on a Friday night while I just so happened to be in San Francisco, California with some of my college buddies. We opted to see BLACK SNAKE MOAN instead. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved BLACK SNAKE MOAN and all, but now that I have seen ZODIAC in all of it's glory, I wish that we had seen it instead. I can only imagine the impact this would have had on me in a full theatre, all blown up on a big screen. As it turns out, I missed it, but I did watch it for the very first time tonight. Talk about a film that can simutaneously creep you out and intrigue the piss out of you at the same time - this is it!     I haven't been so caught up in a film like this since THE DEPARTED. I know that they're two different films, but that's not the point. I could not pull myself away from the television through the entire length, not even to use the bathroom. If I had to piss, I held it. I held it until my bladder was about to burst. The fact that they never caught this dude is so unsettling. There is a sense of mystery and dread that hangs over your head and STAYS there as the film ends, with Donovan's \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" playing quietly in the background. I'll never be able to hear that song again without having this film spring to mind. You really come to respect all of the police and detectives who worked so diligently on the case. Til this day, they are still working on this case, according to the title cards at the end of the film.     The performances are all excellent. Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo were totally ignored as far as Oscar consideration goes, and so was the film and it's wonderfully talented director. This is a change of pace for David Fincher. It is totally different from anything that he has done in the past, yet at the same time, he uses all the right flourishes that have worked before. The cinematography from Harry Savides (BIRTH, LAST DAYS) is brilliantly done. By the way, I also have to throw a shout out to Jake Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance as Robert Graysmith, a young cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, over time, becomes more and more obessessed with the case.     All in all, PERFECT film, and highly recommended to those who have the patience to sit through the two and a half running time without complaining. SEE IT. NOW!    (By the way, this has to be one of the longest reviews that I have ever written for Amazon, so trust me. It's that good.)

In the story Greg (the main character)encounters the problem of his older brother and swimming. In the story,Greg and Rodney go on some funny adventures. Rodrick was my favorite character because I like all the things he does to torment Greg. Read Rodrick rules and you'll go on an adventure. I would give this great book 5 stars! Readers that like hysterical and fun books should read this awesome book.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I've been a fan since the very first episode and I can't wait for Season 4 to start.  I can't say enough about this show.  I watch it for the Awww factor, the Ewwww factor, the Ick factor, the Hot factor and everything in between.  The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic, the writing and directing way beyond what you see on other shows.  Too bad it's on such a crappy network who ignores it and not on some other \\"real\\" network where it could be seen by millons more who would then grow to love as I do.  Do yourselves a favor and buy Season 3 (and 1 & 2 if you haven't already seen the show) and join the millions of us who know a great show when we see one.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|Thank you for sending the movie prompty.  I am very impressed with doing business with you.  The first movie I purchased was in the wrong format.

Thank you again for making me a satisfied customer, who is pleased to order from you again.
B000286RNY|4.0|I was living in China when this hit the theatres, and wow was it popular.  Now I know why.  We start with some absurd Chinese slapstick and move into an excellent shows of special effects, stunts, and martial artistry.  This is fun, thrilling, funny, crazy as all get-out, and just damn good.  I'll be watching it again.
1400034205|4.0|\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a wise and well-written novel about American expatriates in France in the 1920s and '30s.  The characters make different choices about life:  one is a ludicrous social snob; another enters a loveless but stable marriage; another opts for degradation and self-destruction; and another seeks enlightenment in India.  Every character (and path) is vividly rendered, making it an unforgettable book.     That said, readers expecting a tale of Eastern mysticism may be disappointed.  The section on India is a relatively small part of the book, and the events there are rendered (rather artificially) in the form of a long reminiscence by the enlightenment-seeker, suggesting that Maugham didn't quite know how to pull off the \\"spiritual\\" material.  But it's the only \\"off\\" note in an otherwise near-perfect book.  Read it.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|I ordered this music after watching the series. The music is full of variety and beauty. It has pathos and humor and richness...and a touch of quirkiness. A great addition to your music library!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have been a Gilmore Girls addict since the first episode of season 1 aired and I have been a very satisfied owner of seasons 1-5 for a couple of years now.  I wasn't planning on buying season 6 OR 7 because I remembered them as let downs when I saw them the first time (season 6 Rory and Lorelai don't even speak for half the year and season 7 was the rushed finale/broken engagement with Luke- who wants to remember that?!) BUT BOY AM I GLAD I COMPLETED THE SET!  Season 6 is better then I remember and season 7 has that glorious moment between Lorelai and Emily working on the computer and Emily tells Lorelai that she's in kayak and that she's going to make it! I cried.  For this price it's silly NOT to buy it.  COMPLETE THE SET!
B0000640VO|3.0|It's a fine movie.  It's not \\"5 Acadmy Award Nominations!\\" fine the way the DVD cover blasts at you, but it's a fine movie.  Unique color scheme, a wry dry narrative wit that I love, and an allegorical tale that doesn't forget the importance of character development or plot the way that most allegories do.  It moves at a nice fast pace, and both narrative and dialogue were written by someone who cares about the words.  Maybe it's a little twee, but so what?  I recommend it.  It's miscast as a comedy, but it is funny, and it doesn't really fit comfortably into any genre, so what the heck, call it a comedy and enjoy it.
0385720920|2.0|This book had a lot of strange things going on but I thought the plot was boring and didn't really go anywhere. It was not a fun or exciting read.
B000002L9O|4.0|I held off purchasing this CD based on the mixed reviews I found, figuring the best cuts were already on the anthologies [6 of the 12 tracks are included in the Weird Tales compilation). But the cheap price eventually go me. This is a very good disk - and pretty varied as well. You've got 4 hard core tracks [including two great songs IMO - Animal Boy and Freak of Nature], a couple of excellent fast-paced classic style Ramones tunes with Dee Dee vocals [Love Kills and Crummy Stuff], a couple of mid-paced classics included for years in the live shows [Somebody Put Something in My Drink and My Brain is Hanging Upside Down] and a really good Joey ballad [Something to Believe In]. The remaining three tracks are pretty forgetable [particularly the idiotic Apeman Hop and the sappy She Belongs to Me]. This is the oldest Ramones album not to have been re-issued with bonus material; so maybe a re-issue will eventually come. But if you can pick this up for $10 or so, it's well worth it.
B0010X745K|1.0|This movie was such a waste of my time and I feel as though I wasted 126 minutes of my life on this crap.  It was just so horrible.  I dont even know why it was bad but it was just bad.  This is just my opinion but if you like sci fi movies with giant bugs that for some reason were able to come and live in our world because some military men opened a portal, then be my guest. This movie made no sense and then all of a sudden it ends with the military that dissapeared coming back to kill the bugs/monsters.  They manage to come back righ after the main guy shoots his son and friends, what a great movie.  It was horrible, dont bother.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Great movie. Highly recommended for any fan of the previous ones and action movies in general
B0015519VS|3.0|I was very excited as I awaited Usher's new debut; I'm one of those Usher fans who would go out and buy the CD before I heard it because, hey it's USHER RIGHT????  I'd heard a few leaked tracks that sounded really good. But I'm sad to admit that I was a bit disappointed with this project.  The songs I really hoped would be on there (like \\"Dat Girl\\" and \\"Echo\\") weren't on there. The dance tracks I was hoping for were replaced by Power ballads and passive mid-tempos.  Overall, I think its just \\"ok\\"... I mean it IS Usher-- he doesn't do BAD work...but its just disappointing to me that it lacks the up-tempo energy I usually look forward to on his projects. If I had to rate it I'd probably give it a 3 out of 5 for quality of the material but a 2 out of 5 for personal satisfaction with the cd. I have to listen to it again to be sure though...but all I know is on the first TWO run throughs I was left hungry, hoping for a better main course to be on the way ....  The only songs that really moved me were TRADING PLACES & MOVING MOUNTAINS because they seem closer to old Usher. BEFORE I MET YOU is another one I like but it's more new school Usher I think.  I WILL give him this though-- his subject material is always really good; I think he talks about some very mature and close to home topics, HOWEVER, I think either there isn't enough balance between dance tracks/ sexy tracks & ballads -OR- the production/ arrangement on this album just doesn't showcase the subjects well enough.
1878424505|5.0|As an organizational psychology professional, this book has been a very critical piece of my success.  I used it in graduate school and it opened my eyes to a whole new way of viewing my interactions and conversations with people.  I have always felt that I was good with people, but this book helped me to understand that it's not all about me, but it could be about something another person is dealing with, at the time we interact. It was definitely a huge eye opener for me in working in the corporate sector, and I would highly recommend it for anyone to read!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is a fantastic package.  All the movies and extras on 9 discs in a nice little box.  The price was perfect and I got free shipping to boot.  I suggested this to two of my friends and they bought it as well.
0765316889|3.0|I just received the hardcover version of WOA and am very irritated at TOR books. They apparently saved some money by using the smallest possible font size they could get away with - making the book 500ish pages long rather then 700ish?  They also apparently saved on ink. The text is a medium to light brown in color with poor contrast offwhitish paper. I do use reading glasses on some books and on some I do not. Even with reading glasses, it was a chore to read this book, and required me to get the strongest possible reading light to do so.       For those of you who have never considered this sort of thing, at random , in your home library, pick up several books, open them to any page and read a line. then compare the books. It will emphasize what I'm saying and point out again, the publisher's who are 'cheating' us.
B0007Y08QA|2.0|\\"The Machinist\\" is a movie that is so enthralled and impressed with itself that it refuses to let go of its convoluted story. Trevor, a man who has not slept in 1 year, is both physically and mentally suffering from the aforementioned sleep depravation. His work, personal life, body and mind suffer from his insomnia, if we can call it that. Strange things begin to happen, he sees people unseen by anyone else and the viewer, along with Trevor, is taken along in this psychological thriller with more twists and turns than a python asphyxiating its prey. And that is exactly how you feel, asphyxiated and unwilling to follow the convoluted story line. The movie is unwilling to let go and becomes more entrenched in itself pulling more and more twists from the void that is this man's life.<br /><br />I did not like this movie, but I did like Bale's performance. It was excellent, and to see the extent to which he had starved himself for this role, makes the movie all the more exceptional and gut wrenching. I usually like Aitana Sanchez Gij&oacute;n, but in this movie, the dialogue between Bale and her character was pretty bad and this is not one of her best performances. The movie ends with one heck of a twist, I am still not sure if it is worth sitting through the entire movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you're at all familiar with Jillian Michaels, you know she has a reputation for kicking butt, and this DVD is no exception.  I've been doing Jillian's online circuit training for about six months and expected to be able to start with Level 2...not so much.  This is tough!  As she says on the DVD, if you want a good workout in 20 minutes, you can't mess around, you can't take breaks.  You have to give 110 percent the whole 20 minutes.    This is a great circuit-training workout, particularly if you're pressed for time.  You get strength training, cardio and abs in one package, and it definitely works you.  It's quick and doesn't take up a huge portion of your day, but there is amazing \\"bang for the buck\\".    If you're a complete beginner, I would recommend that you either (a) start with something else (lol); or (b) go into this not expecting to be able to complete the whole Level 1 workout.  It's enough to do as much as you can and let yourself build up to completing the whole thing.  I'd also recommend starting with very light weights.  If you're intermediate, you can probably handle Level 1, maybe without modifications. (There are easier modifications shown for some of the exercises.)  If you've been working out for a while but aren't used to circuit training, I still recommend starting with Level 1 to get the hang of it.  You can always move up.    I firmly believe that there really is no better way of getting fit, strong, and healthy than circuit training, and I love this DVD.  Yeah, it's hard.  There's no way around that.  But it works BECAUSE it's hard.  So if you want something to gently ease you into an exercise program, don't buy this!  But if you're ready to get serious and make a major difference in your body, I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD - or any of Jillian's others, for that matter.

078322933X|5.0|Summary: There's a real life serial rapist named David Wayne McCall (strangely)        I thought this movie was an excellent and very realistic production! Not only is it realistic, but it reaches into the mind of the psycho, which I thoroughly enjoyed.        This David McCall character strangely resembles a real life counterpart: David Wayne McCall.        There's a real life convicted serial rapist named David W. McCall, who was convicted as a juvenile in South Bend/Notre Dame, IN Indiana, in St. Joseph County: David Wayne McCall was convicted at age 15 for serially and violently raping several St. Mary's College Students in the late 1970's.        McCall is accused of multiple additional rape cases in Plano, Dallas, & Irving Texas, and is still suspected of a rape / murder case in Indiana where he allegedly murdered CAROLYN SCHINKE. I knew him in grade and middle school at Clay Middle School and Clay high school where he was an award winning wrestler trained by (Wrestling Coach Glen Nelson) and he [Mccall] always seemed quite violent. I can't speak on McCall's overall guilt except for his juvenile record: but I amazed he's on the loose after so many known crimes: kidnapping, sexual assault, possibly murder... he's known to especially stalk female joggers! So, beware Texas! You don't want this guy loose and in your backyard.     [...]
B0000A9GLS|4.0|Identity brings to the screen a group of people converging on a motel in the middle of nowhere during a terrible storm. When the first bodies appear they soon realize that they are not all what they seem to be...  There are slight hints of Clue and Agatha Christie with a touch of the X-Files so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.   John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Ray Liota, and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well (the young couple was not all that exciting).   The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.  In short, Identity is a movie worth watching if you are in the mood for a decent thriller as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  4 Stars
B0011HOEY4|3.0|American Gangster arrived on my doorstep back at the very beginning of March. So here I am approximately 3 months later finally writing my silly little review about it. Why? Why did it take me 3 months to get to a movie that was by some so highly praised?<br /><br />Why did I view movies like [[ASIN:B0015XHP2W Rambo]] which was good, [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]] which was good, and [[ASIN:B00147F8Z0 Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem]] which was bad the day they arrived at my house from Amazon, only to wait 90 days to watch American Gangster? NO, not because I'm adolescent minded! It's the time....Almost 3 hours for the Unrated/Extended Edition of American Gangster required some time-dedication.<br /><br />Look, Ridley Scott is a great director, but sometimes I think Hollywood can get a little self-indulgent with the time they take to tell a story. I mean too many movies these days are well over 2 hours. There better be something really compelling to get people to sit for 3 hours, and as I suspected, Amercan Gangster was good, but it didn't need to be 3 hours long.<br /><br />The story in American Gangster was simple enough: it depicted the life a Frank Lucas played by the always fun to watch Denzel Washington from his rise to power to his inevitable fall. And I say \\"depicted\\" as opposed to \\"documented\\" because there are disputes as to whether Lucas was actually \\"the boss\\" of the Blue Magic empire or if it was really Zach Walker (according to gangster Bumpy Johnson's widow) or if it was really gangster Nicky Barnes (according to some NY area Bronx locals). Walker didn't even get a mention in American Gangster and Barnes (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) had only a brief appearance.<br /><br />The action in American Gangster was few and far between, but the story was very well told. However, most of the movie was forgettable. I already remember less about American Gangster than I do about Rambo or Cloverfield. As for Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem?....Let's just say that it would be nice if Ridley Scott got back into the Alien franchise and revived what the last two Alien/Predator directors killed.got back into the Alien franchise and revived what the last two Alien/Predator directors killed.

0937381888|5.0|Wow, what a book!    Having grown up attached to the internet, I'm always skeptical of the need for most books.  If you can find it on the web, why would you need/want to pay for a book?    However, this book has answered all of the lingering questions that I had regarding homebrewing.  The internet covered some of the basics, but much of the detailed explanations for each and every process can't be easily found on the web.  This book covers everything from the most basic hopped extract brewing all the way up to complex mashing techniques.  It covers partial boils and their effect on the finished product, late extract additions, and why you add the hops that you add.    If you're technically savvy, this is a great book for you.  There are tons of technical explanations to show you exactly what is going on at each step of the process.  If you're not interested in those sections, they can be skipped without losing the overall picture.    And note:  There is a glossary in the back.  Use it.    Fantastic book.  It's pushed me to see the limitations of partial boils in these times of scarce hops.  I'm holding off on my next batch until I can get the required equipment to do some all-grain brewing.
0765342294|5.0|This book was by far the greatest book I have ever read! I would encourage anyone that enjoys books to pick this up and read it. Even if you don't enjoy reading, I am sure this book will grasp you!<br /><br />You watch as Ender goes to battle school and fight for the I.F. against an enemy known as the \\"buggers\\". It sounds cliche, but then you realize this book was written in 1985 and realize all of the other books/movies/games were developed from this book! A movie is supposedly in the process of being made and even a small downloadable game for Xbox 360 or PS3.<br /><br />Everyone I see I tell them about this outstanding book. I will continue to praise O.S.Card for his outstanding title. And to think, he thought up \\"E-mail\\" back then and used it in this book. Its crazy to think, but maybe he influenced our E-mail system to be what it is today!<br /><br />10 out of 5!
0060989157|5.0|I have been a Motley fan since shout at the Devil.  I used to borrow my brothers album and listen it to it non-stop.  I have heard great things about this book, but never bought it until now.<br /><br />Great Read, Fast Furious, eye opening, everything you could ever want from a Rock n Roll Band.  Even if you aren't a motley fan, go ahead and pick this up, you will NOT be able to put it down!
B00005JPNY|2.0|Good message, poorly done.  I didn't see how the story was anti god at all.  I'm pretty sure the book is about choice.  It basically all goes back to eve and the apple if you make it through all three books.  -Original sin and all that.  But I'm quite sure it's just to make you think, not to bash your own way of thinking unless you want to bash how others think for themselves.  The book conveys this quite well, while the movie just doesn't flow properly and seems to lack any real personality.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Ive gotten a couple of movies on here and this by far has got to be the best gay themed movie i have boughten. The coming out story was exceptionally directed and the story line is great not to mention the astounding actors. i would recommend that everyone buy this movie.

B0002ZDVEU|1.0|I was disappointed to find at least one<br />scene missing from the DVD. The scene<br />after Bourne kills the other Treadstone<br />agent. I keep thinking that there are<br />other scenes missing.<br /><br />Correction: I have since found the scene<br />that I thought was missing. I<br />apologize for misleading anyone. The<br />rest of the review is still true today.<br /><br />Others have listed the problems of the<br />shaky cameras and too close close-ups.<br />I wish to say I agree with their comments.<br /><br />Part of the enjoyment of watching the<br />Bourne Identity was the relationship<br />between Matt Damon and Franka Potente.<br />Since they killed her off in the beginning,<br />they might have brought in someone else<br />for Damon to relate to.<br /><br />Since there are more Bourne sequels in<br />the making, I hope someone is reading the<br />criticisms listed here and elsewhere and<br />tries to correct the problems.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Very well done. It shows what a \\"monster attacking the city\\" plotline would be like from the point of view of average people on the street in stead of how this type of movie is usually done...from the point of view of a general or president or whoever. My only complaint would be the action all being shot on a handheld camera, the motion started to give me a headache at a couple points, but not bad enough to count against the film. Overall one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|I can't add much to the collection of reviews here, though I must recommend that the serious sci-fi movie fan actually read through them, they're entertaining themselves.  I loved the original in the theaters, I do like this newest version with the narration edited out, and the inconsistent happy ending edited out, but still, it's impossible to relive the wonderful experience of seeing the first run of Bladerunner back then, for many reasons.  But at the same time, there's no real fair comparison between this movie, and the thought provoking, prescient, brilliant literary quality novels of Phillip K. Dick, and \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" was one of his best.  A big hole in the logic of the movie should have been, given a future with an overpopulation and urban poverty problem, why would big, powerful, monopolistic corporations need to invest time, money, and other expenses into android technology?  People in such a future, indeed, in our present, are available to be the proverbial cannon fodder, and so would not have to \\"see what\\" Rutger Hauer's character saw with his genetically engineered synthetic eyes.  In the novel, the future human and animal populations were decimated by postindustrial pollution, warfare, and enviromental irresponsibility (and remember, Phillip K. Dick was writing a generation ago!).  So lonely, depopulated humans invented talking doors, ovens, and so forth, and artificial animals for those who couldn't afford real ones.  Artificial humans a logical outcome of such a future.  Now the movie worked so well visually, and the story line was so consistent with the older established film-noire detective genre, that this big difference with the book isn't a fatal flaw in the movie, but I give you all this background to note a real hypocrisy in the artistic differences between the director and the studio that resulted in these different movie versions.  In an interview on NPR, the director, the very same director still miffed that the studio changed his ideas for the first run of the movie, laughs off the interviewers question about how irritated Phillip K. Dick was with Bladerunner veering so far from the original important fundmental premises and situations laid out in the novel.  Ridley Scott than candidly admits that he \\"never actually read the book,\\" because he didn't have the attention span for it!  The NPR interviewer responds by stating that she can understand why the author might not have liked the movie then.o changed his ideas for the first run of the movie, laughs off the interviewers question about how irritated Phillip K.

0743290119|1.0|That's it for me and Lauren Weisberger. The last book was awful and this one is too. I only liked her first novel. I could only get through about 60 pages of this, I really tried. The writing is all over the place (doesn't flow nice) and the characters are such carbon copies of other chick lit. I love chick lit and I think having characters like these can still work but for this book it just didn't. I'm glad I got it from the library.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I must be honest, I use to hate Pearl Jam. Not due to their musicianship, but because I was a cliche' Nirvana loyalist. Broadening my music acceptance over the many years since than I can only say, bummer... man did I miss out.<br /><br />Listening to the self entitled \\"Pearl Jam\\" album was a fresh well needed self realization, that bands out of their glory days can come back with full throttle. From the garage rocking \\"Life Wasted\\" to the long 7 minute soft rocking \\"Inside Job\\" this albums contains some of the best music of its genre. With short hard rocking gems \\"Comatose\\" and the ever progressing intro to \\"Severed Hand\\", you obtain a wide scale of rock music varying in degrees but non the less great and interesting. Classic really holding out the right notes at the right time vocally driven songs<br />like \\"Unemployable\\" grab you intently.<br /><br />My pick off the album is \\"Parachutes\\" the marriage of vocals and melody is  as cohering as ones ability to read a stop sign. Bumping acoustics climbing up pitches and than smoothly descending caught with a rhythmical  electric guitar dotting the middle, simply amazing!<br /><br />What may sound like filler at first run through the album is the more artistic songs trying to bud in the presence of radio worthy songs. Overall Pearl Jams 2006 release is a note worthy album, and possibly a come back of the Pearl Jam of the 90's as oppose to some of their bogged down release previously before this one. Do yourself a favor, grab a copy<br /> and relax.
B000GBEWHA|2.0|OK, fun songs, cute acting, generally a good time. But has anyone noticed that the moral of this story seems to say that you should change yourself into something you're not in order to please someone else? Not sure that's a message I'd want my kids to hear.<br /><br />J.W.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|A wonderful show! I love this show but the one flaw is the character Deb, Dexter's sister. The actress who plays deb has NO TALENT and is whiny and annoying! she is so  stupid! i cannot understand why the lieutenant cannot figure out that dexter is the one solving his sister's casses! she is a bitch! too bossy and extremely selfish! I still have to watch 2 more episodes and i wish that the ice truck killer will kill deb! can't bear to see her in seasons 2 and beyond! julie benz is a wonderful and gifted actress! i had loved her in ANGEL when she played darla.
B00027JYLC|5.0|`Freaks' is one of those movies that just has to be seen, by everyone.  It is classified as a horror film but to me it is much more than that.  Much like the beautifully written (and adapted) `Of Mice and Men', `Freaks' broaches the horrors of mistreating and misjudging others based on their physical limitations.  There is no reason to simply cast this film aside as nothing more than a `scary movie' for `Freaks' is far too important a film to be typecast in such a way.<br /><br />Like the prologue explains, there was a time when ones with such drastic physical and mental deficiencies were cast aside as unworthy and left to die.  Those that survived were more often than not taking in as sideshow freaks and paraded about for the amusement of the `normal' people (much like `The Elephant Man').  Thus begins `Freaks'; a story about a group of these sideshow freaks who have simply had enough of being walked all over.  When Hans falls in love with the beautiful Cleopatra, a normal trapeze acrobat, the rest of Hans' friends and fellow freaks (including his one-time fianc&eacute;e Frieda) smell something wrong.  It so turns out that Cleopatra is using Hans for his good nature and money and that she plans to marry him and poison him in order to take his money and run off the Hercules.  When the freaks get word of this they take matters into their own hands to save Hans from his new wife's evil plan.<br /><br />It's obvious that we as the viewer are supposed to sympathize with the `freaks', for they are painted as the more normal of the lot exposed here.  Questions about our idea of real beauty and worth arise as we are able to examine our own vanity.  Even Hans is subject to his depiction of love and admiration for he leaves his wonderfully supportive and obviously infatuated fianc&eacute;e Frieda for the beautiful Cleopatra who herself exhibits no real likable or desirable qualities other than her surface beauty.<br /><br />Us `normal' humans (if that's your standard of normal) are given varying degrees of tolerance to examine within the close nit community.  You have Cleopatra and Hercules who are disgusted by and fancy using those different from them.  You have Venus who does not dislike or desire to abuse the freaks but is obviously not as comfortable around them as some (just watch her facial expressions in certain scenes); and then you have Phroso (as well as Madame Tetrallini) who defend the `freaks' and consider them equals.<br /><br />The question is; who are you?<br /><br />I actually found the acting within `Freaks' to be quite good, especially on the part of Wallace Ford and the Earles' siblings (Harry and Daisy Earles play Hans and Frieda).  I really enjoyed Daisy's performance, for it added so much genuine warmth and concern for her lover Hans.  She just wants him to be happy and you really believe that.<br /><br />As far as the `horror' aspect of this film is concerned, it really isn't all that horrifying in the sense that it isn't truly scary.  The fact does remain that these human beings are scary looking (I know that sounds mean but it is a fact) and that alone may send some shivers down your spine; especially when they start chanting \\"one of us\\" or when they are crawling towards you with knives in hand; but truthfully `Freaks' is horrifying in that it exposes a common thread of thought that is found in many people today, a line of thinking that is not only hurtful but, as we've seen here, very dangerous.al) are given varying degrees of tolerance to examine within the close nit community.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Gilmore girls is always awesome. Fast and creative dialogues, funny situations... It's a life - I think - we all would like to share; it would be wonderful to know Lorelai, to live in Stars Hollow... Not to mention, it's an extremely girlie show in my opinion. It's very easy for us to feel and understand the situations presented. This particular season only made me sad because it was the last, but I was really touched. Big emotions in this season!
B00005JPS7|3.0|I was never actually a fan of Iron Man since he was affiliated with The Avengers and I was wild for the X-Men.  However, from time to time, I did pick up random issues of Iron Man.  So, of course, just like I did with *Fantastic Four*, I had to check out this film.<br /><br />I was actually disappointed in *Iron Man*, giving it a grade of C.<br /><br />Tony Stark heads out to the Middle East to demonstrate his newest weapons.  However, he's kidnapped and ordered to develop a new weapon for the terrorists.  Stark and a fellow prisoner develop a weapon but specifically designed for Stark to escape from the terrorists.<br /><br />After escaping, Stark puts all of his efforts to perfecting his armored suit.  When done, Stark, as Iron Man, returns to the Middle East to tie up loose ends.  However, it's not over for Iron Man as he soon discovers that there's someone within his company that is out to destroy him.<br /><br />*Iron Man* spent too much time on the terrorist angle and on Stark's perfecting work on the armored suit.  So, we get to see little action and abilities of Iron Man.  I do get it that this is the first movie and it takes time to develop the story of how Iron Man came to be.  However, if you spend too much time on the background, you risk losing your viewers' interest.  I went with friends, which we are diehard Marvel fans, but found ourselves fidgeting with boredom within minutes and suffered til the end.<br /><br />Again, was disappointed with *Iron Man*.  Sure do hope that the sequel(s) will be way better as seen in the *Fantastic Four* movies.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Looking at Amazon's reviews, I think I've seen some crossover between a few versions of the Criterion Collection versions of this movie, so I'll cover the two most well-known together. The movie itself is beyond words in terms of everything from camerawork, to story, to lasting impact- it's not if you should buy this film, but what version to get.<br /><br />The 2-disc version seen elsewhere: I originally got this version via Netflix, and it contains the film on a good but not earth-shattering quality, on one disc. The second is special features. Michael Jeck's commentary is included, and personally, I think it is *the* definitive commentary. Whether you're a film student or not, Jeck's commentary gives you the deepest possible insight into the director and his control of the film, down to nearly frame-by-frame analysis of the more complex shots. Jeck will make you want to view certain parts of the film in slow motion, and if you do, you're rewarded with extra detail that will completely amaze you.<br /><br />The 3-disc version I'm reviewing now: Remember the above part about an earth-shattering quality? We have that here. The 3-disc version contains a completely superior picture and sound quality that will blow you away. This does split the movie onto two discs, but the original was made with an intermission anyway, so this is certainly acceptable. You also get not only Jeck's commentary, but even an extra commentary, as well as an art book and some extra features. This version is worth purchasing for the superior movie quality alone, but the extra materials make the transition even sweeter.<br /><br />Get this movie now, if you don't have it already. When you do, get the 3-disc Criterion version. Even if you have the 2-disc version, you owe it to yourself to upgrade today and appreciate this film to the maximum.

1932100660|3.0|I breastfed my daughter (who has type 1 diabetes) from birth to age 2 (yes, TWO) and she was VEGAN, eating ONLY ORGANIC food until she was about 10, so the author's unfounded and unproved and just plain WRONG idea that cow's milk causes type-1 diabetes makes the entire book worthless to me.  Sure, we all know by now that diet is important to health, but people who assume they know it all is a sure sign that I want nothing to do with it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams: deeply principaled, no-nonsence, ornery, lawful good, brilliant, fallible, passionate founder of our country.  This is the story of the unbridled defiance, the shrewd intellect, and the angry pounding fist that tore the American colonies from British rule and gave birth to one of the greatest experiments in the history of the world - the United States of America.  Stunning and haunting, this is John Adams like you've never seen him.  Myth and poetry have been stripped away to reveal the far-more-fascinating, truly-human story of one of the greatest men who has ever lived.    Giamatti is simply brilliant as Adams.  If he doesn't win the Emmy for this, I may declare my own independance from the \\"dark tyranny\\" of the ATAS.  Linney is equally wonderful in her portrayal as the groundingly sapient Abigail.  Their love story is one of the greatest in American history, and it's been marvelously recaptured here.    If it's even possible to have \\"spoilers\\" for a factual historical drama, then the following might qualify, but if you want to see what each eposide covers, here's my stab at it:    Episode 1: Join or Die.  Begins with the Boston Massacre, and covers the period leading up to Adams departure for Philidelphia to represent Massachusettes in the First Continental Congress.    Episode 2: Independance.  Covers the First Continental Congress, the beginning of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord, the nomination of GW (by Adams) to serve as general of the new Continental Army, the Second Continental Congress, and Adams collaboration with Jefferson and Franklin to bring forth the Declaration of Independance.    Episode 3: Don't Tread on Me.  Covers the journey of Adams and Franklin to France to secure support against the British, Adam's tone-deaf approach to French diplomacy, his painful separation from Abigail, his dispatch to Holland (where his approach is somewhat better receive), and a terrible illness that befalls him.    Episode 4: Reunion.  Covers the defeat of the British forces, Adam's return to Paris and reunion with Abigail, his appointment to represent the new nation to the English crown, his frustrating absence from the Constitutional Convention, his return to America, and his election as Vice President.    Episode 5: Unite or Die.  Covers Adam's Vice Presidency under George Washington, the ongoing British and French conflict, his strained relationship with Jefferson over their very different ideas about how the new nation should be governed, and his narrow victory over Jefferson to become the second President.    Episode 6: Unnecessary War.  Covers Adam's uneasy presidency, including the retention of Washington's cabinet, largely controlled by Hamilton (mistake #1), the imfamous Alien and Sedition Acts (mistake #2), his arrival at the White House in the new capital of Washington (both still under construction), his estragement from his son Charles, the XYZ affair, his successful prevention of war with France, his loss of the Presidency to Jefferson, and his somber return to Massachusettes.    Episode 7: Peacefield.  Covers Adam's post-presidency, including the death of daugher Nabby, followed by Abigail, his reconciliation with Jefferson, the election of John Quincy as President, his long and introspective reflections on his life and legacy, and his death on the same day as Jefferson - the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration which they masterminded together.    I hope you enjoy this rare masterpiece as much as I did.  I watched every episode as they aired, and plan to watch them all again as soon as the DVD is available.  This is television at its finest, and I give it my highest recommendation.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Every Indy film that I can remember, in spite of its silly action-movie crust, had some kind of meaty, emotional heart.  The religious idolatry of [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]], the enslavement of children in [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 the Temple of Doom]], the father-son dynamics of [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 the Last Crusade]].  Sure, the films were mostly about watching this sexy archeologist/professor risk his neck for posterity's sake, they chewed up the outer edges of believability with centuries-old booby traps and supernatural relics, they hammed it up with dialogue as chewy as Bazooka Joe.  They were, in a word, fluffy fun.<br /><br />But, even as they packed a wallop with their exuberance, they also made sure to tone down at the right times and to add a little soul.  Even the hotly contested TEMPLE OF DOOM, well, say what you will about its darkness, I always got a rush when those kids broke their shackles and ran free.<br /><br />I'd tell you what CRYSTAL SKULL wants its emotional backbone to be, but that would require a spoiler alert.  Let's just say that it's not hard to guess, especially when Shia LeBouf sticks his well-manicured coif into the screen and starts muttering about his poor, kidnapped mother.<br /><br />Harrison Ford seems to be enjoying himself, in spite of a script that eschews plausibility more than any other Indy film, yet.  (They don't even try, at some points, to keep the pieces together.  For instance, the circumstances surrounding Indiana's recovery of the crystal skull make absolutely no sense whatsoever, and that's big news for a movie that has a man withstand a nuclear blast from inside of a Fridgedaire.)  LeBouf's character is mostly annoying, if not grudgingly necessary.<br /><br />It's got the sort of blockbuster energy that will keep the seats filled.  And all of the Indy elements are there: a horde of nasty critters, that red line criss-crossing a map, Jones losing and regaining his hat, and even helpful monkeys.  I guess the real test would be to imagine this film coming out before any of the others and then asking if it would've inspired the same kind of hunger that RAIDERS did.<br /><br />Not likely.  Jones may look old, but he's as wry and competent as ever.  Give him a whip and a goal and he'll give you a ride, that's not in doubt.  He's still got the muscle and the wit.  Maybe what's missing is the heart.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.  That was torn out in THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  No wonder so many people hate that film.film coming out before any of the others and then asking if it would've inspired the same kind of hunger that RAIDERS did.    Not likely.

B0013FBS20|5.0|I normally don't like undead/zombie/virus movies and was skeptical about this movie, but after I saw it in theatres, I loved it.  I bought the blu-ray as soon as it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I love that there is a glimmer of possibility with the storyline, that it could happen to us one day if we are not careful.  This is a great movie to watch over again and to analyze the different parts.  I couldn't stop talking about it for weeks!
B00005JPNZ|4.0|My son and I went to see the the new Indiana Jones flick, and we both agreed that it was a fun film, and a good way for the series to end (if ending it indeed is).<br /><br />The real stars of the movie were Harrison Ford, who I think excels his other Indiana Jones performances here, Shia LeBeouf, who achieved a really good mix of adolescent tough-guyness and adolescent insecurity in the character Mutt (altho I can't quite see LeBeouf as the next Indiana Jones; he's just too baby-faced), and the Special Effects, which are really breath-taking (especially in the grand finale scene).  John Hurt has such a minimal role that his fantastic acting talent never gets a chance to get going, but Jim Broadbent, with an even smaller role, is brilliant.  Cate Blanchett vamps it well as a female Boris Badinoff.  The only real disappointment is Karen Allen's wooden performance (but in all honesty, it was her spunkiness rather than her acting ability that made her memorable in her previous Indiana Jones).  Most of her time is spent either shrieking at Indiana or swooning in lovestruck hero-worship.<br /><br />One of the cleverest aspects of the film involves the give-and-take barbs that Indie and the young Mutt trade:  a battle between youthful vigor and slower but wiser experience.  Mutt digs Indie about his age--\\"what are you,\\" he asks at one point--\\"about eighty?!\\"--and Indie digs at Mutt because of his fear of nondangeous but scary scorpions.  They make a good team.<br /><br />I was glad to see Harrison Ford end his Indiana Jones career in this way.  It's a very respectacle way to make an exit.
B00006I53S|5.0|This is my default walk-around lens on my 40D.  The focal length range (28-135) spreads between \\"normal\\" (as your eye sees it, approximately) to a pretty decent mid-range telephoto (on a \\"cropped sensor\\" camera; on a 5D the range would be from mild wide-angle to low telephoto).<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><br />1.  The IS is single-mode.  There is no \\"panning\\" IS mode, which I often find useful on my 70-300.<br />2.  The max aperture is \\"consumer-level\\", ranging from 3.5 at 28mm to 5.6 at 135.  I often really feel it at the telephoto end, having to go to a higher ISO sensitivity just to get the shot.<br />3.  IS may not be incredibly useful at the wide end.<br />4.  Relatively heavy (although not compared to the L lens you would get to \\"fix\\" any of the other downsides here!)<br /><br />Upsides:<br /><br />1.  Very sharp, crystal-clear pictures at every zoom, even fully \\"wide open\\" (at max aperture).<br />2.  Smooth, fast, accurate focusing.<br /><br />Overall, a solid, go-to lens.  When going out on a hike, this is the one I'm most likely to grab from my lens bag (unless I'm wanting to go ultra-light with the 50mm 1.8).  I generally don't use it for sports photography, as the tight end of the zoom just isn't tight enough (and I can get a wider aperture at 135 from my 70-300).  Inside, it's a good lens for wider-than-50 (equivalent to 80mm on my sensor) shots, substituting IS stability for larger aperture.  The downside as an indoor lens is that the IS only stabilizes my hand, not the subjects, and doesn't de-focus the background like a large-aperture lens can.<br /><br />IS system works well.  I find myself able to hand-hold shots quite often where without IS I would have ended up with nothing but blurs.

When the film opens, we see Kate (Ryan) in a plane trying to make herself comfortable.  In the middle of takeoff, she loses it and tears what turns out to be a plane simulator apart.  She returns home to tell her fiancee Charlie (Timothy Hutton) he's going to have to go to the medical conference in Paris without her. They part with plans to buy a home together from the nest egg Kate has built up.  She gets the word a few days later, via phone that Charlie's fallen in love with a French goddess and he's going to get married before he returns.    So, Kate gathers her courage and actually takes that plane to Paris to get back her man.  Her seatmate on the flight is Luc (Kline) a handsome Frenchman who unbeknowst to her swindles a grape plant and a diamond necklace in her luggage.  He offers her a ride to Paris from the airport believing that he can recover the goods from her. When they separate and Kate's baggage gets stolen, Luc helps her retrieve it, but he realizes he doesn't have the diamond necklace so he has to chase her across France to get it...    Writing it, the story sounds a lot better than what I sat through.  The humor just wasn't there for me--both Kate and Luc had 'problems' they had to overcome during their trip.  Both of those problems felt more like too much information than anything interesting.  None of the characters actually 'clicked' to me.  While the plot was enough to keep me watching, it wasn't enough to make me actually 'like' the film. I guessed the mystery and was just waiting to be proven right. The soundtrack, sadly, was so many of the same old songs I hear on almost every American made French movie.      If you love French films, any of the principal actors, romance--you may like this film. I just considered it 'lite' on all of the elements that should have been present.    Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
0743290119|4.0|I think people are being a little harsh in their reviews. This is light reading people. Geez. It was definitely enjoyable for me. I thought the characters were interesting and I liked seeing how they changed over the year in which the novel took place. Otis was definitely a riot to read about. This is much better than her last book. That one was painful but this is worth a read.
B0000024ZT|4.0|When I first heard Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I was totally blown away.  If there'd been an Amazon, I'd have given the CD 5 stars for sure.  The sound was different, rougher, a jazzier and more understandable Dylan.      In retrospect, this is not Bruce's best work, but it's still really good stuff.  \\"Growin' Up\\", \\"Blinded by the Light,\\" \\"Spirit in the Night\\", and \\"The Angel\\" still stand up as some of his best.      I think if you're going to get Bruce, you need to have everything.  Every CD has meaning for a time in his life and you can trace his history as well as the history of this country in his lyrics.  He's one musician whose work I have loved from beginning to now and probably will continue to love throughout our lives.  I can mark a lot of occasions by the Boss playing in the background.

B000GUJYRE|5.0|I love this set!  I am new to classical music, but knew I wanted to purchase a Beethoven symphonies set. I am a bit particular about the orchestra -some seemed rather lack-luster.  The London Symphony is one of the best I have heard - there seems to be a depth other orchestras lack.  The price for this set was great as well.  I should add that there are many sets out there, but (for some reason) you are not given clips to listen to with many.  Spending this much prompted me not to take a chance, so I purchased the best I could hear, and I am pleased with my choice.
B00005S6K8|4.0|Sabrina (Julia Ormond) has lived her life above the wealthy Larrabee garage all her life, watching the fabulous parties, dreaming of the youngest son, David (Greg Kinnear). When the poor chauffeur's daughter gets a chance to go away to Paris to work on \\"Vogue\\" magazine, she comes back transformed.     Meanwhile, David's engaged now to a young doctor, Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly) whose family is also an excellent match for the Larrabees. The Tyson family owns a patent that eldest son Linus (Harrison Ford) needs for his multi-billion dollar business.  He's working to merge their two companies together.     When David sees Sabrina, his typical short attention span kicks in, which wreaks havoc with the Tysons.  Linus steps in to divert David.  When he tries to romance Sabrina to get her away from David, Linus realizes the chauffeur's daughter could be the girl for him.    Probably only Sydney Pollack could direct a film that would come close to the original, which starred Humphrey Bogart as Linus and Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina.  The modernization of the story is fascinating.  Harrison Ford makes as good a Linus as Bogart.  Ormond is exquisite, but she doesn't quite live up to the luminous quality of Audrey Hepburn.  Nancy Marchand is the one actor who I think is better than the original Nella Walker.      It's worth seeing both stories just as an interest to see how the story has morphed from one generation to about the third.  You may want both if you love Cinderella stories.      Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B000Z6RH5A|5.0|I was looking to purchase the Talented Mr. Ripley and saw this double feature.  I think both movies are excellent and a great choice to put together.  Matt Damon stars in both movies and gives a fine performance.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes one or both of these films.
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce's rocker status is signed, sealed and delivered with this CD.  This is the hardest rocking he and the band have done.  If you read the backstory, you'll understand why--the band fought hard to record this music and I'm glad they won.       It's also some of the most painful music. There's a whole lot of anger here at a father, \\"Adam Raised a Cain,\\" at the working life, \\"Factory.\\"    \\"The Promised Land\\" and \\"Streets of Fire\\" offer a bit of hope, but it's thin and maybe won't happen--but what are people without dreams.  What stands out is the artist's humanity.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
0689505698|5.0|The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig, written by Eugene Trivizas and illustrated by the noted artist Helen Oxenbury, is a  version of The Three Little Pigs with reversed roles.  You probably know the story.  But Trivizas puts in some very cute spins, from the China teapot to the \\"He wasn't called a big, bad pig for nothing!\\" to the flower house.<br /><br />I read this to a group of children and adults, ranging in age from 3 to 70.  I could tell they enjoyed it, and the text is rich with opportunities to use vocal variety.<br /><br />Avoid stereotypes!  Read this book!
B00171NZE4|5.0|then check this out, unlike the person below me. I don't care about \\"extras, special features and s**t like that. I want to see and hear the band live on dvd, and this dvd really delivers the rich sound korn gives out(especially on the bassist side) if you want to see interviews and all the other behind the scenes stuff go on youtube.com. So go grab it, its worth the money. And to me(I like this better than the live on the otherside dvd) :)

B00005ATZT|5.0|The performances were brilliant, the pacing and direction were phenomenal.  I think this was the best film of its kind in the 90's.<br />I am amazed Andy Davis isn't one of the most in-demand directors in the industry frankly.
B00151HZME|5.0|Despite the popularity of \\"Graveyard Girl,\\" I found it to be one of the weaker tracks on the album. While still a nice fit for M83, other tracks such as \\"Couleurs,\\" \\"Skin of the Night,\\" and \\"We Own the Sky\\" remind us why we fell in love with M83 in the first place. Saturdays=Youth seems as if it was created on a warm, sunny day. I love sunny days too, but I can't wait until Gonzalez & Co. awake to thunderstorms again like they did with \\"Dead Cities,Red Seas, & Lost Ghosts\\" and \\"Before the Dawn Heals Us.    Still it is a brilliant album, and the only thing better than listening to Saturdays=Youth is listening to it live.
0060594896|5.0|I have really enjoyed The Success Principles by Jack Canfield.  He has put the keys to success into understandable, easy to implement forms.

B00003CXIP|2.0|I just sat down and watched this movie for the first time after hearing about it for as long as I can remember.  And I was less than impressed.<br /><br />The story follows the journey of four boys - Vern, Teddy, Chris, and Gordie (Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Wil Wheaton) as they transition from boy to man.  Or at least teen.  The summer before they start Jr. High, a boy their own age goes missing.  When Vern hears where the boy's body is, they set out to find it so they can become heroes.  While they journey, all four face fears, hopes, and disappointments whether it's the absence of parental love, a future career as a writer, or things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />To be honest, I can understand why people like this movie.  It has a good mix of drama and comedy.  The acting is great.  The film is set in a small town in the 50's, so there's the nostalgia factor.<br /><br />So why didn't I like it?  First and foremost, the language.  That was the real biggie.  It was one thing when Ace (Kiefer Sutherland), the leader of the local gang swore.  It was something completely different to have these twelve year olds swearing all the time.  And frankly, I have a hard time imagining kids swearing that much during the 50's.  I'm probably way out in left field, but it doesn't right true.  There are several gross out moments I didn't care for.  Finally, the ending was depressing.  I'll grant you it was realistic.  But it was depressing.<br /><br />I know lots of people who grew up watching this film and absolutely love it.  As I said, I can see it why.  And maybe if I had seen it when I was younger, I would like it now.  As it is, I won't be watching it again.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron's bleak yet surprisingly moving vision of the future features brilliant performances and equally brilliant action sequences.  Children of Men, freely adapted from the novel by P.D. James, stars Clive Owen as Theo: a one-time activist that is coerced to transport the last fertile woman on the planet to safety; all the while outside forces attempt to use her for their own means, and the world as a whole seems to crumble around them.  Cuaron's filming techniques are what make Children of Men so good, as his vision puts the viewer right in the middle of the chaotic action sequences that follow.  Owen is great, while brief turns from Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Chiwetel Ejifor are small miracles as well, and the lacings of political and social commentary that abound, along with a hopeful light at the end of the tunnel, all combine to make Children of Men a memorable and spectacular film.  All in all, if you've missed out on Children of Men, you are doing yourself a great disservice, and you should definitely give the film a much deserved look.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Horrible, horrible!  This adaptation would have been totally garbage had it not for Judy Dench.  Dench does deserve all five stars for her superb acting -though as her long standing fan I lament her decision to be involved in this production.      I think the older BBC version with Judy Parfitt is the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  The Collin Firth version would have been perfect with Judy Dench.      This latest Hollywood version is a bad use of US Dollar.

0312360266|3.0|I'll start off this review confessing that as a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight' Saga,  I was looking for more vampire fiction to sink my teeth into and came across 'House of Night' books recommended to me through Amazon.<br /><br />Trying to relate to a 16 year old heroine (I am 28) is not all that easy but Bella (from Twilight) was MUCH easier for me than Zoey (from HON).  Zoey is prone to unintelligent, off topic interior monologues... in a first person perspective book... UGH... No matter how hard I try I can't find an excuse in my mind for such a betrayal of the english language... On the exterior, Zoey has a lot of traits that normally I would like in a female lead. But I couldn't find myself liking the heroine purely because I couldn't STAND her unintelligent head-babble. I don't recall making up words like ginormos when I was 16, and if I did thank god I don't say it still today.<br /><br />The redeemable qualities of this book were the supporting characters, the villian is quite intriguing, I'd gotten a bad vibe from her from the start, so there was some good foreshadowing on that account, and I am intrigued with the vampire world that the Casts have created.  Despite the constant annoyance of the main characters interior monologue, I can overlook it for these parts and just read the book for the pure, rainy day enjoyment that it's meant to be and I'll probably go on to read the other books just because I'm curious and masochistic.  And for any potential future readers out there who are adults, just be aware of what you're getting yourself into with these books, light reading... and unintelligent, off topic interior monologuing...  You'd do MUCH better with the Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer.

B00005JPSM|4.0|If you enjoy romantic dramas I would say this is a pretty decent one. However, this is not a romantic comedy. Comedy means funny and it isn't funny very often. The main character or heroine, Kate, feels she is missing out on something in her life and her psychiatrist makes that abundently clear. When she loses her sister in a car accident she is left with a niece, Zoe, that is overwhelmed with her mothers death. The two try to cope with the loss. Meanwhile Kate is working as a top ten chef in a elegant New York restaurant. As she and her niece are working out their issues Kate takes some time off to spend with Zoe. When Kate returns she finds there is a new sous chef, Nick, that is hansom, funny (assumed as we see people laughing, but we never hear the jokes), and a pretty good chef that could be running his own kitchen. Kate sees this as a threat to her position and goes ballistic. Eventually she calms down and Nick and her relationship starts to blossom. My wife and I enjoyed it. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.
B00164KYS2|4.0|The Sex and the City movie was made for fans of the show, and it delivers on that very important front. While the movie is almost 2 1/2 hours long, it feels like an extended episode of the show, but it moves relatively quickly with the added bonus of a massive laugh track provided by other SATC fans, in case you happen to see it in packed theatre.<br /><br />I loved the show during its run, but did not like the person that that Carrie wound up with as they seemed all wrong for one another for my taste. I got over it as who she wound up with was less important the fun we had together. The same applies to this movie as the girls don't disappoint, and seeing them was like having the pleasure of seeing your best buds in the old neighborhood. Sometimes going back is a mistake, but not in this case as it does not detract from the memories and allows you to have the fun of going to a boozy class reunion.<br /><br />I can understand how some people can hated the show as one one hand it empowered women to live their lives without looking for the approval of men or playing second fiddle to them, but at the core it could be argued without needing to dig too deeply that our girls lived in an arrested development fog with better shoes, nicer apartments, and no parents to make you come home on time. My take is that both camps are right, but I like imperfect people, esp. when they are endearing and/or make me laugh.<br /><br />None of the leading ladies have gotten personality transplants, and the movie celebrates their friendship, the show, the shoes, the men, NYC, designer duds, and even getting older even if not necessarily wiser. Since it's been a few years since the show ended the movie pokes fun at some of the technological changes that have taken place since in the interim and that leads to some fun. The movie integrates some nice touches that fans will love via flashbacks and characters from the show.<br /><br />So if you are in the mood for frothy fun and enjoyed the show, this one's for you. If you were not a fan or found it merely tolerable there is nothing here that will up your enjoyment, and you might actually wind up feeling bitter for wanting to choke a couple of the characters, especially Carrie for seemingly not having grown a single brain cell since the series wrapped. I am purposely not giving away plot developments as you should discover those for yourself.<br /><br />The movie would have gotten a 5 from me if the plot had not been centered around Carrie's nuptials and a secret that one of the characters keeps from the others that just drags on. Also, with the exception the Miranda's husband Steve, the straight men in their lives are merely boring acccesories, while the gay ones are way too over the top cliches. Jennifer Hudson is introduced in a one-note role and she manages to bring some sweetness to her role as Carrie's assistant. I wish that the character had been a little edgier as she the film at times feels surprinsingly old fashioned.<br /><br />I mention the above less than stellar points only to highlight that this is not a movie about real relationships with the opposite sex, examples of how women should be, or aimed at anyone except those who love SATC. This is all about women celebrating their lasting connections with one another, changing outfits, laughing, and being there for one another and their fans.ere not a fan or found it merely tolerable there is nothing here that will up your enjoyment, and you might actually wind up feeling bitter for wanting to choke a couple of the characters, especially Carrie for seemingly not having grown a single brain cell since the series wrapped.

B00005JPFH|4.0|I've always been a Marvel fan; of both the comic books and the tv shows.   The movie series don't really act nearly the same as the actual old classics but I guess you have to let things go when it comes to those fetches.    This movie of course goes with the previous movies Spiderman 1 and Spiderman 2. You can't see one without the other. I saw this one in the movies, and as such as being a major fan this deal seemed like a good price.    Going on. The service recieved from -willdvds- was quite exceptional (??). The Two-Disc Special Edition is sold in stores for about $35. (Rock on Amazon!!) So paying 8.93 didn't seem too bad- at all. No it was the 12.29 for ship and handling that threw me off my rocker. Regardless it was a good deal- not over the top for service due to there not being an invoice attached to the package, but it was still in brand-new condition. And it only took 2 weeks to deliver the package whereas 5 weeks which it had orginally said. Sweetness!!    Thanks a lot to -willdvds-. I would highly recommend this edition to anyone who is looking for a cheaper price and well as the extra features. Great Deals! Good Service! What more can you ask for??    If this review was at all helpful then show credit where it's worth and order now!

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Make no mistake, this is a movie made by musicians, *for* everyone, but *about* the power and magic of making music.  If you are the kind of person who can hear Glen Hansard tell his band \\"OK, it's in 5/4\\" and go, REALLY?!! then ONCE is the movie you have been waiting for these many years.  I have shown it to audiences of 12-18 year old kids who sat riveted through the whole thing, (very mild) adult content and all, when three years ago they'd have been watching cartoons.  If you love gentle romance, music, Ireland or any combination of the three, I cannot recommend ONCE highly enough.  The one suggestion I would have, especially in showing it to others who don't hear a lot of Dublin accents, is to turn on the English subtitles.  It really helps to know exactly what they're saying when they get going fast or the crowd noise rises.    And it's not central to the movie or the review, but I can't leave without saying - How cool is it! - that Glen Hansard has a leading role in the two great Irish music movies of modern times.  Fair play, as he'd say. Ten cent!  Brilliant.
0765357151|4.0|Let me begin by stating that this is a short story compilation, something that was never mentioned to me at any point in time.  True, the title story is by far the longest in the book, and would qualify as a novella, but it is in length similar to \\"The Mist\\" being the largest short story in \\"Skeleton Crew.\\"<br /><br />The Title story of \\"I Am Legend\\" is a brilliant story following Neville as the sole survivor of the vicious plague which has claimed the lives of most of the world, and then brought them back as terrible vampire like creatures.  Neville is not a scientist, he is not a genius, and in fact he is far closer to an alcoholic slowly losing his mind.  \\"I am Legend\\" is not an action packed thrill ride, it is instead a drawn out study on madness, the breakdown of civilization and what it does to the human psyche.  We follow Neville as he tries to not only stay alive, but also retain his sanity after all that he has been through.  He is alone and sees no hope for the future.  True his behavior may not mimic what our choices would have been, but then again none of us know how we would behave.<br /><br />If you bought this book because of the Will Smith movie, you will probably be disappointed, the story is very different, far less scientific, and doesn't take place in NYC, not to mention there is no action, the dog isn't a main character (though it is a very touching part of the book) and the ending is completely different.  Do I think one is better than the other?  I don't know, I enjoyed them both but find them to be completely different stories.  If you can keep from comparing the two I think you can really enjoy both.<br /><br />As for the other stories in the book, much like all short story books, they are hit and miss.  You have everything from psycho dolls with warrior spirits inside terrorizing apartments, to houses that have gone mad from the negative energy.  Some of the shortest were the most entertaining.  Most have been turned into movies (many in those Creepshow/ Twilight Zone/ Amazing Stories type movies) so when you read through, a lot of them will seem familiar.  I highly recommend this book to those looking for a quality set of short stories complimented by a wonderful 160 page or so novella.t Zone/ Amazing Stories type movies) so when you read through, a lot of them will seem familiar.

B001AG52AG|1.0|THE GOLDEN COMPASS is written by Phillip Pullman, a proud athiest who belongs to secular humanist societies. He hates C. S. Lewis's Chronical's of Narnia and has written a trilogy to show the other side.

1573229725|3.0|I read Fingersmith because it was included on a list of 1001 books to read before you die.  While I enjoyed the tale, I found it to be light entertainment rather than a substantial, totally satisfying reading experience.  Fingersmith is the story of a London lass brought up in a den of thieves who becomes involved in a plot to dupe an heiress out of her fortune. On the negative side, the plot is convoluted and the characterization of the two main characters, Sue and Maud, is weak (although brought up in two completely different environments they seem almost interchangeable.)  On the positive side, the author does a very good job in creating a Dickensian London, replete with con artists, pornographers, and a chilling mad house. Also some of the other characters, notably Mrs. Suksby, are developed remarkably well.  Overall, I found Fingersmith to be definitely worth reading because it is entertaining but I do not think it merits the five star reviews it achieved.

You need to recognize your dreaming FIRST, before you can prepare yourself for what to do when it happens.<br /><br />Instead, I would recommend you ask yourself while AWAKE, \\"Is this a dream?\\"  At every hour.

The Format is HD DVD  which, I found out AFTER I opened the package and attempted to view it, not only does not work with MY DVD Player,  is apparently in a Format that is destined for the cemetary.  I'm Sure Amazon was aware of that fact when they listed it for sale and, in fact, it Was identified as being HD DVD.  However, to a neophyte like me, it didn't \\"Ring a Bell\\" that I wouldn't be able to play it without a special HD DVD player.  A Prominent Warning would have been a Nice thing to do.  NOW, I'm stuck with it because \\"opened\\" merchandise cannot be returned for a Refund.
1577312082|5.0|My wife and I have listened to this book over and over.  Each time we get another nugget. If you are ready and willing to \\"wake-up\\" to the truth and beauty of your own true Self, this book will help a great deal. It is couched in modern terminology, with a clear aim to help move past the false \\"ego-self\\". Life often seems to make no sense at all - this book helps see through all that. Not as the main text, but woven in, are a few quotes from Jesus and other spiritual masters I have never understood. They are clearly explained and I feel I understand them now. I suggest you get the audio copy.  Listening to some of the same things several times over has helped me get nuances I may have missed.
0767817478|5.0|I found this movie to be very entertaining, and that's what it was meant to do. Entertain. It is one of the few movies that I have watched more than once and I still find it entertaining. For those people who rated it low because they feel it doesn't have some deeper meaning or the characters don't have enough depth perhaps they didn't realize what type of movie it is. It's a monster movie people. That's why I bought the movie and why I watched it. Perhaps in some people's minds that makes me dumb. But it seems to me if those people want to be intellectually stimulated by a movie they should spend a little time analyzing their movie selection criteria.
B0013V33DG|5.0|A couple of years ago I had not even heard of this Opera. Now I keep humming the infectious tunes.   Natalie Dessay gives one of the great comic performances ever seen on stage (or even film.) She also sings beautifully. Juan Diego must be one of the great tenors, especially for this period in Opera. I was reading on youtube today that he was not as good as Pavarotti or Kraus. This is Tosh!  Juan Diego sings this part effortlessly.  Buy this and play it to your friends, even though they may profess not to like Opera.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I've had this mount holding my 3D Maglights at the ready behind my bedroom door and in the kitchen. I live in L.A., earthquake country. I mounted the holders into a stud and they've been holding my Mags at the ready for over five years. I remove them periodically to test and or use them. They lock in place very firmly. Mount the light lens down so dust won't collect on the lens. They don't slip out.
B00122J3B2|3.0|Good album, at least half the songs are as good as anything on previous albums. But the link from the remastered deluxe copy to the mp3s do not match. The hint is the new version has 21 tracks, bonus cuts and the full version of \\"Sara\\". But only the old copy is available for download, as I'm writing this.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I had to add something here.  I loved watching this series, and have seen it now several times.  This should not be taken as historically accurate.  It is being aired on Showtime as entertainment, and fills the bill very well.  The sets, scenery and music are wonderfully mingled.  The actors are engaging and keep you involved.      I will not get \\"wordy\\" here, but this is one of the best series I have seen in years.   I am a student of the Tutors saga, so the inconsistencies are quickly noted... but this is not a study of the actual facts.      My thanks to Showtime for putting together this lush, dramatic series.  I hope they continue it for many seasons to come.

The Queen is a site to behold and the finale is probably the best \\"Cat Fight\\" in film history! I rate the film 4 1/2 stars only because the length could have been trimmed a little and Bill Paxton is the most whiniest marine I've even seen, even though he delivers some of the best lines in the movie.

0743290119|2.0|I almost gave up on this book, and it finally started getting interesting about 2/3 of the way through.  I would definitely put this book in the \\"light reading-trash novel\\" category.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Devil Wears Prada and Everyone Worth Knowing, and I was very disappointed in this latest effort by Ms. Weisberger.<br /><br />As a designer label junkie, I expected the characters to have higher standards in regards to their grooming, attire, etc.<br /><br />There was no tie in to the book title until almost the end of the book.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend that you wait until the book comes out in PB before spending your hard earned money on this one.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted, Linda H aka L A Jewel
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I picked this box set up for under $35.00! It is loaded to the max with Alien films, extras, stills, expanded and director's cuts..etc! At the price I paid, it doesn't matter if every film is a classic. The first two films are worth the price of admission for this set. I will be reviewing each film on it's separate release and will add my ratings on this review as I go along.<br /><br />I prefer the theatrical releases over the expanded editions, but they are interesting to have included on this massive set. 9 discs are included and a nice neat package to house them all in. A great set for one of the most memorable creature designs since 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon'!....and that's saying something!<br /><br />1)Alien - 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />I saw this film in the theater the week it opened! Deliberately paced this film delivers the goods. Although the H.R. Giger creature is rarely scene in this film, there is an undeniable intensity because there is no remorse in this creature that just wants to use it's victims as a host to breed more of it's kind to destroy anything other than itself!<br /><br />Watching this film now after all these years, it does seem a bit long and maybe too slowly paced for my taste.....maybe I'm getting impatient in my old age!?? It's still a first rate Horror/Sci-fi thriller! The creature design is fantastic even though it would be improved a bit in the next film. It's a monster movie and this is one H E L L of a monster!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|What can I say, when it's on watch who gets to the TV first, my wife or daughter. I think my daughter has had every friend over to watch season 1 and 2 and with 3 just ending she wanted to know when the DVD was coming out (hmm, should I tell her).<br />I enjoy this show as much as them so I have no qualms about ordering season 3, though I should probably stop teasing my daughter about \\"Dean's\\" current situation.

B0015519VS|5.0|Usher's new release \\"Here I Stand\\" finally exhibits the man that Usher is becoming.\\"Here I Stand\\" shows growth and great maturity, and that is always great for an artist. Usher talks about real and mature topics, and I really enjoyed all of the songs. Usher expresses, in his own words, how he feels about his life today. I think it is a beautiful thing that he has found love in his life that brings him joy!! Congratulations, Usher on another great album :)
B0013K6WLM|2.0|Loved the Black Keys when first hearing them back many years now. I have to be honest I really wanted to like this cd and the Magic Potion cd as well....but alas they are sounding like they ran out of ideas. While driving from Las Vegas back home to L.A. and having absolutely nothing to do I put the cd  \\" Attack and Release \\" in the player for the 3 rd time since buying and still couldn't get thru the first song...really bad. The rest of the cd isn't all that bad but it sounds boring...  My idea would be to have the guys do a cd of some classic blues songs from the late fifties and then try their hand at some late sixties rock ...would love to hear \\" Walk Away by the James Gang \\" done the Black Keys way...or something like \\" Bloodwyn Pig \\" or \\" Savoy Brown tunes\\" oh well again I really loved these guys and I wish them all the best ...but me thinks its time for something new and not Danger Mouse new ...but Black Keys new!
0131177052|3.0|This book is decent but it doesn't break much new ground.  The author has the Fowler-esque affectation of naming very simple things to create a shared and clear vocabulary (ie making a change and seeing what it breaks when you compile is now the LeaningOnTheCompiler pattern) which feels a little overdone in places.       There was some good material here, but generally the best parts were where he would tie an example into a well known design principal which would be explained in a sidebar (SRP, etc).  Of course, that kind of stuff could be found elsewhere in a more concise format.      The book is nice in that it makes you think through the samples, I just wish there were more moments after doing that where I went \\"oh hey, cool\\" (there were a couple, don't get me wrong) instead of \\"yeah, thats pretty much how we do it now\\".

0061537934|5.0|This is a book ultimately about relationships and one of those interactions deals with the bond between a dog and the family he is part of. This is why it has an appeal, it allows us self recognition. Any book that is able to change how we look at world, and our relationships is a meaningful book, and I feel Garth Stein has created such a book. There are some reviews that are critical because  they feel the ending is predictable. This is similar to saying that a book about World War Two has no merit because we already know how it turns out. It is the textures and layers that the author creates in his characters that draw us in. It is the interactions between the characters that are a journey thru a tale we thought we knew, that change our view. This is a well crafted book, that will make you wonder, as you once did, what is my dog dreaming of? It is a wonderful book that has captured a measure of magic.

If you do already own this,or have seen it...excuse me,EXPERIENCED it,you'll know I'm telling the truth. Also, you obviously have to be a WHO fan,but that should go without saying,right? If there's a fire,I'm grabbing THIS DVD on my way out the door!!! Scare the neighbors,blow up the speakers, just RAISE HELL with this MAMMOTH MOTHER.  The fact that it opens with the FBI warning shaking as if a giant were about to smash through your screen is a pretty accurate opening. Somehow this movie had gotten past me for 29 years!?! Can't explain why,been a Who fan since 1969, sure I'd seen clips from it, but man, did Jeff Stein do a GREAT JOB !!! Anyway, don't hesitate if you're considering this...trust me, buy it,you WON'T be sorry, and...may you find a seller as CONSCIENTIOUS as I did (\\"shawnek\\")...they packed it so well, it might have withstood dynamite!!! Great seller,great DVD, LIFE CAN BE GOOD sometimes !!!!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I read all the reviews (all 200+) before buying this product. I've done diets before and tried many many workout videos and classes but nothing has ever really given me results fast enough...and if I don't get results fast I give up easily. This workout is hard...I'm not going to lie but it works! I just started on the level 2 workout (I'm on my 14th day) and I've lost 10 pounds and 8 inches! I was so excited when I stepped on the scale! The best part of this product is the fact that Jillian is tough and at the time it seems like I want to give up because it's too hard she says something that keeps me going. She knows exactly how to get in your head to keep you motivated to finish the workout! If you get this video and you are doing the first workout and you think you'll never be able to do it without stopping...don't give up! I couldn't finish any of the exercises the first few times I worked out but if you keep it up you will get to the point where you can do it all as fast as she can! Good luck guys!

B000PDZFCK|2.0|Some thought-provoking ideas wrapped in an insufferably arrogant tone. Fortunately, there are plenty of other options for books that cover these topics. It just isn't worth wading through Taleb's straw man arguments and narcissistic preening. As alternatives, I'd suggest Mlodinow's \\"The Drunkard's Walk\\" or even Taleb's earlier \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\"
B000148KK2|4.0|A great step in the right direction for her. She has such a wonderful jazz talent, but has spent so much time covering standards. We all love her for that, but she has needed to start stepping away from the formulaic and just start being herself. I hope she begins to explore just playing the piano, I'd love to hear more of that from her. This is a fine listen and is highly recommended.

B000Y35A94|4.0|Here is the information about this 3 DVD set from the manufacturer:     The legendary three-man line-up of Genesis - Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford - reunited after fifteen years to stage one of 2007's most successful tours, playing stadiums and arenas to sold-out crowds in Europe and North America. The European leg of the Turn It On Again Tour concluded with a free, open-air concert at Rome's historic Circo Massimo on July 14, 2007 before some 500,000 fans. All its glory is captured on WHEN IN ROME 2007, a new 3-DVD set from Rhino.          Disc 1 and Disc 2 of WHEN IN ROME 2007 present the entire 2-hour and 36-minute tour finale spectacle, which award-winning director David Mallet (U2: Zoo TV Live From Sidney, Madonna: Blond Ambition World Tour, etc) filmed with a state-of-the-art multiple camera shoot. The show spans Genesis hits such as \\"Land Of Confusion,\\" \\"Mama,\\" \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" plus classic older repertoire including \\"Los Endos,\\" \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" and \\"Ripples.\\" Each concert track gives viewers links to access bonus visual extras, and the first two discs also feature photo galleries, deleted scenes and reproductions of tour programs.          The epic concert is a showcase for the classic Genesis power trio configuration of Banks, Collins and Rutherford - along with longtime sidemen Chester Thompson (drums) and Daryl Stuermer (guitar) - as well as the Turn It On Again Tour's stunning stage production, which included the largest screen ever used at a concert (nearly 210 feet). During the tour, Genesis played to a staggering 1.4 million fans at 22 European dates before heading to North America to play 25 more dates.           Disc 3 features the nearly two-hour documentary Come Rain Or Shine, a fascinating fly-on-the-wall glimpse into the dynamics of life on the road and the myriad issues involved with putting a legendary supergroup on tour for the first time in 15 years. Filmed by Anthony Mathile, it covers the proceedings - with frankness and humor - from the earliest planning stages in 2006 to Genesis' Circo Massimo date presented on Discs 1 & 2.          Packaged in a deluxe slipcase box, the DVD digipak of WHEN IN ROME 2007 also includes an extensive 28-page booklet          Color +/- 5 hours and 37 minutes

After 30 minutes of working out, I was exhausted!  I received a better workout from this than I ever had at the gym or with a personal trainer.  I have only completed one day, but I am so sore, so I know it worked!  Yes, the beginning part could be better if you were able to fast forward it, but it can be overlooked.    This was awesome!

B000FC13MM|5.0|I first read this when I was like 9 years old, and ten years later I still totally love this book. I have to say, normally I can't help but roll my eyes at fantasy and science fiction, but not this one. Garth Nix's writing style is really well-crafted, it's short and spare but it leaves you feeling like you got a really rich description of everything. I loved the way that fantasy and reality get mixed together, especially the wall and how magic seeps into the \\"real world\\" at the end of the book. The imagination that Nix has is just amazing, the image of the mordicants is haunting and beautiful. The feeling I get from this novel is that there is a world just like our own, only with magic hidden under everything, alive but mostly imperceptible - overall, really amazing story.

B000P0I4O4|5.0|I enjoyed the Contract alot, after all it has almost everything an action / thriller movie needs.  the plot was simple and yes it did not add anything new or original, but it was pretty decent and was fast paced with smart dialogue lines. it involved a single dad ( Cusak ) and his son who go out camping in the woods and thier path is crossed by an assassin ( Freeman ) who was escorted by the FBI, soon the assassin's henchmen follow to help their boss escape..and the chase begins !  It had some very good preformances by both Cusak and Freeman, thier acting was top notch, a very good character build up and development, and some pretty solid action.. gun power and even some fist fights..quite enjoyable..  i would highly recommend this to any action fans or fans of either Cusak or Freeman..this movie stands out from the countless lame B-action movies that are coming out these days.  I would also recommend the following : if you like Cusak i would recommend [[ASIN:B000TJ6PBK 1408 (Widescreen Edition)]] , if you like Freeman i would recommend [[ASIN:B000YAF4MA The Bucket List]], if you are looking for some good action then don't miss [[ASIN:B0015XHP22 Rambo (Special Edition + Digital Copy)]] if you want some action similar to the Contract then watch [[ASIN:B000KX0HIW The Marine (Unrated Edition)]]

I really hope Sophie Kinsella rights a sequel to this book - I would love to know what happens next with Emma & Jack!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Not just an action flick, this film is replete with spiritual metaphors and subtle messages. Neo (an acronym for \\"One\\") finds himself falling down the proverbial rabbit hole as he learns the true nature of reality.<br /><br />He is believed to be the one who can break the system (aka \\"The Matrix\\") but he has to go through many trials and tribulations before he can even come close to reaching that state. Some would say this film shows what it may take to release the ego, but you will have to make that discernment yourself, if you so desire.<br /><br />If you don't like action movies or violence, then you can either fast-forward through some of those scenes or put it on mute and read the subtitles. Actually, I recommend watching it with the subtitles because there's so much spiritual depth to this movie it's nearly impossible to get it all in just one viewing, let alone several.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing has to be the best written show for television ever. Not to mention the stellar acting and directing done consistently throughout the series.

Finally, a movie comes along that makes you devote an entire night to the big screen.  But go easy on the pre-gaming; you'll want to remember all of the great lines.  Not once did the movie \\"drag\\" on, and the film is actually worth the $10 for a ticket.  Grab your Manolos..or for those penny pinchers out there like me...grab your Nine Wests and meet your girlfriends!

B000UNYJXQ|1.0|It's funny how rich socialists like Moore, who insist on government control of every aspect of our lives, have no intention of giving up any of their treasure for the cause.  I refuse to take advice on handing over the health and well being of myself and my loved ones to the same type of top down beuracracy that has a hard time keeping track of supplies for hurricane victims from someone who can afford to have a full time physician. It's easy for Moore and others to tell us to \\"Let go and let government\\" when their wealth exempts them from the program.<br /><br />As a comedy it would have gotten four stars, but as a serious documentary, it barely rates one.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|When John Adams premiered on HBO back in April 2008, I thought it would be one 2 and half hour movie that would cover Adams entire life. However, doing so would have resulted in almost a 9 hour running time and who has patience  to sit through 9 hours of commercial free even if it is engrossing? And that is what John Adams is. An engrossing, well written and well acted  mini series. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are perfectly cast as Jon and Abigal Adams as is David Morse as George Washington.<br /><br />  I was lucky enough to have read David McCullough's fascinating book that really took us into Adams life like we never saw before. Reading that, helped me understand the mini series so much better and the fact that McCullough was on set and approved and participated in the production brought more of an authentic feel. I do feel however that the movie tries and mostly succeeds in covering the entire book.<br /><br />  Reading the book is one thing. Seeing it is another because you get to see visually how life was back then and what we as a colony went through under British rule and why Adams wanted Independence desperately.  John Adams single handedly made us a Democratic country and was one of the most honest men who ever lived.<br /><br />  It is amazing that he and Jefferson died the same day hours apart and the film does a terrific job in showing that in a well edited scene. In fact, the entire film is well directed and edited and did I mention well written?<br /><br />  John Adams is told in seven parts in chronological order though the film opens during and after the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party which allows us to see the brilliant lawyer that Adams was. That is pretty much the entire first part. Adams defending the accused British soldiers.<br /><br />  In the 2nd part, is a bit long and drawn out and while unnecessary, I understand why the filmmakers spent 90 minutes on The Continental Congress. It is a crucial story point and basically sets up the rest of the movie and the Birth of America.<br /><br />  I won't go into all 7 parts here but I will say that as the story went on, the story got deeper yet weaker in some places. There were places where you saw a character a few times but never seen or heard from again. I'm a little curious as to why Washington's death wasn't mentioned or the funeral shown. I thought, if done right, could have been an emotional few scenes.

I won't go into all 7 parts here but I will say that as the story went on, the story got deeper yet weaker in some places. There were places where you saw a character a few times but never seen or heard from again. I'm a little curious as to why Washington's death wasn't mentioned or the funeral shown. I thought, if done right, could have been an emotional few scenes.

B0013L4D2Q|5.0|I found this book to be really thought provoking.  It took me a while to read because it really brought up a lot of issues from my own childhood and helped me to examine them in light of how I raise my kids.       I think that following the advice of this book is more difficult than using to time outs and rewards.  However, in the long run I believe in the idea of working with your children with the focus on teaching them rather then coercing them to do as they are told.  For instance I have been afraid for a long time that by constantly insisting that my 3 year old do what I say - even though my intent is good - that her spark and tenacity would eventually be quieted.   I honestly didn't know what to do about this though.  At what cost would I have obedience in my home?  Are manners always the most important thing?  When we go to playgroup though everyone expects you to use time outs and discipline....  it is not an easy choice to make.      The whole issue about school and grades is very interesting too.  When my child gets older do I want her to be focused solely on grades?  That's how I was and I hated school after a while.  My family labeled me the B+ student and implied that I didn't do my best all the time.  I know a lot of people who got worse grades than I did who are successful...     I think this book contains a lot of food for thought and we will try our best to incorporate it into our lives.  In the few weeks that we have been doing so, my 3 year old who is quite moody has been a little less so.  I have also been surprised by her answers sometimes when I ask her why she is acting a certain way and try to talk it out with her.  It can be frustrating and time consuming, but actually seems more effective than the time outs she would have had before.    In all, this book has the potential to change our lives and to make the long-term mother-daughter relationship a lot stronger and how I wish it would be instead of what my fears have been about what it couldbecome.      A lot to take in but worth it.
0689859368|3.0|I bought this book for myself not my kids. That may have been my first mistake. But I had suddenly felt out of the book series \\"bandwagon\\" loop so I decided to start reading this series. This was before any talk of the movie. I read it and it was a cute story. Very short (which I don't mind) and mildly amusing. The book however was more of an introduction in my opinion. It ended in a sorta clffhanger (if you can call it that). I ended up being curious about what would happen to the characters and how the story would unfold but was not so interested that I actually read the next book. Luckily for me the movie came out & I saw that and I didn't have to wonder what happened anymore. I wonder though if the problem lies with the book or with a 30something deciding to read a kids book series.
0061537934|5.0|Yes, there are some weak points in the plot, and yes, some of the characters are less well drawn than others... and it doesn't matter. Enzo is one of the great first-person narrators of fiction, full of wisdom and self-doubt, love and confusion. The daring choice to write a dog's voice as a highly intelligent, even slightly intellectual, human -- which shouldn't have worked -- works totally, due to Stein's sensitivity to dog-details of scent and movement, relationships and motivations. This book will appeal especially to dog lovers, but it's a tender, forthright must for anyone who cares about the relationships between humans and animals, and humans and each other.
