B009JZPH32|2.0|great movie, only problem that they should of just left the movie with the first ending, the second ending stinks like bad beans in a month left over casserole. I was going to give  4 1/2, NOW 2
B003F48E4W|4.0|I had to watch this movie for a class and was very entertained by the whole film. The quality is great.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Another not amazing, but simple fun kids movie to watch. It's a goofy kids movie that has everything in it you'd expect it to have in terms of storyline, etc. Nothing spectacular about it, but has a few decent catch phrases in it you may remember and repeat afterwards.
0684171600|5.0|All the NC Wyeth illustrations.  Printed on a rough paper with irregular boarderw, perfect for a book about pirates and treasure.  This is the same kind of format that started me down the livelong road of loving pirates, sea adventures, and travel 50 years ago.  I purchased this book for an 8 year old, hoping it has the same effect!
B007BVOEPI|1.0|Since I love this genre I was really disappointed when viewing the first episode and haven't tried more yet. I heard it gets better after the first episode. Just a warning to anyone thinking about watching...There's a ton of unnecessary nudity, so take that however you want, but I'm just hoping it does actually get better throughout the season because it has the ingredients necessary to be a great show. They just majorly missed the mark in the first episode.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hey guys! I love this app! But the problem is, it's just like Temple Run. I wish it a little more original. But I love it otherwise.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. I watched it several times with several different people and everyone, even those who expected to hate it, ended up really enjoying watching it. If you haven't seen it you definitely should watch it.
B00ANGICRE|4.0|This is an autobiographical story of poet Mark O'Brien who was stricken by polio and spent much of his life in an iron lung. In 1988 at the age of 38 he decides he wants to lose his virginity. A sure bet for an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes plays O'Brien. Hawkes' already thin frame is reduced even more to where his muscle tone approaches that of a polio victim. His acting is mostly confined to his vocal inflections and facial expressions.<br /><br />Before going much further, let's be clear about one thing. This isn't a dower, conventional weepy film. If anything it's uplifting. O'Brien is a funny guy and some of the scenes between him and his understanding priest (William H. Macy) are some of the best in the film. Once O'Brien gets the Church's go ahead, he hires a sex surrogate (excellent Helen Hunt) to guide him through his ultimate goal. While there is nothing overly salacious in the scenes involving O'Brien and Cheryl (Hunt), they are pretty graphic. Ms. Hunt in particular, leaves little to the imagination.<br /><br />Perhaps under-appreciated in the film is O'Brien's caretakers. One, played by Moon Bloodgood, I found particularly interesting. I would have liked to have seen her role a bit meatier. Perhaps it is no surprise, that in spite of O'Brien's physical limitations, he's quite the hit with the ladies, especially those closest to him. Director and writer Ben Lewin does a nice balancing act, given the sexual and religious overtones. The movie is well photographed giving a strong sense of reality of Berkeley, California in the late 1980's. Excellent film.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Even for those used to seeing quality in Blu ray discs will appreciate the perfection of this issue.  It is absolutely gorgeous in terms color, clarity and sharpness.  I saw nothing in terms of image anomalies.  This is a dialog centered film so the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds.  The dialog is clear and audible throughout the film.  Here is a list of extras:<br />*Deleted Scenes (HD, 3:34)<br />*Writer/Director Ben Lewin Finds Inspiration (HD, 4:01)<br />*John Hawkes Becomes Mark O'Brien (HD, 4:26)<br />*Helen Hunt as the Sex Surrogate (HD, 4:13)<br />*A Session with the Cast (HD, 3:50)<br />*The Women Who Loved Mark O'Brien (HD, 4:24)<br />*Theatrical Trailer (HD, 2:26)<br />*Sneak Peek (HD, 11:04)ide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds.

B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I saw the reviews of how this missed out on having anything really significantly awesome in it. That was true, but it was still a nice kids movie to watch.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is amazing! You can build anything from swords to dinosaurs to basically anything! Great game! The missions are also challenging but still really fun and cool
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|This movie is worth the watch, but is basically just what it would seem like it would be and not more. It might disappoint some because it's not really quite as weird and crazy as the previews might lead you to think.... It's got a few moments that are beautiful...a moment of surprise...but mostly it just drives you through without too much to really mark you or it as being anything fantastic. It's okay....
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this story. It's so wonderful!! Very well written. I would recommend it to everyone who loves romance and adventure
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This long, long movie was beautiful, excellent...... They did a great job and Lord of the Rings fans absolutely have to watch it.
B002ZG997C|4.0|It's a pretty good saga of the OId West in modern gab, with tricky knife and hand play added to the traditional gun shoot 'em up. The problem is that almost any young version of the myriads of gunfighters in the Old West could have played the role just as well. While we get a bit of the quality Denzel Washington always brings to the screen, and very good bits they are, still he is wasted in most of the film. (Granted there appear to be financial reasons in his being Co-Producer to account for his starring but that is irrelevant to what appears on the screen). At any rate, as it stands, there is enough action to keep most action fans happy, a real nasty with his brutal gang, a couple of women to visually enliven the screen, and the appealing sound of Washington's voice, to make this an acceptable way to spend an evening (for those who go for the average Western or other varieties of mixing it up by the boys)<br />Naturally, given the name of the film there is the religious aspect as one would expect. Since such elements in the movies elicit responses from different parts of the audience which I cannot predict, it is to mention here and left to the viewer to decide how they might react to soft-sell approaches to religious belief.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|All 3 seasons are a must watch if you love zombie shows, but there are definitely a lot of points where they try too hard to make this a soap... At this point I'm just sick of all the &#34;governor&#34; stuff and wish they'd move the story along.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Game is not glitchy fun to play colorful graphics are good plays well on samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1I enjoyed all the time I put into it to unlock all items
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Another 'match 3' game.....but I love match 3's<br />The graphics are awesome.....it gets challenging as you move up the levels....<br />I really like the fact that you can ask for more time if you fail.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This version of AB is just too weird.  The birds and pigs appear too small on the screen. I'll choose the original or other versions over this one.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Im starting to become a big Jack Reacher fan... Just have to ignore the fact that he knows EVERYTHING!!! But definitely a book almost impossible to put down....
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It starts out slow and a little overly-symbolic, but hold on & keep reading! A touching story of seeking the wrong treasures & finding the painful good.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was the most thoughtful, and in my opinion of the ender series. The characters are built very well, the storyline is very engaging and it brings up some very philosophical questions that make the reader think not only about the book, but also about how these philosophies apply to our lives.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Definitely recommend watching! Keeps your attention  engaged! The actors fit their roles wonderfully! Definitely not a family appropriate series, but worth a watch.
1476734941|5.0|Easy diet to follow. I already feel better after only two weeks.<br />I do not use the recipes at the back of the book , I prefer my own or the Weight Watcher cookbook that I had.
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting show. Would be amazing to see this show get a full budget for better SFX. Watching season 2 now. Can't wait for season 3
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|If you've never seem this movie, get it and enjoy it. One of the best films ever - entertaining and funny. Bill Murray at his best.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like the imaginative and intricate puzzles. Fun for older kids and adults. Recommend for new tablet users. Try it today.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Use it all of the time.  I used this every day to check out what is happening on face book
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you interested with some unexpected twists.  I just couldn't put it down, it definitely hooks you and keeps you guessing until the very end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great!  It keeps me up to date on all the weather in my area and what it happening in different counties nearby.
0452289963|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT COMPLIMENT TO CHOPRA'S SPIRITUAL BOOKS.  SOOOOOOO IN TUNE WITH MY CURRENT SEARCH FOR PURPOSE FOR THIS LIFE.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Have not used it.  I have never used you tube but had heard about it.  I am planning on testing it real soon.
1878424114|5.0|HAVE A GROUP SEARCHING OUR SPIRITS!  WOW, THIS WAS PERFECT AND AN EASY READ!  RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS.
B001NLKT60|5.0|In his usual style this book was as excellent as the first one. I can't to start the last one in the trilogy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved this book so hard! A great read with lots of heart! Auggie is such a lovable character with very real struggles.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show rocks!  Good for all ages, historical,  and beautifully entertaining.  Our whole family has enjoyed it.  Catch up!  Fabulous!
B0050CQY1W|4.0|The CD is awesome. I liked almost every song on the album and I played it so much ever since I received it on my doorstep until I played it out. I recommend anyone who likes or loves Beyoncé to trust that you will not be unsatisfied with the hard work she put into this album for her fans.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam Neeson was a Jedi knight who came back from the dead.  He also kills wolves with his bare hands.  Why, oh why, would you kidnap his daughter?  Darn good movie.  Watch it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great story line.  Easy two day read!  Can't wait to start the next book in this series!  Loved all the characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think there should be end less world , lava,water,books you can type in,squids,enchant table,the real neather,mods,diamonds less harder to find, and revine.
B008220D7S|5.0|This movie is so funny. I laughed my butt off, and then watched it again the next night and laughed my butt off again. I am so confused about the bad reviews. I love the good music references too (Pixies, Pavement, Ween, Alice in Chains -- \\"This music is so depressing\\" -- LOL!!)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am hoping for a happy ending and keep reading on.  Ana is such an innocent woman and would like to see her turn Christian around into a sensitive human being and able to be content and have true happiness.  I waiting to see if they have children.  I did not know anything about this type of behavior before and really do not understand why women engage in it.  Just looking for a happy ending.  Still have half of the book to read yet.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|very nice and portable speed light for dail use.. It is also ver easy to use. I recommend it for all types of photographers
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am so happy that this game is available for my Kindle. I played this game before on an iPod until it quit working. I loved working to achieve the next dragon. I challenged myself but it take the other players help to complete the game.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|love the movie it was everything I excepted and more blue ray experience is awesome need to get it if you like the movie
B00BU18U82|5.0|I thought this game was very fun and also takes a little skill but very fun and easy to catch onto if you live on a farm like me it gives insight on your future
B002RI9M2U|5.0|This book was incredibly written. It had me captivated from the beginning and I never wanted to put it down. It's an insight into the struggles of a teenage girl in her high school years.<br />Much praise to Jay Asher for writing such an amazing novel!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good plot kept you interested all the way through. Positively surprised. Would read another book from this author.<br />Thank you!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I do enjoy this game. It is mindless thus for me relieves stress.. Would recommend this for anyone as a stress reliever.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Remember to have some tissues ready while reading this book. Very touching and realistic book. Loved every single word.<br />Superb.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is really a challenge for little ones. My 4yr old likes the challenge of building and making things work...at times frustrating, but she loves it and keeps going back to try to figure out how to get to the next level. Would definitely recommend it for any one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love Minecraft is awesome I play Minecraft So Much I have sex with it .my mom love to much
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this for my teenage daughter but listen to it all the time!  Very pleasantly surprised and glad she talked me into it!!
B000AL5OZK|2.0|From the sampling of the tracks on Amazon, I thought this much be a much better album.  There were a handful of tracks that were decent, but overall quite uninspiring.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game and give it a high rating because it is very easy to manipulate and the ads are easy to skip!  I find Solitaire to be relaxing and enjoy this version which is the best of others that I have tried.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Fun way to pass the time.  Some of the levels are simple, but they get harder.<br />Also enjoyed Reflect.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My 9 year old son has school early and he relies on this i like how you can change the time easy  and the background i rilly like this app only 1 word AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|At first, I didn't know if I was going to enjoy the book. The first few pages set the stage for the other two novels, and I had to read through that. After that, I couldn't put it down. Great suspense read for young adults and adults. I loved it!
B00683JLXA|1.0|this is exactly like angry birds. like angry birds if u play it long enough it will get very boring. I used to have angry birds and it would just sit in my favorites taking up space. today it is the free app of the day but anyone who would buy it otherwise is crazy. there is a reason it wasn't in the top thirty of the free apps list.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Loved the graphics on this. Wow. The Final Fantasy Series never disappoints in its delivery of entertainment. I plan on purchasing the entire series for my children.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great read. Takes you on a great adventure with lots of twits and turns. Can't wait to read the next book.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|This was the 2nd of the Star Trek films and it is fun to watch.  Khan re-emerges from the first TV series to face the crew of the Enterprise with a vengeance - along with a smattering of Shakespearean one-liners.  What's also great about this is that you see Captain Kirk struggling just as hard with his own mid-life crisis as his bloodthirsty nemesis.  From beginning to end, the pace never lets up and in the end, it's Spock's turn to face the no-win scenario.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is real cool and my friend loves it too and my friend told me about Subway Suffers she told me I would like it so I tried it and I loved it.
B005F3XV62|4.0|This isn't the best movie that I have watched but still pretty great. A good clean movie for any family.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The ending was as appropriate as much as it was frustrating because it leaves you wondering a bit. Loved the tone and the flow. Great writing.
B000683VI4|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie! It makes you want to cry, laugh, scream, and shout for joy! I would also recommend reading the book as well if you haven't already.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book my me cry and it was worth it just the fact the it talks about life the way I never thought it would be...
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I really love this movie. My english teacher in high school first showed it to me 4 years ago and I can still say I enjoy this movie! Great for almost all ages!
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|Bought this for my son. He loves the Silent Hill movies. Thank you. Always a great movie to watch. LOVE the Guardian character the most. Very creepy.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|I don't know why but I really enjoy this movie and I am 20 years old now. Great for almost all ages and families.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I liked the mini games inside the game. I like that there are different modes of help to play. I think G5 games are really well thought games.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is grate it allows u to basically do any thing in mc pe. It does make it a little does make it a little boring if you use it in a new world so i would suggest using it in an old world. Now the essayist way I've found to get diamond is to make a world in creative and place a lot of diamond and iron blocks the iron is so you can make iron picks to mine the diamond blocks.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Everything this man makes is great regardless what happens in the box office. This is just one of my favorites of his works. It doesn't hurt of you are a Danny Elfman fan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Our entire family loves this game . It is easy and everyone down to the youngest grandchild can play with this awesome game.
1452110581|5.0|This is fun book for any cat lover. Depicts exactly to what goes on in those furry heads. Purr-fact  for anyone who has love for those great little friends.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I thought the movie's cinematography and cgi wowed, though the story was just mediocre. I wouldn't purchase this DVD as I don't think that there's anything in this movie that made me think of things differently.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|A movie i could not put down.  i kept seeing it over and over!  the action sequences and this actor caring so much for his 2 brothers who their father adopted him.  he was so grateful for the love and support he received that true loyalty came to the forfront and made this movie spectacular!  Pam
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like it it not like first book. But it was great cant wait to read the third book hope it great ending
1451695187|5.0|Believe in near death or not,  this book is worth reading.  It's slow at first, once you get  into it hard to put down.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Ok, so I got this game and loved it. Then I closed it and played something else. AND THE GAME WILL NOT OPEN NOW!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|As always with Jack Reacher, it is a page turner - you never know what he is going to do to the bad guys. I will finish the whole series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nice ending. Good series I hope the movies can be true to the story.  Read all three books in less than a week.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|AWESOME ! I have played it constantly, over and over. So glad I purchased it. And this comes from a 64 yr.old Grandmother of 7.
1616550414|5.0|This book is absolutely AMAZING!!! Everything you could ever want to know about Legend Of Zelda is in here!! LOVE IT:)
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|Beautiful rhythm and sleepy book! Follows a routine too! Another great Boynton book. Lively pics and text as well. Love it!
B008L40Q7E|4.0|I haven't read the book yet so cannot comment on the content.  I got it on sale, so was a great price.  It seems to work great on my Kindle Fire e-reader.  Navigation looks easy.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Been enjoying the photography,the costumes, the story-line and how the characters were developed as the season went on.  Sorry season finale is coming now....
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Beautiful movie, great acting and story. Watched the movie several times. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes fantasy.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Great show. There are a lot of funny moments and the birth of christine. Booth is over protective for most of the season
B0087ITBPC|2.0|My husband thought it was 'boring' and I felt it was dry. The advert was more entertaining as it happens!<br />This movie had its cute bits and yes, mom knows best,ey?! I think the producers were looking for ways to be a little Quentin Tarantino in terms of the few 'risky' incidents(e.g. bar incident)& the remarks made throughout the movie. Quite frankly only a few worked...:/ We moved on to an older movie tonight called 'Hidden Silence.' That was 5 stars in comparison! Seriously, The Guilt Trip was not worth watching. Possibly an actor who is a better complement for Barbara would have worked for this movie...imagine a Woodie Allen like personality and Barbara or something...just think this didn't work. Sorry!
B009MYARIK|3.0|Quintessential Kinsella - somewhat flawed, but endearingly quirky gal is rescued by a great man.  A pleasant and light hearted beach read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was annoyed the entire time I was reading.  Christian Grey feels so entitled and to me that is not a turn on at all.
B000FC10IO|5.0|So well written. I love this writer's rich visual writing that paints such a vivid picture but doesn't ever go overboard or get in the way of the story.  The characters are such interesting, dimensional people. Love this trilogy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have loved every Gillian Flynn book that I've read!  She is great and this is a great read!  Great twist!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Never thought I would be addicted but I find myself constantly checking my FB to see what's going on and to read inspiring messages from my friends.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I didn't really like the way it ended.  I guess I was hoping for a happily every after like usual
B00005V9HH|4.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since its release in the 90s.  A great blend of actors, writers and production  staff.  If this is not a cult classic yet, hang on; it's sure to reach that status soon!<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I love all of Jo Nesbo's books and of course, Harry Hole is one of my favorite literary characters.  Highly recommend.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|This is the first of two or three prequels to the Alien franchise/  It's a good start and I am hoping that Ridley Scott stays involved so the amateurs don't get the chance to do what they did in Aliens three and four.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next part in the long story.<br /><br />P.S. Noomi Rapace is steamin!!!!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Sorry I wasted my money on this.  Way too fake and cheesy for my taste.  Christian Grey's world is not my idea of a fantasy.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|This TV series takes up shortly after terminator 2 Judgement Day and leads partially up to the Rise of The Machines.  Even though the ratings were not what the corporate executives expected, the series needed a third season to properly wrap up this portion of the story.<br /><br />In many ways, it was more interesting than the movies in my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great look into how some relationships can be,. Things aren't always what they seem as Lee Brightman shows us.  Highly recommend.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's good but difficult to tell the difference between the flowers to match them.  I would recommend it.  Just take into account the learning curve.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lots of great characters in this book! Indulgent parents, crazy boys and a somewhat disfunctional family all come together in a great &#34;who done it&#34;.<br /><br />A real page turner right to the end.
B005LAII4E|1.0|At first I was thrilled they made a second Gi joe video. However right from the beginning they put the spot light on the rock(rode block), and they killed of duke how never dies in the comics or the cartoons. Personally I don't see why every body goes cooko for films that the rock plays in, as an actor he's horrible . My opinion as some one how grew up reading and watching the Gi joe material is they need to stop trying to screw with lead caricature and base the script off the comics,like in marvels iron man movies witch are pretty good.
B007712XAU|5.0|Thanks PBS for giving us this great historic experience. The cast is wonderful and the plot is so intriguing. Wating for another season.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|I love Sci-fi.  I love the fringe frame of mind.  What else can I say.  Great TEAM OF WRITERS.  I LOVE THERE THINKING OUT ON THE FRINGE OF THE IMAGINATION.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|\\"Childhood's End\\" by Arthur C. Clarke is without a doubt one of the most engaging, imaginative, and original sci/fi adventure stories I've ever read. It's certainly understandable why so many fans of this genre rated this incredible story 5 stars because it is truly an amazing experience to immerse yourself in this brilliantly conceived storyline from the mind of a master inditer...it's absolutely magnificent! 5+ stars!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'd really like to update MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION but it won't update. Please,please, please,please,please, please,please,please update Minecraft.<br />I have to have the update.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great film ---- Daniel Day-Lewis has you believing that this is really Lincoln.  You also learn a number of facts that you had no knowledge of prior to this film.  Sally Fields and Tommy Lee Jones are well established actors who could have easily folded when being cast with DD L and they did not.  They give excellent performances.  Enjoy and so far have watched it 3 times!
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is an insightful movie and the actors are great.<br />Since I have a hearing problem I will be viewing the DVD more than once.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so fun but very addicting!! Free daily tournaments and fun levels. Some are a little to difficult to get all pieces but still very fun!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|How refreshing to have a &#34;thriller&#34; based on an actual story.<br />Even knowing the outcome it was tension filled and  gripping.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Professional done. Very today and IT technically educating. I have been Clancy fan for a long time. This novel is back on Clancy track!!!
B00AFOS6QG|4.0|Like many of their other releases, this one has grown on me.  Initial reactions were not overwhelming, although Jubilee Street was an immediate standout.  But I've had this experience of other albums of theirs in the past as well.  In fact, it's what I've come to value this band for - they are always pushing ahead and making an effort to do something new - or in a new way.  And this challenges the listener to grow with them.  I didn't know what to expect and I find I'm surprised . . . . And can't wait to hear more.  I'm enjoying this album more and looking forward to the next one . . . . And to more surprises.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love period drama and this is one of the best I've ever seen.  The detail is rich, the characters are flawed but approachable, and every now and then the writer throws in an anachronism just for fun.  The parallel plots between 'upstairs' and 'downstairs' keep me riveted.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my attention and I have suddenly been interested in the War era books. Even if they are fiction the authors are giving me a glimpse of the past. This was a good one.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|A really good game, it is such a good game, and if u play it u will love it, and u wont stop playing it, u will play it every day, and the last thing. it is the best game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I Love all the history, and the actors, scenery, and costumes! What an interesting relationship between the upper class and the servants.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Didn't know what kind of book this was, just that it has been talked about.  What a disappointment.  I can't imagine so many reading this kind of trash.
0374531269|4.0|'A Long Way Gone' by Ishmael Beah is a very touching memoir of a then 12 year old soldier in Sierra Leone. Especially after hearing about the Kony 2012, I found myself being curious about what these young kids had to go through. Rather than being carefree and playing with other kids, they were ultimately forced to grow up and become heartless killing machines. In addition, these child soldiers were doing drugs and young girls were constantly being raped. All of these kids never got the chance to just be kids and that was heart wrenching to read. It was a tough book to read but it was hard to put down because Ishmael Beah's words intrigued me. He was very descriptive and it felt like I was there with him throughout his roller coaster journey. With the help of UNICEF, he was allowed to gain his freedom and was asked to be a speaker at the United Nations. Those who helped him with his rehabilitation showed him how to cope with his troubled past and forgive himself and move on with his life. I would definitely recommend this book for both pleasure and as a class reading material. 'A Long Way Gone' was very interesting and educational!
0446573027|2.0|To me, my first acquaintance with Baldacci and his Zero Day was a boring experience. I don't understand the accolade about it. A whole chapter drags about an old lady with a medical problem and the hero's laudable approach to it, but is as exciting as the other pages about the hero's mission. Clearly, you must be a believer to buy another thriller by this writer, who seems to give us in fiction what Tom Cruise offers in cinematography.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I saw this at the movies.  I love this movie.  Best one ever showing the real horror Jesus went thru for us.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I quit reading Clancy novels some years back, because his latest books were simply &#34;words in a row&#34;.  However, this novel is a great comeback for Clancy, even if he didn't write most of it.  The story is &#34;spooky scary&#34;.  Cyber warfare is here.
B000059GEI|5.0|No Business like Show Business was a great movie when it was first made. It's just as good now as it was then! My self & my disabled dad completely enjoyed watching it for the first time in many years.
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|Sent this item to our daughter in Australia, it was one of many DVDs sent.  She and her friends were twenty minutes into the movie when it started having problems.  When they investigated the disc it was bubbled.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Amazon sent the package, it arrived quickly.  We have been very pleased with Amazon products.  This was not up to the usual standards.

B00AFEY354|5.0|The movie draws you in and you feel as if you are a fly on the wall. It reminded me of my teenaged years.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Very good product, worked fine in 3 different Tvs including my smart TV, of you want to watch a movie I recommend to have the phone with at least 80% of battery, when you plug in the charger it helps to drain the battery slower, but still drains it.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book but the only part I didn't like was when the dog died. I never cried when reading a book or even when reading Old  Yell-er but I cried when his dog died. But apart from that this book is amazing!!!!
B005RJI67I|2.0|It's MUCH smaller than you would even think..... I bought it as an &#34;extra&#34; for another gift and was almost embarrassed to give it to my nephew.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It really helps to know the story line, or at least the Cliff Notes version before seeing this production: Then got to this production to enjoy the magnificent music, acting and filming that brings you into the time period. This was totally enjoyable.

B008XBCJ34|4.0|The first time I watched Avatar on 2D Blu-ray, the story was just alright to me. With the 3D I actually found the movie more fun and engaging. This is a must buy if you own a 3D TV.

B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I never knew of this series until a friend suggested it a while ago.  When it was in its first run, I guess I was too busy with school to think about TV, so I missed it.  After months of being dripped on about it, it happened to be run in a marathon format on the science channel, I think. I loved it!  So I had to buy it!  Then I was sad it was over...then I got the movie...then I was sad THAT was over....  The series was better, it didn't have the finality about it that the movie had, but it was supposed to keep going, then, wasn't it?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm a fourth generation disabled combat vet. What I gave to this country is nothing compared to this guy. He wrote this book to make sure the truth got out there before the Navy made him into some sort of superhero that he wasn't. I admire that. Throughout the book, the author (and occasionally his wife) spoke honestly and very bluntly about war, training, what it is like living in the military, life as a military spouse, life as the spouse of an Operator like SEAL's, etc. Chris tells the story from early childhood on through BUD/S and on into the second Persian Gulf War. He speaks matter of factly about everything. At times it might seem that he is bragging, but he isn't - he is just trying to be honest. If you want a true look at the face of war from the viewpoint of a special operations guy, or are interested in Chris himself, you WILL love this book. It is a shame that he is dead.

B009NPA3MS|5.0|I was unsure whether it would be too youthful and edgy for me.  But I find that this young man can sing and write songs that are ageless.  I think he has a career that will span his lifetime.  It is worth buying.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I was fascinated by this story and have thought about long after finishing the book.<br /><br />Subject matter was not uplifting but the characters were so well developed that I<br />sympathized with all that they were dealing with.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|I remembered the movie more than the book and it was one of the most frightening movies that I ever watched.  The book was fascinating reading.  The narrative structure of the letters was done extremely well and Bram's ideas about the vampire were so interesting compared to the usual contemporary vampire constructs.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I enjoy the game &amp; play it frequently, however, the last coupe weeks I've gotten several notifcations at 3 am. If there was a watt to stop the notifications I would change my rating. Turning off my ringer is not an option.

014242613X|5.0|The Accused by John Grisham is a great mystery book for all ages. Although this book if for the young reader, adults will enjoy it also. Grisham has weaved a story that young folks can enjoy from beginning to end. Theo Boone is an eigth grader and in middle school whose parents are both laywers. Mom handles devorce cases and normally with women clients where dad is in real estate. But it does not stop there! Theo Boone is a kid with a great deal of knowledge in law and uses it to help adults with problems in a lower court. He has the respect of judges and others in the field of law. The Accused is Theo. He has been framed by someone who has a big dislike for his mother. Stolen items are placed in his school locker and Theo is the prime suspect of the police. His home is searched by the police looking for evidence of a burglary of a computer store downtown. Who was able to get into Theo's locker? How did this person get into the school and place some stolen items there? Uncle Ike has an idea that just may work to find the real burglars. This is a good read for any reader of any age. It is a FUN book to read. I have no problem recomending it. You'll enjoy it. DP
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I love all these movies and was so happy to get them all together as one and for a great price!
0345803485|2.0|I have read only the first in this series and I don't understand all the hype about this book. If you read true erotica you will find that this doesn't hold a candle to it. If you read read romance this really doesn't fit the bill for that either. The writing is somewhat juvenile with repetition, repetition, repetition. Some of the word choices are every odd and are words that I don't think are used by anyone, anywhere. The relationship between Ana and Christian is just boring and his character is not believable. He seems to be a self made billionaire who never works, has private staff who appear out of nowhere any time he needs them. They know his secret life but don't speak of it. He reminds me of batman. Skip it and read a more seasoned erotica author if that's what you're after.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Clint Eastwood move over!  Great film, Great actors, Great Story.  Too bad they didn't make sequels.  You knew when Sergio Leone<br />directed it was a good o ne.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|If you like the other albums, you'll like this one too.  Another solid performance from them.  Catchy melodies and hard driving guitar; it's what rock and roll is all about.

B007REV4T8|1.0|I have always been very satisfied with everything from amazon, but the dvd of skyfall was not clear at all. The color & picture was distorted. It was not worth it to return, because of the shipping. It was a gift, so needless to say it was embarrassing.<br />Sincerly, Irene Nicholson
0553801473|5.0|Anyone reading the Song of Ice and Fire must follow the story. A natural continuance for anyone hooked onn the story line.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first time reading this author's work.  This book is a great read.  It is definitely a page turner. Unlike some reviewers, I have no problem with the ending.  I f eel the author wrote the story in such a descriptive manner that the ending is fitting.  The story captures the reality of true human nature and the society in which we live.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Would be a five star if it would stop freezing<br /><br />Love the option to download even more puzzles and numerous sizes.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|If you like action packed super-hero movies (which I do) I would recommend this movie.  This is also good finale (?) to the series of Batman movies.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I can't stop playing the game. I am addicted to it.  It's to easy to navigate and really fun. It makes you think..I think 10 or 15 words would be enough.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I'm a 26yr old married mom and my little sister is just turned 12.  I wanted to get her a movie she hadn't watched, but one that I had so I wouldn't be getting something I wouldn't want my kids watching.  This is a really good movie if you like the high school boy drama scene.  There's no naked-ness and somewhat minimal cursing.  This in my opinion, is a great teen movie for boys or girls.  After it was delivered, she messaged me that she loved it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|From the first page, this book takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride. This is a terrific book club choice.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Such a cool show- sooo much better without the commercials!!! great price, and for some reason these later seasons are harder to find in the store- but i picked them up on here for a fraction of the cost.  Sweet deal!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I don't even know where to start with this show! It really draws you into it. From a historical point of view it's really accurate - its not like some Spartacus junk where it's nothing but fake cartoony violence with a s*** story line. All I can say is you have to watch it!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|even after 43 years (somebody loan me a dime) boz is still the best!  he is still mr. smooth and silky voiced.

Character Quirks<br />2. Metaphors and symbolism<br />3. Literary references<br /><br />Thank you, John Green, for a marvelous book.
0451175123|5.0|Probably the nest book I have ever read, literally. If you haven't read it, you need to. Ayn Rand also wrote a book called Atlas Shrugged, which is just as amazing. Really great price from this seller. Very happy with my purchase.

B008B1BL4E|4.0|Sleepwalkers is about how, not why, Europe fell into the abyss of war in 1914. It is a terrific work of history, but for the lay reader, it is way too long and gets too bogged down in minutia. Hence four stars instead of five. What makes this book different from the volumes I have read on the origins of World War One is that is puts the emphasis on where it started, the Balkans. After reading the early chapters of the book, Clark proves, intentionally or not, the Bismark aphorism, that the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.<br /><br />For someone like myself schooled in the works of Tuchman (chaotic and inept decision making theory) and Fischer (Germany wanted a war from the get go) Clark's book is an eye opener. First it makes all of the players seem rational and second it puts far more emphasis on the role of France and Russia in starting the war. Both France and Russian planning was based on a &#34;Balkan inception&#34; scenario; something that was given to them on silver platter by the assasination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarejevo on June 28. Within five weeks Europe was at war. As an aside the fear of growing Russian power not only motivates Germany, but also France in that France feared that in only a few years Russia would no longer need an alliance with them.<br /><br />Although Clark convincingly covers the intrigues of Belgrade, Venice, St. Petersberg, Paris and London; he does not spend sufficient time on Berlin. I know that might be more of a &#34;why&#34; question than a &#34;how&#34; question, it is necessary for the story. It speaks the need to understand whether Austria-Hungary was an independent actor or a pawn of Berlin.<br /><br />These quibbles aside there is so much to learn here and there are lessons for today. Afterall the Sarajevo trigger was an act of state-sponsored terrorism.<br /><br />David Shulman
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first read the Hunger Games&#34; trilogy I literally tore thru the first two books...but when it came to reading &#34;Mockingjay&#34; I held back.In fact it took me several months to actually start reading it...and even longer to finish.Why?maybe I wanted to make it last...like a good piece of chocolate . But finish it I did.<br />Naturally I saw the movie when it was released..and have seen it several times since.After my last viewing I began to re-read books 2&3. And boy did I truly appreciate both of them!This last book was amazing!i would only hope that Ms.Collins can one day revisit Katness,Peeta,Gale and their respective children and the brave new post Hunger Games World of Panem. A wonderful modern day classic.
B004PGO25O|4.0|If you are looking for some inspiration on getting started, continuing or completing a journey, this is a good and easy read to assist you in the process.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|While funny in parts, as a whole the movie lacked verisimilitude. Moreover I just wanted to reach through the screen and beat the crap out of the characters -- they were f-in clownshoes.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I found the date jumping annoying.  The concept bizarre and the characters unappealing.  I wanted to look forward to what might be happening next and then it jumped to another time and place.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|I own this movie in VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray, and each release gets better than the one before it.  Lawrence is simply one of, if not the, greatest movies of all time.  If you haven't seen it you're missing out.  If you have seen it, you need to see it on Blu-ray.  The latest digital restoration is a thing of beauty, with a bright, colorful image, and level of detail that will amaze.  The Collector's Edition is an impressive set, with a third disc of extras not found in the standard two-disc edition, a soundtrack disc, a numbered individual film cell, and large hardcover book.  I'm pleased with the the quality of the extras and would definitely recommend it to the film's afficionados.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie on TV so bought the DVD.  I often do this when I have special movies that I know I will want to watch again.  VERY good movie - an interesting take on a &#34;justice&#34; system.  Sound like fantasy? I would not be too sure the way &#34;some people&#34; in Congress have reacted to issues in our society lately!

B0042TV4IW|4.0|Endearing characters, good acting, good writing. Sometimes the sound quality and/or the British accent make it a little hard to understand, but that's a minor quibble. It's not &#34;Downton Abbey,&#34; but it's very good.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am enjoying the game.  But I don't like the idea of having content related to getting reviews.  Seriously. ..

0802473156|5.0|This is a great book to discover what your love language is and how it plays out in a relationship. When two people are speaking different languages, it can create  an environment for miscommunication or missed opportunities to connect with your partner.<br /><br />It was fun to see, in the book my preferred expression of love and how that translated into a love language. Gary Chapman shares that one of the keys to discovering  your own love language and that of your mate is listening. Not the typical multi-task approach to listening, where you are typing up an email while listening to your partner share about their day. What he means is listening with your full attention.<br /><br />This reminds me of the book, \\"How to Have a Match Made in Heaven Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating and Marriage by Ariel and Shya Kane.\\" [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]] They discovered  through listening, with your full attention, that it draws you into the moment. When you are in the moment, you are engaged with those around you and in your life. I love this book and am excited at the new possibilities I have discovered in my relationship.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I am  not a horror movie fan, and I am sure some people can't see past the violence and gore. For those people I say fine, that's your opinion. But I was lucky enough to see in person both Andy Warhol and B. Fuller, both changed my perception not only about art and media but in grasping a mentality that has kept me sane in a world of increasing insanity.<br />This is a film that pushes a lot of buttons within me, but before I can think, the tempo of the film moves me, so all I am doing is feeling, I am reacting emotionally, I am immersed in the work of art. Hat's off to Andy, Nico and the Velvet Underground for expanding my mind. I am not making a comparison, just praise for those who taught me to &#34;experience&#34;, ok while I am at it Jimmy Hendrix, John Coltrane and Pharoh Sanders cleared the path to be immersed in the art.,<br />I gave a thought to the 2 Blu-ray set, but opted for the individual media to put time between the sets so to speak. This is a movie that engages me at a level of assualt on my senses, the audio tracks add a great deal in that respect. This is in my mind worth the investment to buy the Blu-ray version.  Not all films offer more in Blu-ray, this does.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is challenging when there's more than one suit and sometimes rather frustrating, but I want to stay with it and see if I can complete it.  I found it to be more interesting when I am allowed to leave some empty slots on the board before dealing the next pac  and hence, have the abiltiy to move the cards and &#34;runs' around.  Makes more sense to me.  It takes time, so I'd recommend it to persons with patience!
0812979656|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written books in existence and despite the terrible injustices, tragedies, prejudices and sorrow described, it is still engrossing because of the sheer beauty of the language.  Story about twins born to a good mother. Amma leaves her husband, because he is a relentless alcoholic, who tries to get her to bed his boss in order to salvage his job.  Amma has no choice but to return home with her twins, though she had initially married her husband to flee her terrible family.  Amma's father is an abusive tyrant, who beats his wife, and is defeated professionally.  His sister, the aunt, falls in love with a priest in her youth, and she wrecks havoc on the entire family because of her own vanity.  Two good parents produced children of tremendous evil, and I mourn all the good lost, so causally swept away.  This is a wonderful book, so easy to read, detailed and vivid, and though there is sadness, you can't turn your eyes away.  I've read this book twice, and I was captivated each time.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Trip down memory lane. Great presentation, it made you feel like you were there. I watch it often. Thank you.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is very good just to play in your spare time. The only thing that stinks about it is that you need energy to do anything. You always start with little energy. Other than that it is great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever! This is not like the computer version, but it is made to support a lot of mobile devices. I love the app.
B008VBYN80|4.0|yup. this is a pretty cool empire building game.  you will either spend cash or progress pretty slow though. still not bad
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I love lawrence  fishburn he makes it very exciting to watch him i think he is an great actor also will, cream de la cream.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I haven't seen a Disney movie that I wouldn't give 10 Stars! I purchased this movie for my nephews but I enjoyed it just the same. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a child at heart.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved American Horror Story. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode and was sad to see this season end, not because I didn't like the ending but because I loved it so much.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Juliann's portrayal of the wronged wife and how she pulls herself up and out of the mess adds power to this series.  The twists and turns of the legal issues brings even more strength to each story.  The characters are complex, the stories exhilarating and timely.  I love this series!
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson's summary of the political conflict leading up to America's plunging into World War II is excellent, thorough, without the annoying redundancy of many such attempts to explain what happened. It shows FDR in a very different light, more cautious, more hesitant, less confident than he is usually portrayed. Her portrayals of Wilkie and Lindberg are enlightening, as well. Altogether a very satisfying read.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Enjoying this very much. Great tool for me on trips to my family and friends,love the video option. Looking forward to the summer keeping up with the days and trips.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Great book. Kept you wanting more  I should have read the first book first about the Camel Club but I didn't  I will now..
B004G81XBW|1.0|I didn't like this movie because the trailer shows a man and a woman practicing martial arts. The movie is a cartoon. The trailer was misguiding to the movie content. I would only recommend this to someone who enjoys these types of movies.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The bk2 is the best knife out there. It takes a wicked edge and the blade is bomb proof.<br />The best knife ever
B005MLOKXA|5.0|A good plot, strong characters and excellent acting keeps this series fresh and intense.  The stories are timely, the ins and outs of the law are illuminating and the conflicts these characters face in their personal and professional lives are compelling.  Great show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my family all love this game we play it non stop keep making there  kind of games you never know what world tour you'll go next
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is very dark. The beginning is confusing trying to figure out all the characters. At the half way point I started to get into the story.  Not a happy book, for sure.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Reads like a collection of little stories and not one continuous story.  Very well written narrative and is a good read for anyone interested in the zombie genre.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|I chose this movie because I was feeling nostalgic. I remembered some things about singing in school choirs and I had considered purchasing this movie once before and I never did. I sang these songs then and I remembered almost all of them. I would only recommend this movie to people who enjoy musicals. It is a classic and I hope to purchase others like it.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is the third Baldacci book I've read in the last week.  His story lines are captivating, the characters are interesting, and there is always a believable twist at the end.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|There were so many surprises in this movie: I was already primed to see a great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, but he was almost upstaged by Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of the radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens and Sally Fields as his wife. Wish I could rate this movie with one more star.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|This is just a fantastic book - it is full of intrigue from beginning to end. At no time does this book go into neutral, so you need to absorb what you read otherwise you will miss out, so no nodding off with this book!!  Just as you think you know where things are heading it takes just another turn!  The characters are wonderful and all have their own story and you somehow become part of their lives, their joys and their sorrows.  There is of course a character who I am sure everyone despises, but he is an essential part of this story.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a book with that something extra, this is it!  You will just love it and I hope you will enjoy turning each page just as much as I did.  Enjoy!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really like this series so far. I have only watched episodes 1 through 4 but it makes me want to watch more. This is like a combination between a Porn Film, Lord of the Rings, and a drama. Overall Watch it because it will make you love it.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I love these types of shooter games! When I saw this app I had to get it. Pretty old school but it's a fun ride through space! If you get it, enjoy!
B0083Z614S|4.0|I liked this book because I found it easy and enjoyable. I found some parts funny, especially when Mary gives Colin a taste of his own medicine. I think adults and children would enjoy it. The story has lovely descriptions of springtime and nature and Burnett easily paints a picture for us of the secret garden.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Nerds rule! Really! I just finished reading Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan and I have arrived at my opening statements as a result of reading this book. I loved this book. It was unlike anything else I have read which is unusual because I read a lot, and I did not want to stop reading it, which is one of the best criteria for choosing a great book. Of course Mr. Penumbra’s name, which refers to:  1. The partially shaded outer region of the shadow cast by an opaque object, or 2. The shadow cast by the earth or moon over an area experiencing a partial eclipse gives us a great big clue that we are about to explore something or somewhere mysterious. Clay Jannon is our guide to solving the enigma that consumes his life once he is hired to work the overnight shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore. Clay has just lost his job which involved designing web ads for a shop called NewBagel whose mission was to bring New York City style bagels to San Francisco; a store which failed. He is operating in the current tough job market. His new job with Mr. Penumbra is saving his lifestyle.<br /><br />Clay’s roommate Mat is an artist who is gradually turning the common space in their apartment into a simulated city (not computer simulated either). His other roommate is Ashley Ames. He is best friends with Neel Shah who has made himself rich with software that provides body parts, especially boobs to game designers (these are digital in nature). Through the bookstore he meets a few “normal” people including Kat Potente who works at everyone’s dream company, Google. He also meets a string of very eccentric and “original” people who are the actual clientele of the back shelves of this bookstore. It is this group of borrowers that Clay must especially keep track of. He accepts the book s/he has finished with its totally incomprehensible title and he provides her/him with another tome with an equally incomprehensible, but new, title, which often has to be retrieved via a ladder from far up near the very high ceiling of the back room of the bookstore. Clay also must write a detailed description of the borrower, his/her demeanor, attire and any exchanges that took place in the set of log books behind his desk. He is apparently free to read and use his computer when he is not busy with customers (which is almost always).<br /><br />Clay and his friends become interested in figuring out what is going on with these strange bookstore clients who do not buy books but simply borrow books. Why do the books look so old and plainly bound? Why do these, let’s call them interesting, characters act like they are involved in some kind of weighty research using books that are obviously written in some kind of code. What bunch of IT and art nerds would not be in nirvana with such a meaty mystery to submit to their computer algorithms for answers. Is the internet up to it? Can Google, google it? The collision between very old school books and computers reverberates like a gong through the lives of all the new and old people in Clay’s life. Fun, fun, fun and also makes you wonder if the whole book is a riddle or puzzle. If you solve it please let me know. I have some ideas but they would be spoilers so I will keep them to myself.be retrieved via a ladder from far up near the very high ceiling of the back room of the bookstore.

B009QU9X44|4.0|I borrow (as is the case with the title of this review) words and phrases from this great author.<br /><br />I was \\"excited\\" and in \\"awe\\" as the pages unfolded, revealing familiar and refreshingly new views through a modern style of using blogging to narrate an intricate tale of Love, Culture,Race and Gender as part of the package.  Unlike \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" and \\"The Purple Hibiscus\\"  I believe this book, Americanah will find a broader audience, as it resonates with most Black women, women of colour, Africans, specifically South Africa, as \\"race\\" has been a part of our lives for the past 500 years.<br /><br />The racism truths as expressed through various characters in the book, resonates with me especially, as we come upon such characters daily in South Africa - 19 years into our democracy, most discussions around this topic has become uncomfortable, although there is a definite volcanic brewing of things unsaid, thoughts not expressed, wounds not healed on this topic.<br /><br />The descriptions of the USA cities, culture and people is welcoming, especially nostalgic when she writes about the Obama election campaign through to the Presidential inauguration, presenting a myriad of American views through her blogging, but successfully convincing me that she was right there, in the midst of this very historical and momentous time in history.<br /><br />We find on the continent of Africa, many who had received education in the USA, and some of them struggle with identity issues, self hatred and continue to fast talk themselves through life, many times never embracing truly where they belong and drift between places for a life time.<br />For every black women everywhere, the discussions, blogging and views on hair is welcoming and narrated lightly, without bias - a simple truth, Many of us have at times aspired to UN-BLACK our hair, and have experienced the sting that comes with remaining true to your natural hair-state, but many realise that time when embracing your natural hair, is perhaps symbolic of embracing your essence as a human or woman.  I love the idea of seeing a well know Black woman like Beyonce in her natural form.<br /><br />The American white-woman character \\"Kimberley\\" is a welcoming addition which to me illustrates the roles of many women who confine themselves to a safe place, avoiding life at all cost.  She allows her fears to develop into a life long \\"people pleasing\\" persona, in stark contrast with her sister \\"Laura\\" who is on a quest to be proven right at all times.  \\"Laura\\" needs the weaker sister \\"Kimberley\\" to affirm her own basic, limited and self righteous views to sustain herself.  \\"Laura's\\" views about Africa is at times humorous, as she quotes from tabloids and magazines, affirming her limited understanding of the American's saving grace towards the orphaned and \\"dark\\" African continent.<br /><br />The simplicity of  the love story between Ifemelu and Obinze is perhaps refreshingly a truth we all aspire to in our quest for love, regardless of where we find ourselves.  After her experience of love with the White American and the African American, she continues to yearn for Obinze - that realness - a place where she could be truly herself and where she feels finally at \\"home\\". I quote \\"Her relationship with him was like being content in a house but always sitting by the window and looking out\\".  But before she comes to this realisation she experiences necessary awakening life lessons, at times painful, but leading to a place of accepting her true self.<br /><br />In the end, which to me is also the beginning, Ifemelu who started her journey as an idealistic determined young girl, opinionated and having readily answers about life and love, discovers that there is more to her limited view of the world, not necessarily right or wrong, but she uses her experiences to reflect and her blogging to express, and gain insight into others - and learning finally Reverence.
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Love this band love this disc. I love the fact they didnt just make the first album over again. Not as straight forward metal as the first, but that makes it even better to me. This band doesnt want to stay the same and that is a good thing.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I only give five star reviews for books which are life-changing, and this one is. It has everything - an original and perfectly constructed concept, fully fleshed out characters (even the minor ones) and a shock-a-minute plot. Plus it is masterfully written. Amazing. And as the cherry on the top, the author seems like a really nice guy.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|This application fills the need to be able to write notes, lists, and comments on the Kindle HD Fire (7&#34;).
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a real fun game for the family and it passes time when you're bored on those lazy days.
B0072S9KU4|5.0|This movie is different. The story is a couple of allied commando's on D-day World War 2 who are creating a diversion on one of the Channel Islands held by the Germans. Trouble is the Germans in their quest for a super weapon via the supernatural have raised a demon that eats flesh. You guessed it the Germans got eaten except one, he needs the help of  the surviving commando to send it back to Hell or so he said. This is not very fast paced movie, but it does move along well, and I liked the acting from everybody, very credible and creepy. I totally appreciate that this film's lighting was bright enough you could see what was going on and the gore was all there to see (special effects team nice job), no murky picture either all crisp and clear. I recommend this movie.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I enjoy watching this series over and over again. Great entertainment. Intriguing and not offensive in any way, thank you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Have to play every day! Wish it was easier to earn bingo chips so I could play it more often!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This CD was for my husband and he loves it.  He plays it in the car constantly. Even though he can't understand the words, he loves the music and Andrea Bocelli's voice.
0307887960|5.0|yes, this diet works and getting the OATS here is even better!  Great book , easy reading and the diet works!
B007EC27QM|4.0|I find this very easy to use and very convenient.  I like the fact that it shows the previous calculation.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|this is a rather fast moving game and it does hold my attention for a long time each time I play it
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great novel by Nicholas Sparks. Love the way Katie perseveres and reinvents herself after bravely leaving such a volitile marriage. Love the romance that blossoms and my favorite was the complete and unexpected twist at the end! Couldn't put this book down!
0399157565|4.0|I am so pleased that PC has gone back to her usual stories/plots.  I did not care for the way-out stuff.  This keep you wondering & you can't get your nose out of the book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun game and a great time killer. I haven't made to the point where every one says it resets but getting closer. It's just fun to play.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|A lot of reviewers said they weren't happy with the appearance of the film as far as colors - I didn't see anything wrong with it. It is just as I remember from watching it when I was a little girl. I had no problems with the functionality of playing the dvd and was happy with my purchase. It was definitely the real deal - not a bootlegged copy as some experienced. I am guessing that those who received a bootleg copy may have purchased it from a different seller rather than Amazon. Mine even came with the Disney Movie Rewards code, which worked fine when I entered it online. Overall a great deal, considering most Disney movies that are \\"in the vault\\" are significantly overpriced!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A cogent reminder that we need to be more conscious of unconscious sexism. The field is still not a level playing field. Every man and woman in the workforce should read this.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|I enjoyed it as long as it was free to me.  I don't like that if I want to continue playing, I have to pay for it
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I found out about these books before the movies came out so I rushed to read them before seeing the movie.  I liked the first one and the second one was decent.  The last one was a large letdown.  Rather than taking this in a positive direction and having the character triumph over the adversity, she instead seems weak and completely broken.  It would have been nice to have some ray of hope in the end.  I'd also liked it if there was actually a good side to root for.  It seemed quite a depressing way to end what was a great start to a trilogy.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I am a CW buff & think the movie is so realistic.  There are a few errors in the movie but they can be overlooked because of the history of the 13th. Amendment.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was a great sequel to the selection. There were so many unexpected events but they all fit together.  Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have learned a lot about horses from this and I like all the fun things to do.. I just wish it was easier to earn gems without using anything on Google play... I'm on a kindle fire and can't uses Google play
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|only thing it needs is some more heroes but an awesome game. best game on tablet, kindle, or ipad. I recommend this game to any and all
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A magnificent book.  Haven't seen the movie yet, but friends tell me it's awesome.  Will read this one again very soon..
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is abed back to the movies in a few weeks back to do a good thing for the past year ago I was introduced in Lexington now and then when you want to meet at Kroger the same time songs
0812982622|1.0|This is magic realism in North Korea and with the present situation it is not politically wise.<br />The chracters are confusing  and the plot jumps around. While I belieive an author has a right<br />to express himself this most  disturbing novel does nolthing to really educate us about North Korea<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I read widely and everything but this was a big disppointment.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed first jack reacher novel; kept me reading.  I am going on to the next one quickly.  Loved it
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|With the great actors in this movie, and the interesting subject, I expected alot more from this movie.  Maybe Hitchcock as a person just wasn't as interesting as you would believe.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|It remainded true to the feel of the entire series.  Hard to see such a great series end. I did not watch the series when it was on and watched the entire series over a couple of months. Even when viewed in a compact time compared to the years of the orginal airing there were not obvious story irregularities.  Jack becomes more &#34;broken&#34; over time which is to be expected.  The ending scene was great.  After so many hours of viewing I missed him when it was over.  That is the mark of a good story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|After doing umpteen HO games,this was a nice change of pace. This was a great game,but,I agree with a couple of the other reviews in that it was too short.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|It's the best CD I've lately bought, love it :) Hope you guys come out soon with something new :)
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Anything but firefox, google, safari or microsoft.. No it doesn't render everything perfect but for me its close enough and speedy.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Good story and no surprises.  I knew how it would end less then half way through.  Probably why I'm not a love story type of person.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun. Keep playing to earn coins. Love that it was free. I'm still on the beginning part & I keep getting caught. Try it.
0307476073|1.0|The first paragraph captivated me. The sentence on page 57, &#34;I got an abortion and learned how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky...&#34; made me put the book down.  Guess having an abortion is right up there with making camp food.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it is the best angry birds game ever even better than angry birds star wars the only thing I hate is that when you get the update it deleted allmy progress
B009JNXK88|1.0|Never got a chance to play it because it would not work on my phone. Not sure it was a problem with the game or my phone so I just deleted it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app is ok,  I was used to a local station, but couldn't find that one for my kindle that worked.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie, and this one is good.  The two discs allowed me to keep one and give one to them.
B00499K9E0|2.0|It was with egger anticipation that I ordered Sherlock season one.  I had heard that it had been the inspiration for CBS's show Elementary.  I was disappointed.  Although in premise the two shows are the same, in execution there is much more depth to Elementary.  The Sherlock characters seem stiff cliches in comparison.  Sherlock is edited in an trendy avant garde style akin to music videos with lots of jump cuts, interspersed city shots, and on screen text.  Elementary is more a drama of personalities, the editing focuses on what people are thinking and their interactions as well as the plot dialog.  Where Elementary's sleuth is a quirky but sympathetic character, Sherlock's Sherlock is snotty, arrogant and unlikeable.  Sherlock's Watson is only a plot foil; Elementary's Watson has her own issues and dark challenges to contend with.  That only three episodes were included in the season one DVD I consider another strike against it.  The contrived cliff hanger of episode three was enough, strike three.  For me it's elementary:  Elementary on CBS.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is FANTASTIC!!! the only down side- my homework wont be getting done any time soon. this game offers different choices of fun and exiting things to do with the ppls hair. me and me friend go crazy over this game because it is so fun and awesome! this game is highly reccomended. TOTALY worth the $3.00!!!!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good job. Fun game. Could have more detail on what an item is. Otherwise having a good time playing it so far
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I beat this game. Its so much fun and you can play it over and over and as many times as you like. They also have special achievements and challenges. The game doesn't work that well on my phone or tablet but great on the computer or laptop.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It was simple and I had so much fun playing it. The puzzles were hard enough to make you think, but easy enough that you can do it on your own. I had no problems with it loading or playing.
B00351YEVC|5.0|Having the story narrated by Bruno made it all the more real.  So well written and I really enjoyed this book.  I was totally blown away by the ending.  Fantastic book that will stay with me for a very long time.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|I have read some fiction from the Tudor era (Philippa Gregory, Susan Kay, Susan Higginbotham).  This was my first non-fiction.  I found it just as interesting and almost as readable.  Ms. Weir does a great job of putting the events in the context of the times (e.g. the role of women and royal succession).  Other reviewers have commented that it jumps around.  I attribute that to Ms. Weir writing it thematically, not chronologically.  The Chronology at the beginning was helpful in tracking concurrent but unrelated events, but I had to keep flipping back to it.  It would have been nice to have some tie-ins (while Katherine Parr was doing this while Anne Boleyn was doing this).  I also noted the formatting errors on the Kindle version.  Unfortunately, the Genealogical Tables, which probably would have been very helpful, were unreadable on my Kindle.  Having not read any other non-fiction, I can't say whether Ms. Weir was biased in favor of Katherine of Aragon and against Anne Boleyn; she seems to have documented what happened well.  Not so well-documented in the text is her reference to Jane Grey being beaten by her parents.  I will look for other books by this author.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I don't often find myself watching shows about the lives of teenagers, however since I find myself using the word &#34;Awkward&#34; often, I thought I would give this one a go.<br /><br />The show is well written, and addresses some interesting issues that in High School were prevalent for me as well. There is a need/desire to be liked, and sometimes we find ourselves doing things solely for the purpose of being liked. How can we go through the natural growth and emotional development and be true to ourselves.<br /><br />One comment I would have is that it isn't realistic that 2 handsome jocks fight over someone who might be classified as an outsider... not sure that is realistic.<br /><br />The &#34;mean girls&#34; have some really interesting character development... through the seasons you are able to see that they too have their own insecurities they deal with... and how we deal with these differs.<br /><br />I will keep watching, as long as the show is around... I recommend watching. If you have ever been a teenager, or will have one one day... Definitely worth your time. (Plus the episodes are only 30 mins long.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this series is right !  I hope more American studios are paying attention - this is the way movie making should be!
0553381695|4.0|Got this as a gift for someone who had all the books except for this one, now the book set is complete. Definitely a Game of Throwns fan and the books are always better.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Only missing Roger Waters, but this is one of my favorite concerts.  David Gilmour really shows what he's got in this concert.
B00AI5AQPQ|3.0|Impossible to understand the words from the songs - too miked and high pitched voices of children in English accents.  Good staging and choreography.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I was anticipating something as great as the Lord of the Rings.  This does not compare to the past movies.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Its nothing special. It could have been so much better than what it was. It was kind of cheesy at some parts but its a tarantino movie so its worth watching.
0802473156|1.0|I bought this with a friend of mine coz we heard so much about it. We had the biggest laugh going through it. It's really just common sense thats been fluffed up and stretched to make a book.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Definitely not a Hollywood-Bruce Willis type of movie.<br />It does show (within the constraints of a movie) what our Intelligence people were up against over the years since Sept 11.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have been a Bond fan forever.  I think that Daniel Craig is the best of them all.  He shows some of the &#34;old Bond actors, humor&#34;, and his own style at the same time.  Great action.
B00683JLXA|2.0|I agree that this game does have a likeness to that of Angry Birds in reference to strategy of game play. However, there is an obvious difference in quality. The graphics are ok, but they are not fabulous. What I wonder about and have an issue with is the mechanics of the game. Though the objective is easy enough, the maneuvering tasks are not. However, all of this was discovered on my first generation Kindle Fire, as playing this game on my Samsung Galaxy SIII was simply impossible, and my patience was limited.<br /><br />I give two stars for the music.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|We owned this on VHS and had to purchase on DVD since VHS players are outdated.  Loved it when it came out and love it today.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is very fun,  very simple game play,  but it is very addictive.  The graphic is awesome and very  funny.  One of my favourite games.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The angry birds franchise has consumed 100's of hours of my life.  The perfect little game for when you have a spare moment or unwinding at the end of the day.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|They could have kept it cute, but some of the main characters are from a first person shooter game and the &#34;commander&#34; is a woman, while completely covered, is still inappropriate. And it's just too scary for my kids 3, 6, and 9yrs. I think you have to be a pretty big gamer to get all the references too.  Too bad Disney couldn't keep this one clean.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an excelent way of mixing classical instruments into modern music, i really enjoy every piece... Recomended for everyone that love classical or for those Who want to enter into classical music hearing
B0013ND36G|4.0|Overall, the movie was pretty good, but Nick Stahl was not the best choice for John Connor. I was also a bit disappointing at how much a pansy the character was written since he is supposed to be the savior of mankind.
B001NTHCXK|5.0|Great story based on real life. The dynamics between Redford and Streep is amazing - like the real characters which the movie is based on. The clothing fashion is fascinating, also.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I have been in IT for years and this book resonated with me.It is a good story and it reveals the true nature of life as an executive in a high profile software company. Kudos!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was good enough. Loved the part with doppelganger enemies and the climax was kinda unpredictable. Overall it's worth the time
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely can't stay off this site. It is so interesting. And filled with great info. Love it. I have told everyone I know about this site. I hate it took so long for me to discover the site.
B00881PTRC|3.0|When you &#34;lose&#34; a round, the game place YELLOW text on a white screen to show you the letters you missed. Not enough contrast. Dumb choice. Otherwise okay game.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I am in the process of reading and following this particular fasting method to dieting.  I love the book because it not only explains the process but also gives the reader many fasting meals to follow.  I totally recommend this book.
0811879542|5.0|My son loves the book!!!! This is going to be one of my favorite books now!!! Go buy one for your child!!!!! Very interactive and allows you to bond with your child!!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This album is remarkable in classic Depeche Mode style. Electronica at its best. It comes with an insert of pictures of the band and all the song lyrics.  This album is a must have for every Depeche fan! Love it love it!
0807014273|5.0|[[ASIN:0807014273 Man's Search for Meaning]]Written from a personal point of view, and based on his actual experience Frankl is both fiercely direct in describing the atrocities he experienced in Germany in the 1930's and unexpectedly inspiring in his personal reflections about coping with the daily life brutally thrust upon him.  Because this is written from one man's point of view, the work is very personal and engaging...you can put yourself in his place through his writings.  As such, the book goes beyond merely listing historical facts and dates, and goes to the heart of the matter of the challenge for an individual who must find survival resources within himself.
B000YJ6736|3.0|In the beginning of the story character development good, started to care about two main characters...in end they are forgettable.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This is a fun game and kind of hard after a while. If you like bridges and building things and working with your brain you will like this game.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors. Her story line and plot never fail to keep me holding on with bated breath until the very end.
B000001FT2|4.0|wonder if there is a music video collection available?<br /><br />fascinating, weird and danceable tracks. have other albums waiting in the queue
B0097HSS4M|2.0|I worked on some pictures with this app and lost the pictures!  In fact, one of the pictures I adjusted with this app simply disappeared completely...original and finished pic!  I just wonder if I am the only one with this problem.  As of today, I will not recommend this app to anyone.  I am very frustrated.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Even though ima teenager I love this game. It's fun and it makes me miss being a little kid. This game is great no matter how old you are you'll still have fun playing it. The tasks it gives you are easy it's just over all fun
B00957T6X6|5.0|I had read the first two books when they were first published and enjoyed them very much. In a series, sometimes it is easy to get distracted and forget to read the next books which is what I did until a friend of my daughter loaned her the first two seasons of the HBO series based on these books. The TV movies are very well done and I also recommend seeing it too but the storyliine is not quite followed exactly.<br /><br />I enjoy knowing what the author had in mind in the books, knowing all of the reasons for the drama and how the background info ties each character together with the others.<br /><br />My only complaint is that once I finish the 5th book this week, I will have to wait for the next to be published to find out what happens next. The good news though is that Amazon will send me an email announcement when it is published so I will not forget to get the next book :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a fantastic show. It holds your attention from the moment you start until you finish. It is impossible to watch this show and not become attached to the characters.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I waited for many years for this ending. Many turns, twists, and sad notes. Well worth the wait. Thank you, Robert Jordan for your vision, and Brandon Sanderson for the clarity and skill to finish his work.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This game is very entertaining and fun! I am trying to find more games by fantasy flight because this is so fun!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Flight, for me, is one of those movies that takes you completely by surprise. The way I understood it from the trailer we had a pilot (Denzel Washington) who does the unthinkable by saving close to 100 people in a plane crash. Then it turns out that doctors found high alcohol levels in his blood after performing a toxicology report while he was unconscious. Now, originally, I thought Flight was going to be a movie about him proving his innocence. Maybe someone set him up or something of that nature, but I was completely wrong.<br /><br />Flight follows the story of Whip Whitaker (Washington) after the aforementioned plane crash. What the trailer didn't tell you was that Whitaker is a raging alcoholic and, essentially, that's what this entire movie is about. Yes, there is a plane crash and yes he did save those people, but that lays the groundwork for something much more powerful. On the surface you have the plane crash, but when you dig deeper it's a strong story about alcoholism and drug addiction.<br /><br />While in the hospital recovering from his, surprisingly, mild injuries, Whitaker meets a drug addict by the name of Nicole (Kelly Reilly). These two eventually form a bond when Whip finds her being thrown out of her apartment complex not too long after he was released from the hospital. After we reach this point in the story things start to get really serious as the viewer starts to see just how bad Whip's alcoholism really is.<br /><br />One of the things I found most enjoyable about Flight was not only the powerful narrative, but the strong character development as well. As you watch Whip constantly get hammered it's hard not to feel something towards his character. Time and time again we see him attempt to quit and every time I found myself rooting for him, but he just doesn't have the willpower to put down the bottle of whatever his drink of choice is that night. It's almost heartbreaking becauseyou can tell that he wants to stop, but he can't.<br /><br />Then there's Nicole. Towards the beginning of the movie I had a hard time understanding what her role was in the big picture because they give you little to no explanation about why she's there, but eventually her role becomes more apparent and, just like Whip, you feel for her. The only difference is that she truly wants to get clean. So she gets herself a job and starts going to AA meetings. Now I don't know how difficult it is to play a recovering addict, but Reilly did a fantastic job at portraying the constant struggle that these individuals have to go through to avoid a relapse.<br /><br />Along with the main gunners you have the supporting cast which consists of Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, and John Goodman. Cheadle plays Whip's lawyer Hugh Lang. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like everything I see Cheadle in he's basically playing the same character with a different occupation. He's not a bad actor by any means, it just feels like he gives off the same persona in every role and that stops the viewer from creating any sort of emotional attachment with the character. With that said, he did a solid job as Hugh and I couldn't help but chuckle at a few of his facial expressions towards the end of the film. Bruce Greenwood plays Whip's old friend Charlie Anderson (talk about a plain name) who works for the airline's pilots union. He doesn't get a lot of screen time, but he gave a solid performance in the scenes he was in. Then you have Goodman who plays the hilarious drug dealer Harling Mays. What I loved about Goodman's character, other than his fantastic performance, was that it provided just enough comic relief so the movie didn't feel like an emotional burden. This is a serious topic so that little spice of comedy scattered throughout allows you to enjoy the story without leaving depressed.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - To say that Flight caught me off guard would be an understatement. I went in expecting one thing and instead was given a very powerful story about drug and alcohol dependency. Denzel comes through with another fantastic performance proving once again that he can bring just about any character to life. Couple that with a solid supporting cast and you have yourself a nice little film. It's hard for me not to recommend Flight because I grew up with family members who dealt with the same issues that are addressed in this film. Still, I understand that it's not for everyone, but if you have the time I definitely recommend you give it a chance.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is a great series as most of the series on the USA network are. It is also very affordable compared to some other network series. You will get hooked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know the price may seem expensive especially for a game&hellip;but its TOTALLY worth it!! You can explore and find rare items such as:  diamonds gold and other rare items. You can get in battles too
B000002ETI|4.0|An excellent but now dated collection of songs in this CD. It shows Julio's abilities and illustrates why he became famous, with its catchy tunes and well known lyrics. I'd recommend this for anyone with an interest in Latin American music because it is one of his most famous works and he is one of the best Spanish singers ever.<br /><br />Un excelente CD pero ahora quizas la colecion ha pasado su mejor tiempo. Si que muestra la habilidad de Julio y porque llego a ser famoso, dado la musica y la letra estan muy conocidos. Lo recomiendo para todos con interes en la musica del mundo hispano, porque este CD es un de sus obras mejores y el es un de los mejores cantantes Espanoles jamas.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The mystery was good and kept my interest.  However, the use of curse words took away from the novel.  The curse words didn't fit the characters, but seemed to have been added to give more &#34;excitement,&#34; but instead detracted from the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! There's always an update coming out and you can kill creepers, skeletons, spiders and more. There is also diamond tools and armor you can mine, create nether reactors or kill animals like sheep, cows, and pigs
B0015DWLD0|2.0|This book shed light on the lower and upper castes of India. There was corruption and murder-and the author wandered about telling his story.  The journey was tedious giving me another reason not to visit the area.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|This 2-disc set met all of my expectations with all of the tunes I was looking for! It is a great creation of music!
B00683JLXA|1.0|this app is exactly the same as angry birds but angry birds has better graphics and better flinging action, and it dosn't run well on my kindle fire at all, over all I would not recommend this game
B001NN4162|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. It is always entertaining. I can not wait to show this movie to my future kids.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudors is one of my all time favorite series.  It is well written and directed, the sets and costumes are gorgeous and the acting is phenomenal.  It's a great way to learn about English history and just very entertaining.
B000002J09|5.0|I bought the Lp album in 1977 & don't know where it went, and besides I don't have a record player anymore. I loved the music then & still love it Today
B00B2166BS|5.0|When I first ordered it, I was a bit skeptical.  But when I received it and plugged it in....  Wow...  The feel and the performance felt OEM.  If you have a nexus 10, Its a must have.  It charges faster the the micro USB charger, too.
B0000630BT|5.0|The only thing I can say about this masterpiece,is that this is the best metal album in the last 25 years!!!No doubt about it.From Painkiller to One shot at glory every song kills!!!I would give it 10 stars out of 5,unfortunately it's impossible.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|sarah silverman was great. if for nothing else- watch it for venellope von schweetz. watched it twice! fun for kids
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app, this has a lot of options. I am a very satisfied customer. Order this app, worth your while
B009AMANH4|5.0|I liked this because it gave more insight as to how hard it was to get anything passed then (Like today)
1451695195|5.0|Fantastic for me, because of the grthound-breaking science witnesses by a renouned surgeon.A first for those who follow<br />&#34;after death &#34; experiences.It can no longer be said that these experiences are functions of the unconscious brain because<br />the authors brain was silenced ....shut down.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|this movie was beyond bad.  but I don't know any words that would sum up how we felt about this movie that wouldn't get me kicked off Amazon.com.  so you're stuck with bad.  just bad.  raunchy for sure (probably should have expected that from Judd Apatow, but didn't expect it to be that way right out of the gate).  but if you've got $4 and 12 minutes to waste, here's your movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that you have a choice of a random deal or a winning deal. you can play a quick game in 2 or 3 minutes.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Love this time waster! Is highly addictive, at least for me it was. Does get a little repetitive, but at least it becomes more challenging as well. One of the better FAOTD offerings.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This told some of the political problems in France.  It also had a great story line.  I didn't think I would like a story in song but I did.
B0000013G9|5.0|Good service.  R.I.P. Left Eye!  TLC forever!  This was the best TLC album!  This album had evolved the group to become women and provided a new sound for all the fans to love.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Over thirty dollars for a BluRay? I think not. Shell this out and you can expect more of the same abuse from this company. They are testing the waters and determining what the public will bear! If there is a 3D version, we expect it to be included for this price...otherwise Disney...NO DEAL. Show some constraint people...say \\"NO\\".
B0053O89KG|5.0|the yen & yang of the leads is great, I'm glad they are getting the supporting rolls more depth, great.
0307744434|5.0|A love story of a little girl and a little boy who grow up and find each other competing against one another's powers in the circus setting. Vivid and memorizing descriptions of the magic, emotions, and rich circus characters. An absolute page-turner that will not disappoint!
0790734060|5.0|one of my favorite movies ever. when i have more money i'll buy it on dvd, but the vhs price was definitely very reasonable and totally worth it. the vhs plays fine, no tracking problems or anything.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think lots of people will download this then get addicted to it I'm already addicted so download this I think you guys will be addicted.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|As someone who enjoys intelligent writing, and good political drama, I could not be more pleased with this series.  Previously, I had separately purchased DVD's of the first three seasons for around $20 each.  Unfortunately, the second season had two defective episodes on one DVD (Not purchased from Amazon).  I sent that set back and received another set with the exact same defect in the exact same places. I also returned that set and got my money back.<br /><br />When the complete series went &#34;on sale&#34; with Amazon, I could not pass up the offer.  Prior to purchasing this set from Amazon, I had already seen the whole seven seasons multiple times, on TV, Netflix, and the individual DVD's.  I re-watched all seven seasons of the series on the DVDs that I purchased from Amazon and the playback was totally flawless--not a single glitch.  My only complaint is that I just wish the show would have continued on for a few more years, but Amazon had no control over that :)
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel Washington does not disappoint the viewer with his portrayal of the flawed character.  You wish for him, you believe in him, but you must endure the process!
B004AUGJS8|5.0|Let's face it, I would be entertained watching Ryan watch paint dry (especially if his shirt is off).<br /><br />However, both him and Kirsten have great chemistry in this engaging story. I don't want to give too much of the story away but Ryan plays a character dealing with significant trauma from something he experienced as a child and shows how this affects him as an adult. Kirsten, his wife, is unaware of how disturbed Ryan's character is and is in love with him so much so that she see past the initial signs. I highly recommend watching these two very talented actors in this well written, well directed, and under promoted movie.
B00B4804KS|4.0|Jurrasic Park is a modern classic, not great, but fun. I got the 3D version which is slightly better than most 3D upscaling, but nowhere near what can be done if filmed in 3D.<br />Is the 3D version worth the extra money? Not unless one counts in the need to support the 3D technology's financial viability.<br />The best 3D I have seen so far is \\"Dial M for Murder\\", and \\"Avatar\\". I use those movies as my benchmark, and this misses that target by a long ways in my opinion.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator that I keep on the carousel of my Kindle.  Large keys and easy to use.  For large projects I prefer my 10 key or a spreadsheet, but for figuring out quick math this is the calculator that I go to.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|OMG.  ST Voyager is the bomb.  It is the ending which is so readily desired to see.  I would watch every season all over again.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Game is very cool & fun just like hang man, without paper! But since I have downloaded it I have continued getting game advertisements that are annoying.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|This movie makes me appreciate who Nelson Mandela even more so. The story is based on his Presidency and how he influenced a nation divided after the end of apartheid. It shows how much he sacrificed in his personal life to fight for equal rights and how forgiving and gracious he was after he was freed from prison. Though everyone was now free, there were still deep emotional wounds that needed to heal. Mr. Mandela felt that the South African ruby team would be a catalyst to help bring the nation together. And the rest, they say, is history... though, for this movie, really is the case.<br /><br />Warning: do not watch with a New Zealand ruby fan--said person will likely still be upset about what happens with the All Blacks.
0062200399|5.0|The idea for Stardust came to author Neil Gaiman when he saw a falling star and wondered what would happen if it actually landed on earth. Just like that Stardust was born. It tells the story of Tristran Thorn, the half-fairy child of a humble farmer in the town of Wall. One night, Tristran sees a star fall, and vows to the woman of his dreams he will bring it back for her. He crosses into Fairy to bring the star back, but when the star turns out to be a woman named Yvaine, everything changes. Soon the two are being chased by evil witches and treacherous brothers. They are offered help along the way, but everything is not as it appears.<br /><br />Finding excellence in Neil Gaiman's writing is no challenge. With works like Sandman, American Gods, Anansi Boys, Coraline, and dozens of short stories, Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. Stardust is no exception. The most significant, positive aspect of Stardust is the way characters develop. Tristran begins the story as a heart-sick, one-track minded kid. Slowly, as he accepts help from others and learns about himself, he develops into a man. The changes are so gradual in all the characters the reader feels they are growing right along with them.<br /><br />There are no problems with this book. From the superb writing inside, to the beautiful binding outside, Stardust is great. Some readers, who are reading this book after having first seen the movie version, will find some major differences. The changes don't affect either one, but some readers may get frustrated.<br /><br />The 15th anniversary of Stardust is a beautiful edition of a fantastic book. Whether a long-time lover of Neil Gaiman, or just starting out with his books, Stardust is an excellent addition to anyone's library.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|User friendly.I am sufficiently satisfied to NOT explore the other search engines.<br />Have found answers to all my queries to date.
B006M9NI48|3.0|\\"The Secret\\" was my introduction into the Law of Attraction. It piqued my interest in that topic and it made me want to know much more about it. However, I was sorely disappointed not to be given much in terms of how to apply The Secret to day-to-day-life.<br />I have since then read a few books on the same subject by different authors. To anyone who wants to get more guidance putting it into practice, I recommend Jonathan Manske's \\"The Law of Attraction Made Simple\\".
B0001DMPVI|5.0|A tribute to the genius of Eric and the Animals., true genius! I've read some reviews that the engineering of this product was ponderous at best,I definitely refute that! How close they come to recapturing the original concept of this monumental album is scary, to say the least.I realized  that I had never heard \\"Sky Pilot\\" in stereo (entirely possible I 'm so retro) well, last night, through my MP3 player and earbuds, I was astounded at the stereo separation alone and I had never heard that Eric true voice on the previous mixes. I was even spotted singing\\"Orange and Red Beams\\" while at work.In the day, Tom Wilson and Richard Perry were the techs behind the boards,while musician's visions were tried with experimental styles of recording. Sometimes,the vision becomes immortal ,other times it fails to hit the mark. But we're so over that and gratified that someone cared enough to try.Nothing is perfect in an imperfect world so,do embrace the concept and enjoy this CD  in the spirit it was conceived. ************'s. Keith
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|...need I write anything else?<br /><br />Ok, I will because even if you've never seen any of Seth's other work (namely &#34;Family Guy&#34;), Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are great. And let's face it... who comes up with a story about a talking teddy bear that turns into an adult, so to speak, and drinks, smokes pot, hangs out with hookers, and gets into fights? Seth is either incredibly brilliant or completely crazy but whatever drives his creativity makes for a very funny movie.
1608871452|4.0|Most fans of the show Supernatural have dreamed of traveling with the Winchester brothers as they hunt monsters, myths, and demons. The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester is about as close as it gets. This oversized coffee table book chronicles the Winchester's history, broken into the events of each season. Intermixed are interviews with actors, directors, special effects artists, and costuming directors. The coolest feature to this book is all the extras shoved in. Posters, stickers, pictures, and postcards are included for the readers' enjoyment. There are smaller pamphlets on exorcism, roadmaps, and killing monsters tucked in the pages as well.<br /><br />For Supernatural fans, this book is fantastic. The only thing that could have made it better would be the inclusion of some material that couldn't be found in the show. Some back-story on the characters, or even the monsters, would have made this book worth way more than the $50.00 price tag. Regardless, whether you leaf through the pages while watching reruns, or sit down and read it straight through, this book is a must-have for any fan of the show.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh has loved the blues his whole life and enjoys singing these old songs with great soul. I've seen the video too and it's the next I want to get, you get to see the great spirit of the BLUES  by Hugh and some oldies down in the greatest town of the blues New Orleans.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|I liked some of them but I think they could have picked better songs I like the vanhalen one and heart but there could have better choses if you like cover songs buy great muscians then you will like this album I would say buy it to my friends
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was pretty good. It was totally different from the other books.Took nearly two days to read this thing. It could be longer. Jeff could do better. Needs more information!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What happened  Diary of a Wimpy Kid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:(
B000HF702E|4.0|This is a cute kids' movie I purchased for my grandchildren.  I'd seen it many years ago and own it on VHS as well as this DVD purchase.  It entertains them.
0812993292|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is the story of a man lost in his own life. After retiring from his job, Harold spends most of his days reclined in his easy chair in rural England. When Harold receives a letter from a long time co-worker informing him she is dying of cancer, Harold doesn't know what to do. Before long he is on the road, walking to visit his long-lost friend 500 miles away.<br /><br />Possibly the best aspect of this book is how closely it follows the model of many pilgrimage books before it. Much like The Pilgrim's Progress a solitary figure sets out with a goal in mind. Some days he meets helpful characters, and some days he is sent off course by others' selfish desires. Author Rachel Joyce takes this story a step beyond a simple pilgrimage by allowing the character to work through his family history, and come to terms with lifelong issues like abandonment and neglect.<br /><br />It seems a bit clich&eacute; to say there is nothing wrong with this book, but upon finishing the last page there were no imperfections to speak of. Every page is perfectly crafted, and it feels by turning the page you are traveling along with Harold. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a journey anyone can benefit from taking.

B003U4UNPK|5.0|I did not see this season when it was running.  I am so glad I have amazon prime!  I look forward to the last 3 seasons
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I normally love period dramas featuring Keira Knightley, but not this one. It's kind of a mixture between a musical & a movie, and the story flips back & forth in time without any warning. Very hard to follow, and we quit watching about halfway through.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|interesting storyline.  good characters, but i must admit that my expectations were fairly high based on the rave reviews i was seeing everywhere.<br /><br />i felt that the writing style left a lot to be desired.  while the author effectively made me see threw the eyes of his various characters, i did not find the writing itself to be enjoyable.<br /><br />this was an easy, quick read, which was nice.  i did however look forward to finishing it so that i could move on to read something else.<br /><br />i felt as though i knew what was going to happen next throughout the duration of the book, which is not typically what i prefer when reading.
B004NELBPC|1.0|HP was my go-to app for insomnia reading on my kindle.  like every night pretty much.  now, not only is it more difficult to find articles that interest me, when I do, the writing is too tiny to read.  how can that work on a phone with a screen half the size of a kindle?  sad!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Quentin Tarentino movies,but ended up watching it because hubby wanted to see it. This movie surprised me. It was actually good. I really liked it. Very good acting from everyone. Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job. I totally recommend this movie. I thought it was going to be boring & it was not!
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Good movie, highly recomend - a much to common view of america in 2012, Fasinating and disturbing but hard toi stop watching. Most everyone has know someone affected like this
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I wanted to like this movie because it starred actors whose work I respect AND because I am usually very interested in movies which expose the dark side of human nature, obsession with charlatans, etc.  But I wish I could have back the two hours of my life I wasted by watching this film.<br /><br />First: I am not a prude, but this movie rubbed me the wrong way in the first five minutes when it featured a scene of a sailor jacking himself off at the beach. The scene was gratuitously repulsive, and reminded me of why I did not watch Monster's Ball beyond its similar opening scene of Heath Ledger's character 'scratching an itch' with a young, bored, bleach-blonde prostitute.<br /><br />Second: watching The Master was an almost painful experience. To say that it was tedious, confusing and boring -- BORING! -- is an understatement. I was restless for the movie to become interesting, regularly mumbling to myself, \\"God this had better get good soon\\", and had to pause the DVD several times to do something else just to temporarily relieve boredom.  I came close SEVERAL times to giving up on the film, but because of the quality of actors I kept deciding to watch to the end . . . and at the end I was like, \\"OMG! I should have turned this off the first time I thought to do it!\\"  There was never, at any point -- and I repeat NEVER, AT ANY POINT -- a scene, an expressed sentiment, an 'aha' moment, or anything else even remotely edifying about this film.<br /><br />LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SPEND TWO HOURS ON THIS FILM.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
0425264351|5.0|The  first book was excellent. I enjoyed the continuous pace of excitement, and explanations throughout, but also, suspense. Well worth the investment
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow, this was my first romance book to read and I couldn't put the book down.  It kept me going back for more.  I am speechless.  Loved it to death.  I hope she writes another book as good as this one.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I use it in my class to teach Chinese culture to my 6th graders. Plus it is funny and a good movie.
0811875040|1.0|I tried to give this book a chance because I felt the cover was so pretty and the book just looked gorgeous. As hard as I tried, this book is a total failure.<br />First off, I went in fully aware of the issues and errors, but decided to go ahead because I felt the author had had 4 tries to fix this... clearly that was not the case.<br /><br />I've looked at the errata on the webpage and even that is not well thought out.<br /><br />From the errata:<br />\\"PLEASE ADJUST THE FOLLOWING RECIPES:<br />Fleur de Sel Caramels (page 167): The amount of fleur de sel should be \\"Fleur de sel for sprinkling.\\"<br /><br />Vanilla Buttercream (page 185): Step 2 should end \\"until soft peaks form.\\" Step 3 should read, \\"As soon as the sugar syrup reaches 238 degrees F, immediately pour it into a heat-proof measurer. Pour a few tablespoons into the whites, away from the whisk, so the hot syrup doesn't splash, and whisk on medium speed for a few seconds. Be careful as the syrup is very hot. Pour in a little more syrup and whisk for a few seconds, until incorporated. Repeat until all the syrup has been added. Raise the speed to high and continue to whisk until the mixture cools to room temperature, 70 to 75 degrees F, 5 to 10 minutes.\\"<br /><br />>>>> When they corrected step 3, couldn't they look at step 1 that states to heat until 248 degrees? 2 years later and it's not even on their own web site.<br /><br />\\"THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, THERE ARE INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WEIGHT OF FLOUR AND SUGAR MEASUREMENTS. PLEASE APPLY THE FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS:<br />1 cup of all-purpose flour is equal to 5 ounces.\\"<br /><br />>>>> In almost every baking reference I've seen, I cup of all-purpose flour is approximately 4.5 ounces. With this book and in her correction, she states 1 cup of flour is 5 ounces. Clearly, that's not even the conventional measurement. Then when you assume that her weight is based on weighing the cup of flour she uses (slightly packed), you then notice all these inconsistencies with the different recipes.<br /><br />From her recipes:<br />Pumpkin Walnut Cake: 1¾ CUPS (9 OUNCES) ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. <-- Based on her own measurement, shouldn't this be 8¾ ounces?<br />Honey Tea Cake: 2 2⁄3 CUPS (13½ OUNCES) ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR <-- This should be 13 1/3 ounce<br />Banana Bread: 2 ¼ CUPS (11 OUNCES) ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR <-- This should be 11 1/4 ounces<br /><br />These errors are all over the book and I would not even rely on this book for anything.<br /><br />My advice to the author: fix all errors, reprint the book and use weights (GRAMS which are more accurate).<br /><br />As most people know, baking is more exact so with all these errors, I would definitely pass on this book.
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|The game is interesting. Very INTRIGUING!!!!Just started playing. Different  from other hidden object games. I seriously recommend this game !!!!!!
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|I enjoyed watching the animations so much more than the plot line. If I can sit down and work on my homework rather thanlisten to a storyline it might not be as great as I had hoped.
B002M5E2DW|2.0|Rhonda Byrne found her secret to making money. There are deeper books to read if you want to know the secret.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|The glass is high quality and it adds versatility to my kit without having to add the weight of an additional lens.
B007R41E8O|3.0|Ok so I usually don't do a review until I have completed the game but I am so frustrated right now and I had to take a break for a min. Plus I wanted to warn people about some things. First off, the game is fun and I do like it but every other scene, it shuts down. It restarts the game and goes back to the main menu. Now, all I have to do is hit the continue button and I go on my merry way, but it happens ALL THE TIME this doesn't happen with any other game I have and I have almost 20 on my Kindle Fire 2 Gen. This shouldn't happen!!!! Ok and now I'm mad again because I'm kinda stuck in a scene. I say kinda because I can hit the skip button and have it do it for me, but I really don't want to do that. First off I know the answer to the puzzle, and I want to finish it since I actually know one lol. Second, I try not to skip because I want to use my brain and figure it out. SPOILER!!! I am stuck in the house where you have to move the tiles around to get the zodiac signs in the Earth, Wind, Fire and Air rows. The first time I tried it, it was fine. Then it shut down on me and now the tiles won't move. I mean almost not at all. I can get a random one to move, but it moves on top of another one and then back to its original spot. OMG I am so irritated. Like I said I like this game so far, but it makes me so mad.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Read it. It is smart, easy, revealing.<br />Should be a must for professionals, entrepreneurs, bussiness owners.<br />I really enjoyed it. I have highlighted the all book.
B000083E79|4.0|Enjoy all of her albums in one feature. It is very convenient, and easy to listen to. Well worth the investment.
0893860220|4.0|I appreciate the interview style. It kept me interested from the first page to the last word. I had to force myself to slow down so I could reflect on the answers.
0151003084|4.0|What a haunting, beautifully illustrated little book.  Creepy as all get-out, but pretty darn awesome.  I can't imagine anyone reading it to their child, unless their child was a morbid teenager.  ;-)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|There is no simple way to describe Hunger Games. The movie is set in a futuristic era where young contestants are selected from each district to fight to the death until there is a single survivor.  Or is there another way?  Katniss is a strong female role model for young ladies coming into their own. I highly recommend this movie for the teenage crowd and above despite the graphic violence.<br /><br />I am looking forward to The Hunger Games: Catching Fire due out November 2013.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|A lot of the same old stunts with not a lot of substance. Nothing unique here, Where is the imagination in the story line?
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Even after 30 plus years, how a band could keep creating such collaborations is beyond me. As a musician (playing guitar, bass, keyboards and vocalist) I can really appreciate the time it takes to put together ONE great song. this band has done it time and time again for over thirty years! The new album, Clockwork Angels to me is a band revisiting the old but never resisting to push forward in their material and song plots. This whole album tells a story worth listening to even without the most amazing music pushing it. To Geddy, Alex, and Neil - PLEASE keep this going. There aren't enough bands out today that haven't been put through the clone stamp grinder that have achieved your status...buy it, listen to it, and I think you will agree. It's RUSH and that's enough said!
B002ZG98UK|5.0|This was our 1st 3D movie at home and it was a lot of fun! The 3D is awesome and the movie itself isn't too bad. We've watched it a couple of times just for the 3D effects.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|there are so many reasons why this game is really epic its free has really good graphics and is one of the best games I have played
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The plot has finally pick up steam after it seemed to slow quite a bit in Feast for Crows. The book was definitely not what I expected it to be - yes, I still needed to refer back to the Game of Thrones iPhone reference app to look up characters, but the characters keep growing and becoming more complex to the point where maybe you can see where the story is heading. There are two great battles that are left open ended and thus I hope Winds of Winter comes sooner than later. For the Khalessi fans, she definitely becomes amazing in this book...just keep reading!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I've been using the amazon app on my android phone for quite some time and like it.  When I bought my tablet, I downloaded the tablet app.  It's just as good, if not better then the phone app.  Well worth the download.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Never read the first book until after watching the movie. I had to read this series because of the underlying plot written here. As a guy, I prayed it wasn't a &#34;Twilight Saga&#34; kind of read because (no offense) I really felt the plot developed correctly could be an amazing read. So I put down my W.E.B. Griffin and Tom Clancey books just to see. Bottom Line: Read this series! It had more plot twists than even I expected and when finished I thought about it a lot.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I love history and this movie was an excellent example of how our government works....even today!  Daniel Day-Lewis did a wonderful job of acting as Lincoln.
1401937519|5.0|this was a very good book, fascinating to read.  Provocative reading which lead to a lot of discussion with my sister who also read the book.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|It errored on download. I paid for it but never got the product. There is no where else to report this!!
1401938906|3.0|I enjoyed reading Pam Grout's book, \\"E-Squared\\" and trying out some of her fun exercises, which worked! It is always good to hear the message that your thoughts create your reality, and this book does not serve to diminish, but only adds to the power of that central truth, albeit on a light level.<br /><br />All-in-all there is nothing really new here, just repackaged in a form that was a bit too irreverent and slick for my taste.  I found this to be a mixed salad of old favorites; A Course in Miracles, Hicks (Law of Attraction, aka The Secret), Dyer (Power of Intention), Gary Zukav (Seat of the Soul), Louise Hay (The Power Is Within You), etc., with some very interesting quotes from a wide circle of notable folks.<br /><br />But to be fair to the author, none of the ideas referred to above are new: They date back to the Christ teachings in the bible (\\"Be it unto you, even as you believe,\\" etc.) and probably further back in time than that.  It is in the practicing of these faith based thought principles in our daily life that creates positive change in our lives, and Grout's energy experiments offer an entertaining way to begin testing your beliefs.<br /><br />My personal all-time favorite author for really learning how to change your thoughts and create a whole new life for yourself, is anything written by Emmet Fox (Sermon on the Mount or Power Through Constructive Thinking).  His inspirational, profound, yet simple writing continues to touch my soul at deeper and deeper levels.<br /><br />I am a Hay House Book Nook Blogger and have been given the opportunity to read this book in exchange for sharing my opinion with you. Thank you Hay House!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love this game it is the one game that is just like bejeweled!!! Everyone who will play this game will love it. I love it !!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen Les Miserables several times on stage and the movie version is great!  It really tells the story of the French Revolution in a more specific way.  It was easier to understand than the stage production!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's a tough game for me to Kindle Fire through, but it's inspiring to witness a 6 year old daughter accomplish, showing success with overwhelming confidence.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|It errored on download. I paid for it but never got the product. There is no where else to report this!!
1607066017|5.0|One of the best new trades I have read in a long time. Excellent art, in-depth characters, and captivating story line. Brian K. Vaughn always delivers!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a must read!!!! If you want or think you are going to be a Navy SEAL, you need to read this. I know I will never meet Eric Blehm, if I could I would thank him for an AWESOME story. It made me feel like I was part of the Brown family. Thanks Eric Blehm.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Since when did I ever see a rated Mature game better than this one. I am covered with my game. If I was you I would purchase it!!!!!!!!
B00199B2Z8|5.0|I have read nearly all of Bill Bryson's books, but somehow had missed this one.  I think he is an especially amusing writer with wonderful insight into human nature.  His choice of words and turns of phrase make every page enjoyable.  I laugh out loud and always have my spirits lifted.  Highly recommend.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|What can I say about a lens hood. I did not receive one with the purchase and this was the exact replacement
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing, there's nothing more to it. Well-written, with a good plot and good characters.... It is simply amazing. Just read it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed, no matter what style you usually prefer.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great story, fantastical but just what I need sometimes-a light fun read<br />I would highly recommend to any Grisham lover
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I have all the seasons now. SOA is a great show, can't wait for season 5 to come out. I buy them for my husband and he watches them over and over.
B00A4AI17A|4.0|This presents a good selection of Verdi's opera output with most of the casts being above average.  Obviously, there are some better performances available of individual operas (e.g., Toscanini, or Price), but as an overview it is good.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was a great book I think everyone read it tobygames is awesome so watch his awesome videos of happywheels
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|The scope of this book is unbelieveble. If you enjoy Tolkien or fantasy books then this is something for you.<br /><br />But beware this is not a book for children and you have to put in a lot of effort in order too really understand it. But if you do, then this book and the 9 others in the serie has the potentiel to become the best read ever :)
B00ATP24SW|5.0|I just discovered this band a couple of years ago, but they are now my favorite. Nemesis may be their best album yet, although Polaris would probably run a close second. I even run an American fan page for them on Facebook. Anyone who's into progressive metal has got to check this out!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a selection for my book club.  The first few pages were confusing until I determined who was telling the story.  By then I was hooked on the characters.<br /><br />The story was real and told at times through the eyes of a child.  This allows the reader to experience the circumstances of the child's life.  I was happy for the triumphs and sad during the tragedies.<br /><br />The Book Thief was an engaging and well written store and I would recommend it to anyone.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The series starts out with a fantastical story and pulls you in with a conspiracy theorists intrigue.  It entices the imagination, is thought-provoking and always keeps the viewer wondering.  I would definitely recommend this series to those who like science fiction, conspiracies, and internal conflict.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is the best game ever I love this game it is so fun and very cool and very amazing
1878424602|2.0|The pocketbook is poor in content as it offers no insights. The pocketbook suggests many of Dale Carnegie's advise, and a few thoughts of general philosophy. Other than the prettyncover, there isn't any other value. Very dissapointed on Deepak Chopra. This is the first and last of his books I will read.
B008Y1KQEW|3.0|Not a bad book. Has good information but I wish there were more pictures and ideas for difference kinds of cookie decorations.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|With a PhD in neuroscience from Harvard, Lisa Genova writes authoratatively about early onset Alzheuners,  But what is unique is that the story is told from the patient's point of view.This book is informative, tender, loving, and heartbreaking.  It is a most compassionate rendering of a most heinous disease.
074322454X|5.0|It was good to read before taking a trip to Normandy where some family members served.  We were able focus on areas we wanted to explore.
B00000J9HF|4.0|The voices and the singing as singing are so good here that I can't give it less than four stars (and the late analogue sound is good too), but it's all a bit too well-behaved.  This is dissolute Renaissance Italy, and it's about revenge, for heaven's sakes.  Liven it up!  I blame Guilini, a conductor I admire immensely, but here he seems to be preserving a museum piece rather than creating a living drama.  I think the singers are trying to do more -- Cappuccilli, in great voice, seems to be trying in his recitatives and exchanges to breathe life into what's happening.  Listen to Domingo and Cotrubas BEFORE  \\"E il sol dell'anima\\" -- all erotic tension and energy.  Then Guilini sets the tempo for the duet, and it's like a concert performance.  On the plus side, Domingo was just amazing at the time he made this recording (1979).  He had Otello in his repertoire, and I think he had sung some Lohengrins, but he is fully in command of the Duke's music, and the tone is golden.  Cappuccilli sounds like himself -- one of the great Italian baritones of the last 50 years.  Cotrubas didn't have the ideal Gilda voice, but she was a lovely singer and she carries the day, even if one would prefer Sutherland's ease and total command.  Then you have two of the great basses of the last 50 years -- Kurt Moll (as Monterone!) and Ghiaurov (in great voice as Sparafucile).  Talk about luxury casting -- and the Vienna Philharmonic to boot.  So by all means hear this and appreciate it for what it is, but don't throw out your old Callas/Gobbi or your newer Gruberova/Bruson.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|robert duvall and all other cast portrayed were great.. kinda scary that this could happen to our world. would definitely recommend this
B006VRDZ44|1.0|The image is deceptive: when they put the blue strip at the top, it makes you think that you are getting a Blue Ray kind of definition, but actually you get DVD definition which by today standards is not High Definition
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable!  And I could do nothing BUT read these last 100 pages this afternoon, could not put it down.  A great ending, too!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Born to Run made me feel the joy of running. A great story with interesting insight into what was lost and found, joy and how to run with that joy.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It really makes you think, but is fun, too.  The sound effects are funny too.  The puzzle layouts make the game interesting.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I chose this rating,because of the interesting way Peter W.Murphy answered the secret of introducing yourself to a new person. I think this book will help me this Monday in school. I really appreciate it. I think all my friends need to read this,because it is very informative.( I know I needed it.;) lol
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|One of the best reads on DevOps. A must read. It has great illustrations to so many challenges IT faces but are capable of controlling and managing.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|It's refreshing to see a game that doesn't require any permissions. That alone earned this game at least one star and an instant download when it was the featured app. I'm very glad I got it, too! As it turns out, this is a very fun game with unlockable achievements and game boards. You can play alone against up to three computer or human opponents (no network access, so these are people physically at your device) or even sit back and watch up to four computerized opponents play if you'd like to observe game play. I like the graphics, and the sound effects and music can be changed in volume if they get on your nerves or seem too loud (the latter was the case for me). It runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;.
B0000024YL|5.0|This is a wonderful CD packed with their famous songs.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Simon and Garfunkel, and who doesn't
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Good and funny action movie. Totally foolish movie I know but entertaining in its goofiness.  I recommend you not take serious, seriously over the top action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the new version of the most popular stories of the rest is history and carly Rae Jepson the new features that make up for our customers and the rest of the new features that are available for download from the most common type of  website.(=?&quot;&amp;@$_#!-/=+():;&quot;+_:&middot;&trade;&euro;% [{] &lt;&lt;\[&reg;&deg;*\&yen;\%

B000002W9Q|5.0|this CD is so much fun. if you loved the movie you will certainly love the CD.  make someone's day and buy it for them if you already have it.  it will put a smile on your face.
B001HLZMUE|5.0|As director of the shadow cast for the annual Rocky Horror Masquerade Ball at the Historic Alabama Theatre I'm naturally a HUGE fan. This is the best cult classic B movie in history!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really pretty good! I've always had a fear of two of the loneliest ways to die. One is falling into an abandoned well and the other is to fall from a ship at night and watching it sail away. This book covered both of those very well.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game but I have to delete it and get it again to get new things or updates
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|One super man fighting off the &#34;Mafiosi' of a senator and all his political power. In the end the truth prevails...a real American story line.
1616550414|5.0|I cannot BELIEVE I finally have my own coy of the Hyrule Historia :D I remember first signing the online petition to have it translated to English. It's an amazing book, and gives such great insight into the Zelda universe and its many, many characters. A must have for any Legend of Zelda fan!
B007R0WHMK|4.0|Could be weird for some but the movie will suck you into the mystery. Highly recommended for all except the young.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|The whole trilogy read in 5 days! I couldn't put it down. The movie pales in comparison...as usual. Thoroughly recommended.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|Interesting historical story about the battle of powers between kings and church. Showing how the input of one or two can make a difference.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|This album is the best! I can listen to this and completely calm down. My life is so stressed and when I listen to this it takes me away to a better place. I need music like this to help me calm down.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Haven't used it extensively yet ... but it's great to have for interviews. Don't know yet how it works in a noisy crowd, which is what we need for our website... &#34;SeasonsBeverlyHills.net&#34;<br />We'll be glad to review it later.

If you don't like rap, this album, its the one that will get you into it, the raw, emotional lyrics speaking the truth about yourself and the society is what this genre is about.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this game!! She has my niece hooked on it also. This is a great buy for little girls
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If your a mystery puzzle lover this is the game for you! I thought there wasn't a game out there left to grab my attention and baffle me and this one has done it! Every time I figure one price out there are ten more! I haven't beat it yet and I am hooked!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I read this one on a plane and got caught laughing out loud so many times, evil stares from those trying to sleep.  What a enchanting view into his world of order, I particularly liked the scene regarding the jacket, the one about cocktails and his menu for the week.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Woohoo!!!!!!! Best book ever!!!!!!!! Thank you Suzan Collins for making this book!!!!!!! This is a got to read book!!!! Love it!!!!!

B00A77II0U|5.0|I love all these types of games. They keep my busy for hours sometimes days. I always have to think where do I go next
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book was wonderfully positive.  It makes me want to approach life in a much more relaxed &#34;it'll work out&#34; way.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Twist that I had never expected ending in the most unexpected way prophecies unveiled in unbelievable and completely unexpected ways
B006J3Y20Q|5.0|The first time I read this book I was in 8th grade and I instantly fell in love with it. Lois Lowry wrote such a great novel, in which he creates a utopian society, where there is no pain, hunger, and there is climate control. Jonas is given the job of the giver, which means he must hold on to all the secrets of the world. The cover of the book really ties in with the story, the book is in black and grey except for a torn piece which shows color. The entire book is written from 12 year olds, Jonas, point of view, which lets the reader experience the story from his point of view. I think this book is perfect for 12 and up, it's a book which wills stay with you forever.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Tapping and waiting gets tiring,however, the game is a great way to pass time and have fun at the same time. Recommend a healthy dose of patience if you do not want to buy credits or invest points.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every book that Grisham has written.  I was particularly impressed with this book because the main character was developed in a very interesting way.  I am not a spoiler so I will just say it was an excellant read.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Ads keep popping up and the way to get out of them is a different location each time. I did not expect solicitation during a game!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate. Lots of choices of versions. It responds quickly to version changes. I appreciate the newer version of the NASB.
B00BI745AA|1.0|I love the play so much that I have seen it on stage 3 times and I could not wait to watch it.  I am not a fan of auto tune, but I think it was needed for most of the actors.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I didn't expect to laugh so much. I was pleasantly surprised about this movie. I really enjoyed. If you're looking for a light, funny movie for the whole family, this one is a good pick.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My four year old girl loves playing this game. It can keep her entertained for a while and I enjoy playing for her when she needs help.
B00006LFGD|5.0|All of Barbara's albums are good, but I especially like her duet album.  Album was a great value and would highly recommend.
B009GJCFL8|4.0|The album contents two CD's and one DVD, and a 8 pages &#34;booklet&#34; with pictures from the &#34;Omega tour 2010&#34;, and some information from the tour and the making of the album, 18 songs. This concert is a live recording from the Basil in Switzerland, 4th of may 2010. The tour started in Rome. A fantastic album cover and very good sound on this live album. Geoff Downes on keyboards, Steve Howe on guitars, Carl Palmer on drums and of cours John Wetton on bass and lead vocals (the best lineup of Asia). If you like Asia, this is the best live album from this band - no doubt.  One of the reasons I like the band is that Geoff Downes and Steve Howe are in this band - great musicians! Geoff Downes, what a great keyboardplayer.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Watched this band perform on Saturday Night Life and was mesmerized by their performance, esp. Brittany.  Great music, lyrics and pronunciation....lots of influences in the music, but the lyrics are awesome too.  Great band.
0811806405|5.0|Wow, it's not often you come across an instruction book this dedicated to explaining a craft. No wonder this has become the defacto standard for beginning in the art of lutherie.
B001QWBM62|1.0|I received the item this morning from FedEx Saturday Delivery.  After opening the box and reading the basic steps in the manual, I tried to use the recorder.  However, with the card properly inserted (there is only one way to insert it), the recorder showed \\"no card\\" and would not work.  I tried it many times and googled for a solution without any success.  I'm really disappointed (was planning to use it tomorrow for a recital) and returning it to Amazon.<br /><br />Also, it's strange that there is also a mini card in the package, beside the SD card.  Why?
B0098WZDZ8|5.0|This is Rainbows, Made in Japan, what a album - just great! Live in 1976. The original album was produced and issued in 1977, reissued in 2012. There are one disc with Rainbow on stage (the orginal album), and one with bonus  tracks; &#34;Live at Osaka, 9. of december 1976&#34; with the extra song &#34;Do you close your eyes&#34;. The album content a 20 pages booklet with 11 pages of pictures from the shows and 9 pages with the story of the &#34;Third album&#34; from Rainbow,  The story of Rainbow so far. Its  a good sound on those two CD's. The guitar playing is as always just great! Dio sing very well on this live album. And Cozy is the engine -  what a drummer. Jimmy Bain on bassguitar and Tony Carey on keyboards.  But I miss more songs from the album, &#34;Rising&#34;. This tour started short after they did finished the album &#34;Rising&#34;, so I expected more songs from this album. Blackmores solo project, Rainbow, gave him even greater scope to express himself through his Fender Stratocaster. As consequence many concur that the '76 tour saw Balckmore take his ablility to an even higher level than he had displayed in DP (from the booklet).  A &#34;must have&#34; live album from Rainbow produced by Martin Birch. Remastering, Andy Pearce.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After reading the first book, and with it ending so abruptly...I had to read the next.  It's an interesting story although in real life I doubt the timeline would unfold so quickly.  I like learning more about each character and would say the book isn't entirely predictable, but one can assume some of the unfoldings will happen.  I like it..it's engaging and a good diversion from every day life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey has been an absolute pleasure and escape from time and place. I'm savoring my last remaining episodes.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I absolutely loved World War Z!  I highly recommend it to any fan of zombie books, video games, or films!

1250007208|4.0|Steph's Review:<br />Cinder is a wonderful read and debut that follows retelling pattern of the fairy tale, Cinderella (hence Cinder). We get a robotic twist in this one, where our protagonist, Cinder, is a cyborg. Caught in a terrible fire as a child, Cinder was injured so horribly to the point where surgeons had to replace parts of skin, limbs, and bones with metal parts in order for her to survive. It's great having her life back, but the downside is losing privileges that a \\"normal human\\" would have. She's basically treated like dirt, just like the beginning of the tale of Cinderella, and she even lives with two step-sisters and an wicked stepmother. The plus is being a great mechanic--something that's hard not to be good at especially when parts of your body are chunks of metal. Weighed down with the job of being the only source of income for her \\"family\\", Cinder really has nothing great to say about her life.<br /><br />When one of Cinder's sisters contracts the cure-less, ravaging plague \\"letumosis\\", the blame is put on Cinder by Adri, none other than Cinder's evil stepmother. Looking for any chance to get rid of a burden, Adri hands Cinder over to the New Beijing government to be a guinea pig for letumosis cure testing, in exchange for money. While being prodded at though, scientists find a special secret about Cinder, one she did not know about herself. She is a double-edged sword. She may be the savior to humankind, but if the Lunars (the enemies in disguise) get their hands on her, it could all be over.<br /><br />I am a really big fan of the Cinderella story amongst fairy tails, so of course I would enjoy any revamp of it. Meyer makes Cinder a witty and sarcastic heroine, and throws her into the most awkward situations (I love reading awkward situations, have you noticed? :D). These situations include our lovely prince, Kai. I didn't feel Kai was a super hot guy, but I liked him, just like in the real Cinderella story. He is a complex character; he is a prince who basically wishes he wasn't one, but must stand strong to his country who lives in fear of the Lunars and the plague. The poor guy can't really catch a break, especially with his father having contracted the plague as well. Cinder automatically grows on him because she's one of the few people who doesn't treat him like a prince, and she actually bothers to joke with him. Some of Cinder's lines really made me LOL during the book, especially this one (No not with Kai unfortunately, with the docs. Probably one of my favorites in the whole book!):<br /><br />\\"I don't know. I don't actually remember anything from before the surgery.\\"<br /><br />His eyebrows rose, his blue eyes sucking in all the light of the room. \\"The cybernetic opetation?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, the sex change.\\"<br /><br />The doctor's smile faltered.<br /><br />\\"I'm joking.\\"<br /><br />Besides the plague, New Beijing has the Lunars to worry about--people of the moon hence their name. With their magic of brainwashing and compulsion, they could bend any human to their will and take over the world. The only thing stopping them is the tense peace treaty signed between Earth and Lunars. It's fragile, and deteriorating. I detest these Lunars with all of my heart, and it was a wonderful twist on top of the normal Cinderella story. I think the conflict with the Lunars is what makes this story stand out, because if it was only the fairy tail it'd be pretty mediocre. Without warning, Cinder is thrown into the heart of the Lunar/Earthen problem, where keeping her secret is the utmost priority.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is that since it is a retelling, it is very predictable. I could sense the plot twists and the ending from miles away, so I never felt especially giddy at any point in the book. It is a great read, no doubt, but it isn't particularly suspenseful. I love the world and characters though, and they make up for the so-so plot. I am definitely going to be reading Scarlet, book 2 of the Lunar Chronicles, which is the story of Red Riding Hood told Marissa Meyer style!he Lunar Chronicles, which is the story of Red Riding Hood told Marissa Meyer style!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|This truly is an amazing cast and series.  Not the most historically accurate, but more accurate than the first season.  The acting is superb.  I just wish they would age Henry into the old, fat slob that he was.
B004OR199G|5.0|An amazing lady with an amazing way of telling the truth about our food we eat and how it is destroying our precious bodies.
B005LAII94|5.0|Loved,loved,loved it!!! Aaron Johnson is the hottest, and the most gorgous guy out there!! would recommend this movie to everyone!
1426308469|5.0|One of our grandsons has a great interest in dinosaurs. This is the perfect gift book to fuel that passion in any child with a similar vent....
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Lots of historical inaccuracies in season one.  The timeline is very, very condensed.  The scenery and costumes are absolutely stunning.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The sound quality is excellent on this, the 2000 release.  It starts out with early hits such as \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"I feel fine\\" and then moves on to later hits like \\"Yesterday\\" which was covered by Frank Sinatra, and \\"Something\\" which established George Harrison as a great songwriter.  \\"All you need is Love\\", written by John Lennon, changes beats between 7/4, 8/4, 4/4, 6/4 throughout the song and in some amazing way they make it sound natural.  If you're a new Beatles fan or just want a great collection of their hits on one CD, this is the one to get!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great player on all my devices and allows me to create one playlist that I can access anywhere. When I download music it automatically syncs with ITunes and makes getting my music easy.
1564029654|5.0|I started reading this book as well as &#34;The Kissing Hand&#34; to my 2 and a half year old son as he started a transition program at school. Both books are great. The premise of this book is that mommies always come back. It didn't take long for me to be able to drop him off at 9 and pick him up at 12. No tears shed and I think I have these two books to thank for that. He felt safe and secure being dropped off at school knowing that mommy will always come back to pick him up. Highly recommend.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites from the 80s.......and it was filmed not far from where I grew up.....great story!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Instead of having to drag-and-drop each app into a folder on the home screen, I can just fire up my lists and organize that way, then create widgets on my home screen for each folder.  An excellent time saver!
B000SGSU58|4.0|Pretty much what I have come to expect from Michael Connelly, which is a good thing.  Clever, interesting, and unusual plot, with unpredictable twists and ending. I recommend it for Michael Connelly fans, or for those who have not read his books previously.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|This record kicks butt! It is similar to Empire or Process of Belief in many ways; Bad Religion has perfected their sound and the lyrical content is as good as ever. True North is raw energy and attitude from one of punk rock's most refined and tenured acts. Buy it!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wondered for months what all the excitement was about with these books.  I finally ordered the kindle version for my iPad.  The books are okay, and they are erotic, but no more so than the Harlequin romances and other romance novels of the 80s and 90s.
1439152756|2.0|I wanted to like this book but it ran aground pretty quickly.  The story is poorly developed: the protagonist undergoes a steady deterioration. This leads to a major problem as far as protagonists go -- she is unable to make important decisions and becomes increasingly a passive player.  The book is fraught with repetition: the protagonist forgets what she was in the middle of doing, then starts doing things over again, but forgets what she was in the middle of doing.  How many times do we have to read that passage? And how many times must the author mention Harvard?
B005PK1G76|4.0|I installed this Organizer onto the UppaBaby Vista Stroller.  The handles on the Vista are very wide which exceeds the installation width of this Organizer.  Otherwise I really like this Diono item and I assume that it fits onto the majority of some other strollers.  I recommend!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, surprise find that turned out to be a fantastic read. You might have to be an engineer to really enjoy it though :)
B00683JLXA|2.0|This is angry birds with a different dressing and poor control.  On my Note 2 I had a hard time getting the ammo to pull back.  Graphics are substandard and sound is very annoying.  If they improve the controls and improve the sound I might give it another star but there is just nothing new or insisting here.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Brilliant book! interesting story line. Journal style of writing was refreshing and allowed a deeper connection with the main character. Scientific research was up to scratch and made this book believable. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Riveting and unexpected turns kept my interest. Ms Flynn's attention to detail in her characterization made me feel like I knew these people and the town they loves on. Very nice read.
B00993G41S|5.0|Enjoyed the silly comedy.  Great movie to watch and laugh with the silly characters in the movie.  Would watch again.
B0037W68F4|1.0|Please listen before you buy this album. I heard a few MGMT tracks on Pandora that I enjoyed and read a positive review on AMG, so I made the purchase. I regret doing that. This album does not rock. It sounds like a cross between Weird Al Yankovic and a children's nursery rhyme CD. I can't fathom who would think this was a collection of good music. It sounds like a joke.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I love this guy and all of his movies. I want to collect Men In Black I and II. Very pleased with product.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Was looking forward to seeing this movie for the actors and the trailer's story line.<br />Very slow-moving and a scattered story.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A funny romp that becomes quite moving by the end.  Very clever, very meta.  A quick, light read that you will think about for days after.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun I love playing it I play it every day.<br /><br />I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I play it at least 5 times a day to get money.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I bought this as a joke for my friend's bridal shower a few weeks ago. I am happy that it got to me in one piece and earlier than I had thought! Very pleased!!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Great, classic book.  Frankl's approach to his subject is revolutionary, spiritual, compassionate and scientific.<br />It's hard to believe that someone who experienced what he did in a German concentration camp could see through his and others' pain and anguish to find meaning and purpose.<br />A must read for searching souls.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Probably should have rated this CD higher but I just don't care for Josh Groban. My wife is extremely happy with her music.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie, even though it is very long (over 3 hours).  It has historical value, it gives you a glimpse of the beauty of the actual country of India, and Gandhi's message of peace is amazing.
B00CATSONE|3.0|A quick shove to encourage you and a nice little bio on Tesla. Very upbeat, especially if you are trying to make something out of your own ideas.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout is quite good.  It takes 30 minutes to get through each workout.  I typically like to work out longer, but when I finish this one, I don't feel shortchanged.  A couple of annoying things about the dvd (otherwise I would have given 5 stars):<br />1.  You have to sit through the intro every time; I haven't found a way to skip or fast-forward to the workout, and it's not exactly a quick intro, either.<br />2.  She tends to start and finish on the same leg or arm, so one side gets an extra rep.  Maybe it's just me, but I like balance and knowing both sides get the same exact workout.  So, I typically rush an extra rep in before starting the next exercise.
B00CAJDUX8|1.0|After stupidly purchasing this album, I must say that I've given it a few listens and have to come to the conclusion that it is completely and utter garbage.  Every song sounds ripped off from someone way more talented.  Don't waste your $5 as I did.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|He used a lot of big words that made you think but I'm glad I bought it. I liked the book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book was okay.  The author was able to draw you into the characters.  Of course the subject matter is different.
0470876417|4.0|A well illustrated book on how to brainstorm a business model. Needs more depth on hat to do after the business model is defined, which would make a nice follow up book.
B004P7CNUY|4.0|Great movie one of best in the Halloween series. Worth a watch and should be added to your Halloween collection. Packaged arrived on time and packaged so's it would not damaged.<br />Thanks!
0385349947|5.0|I would recommend this for all women (and men) everywhere.  It is educational and opens one's eyes to so much we as a society take for granted.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked reading it at the same time it was disturbing when it ended.  The last book was extremely fast paced.<br /><br />I plan to read it again as I do with most books I read.  I don't think a first read through ever does justice to a book or give the author their due.  Since I tend to read fast I do miss some things.<br /><br />If I am able to get into the characters and relate to them I will often times want to re-live their experiences and the book.<br /><br />Some of the characters in the books could have been better developed.  I did hate to see the deaths.<br /><br />I realize it was written for a youth audience and probably meant to be quick paced, but I like a little more character development.
0385523912|5.0|Blending objective journalism with a story-teller's voice, Demick puts a human face on the most repressive tyrannical regime on the globe today.  Highly recommended!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was curious to read an adult Rowling book and really enjoyed it.  Her depth of character development and description is really well done.  She creates so many emotions in the gradual insights into the main people in the story. I will read more of her work.
B0049VZ222|1.0|I did not like the casualness that was taken with regards to how easy it was to pull a trigger and kill someone
B0084HJE0S|5.0|I've been reading different books looking for what I found in this one. It's simple yet profound enough to know whether html5 is for you or not X_x
B005DJREJS|4.0|I liked it a lot. I watched all the previous seasons on Amazon prime. Now I'm watching the current season.. Amazon is a great way to discover shows I normally would not know exist.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett gripped me into the story immediately. I am a great fan of all the Follett books I have read.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This is an excellent batman vs joker story, the artwork is superb and if you are a fan of the joker like me, you will love it
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|If you buy only one Cd this year, This is the one to buy. This WILL be the the CD of the year, hands down. there isn't much else to say, except buy it NOW!!!!
B002UD56I6|1.0|It was not what I expected. Not enough action. I am thinking of throw it away. I was very disappointed with the content.
B00633W614|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the other in this trilogy. Looking forward to reading the third book. Could not put the book down!
B00493E1GI|3.0|I'm not totally thrilled with this movie as I know it was based on a true story but  it's just not that believable to me.
1743117094|5.0|I was surprised by how beautifully written this book was.  This is certainly not a silly romance novel, but a gorgeous character study with each of the many characters so well developed that you easily find yourself relating to them.  The plot is intriguing and complex and one finds oneself wishing certain events weren't happening.  I found myself saying &#34;if I were there I would say this to snap her out of it, or this to warn him&#34;.<br /><br />This is a definate read for those who love a book one just can't put down.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This is a great series.  The acting and story lines keep me coming back season after season.  Viewing without the commercials is the best.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Ok, so I don't normally read books like this, but I know Harlequin has a good collection and I enjoy reading their supernatural romances, so I thought I would give this a try. I found it on Netgalley and also got it from the B&N store. It took a while to start reading it, but I'm totally GLAD I did.<br /><br />I read this in only a few hours. By the time I went to bed my eyes were red rimmed from crying! It was amazing, and while the ending wasn't what I had hoped it would be, I was still pretty satisfied with it, and I usually hate endings because they are usually rushed.<br /><br />Waking up Married took me on an emotional roller coaster ride. Its written so well that you get caught up with the characters, the situation, the setting... everything! I laughed my ass off, cried my eyes out, and whooped when they finally realized that they were right for each other!<br /><br />And don't get me started on how much I wanted to hit them upside the head! Especially Connor. His reaction to even a hint of emotion was so frustrating, and although his reasons for staying married and then wanting to be married to her are fuzzy and confusing, I still loved how well they fit and when he... OK, no spoilers. But it was frustrating! And good at the same time!!
B007IK44CK|5.0|WOW! This movie rocks!  Action, Suspense, Great Storyline & Plot... Exactly what we want from an action flick, and Tom Cruise delivers!
6305090564|5.0|Love this cast!! You couldn't find a better set of people either to be in this movie! Cheesy..yeah, but it's all about those moments that we all have thought at one time or another...including that famous..&#34;Now what&#34; statement and it's repercussions! On the dime shipping, perfect on the budget. Collectors must have..lol
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I absolutely love the game on my PC, and this is exactly like it.  It's only $5 to upgrade to the full game, and for those complaining about that nominal amount evidently don't play many PC games because the average cost of a game is $7.  Just wish Playrix had more games for the Kindle-they always have high quality.
B00003CXB6|5.0|Love it. Very good movie!  Plan to watch it many more times to come! would recommend anyone to get watchit at least once!
B007ED9FIY|5.0|George Clooney is at his best in a wonderful story about what it truly means to be a family -- highly recommended!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|You're not going to find any pompous review here with fancy sentences or phrases referring to books \\"of the same name.\\" I'm going to tell it like it is. This movie is awesome. I came here specifically to tell you that so you can share the great time I had watching it. The movie has some great surprises in it, great action and special effects, top notch actors, amazing special effects, and it's an all around great Spring/Summer flick. I plan on taking my parents to Imax to see it, which will be my second time.<br /><br />I will buy this bad boy on bluray as soon as its available and watch it again.<br /><br />EDIT 12/21/2013. Just watched my bluray version again. Even more awesome this time around. I watched all the special features too. I also bought the amazing sound track including the beautiful theme song by M83 and Susanne Sundfør. I've probably played it 100 times already. GET BOTH.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is good of you want to keep track of your battery. It also helps you by giving you ideas how to save you battery life and what is using your battery life.last but not least it tells you how much charge time you have and how long you can use your  device until it goes dead .like I said best app ever
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I seriously don't get the people giving this movie anything less than four stars (or five stars if you like smart action movies like I do - and no I don't mean the kind you have to have a PhD to decipher). Great action, great acting (as usual for Tom Cruise), and great movie. Five stars.
B003B96AOW|5.0|everything on the order was great,on time,nice and i like it! and i don't want to type to much am just happy and thats it!

1452115567|5.0|Fantastic photos, beautiful dawg, touching stories and wonderful places and people.<br />I bought two copies so far - they make a great present for a dawg lover like myself.<br />Wish there would be a book signing in the UK one day - I'd be there - I'd love to meet Maggie and Theron.
B00A3AU1U6|1.0|I am a big fan of Brian Eno, and love many of his albums... But Lux is to me extremely boring...I've been listening to it several times but find nothing interesting.  Sorry..I don't understand all the other reviews ??
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very good book with action an a little bit of humor and love story in there. All I have to say is that this is a very good book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent movie. The events were happening while I was in high school. I was not paying attention to politics or current events at an in depth level. It was nice to go back and find out what happened.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|FANTASTIC - THE ACTORS ARE GREAT...PICTURE OF HISTORY AT THAT TIME. STORY OF A FAMILY AND ITS TRIALS.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B002A4Q652|5.0|Purchased for one track and loved the whole album, this will drive you to check out other albums from this group. Highly recommended
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I enjoyed this at the theatre many times, enjoyed it the first time I saw the film adaptation, and loved it even more in the blu-ray.  Tom Hooper was a masterful director for this well-loved musical; his choices were spot on, and the cast was phenomenal.  In any other year, Hugh Jackman would have won the Oscar for his visceral portrayal of Jean Valjean.  Truly a wonderful addition to my film library.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I Love his songs always did. Everyone should buy his cd's I have all of them. I just wish I could see him in concert.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The new album is 17 songs of solid material.  I like it better than I expected.  David is a true talent.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I loved this treatment of the sexual sides of ourselves that was kind, caring, and personal. Sex is essential to our emotional happiness in its raw, real, and mutual sensation. This movie helps show this most important part of ourselves.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The quality of the sound is perfect. It is very handy. The charge last very long. Though, not so loud as expected...
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. It was so good that I finished it in two days. overall a really good book

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I received it promtly, was more than pleased with the quality of the product,and would recomend it to all my friends.<br /><br />I love my Kindle Fire and I'm considering buying a  Kindle Fire HD, My friend that have a Kindle all say they love theirs too, so<br />GOOD JOB AMAZON, AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
B008BU70HW|5.0|So nice to read, supports the TV series.  Every character is perfectly suited for their role.  Provides a good visual from a print perspective.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I understand the developer wanted to make the widget resize better, and it does that, but I miss the current Real Feel being displayed on the home screen.  Also, I think having the forcasted temps showing on the home screen is confusing.  I simply want to know the current temp adjusted for wind at a glance.  If I want or need to know more, I can click through, but 9 times out of 10, I just need current conditions.

B008YRVW0I|5.0|Great game!  I really enjoy playing it.  But what would make it even better would be to have a relaxed mode so you can  play the game without having to worry about a time limit.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Beautifully written. I read this book in high school and I had to read it again for leisure and I loved it
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|I loved this movie for many reasons.  I saw it in the theater in New Orleans when it came out.  It brought most of the viewing audience tears. The movie communicated the the depth of what was lost in Katrina.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it's user friendly and full of  weather info. No glitches that I have found and pretty accurate . Being free is just  a bonus.
B0096HL33G|2.0|I did not care much for the movie. It's plot moved too slow to keep my interest. A very good cast, just poor movie.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase Michael Buble's \\"To Be Loved\\" because of some of the reviews. I decided to take a chance...as I have really enjoyed his other CD\\"s.  Believe me, this one is great,too! A nice variety of slow and fast songs, old and new. The arrangements continue to amaze me.  Every song is super!Way to go, Michael.  I think you are one of the best contemporary singers of our time!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Not only are the colors and designs great, the &#34;popping&#34; sound of bubbles and &#34;popping&#34; disappearance of each cube when matched is fun.  The ability to turn the cube in all directions, (even on an angle), makes for a more challenging game and gives different perspectives to match the cubes.
B005HED08I|5.0|This TV series changed my life on many levels. First it was an avenue of hope during a very uncertain time when humanity was looking forward to war, as I was in my teenage years. The diverse crew with members from many different countries including Russia (a sworn enemy at the time) really said &#34;Hey, there may be a future after all.&#34; The technology said &#34;We have things to discover.&#34; The five year mission said &#34;it makes sense to plan for longer than just next week.&#34; Having a black female as the voice of the crew said &#34;We can change.&#34; And an alien Spock with more than human intelligence spoke to things we had not even considered including intermarriage. Although the acting seems less than &#34;Stellar&#34; now, and the special effects were done without the aid of CGI, and the computers were primitive and slow, Star Trek offered hope to a hopeless generation, at least in my case.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this to keep up with everything. Projects, to do list, I use it all the time! Great product and easy to use
0062059963|1.0|I truly enjoyed the first book and anxiously waited for the Elite. Even the Prince was better! The entire book could have been a short story; it was not a  &#34;dystopian&#34; romance and what it ended up being was a novel of who will she choose? even the end was unsatisfying. I kept waiting for more. This should be a $.99 kindle book.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|If you are a fan of Phonix's previous work and haven't listened to them in awhile you'll quickly fall in love with their music all over again. The beats are catchy but not played out, the lyrics are good but not cheesy, and there is enough variety to keep you coming back again and again.
B0000024SI|5.0|I really don't know why I'm writing this. Dylan's early stuff is<br />always can't-miss and this album was an important part of<br />his early transformations.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie was filled with excitement and humor. It was a perfect movie showing how to make something good out of a bad situation. It is a must-see.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Being a big horror buff, I totally enjoyed this movie.  Great story, characters and atsmosphere.  The filming, darkness and period were great.  How much scarier a haunted house has to be without electricity!  Definitely worth watching and I enjoyed the extra at the end about the filming.  Can't wait to watch it again at night and in the dark!
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Well. It started out promising. Then just got more ridiculous as it went on. Don't think I'd watch it again.

B00797MB0O|3.0|Entirely predictable with a lead character that is unlikable and for whom it is difficult to have any sympathy or empathy.  Found myself rooting for her to fail at every turn, including that of her &#34;self-discovery&#34; which, when it happened, fell flat.  Glad I rented it and watched on the laptop so that I could do other things while it played in the background.  If I had seen this in the theater and had to choose between losing my money or staying to watch how it ended I would have (gladly) taken the loss.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|I only read this book because I liked Gone Girl so much. This book is probably more twisted but it was shocking in the end. I had a hard time putting the book down. My only complaint is that there were a lot of characters and sometimes I had to go back to refresh my memory on who they were.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|I enjoyed reading from Enzo, the dog's perspective. I learned about the drama of life, the character of a man who is decent and kind beyond measure, and more about car racing than I ever imagined. I appreciate an author who uses words and literary elements to bring the reader into a new world gently and respectfully. These were all fully formed characters whose lives are mixed with joy, trauma, and redemption.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I never saw the original series when it premiered on the debuting FOX network in the late Eighties though my younger sisters were absolutely gaga over a youthful Johnny Depp.  I gather liberties are taken with that show because I can't imagine the series being as raucous, vulgar, and over-the-top as the movie.  But it works!  Filmed and edited at a breakneck pace the movie never lets up and gives you a comic adrenaline rush.  A lot can be attributed to the ascendant Jonah Hill and a surprisingly funny turn by Channing Tatum who sends up his beefcake image cemented in \\"Magic Mike.  These guys have chemistry that fuels the engine of this flick.  The humor here is decidedly off-color but if you are a \\"Hangover\\" fan this is right up your alley.
B00BMEF8UA|4.0|My first reaction to seeing this product on Amazon was \\"Really?  Another live recording?\\".  While it is only their second actual live cd release, the DVD set 'Festivals of the Wicked' is less than two years old.  Between that and the Alive in Athens recordings, I wasn't sure if a fan would need a new recording.  But since this is the first live recording with new vocalist Stu Block, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />Let's backtrack a bit - Iced Earth had all of the markings of a band on life support by the time 2011 arrived.  Longtime fan favorite Matt Barlow returned to the band for 2010's 'The Crucible of Man', otherwise known as 'Something Wicked Part 2', the conceptual sequel to 2007's 'Framing Armageddon (Something Wicked Part 1)'.  This was very odd since Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens had provided vocals for the previous album, so Jon Schaffer even went as far as to have \\"Framing Armageddon\\" re-recorded with Barlow on vocals for the 'Box of the Wicked' boxed set.<br /><br />This proved to be pointless in the end, as Barlow's return was short-lived; he quit the band again in 2011 to spend time with his family.  Truth be told, the Something Wicked saga had turned out to be a massive disappointment; after the awesome trio of songs that began the saga at the tail end of 1998's 'Something Wicked This Way Comes', it was almost 9 years before the band picked up the story.  By then, many fans had lost interest.  Compounding matters even more was the sheer lack of interesting material in 2007's 'Framing Armageddon', which contained bland, overproduced anthems that were not sonic brethren to the original three anthems.  Ripper Owens's uninspired vocal performance made the album utterly forgettable; in fact, his tenure with the band never really worked.  Whereas he had fire and personality in his stint in Judas Priest, he never quite found his sweet spot in Iced Earth, and was often guilty of over-singing (even by Iced Earth standards).<br /><br />Even Barlow's 2010 returndidn't save \\"The Crucible of Man\\" from mixed reception from fans and critics; it seemed that Jon Schaffer's songwriting ability had severely degraded.  After the mixed bag that was 2001's \\"Horror Show\\", and the average-to-poor quality of 'This Glorious Burden' through 'Crucible', it seemed like the band had finally exhausted everything they brought to the table.<br /><br />Enter Stu Block - Stu came to notoriety as lead vocalist for innovative progressive metal band Into Eternity.  His voice in that band could be described as versatile, as he oscillated between smooth clean vocals, piercing shrieketto, and guttural death vocals.  It was unclear if he'd be another \\"Ripper\\", having difficulty finding a way to fit his voice with a new band.  But 2011's 'Dystopia' was a pleasant surprise.  Stu managed to find a niche in his new band, modifying his vocal approach to better fit the more 'staccato' vocal attack required of Iced Earth.  If he was guilty of one thing, it is that his lower vocals oftentimes sound eerily similar to Matthew Barlow's (at times, it's hard to tell them apart).  But his higher register carried much more power and gravitas than Barlow's did; where Barlow's falsetto often petered out, Stu possesses a higher range and greater degree of comfort and power.  Stu's solid presence, coupled with Jon Schaffer's 'back to basics' approach of just writing simple, quality metal anthems made 'Dystopia' a surprisingly solid effort.  While not a classic, it was far away the band's best effort since 1998's 'Something Wicked', and injected the band with new life.<br /><br />So it does make sense to a degree that the band would release another live album (assuming of course, that fans want to add another 2.5 hours of much of the same material to their collection).  Sonically, this live album does not differ much from previous - it is a high quality mix with crisp sounding guitars and vocals (and likely an overdub or two).  The setlist is an effective blend of all eras- each album is represented by at least one track, and most containing at least three entries.<br /><br />Sadly, there are no real surprises - \\"Dante's Inferno\\" remains the only 'Burnt Offerings' inclusion, and 'Something Wicked' has a disappointing representation of mostly ballads (\\"Melancholy\\" and \\"Watching Over Me\\" are two of the three entries).  And of course, 'Night of the Stormrider' and 'Dark Saga' contain their pre-requisite staples.  These songs sound as effective and full of life as ever, with Stu Block delivering quality performances.  He doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the proceedings, other than restoring Greely's powerful falsettos to the Stormrider tracks; nonetheless, he turns in a solid performance.<br /><br />What elevates this live album are some of the other performances - the 'Dystopia' songs work extremely well in a live context, with Stu Block actually improving on his studio performance on tracks like \\"Boiling Point\\" and \\"V\\".  Surprisingly, the material from 'Framing Armageddon' (especially \\"Setian Massacre\\") are given new live with Block's vocals.  While still far from their best material, the tracks actually contain presence for the first time that improve their standing in the setlist.<br /><br />And then there's the 'Horror Show' material.  Iced Earth were guilty of overproducing the hell out of the vocals on that album, using layer upon layer that made them difficult to reproduce live.  Additionally, they were some of the most demanding tracks Barlow laid down, as they contained some of the rangiest material, with frequent octave jumps and notes around the breakpoint.  Three of the best entries on the uneven studio effort are included here:  \\"Wolf\\", \\"Dracula\\", and \\"Damien\\".  Stu proves he is game on \\"Wolf\\", managing to convert the difficult two-part vocal melody into a solid one-part effort, with additional gusto on the demonic-sounding chorus.  \\"Dracula\\" succeeds largely on the sweat and tears of Block; it's a song that worksmuch better in the studio, but Stu's versatile octave-jumping manage to provide the song with the requisite amount of melodrama and delightful cheese that made the track engaging to begin with.<br /><br />Only \\"Damien\\" fails of the three, but this is largely due to Schaffer's lazy songwriting.  Barlow's over-the-top octave-doubled vocals carried the original and masked its weaknesses, but alas, Stu only has one set of vocal cords, which exposes the song's inherent mediocrity.<br /><br />The recording definitely does a nice job of capturing the energy of the crowd, whose soccer-esque chants are infectious.  Stu brings much charisma as a frontman, and clearly feeds off of the passionate crowd.<br /><br />Ultimately, this new live release is far from essential (how many different versions of \\"Pure Evil\\" does one fan need?).  But for fans, especially those (like me) who had given up on the band after 'Crucible of Man', the album is a stark reminder that Iced Earth is back...with newfound passion and excitement.  And isn't metal better when Iced Earth are having fun?
B0072GPPNC|5.0|we really like Steven Spielberg and War Horse is no exception to his amazing filmmaking record. The BluRay is clean and clear and plays great, and we have an old DVD player, so we bought this one with both versions, and it works for us! A+

B00BDSRER0|5.0|This album is by far my favorite Phoenix album! I like every song in this album. Even the bonus track is pretty cool.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This really is a compelling story that approaches the air war of World War II from both sides.  It’s hard to write a history of German fighter pilots and describe their hardships and expectations without cheering for their country and cause.  The authors do an excellent job doing just that.  We come to learn of the hatred between German fighter pilots and their leader Hermann Göring.  How Göring blamed German military failures on the cowardice of Luftwaffe fighter pilots.<br />At the same time we follow the aircrew of an American B-17.  We learn of the interaction between the B-17 and a German Messerschmitt pilot.  In the final chapters we learn how each feel about the other in their retirement years.<br /><br />Don’t let the somewhat simplistic writing style of the authors dissuade you from reading this great story.

B00683JLXA|5.0|The physics aren't quite as spectacular as angry birds but seem to be fine. If your an angry bird fanatic like me you will love this game. The fact that the panda throws the way he does is all part of your strategy on how to approach the level.
B000001ES9|5.0|This album belongs in your library of classic albums. Hear why the band was inducted into the rock n roll hall do fame.
B00BESM14U|2.0|I wasn't really impressed with this movie.. I thought it was going to be much better because Emma Watson is so great but it was lackluster & boring..
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Although I wanted to stab Maxon and America both at certain times in the book because of their lack of communication this was a very entertaining read.  The characters were steady and interesting and the thought process behind the plot intriguing.  The next book will rock because if how things ended.
B0019IB0II|4.0|This book takes the reader into new territory.  I found the subjective / objective descriptions of stroke aftermath to be fascinating.  My Mother has experienced TIA's.

0307010856|5.0|I had this book when I was a kid. So I bought it for my son, perfect, brand new book. Got here supper fast.

B00190N4E4|5.0|Excellent portrayal of a historical figure. Well written. Told the story realistically without being overly graphic. Violence limited to what was necessary to the plot line.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was a female in Corporate America for years, and especially appreciate the realism and believability of these characters.  I also had the horrific experience of a husband (now ex-) who cheated on me.  I find Alicia's responses very true to what I went through.  Great acting... and the great 'cases' the lawyers work on keep things intriguing.
B00076RT24|5.0|I have all the Star Wars movies and I love the series.  I only hope Disney will have the same quality when they make the next movies!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome... it has missions so u never get bored, it has loads of vehical upgrades, tons of different clothing, different faces, and the best part is that you get to have these helper upgrade things and you can even have a little dog that helped you collect coins.... that is if you aren't using the coin magnet upgrade. BUY THIS APP TOTALLY WORTH IT.

B000NA28I4|5.0|I love this moive and the book it is based on.  I don't know why they never made movies of the other books in the series; the would have been great!
B00BKTWBMA|2.0|Let down for the most part. Mr. Clapton is going in a different direction I guess. I bought it right before<br />seeing him in concert.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Season 5 continues with great stories and characters.  When the show was cancelled it felt like a punch in the gut.  I really liked the team and how they cared for each other just like SG1.  Going to Stargate Universe was a mistake.  I re-watch the Atlantis and SG1 eps so I can catch the little nuances of humor and interaction.  Wish Atlantis would come back!
1592537251|5.0|Can't help but be inspired by this book and its wonderful artists. It's packed full of different styles & locations.
B004LWZW88|5.0|I saw this film in the movie theater and I wanted it; now I have it.  I have yet to see &#34;The Three Diablos&#34; because I don't as yet have a Blu Ray player, but I will! This is a great movie and I love Kitty Softpaws, and especially the dance fight in the cantina.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game keeps the match 3 game interesting by switching up the graphics regularly and adding new twists to chalenge the player. The graphics are really nice. I like to play the less stressful version without time chalenge.
1118109791|4.0|Wish it included a few practice tests.  Taking the exam next week so I will see if the book did the job.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Different than more WW II books in that it show a perspective from both sides.  This book focuses on individuals trying to survive in a war over which they have no control.  Very well researched.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book series. It is amazing, I just hope Jace &Clary get together. Keep having fun writing, love you
B007PTJOV0|1.0|i think this game is kind of cool<br /><br /> but not really the only reason i play it is because it keeps me busy
B007IK44CK|5.0|MI:4 is hands down my favorite Mission Impossible movie. I saw it three times in the theater. There isn't a single thing that I would change in this movie. It's a great ride.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book after reading the 50 Shades Trilogy. I thought it was very captivating and made me root for the underdog. Jamie McGuire did a great job placing the reader in the story and made me feel like a close friend of the character. I followed it up with her second book Walking Disaster. It was a great book for a weekend read.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|Very good story line. Enjoyed the movie and now will have to look for Ip Man 1.  Very good action film and we enjoyed the story and the actions.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Very realistic account of domestic violence and an eye-opening look into the world of OCD. The book disturbed me, but in a good way - the way good fiction hits me on an emotional level. It's a dark tale with some pretty graphic abuse scenes - some of which I wish I could get out of my head. Although it was well-written, I'm sorry I read it - a bit too brutal for me.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Fun movie! 3D effect is awesome! Great buy! I hope they make more movies like this one. Too many junk movies these days.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|For my kindle fire HD, I won't use any other apps to keep my files organized.  ES file explorer gives me just enough freedom that I don't have to run to a laptop or desktop pc to gather the tools needed to move and sort files.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|After purchasing this game and playing i discovered you have to buy the additional worlds. They cannot be earned and must be bought with real cash. The worlds cost as much as the game.  This is a double charge and the epitome of greed and deception. Buyer beware.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. After seeing the movie it is impossible to say one is better than the other but in terms of description and the fact that there is so much this book is a must read. Truly a story to make you believe in God.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Very nice bag. I bought it for my Canon 5D Mark II. It fits without a battery grip. I have my 24-105mm F4 lens on, but I have to reverse the lens hood or it won't fit.<br />Very compact bag!<br />Materials wise: lots of cheap plastic, so probably won't last very long. But for $16 I have not complaint.
B006UK248A|5.0|When I don't want an artist to speak, I turn to this album.  13 favorite songs with the &#34;glee&#34; featured smooth criminal, Sulic and Hauser are the best at what they do!  Very well worth the entertainment value!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was written in a style that was intriguing and fairly quick to read.  I knew Charlie had a problem but not sure what it was.  I thought the characters were well developed and I liked them and was glad they found each other.
B00A83075M|5.0|Excellent movie, very funny, good for all ages. A bit scary for younger kids (3 & under) Otherwise a new family favorite.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Great family movie! My 2 year old daughter loves it. It was a great way to introduce Santa, the tooth fairy, sandman, easter bunny, and Jack Frost. one of those movies you don't get tired of watching. This pack was great for having the Blu-ray at home , DVD at grandma's, and digital on the iPad.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|I was not a fan of the games or book series until I watched this. I am now hooked on the whole thing. The movie starts with a an underground lab where scientists are paid to create classified millitary and medical advancements. Something goes wrong and everyone is killed by the super computer encharge. A team goes in to figure out want happened and the zombies attack. What I think makes this great is that it could accually happen. Many zombie movies don't explain why. The govenment working secretly on biological weapons and enhancements is very likely. Something going wrong and it being covered up is very likely. Just know that there would not be 5 movies and a book and game series if this was a bad movie. Personally I think you'll love it.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|This is a good novel.  I didn't lose interest, or even put it down for more than one day.  I always wanted to know what would happen next.  The ending was satisfying.  Then I moved on.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|I use my minimag every day at work at least every fifteen to twenty minuts to check progress of machining in tight spaces. I chose this conversion one for the led to conserve batteries (I go thru a set every week with the old bulb) and two for the switch I figured I could save a lot of time if I didnt have to focus my light every time I go to use it. Instalation of this kit was easy and took less than five minuts. The light is very bright impresive from a single LED. The focus is a little fartther out than the original bulb but that is not a problem. My concern is the switch it feels cheap and I'm worried it wont hold up. I would prefer something with a little more beef. I think I will hold off on locktighting the focus untill the switch proves reliable. all in all good investment I think even if the switch dose fail, the LED will pay for itself in batteries.
B004QSQML8|5.0|For a movie from the 80s, this is one of the best Blu Ray transfers I have seen. The director cut version is a fantastic bonus. .If you loved this movie way back when, you will love it even more now. I remember this in the theaters and the quality was nothing like it is now. (I do have a fantastic tv.. and proper equipment is needed to appreciate the upgrade)
B008VSEJPK|5.0|Really well elaborated, wonderful material and approach to the field. Worthy for letting you acquire different perspectives over the mixing engineer head.<br />I entirely recommend this fascinating book.
B006N57PXG|5.0|These books are seriously creative, inventive and fun.  How did the author come up with such a brilliant take in the Alladin and the genie theme?  Great humor because Stroud must have such insight into human nature.  And he is not arrogant or sententious in his world creation.  He doesn't browbeat or bludgeon us with his cleverness.  The books are even throughout, always fun, delightful and exciting.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I am NOT a fan of pop music, but I broke down and gave JT a break after seeing him play bass with the Flaming Lips. My wife and I have really enjoyed this one!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long long time. Can't find on cable, Netflix or Hulu. So I bought it for those times when I need an Avatar fix
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is a revelation on the connection of disease and diet. The health information is clear and cogent. The knowledge to make wise healthly choices is now available. Thank you for removing the shroud of confusion when it come to nutrition and our health.

B0092MKFIY|4.0|I almost didn't buy this CD after running through the samples. I finally broke down once Radioactive hit the airwaves. Overall, not a bad effort. Glad I gave it a chance.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|I have come to adore this series! Best fantasy books I've ever read!<br />The characters are so well developed, they are not black and white but every shade of grey I between. I love the very real sense do danger, I'm constantly surprised and waves of emotions the story admits is fantastic. I find it very easy to read and follow although there are many characters the way it's written makes each memorable in their own way. I'm smitten!<br />I enjoyed this ebook immensely and I'm looking forward to starting the next one right now!
B000RFPORW|5.0|Fellini's masterpiece. 8 1/2 is a movie to watch over and over again. Every moment is beautiful. This is a true classic!
B009O2XY12|2.0|Hey first time doing this but yea it's a good game. But it will have u thinking and u really have to.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|Steven Wilson never rests on his creative laurels and TRTRTS is just another step in this genius' musical evolution. Well, not \\"just\\"...it's a brilliant piece of work. Great writing, great musicianship, great production. If you're already a fan, it's a must-have. And if this is your first dip into the Wilson catalog, I'm almost jealous: you have an incredible new world to explore.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This is a terrible book. Childish. I kept reading it, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time.
B002GDM2UA|5.0|When the world shifted to dvd, I bought a copy of Highlander to replace my old VHS tape. The dvd was terrible... fuzzy and poorly mastered, so I took it back and bought another. It, too, was fuzzy and poorly mastered. Over the years, I could not find a good copy of the movie on dvd. Now, finally, I have a good copy of the movie for my video library.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown hit another home run with this one.  I love the way he writes the intrigue in such a way that you just can't put it down. You will be on the edge of your seat as you read and try to figure out with Professor Langdon the next clue.  I loved the book!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|From the advertising when this movie came out in theaters, I expected a very different film.  This was a very moving and inspiration story, that didn't take itself too seriously while it provided a funny, touching view into the human condition. Highly recommend it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I LOVE Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis. Theh sing about real life in a fun and honest way. I sought out this purchase and was in no way disappointed! Thank you mackelmore and Ryan Lewis for your music!
B009R659L8|5.0|I am never disappointed when I read her books.I can't  put them down.I have never figure out who has done the killing or who is the one  to blame.I am. Sad to have to have the book end. NOW have to wait for a new novel  to come out.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Great story telling you thats you have to work very hard to get your legend even if its under your feet...
B00AW0KHMY|4.0|Having said that, there were only a few new scenes that I recognized.  However, if you are building a Twihard Library, it is a must-have.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easier to learn, easy to make changes, provides extremely great service as a personal travel alarm clock.  Works great as a reminder clock also.
B000067QMD|3.0|The item is as described.it is recommended for any who is interested.it I is worth the money.buy it as it is a high quality item
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Not the bingo I know.  Did not expect what I got when I opened it.  Maybe it is just me cause I am only an occasional gamer, so you might want to check out other reviews.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Wonderful cast.  I'm waiting for the next free season to start! It gets better each year! Its great to sit and watch a whole season without commercials!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is great to play anytime to make the time fly. Starts easy and gets hard. If you play long enough you can get go the good powerups.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I enjoyed these colorful characters, especially the three sisters.  The plot unfolded bit by bit and was never predictable. I enjoyed the writer's way with words.  Very descriptive without being overwhelming.
B0051OZ564|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Sucker Punch. Of course, I had heard negative things about it, and my hopes weren't terribly high going in, but the premise was too enticing to avoid. The action sequences were well done; aesthetically pleasing (to say the least) and high energy. The visual effects in this movie are marvelous, partially for their consistency, partially for their occasionally novel interpretation of the mental world the characters inhabit. Don't go into this expecting a mere exploitation flick or a philosophical deconstruction thereof. This film works on many levels; quite a few more than the characters inhabit, in fact. It does not work on the surface; if you take it at face value, you will be disappointed. Take a minute or two to think, however, and you will be pleasantly immersed in a gorgeous world with compelling (if, admittedly, underdeveloped) characters.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Instant classic great story line characters and adventures low budget but that was part of the charm I would highly recommend
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is the best Hangman game I've played, I love the animations and music, they really did an awesome job on it!
B002UWH8P6|3.0|This show had GREAT potential, but, in my opinion, pushes it a little to far with the transference of souls via the stones.  At some points, it made it difficult to follow as far as, who was supposed to be who.  I think the show could have made it many more seasons just exploring and learning the ship while gating to nearby planets for supplies and exploration, and skipping the 'stones' all together.
075669812X|5.0|My 9 yr old grandson carried this around the house for 3 days &#34;studying it&#34;.  He even took it when we went in the car.<br />He was enthralled.  Good bargain to get a Ninjago &#34;guy&#34; AND a book for $10. ...happy grandma.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and found it not only very entertaining but very fascinating about the woman behind one of the greatest horses (Secretariet) to have ever lived.  Great true story and pretty incredible.  The story is very well told and the photography of the races are fantastic.  Definitely put this on your list of &#34;must see&#34; films!
B00785P2QC|5.0|The graphics are great. All of the buildings make it seem real. I like that while your not playing the game you still earn money
B00136JS12|5.0|Lost the old Boston LP.  The sound quality here  is fantastic! I've started up my old collection as MP3s.  Nice!
B004H83IFA|4.0|This is definitely Ryan Gosling like you've never see before!  He plays a really creepy character but it's based on a true story and I remember the true story very well because of reading it in the newspaper.  It made headlines because it was pretty grizzly!  The movie is pretty good and as always Ryan Gosling is excellent.  The movie is creepy but regardless very entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ThiS APP OSO THE ZOMBIES EAT YOU'RE BRAIN'S .CREPERS EXPLODEE IN YOURSELF and enermans your envy's a nether wi this incredible
B007HO392S|3.0|This album is saved by Carrie having the voice of an angel. I like when she &#34;rocks it&#34; but it has some heartfelt ballads,too.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|This isn't any great love story but it's really cute.  I especially like the aspect of this being played out in a kitchen between 2 Chief's!  Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good as is Aaron Eckhart and the little girl played by Abrigail Breslin is adorable.  Just kind of interesting what goes on in a restaurant kitchen where customers are not allowed and how a restaurant prepares each night for their customers.
1250006341|5.0|Very informative about the time period. I was not that familiar with this information. And a gorgeous presentation! A great collector's item.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a superb book about cancer. It is written by a physician but it is not a difficult book. Everyone can read this, without needing a scientific background. The information is very clearly presented and the writing is smooth and colorful. There are may touching stories showing the viewpoint of the patients who live with cancer and how doctors try to help them.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|This is an old film that is classic in my opinion.  It's a great Yul Brenner film!  The story is pretty cool about machines taking over and going berserk.  It's a funny movie and also good drama over what's going to happen next. Definitely see this movie if you never have!
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Daughter really likes this. An unusual show, but its like a kid version of Frankenstein. Sweet story actually and some good voice actors. Cool black and white format! Like an old movie.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Read it after you see 2001 Space Odyssey: for once the movie is even better than the book. The book explains the movie a bit but the most extraordinary part of the movie was that not everything was explained, as would be expected when humans meet an advanced alien civilization. The book still is well worth reading: It is great science fiction.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Wow, this is a powerful film and although you do know how it ends because it's a true story, it will STILL have you on the edge of your seat!  Ben Affleck has really become a GREAT director!  He also does a nice job of acting in his film as well as all the other main players.  Don't miss this film.  You'll love this movie!
B00947N6D8|5.0|Knew we had to get this. A new and interesting twist. A little scary for smaller children, but great for mine.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked the book, but there were parts that I found uninteresting. This book is by far the best of the Hunger Games trilogy.
B00427X9WI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I am partial to Julia Roberts.  She has such screen charm.  It's beautifully photographed in many exotic locations.  I really enjoyed that part of the film. Story is slightly weak but I still enjoyed this film.  I found it to be entertaining.  Love James Franco, Richard Jenkins,Viola Davis, and Javier Bardem in this film.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Glad to have these in a set. We watch them however with a foul language filter. Wish we didn't have to.
B007REV4YI|5.0|coming from a person who generally dislikes new-school bond movies, i was blown away watching skyfall as a download, then watching it HD, and by the third time i was watching it on bluray and even more blown away.  definitely worth the extra price.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is really terrific and watch for all the iconic gadgets from all the past Bond films in this movie.  It will crack you up.  Great story and I LOVE Daniel Craig as the latest James Bond.  He does a fantastic job!  Do NOT miss this film!
B00ARVRD1Q|5.0|This instantly brought back some great memories. I got the CD as well and then made a playlist with the original song playing first, followed by the Jazz version. Bryan and his band did an amazing job. Even the packaging is superb.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a die-hard fan and love having the entire set together in one place.  The only problem is keeping kid hands off it!!
B005LAIII0|4.0|This is one of the most visually beautiful films you'll ever see.  Nice story, and the young man in this movie is excellent.  Director Ang Lee  did an outstanding job as with most all his movies!  Definitely worth seeing and owning!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the Hunger Game movie prior to reading any of the books, and if I could go back I would do it in the opposite order.  I thought the movie was awesome, however the first book gives more detail about the story setting and the dynamics between the characters.  The books are written in first person, while the movie is in third person, which makes it difficult to get a grasp on what is going on inside Katniss' head.  The books do a better job at explaining this.<br /><br />I read the trilogy while on a weeklong vacation in Mexico and I had trouble putting it down.  I am still excited for the sequel movies to be released, although it will be tough for them to meet my expectations after reading the second and third books.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book. Touching. Makes you realize how our media affects the military...not in a good way. A must read for military buffs.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this film. The only disappoint was, that they broke it up into 3 segments. But hey, this is Peter Jackson's work, and he has to do it up right! Doesn't follow the book exactly, but still a lot of fun.:):)
B005DJRD80|5.0|This a funny sarcastic show that keeps you entertained.  I found myself hooked!  Definitely recommend watching it and guarantee you will laugh!
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is a great family movie, that is entertaining for all ages.  Would recommend this as a new family classic.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This last installment to me, needed to be closer to what the book tells. It ties up the loose ends from the previous 6. So even though it pretty well done, I was still left wanting them to do it right. The book is still better. But i bought these anyway to complete the set. I am glad though, that they kept the bring in to Gringot's , dragon and all and Harry's near death experience!
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I have read many books about Michael Jackson and this one is well researched and heartfelt. It takes the reader on a journey into many of the joys and trails and tribulations of this amazingly talented artist and humanitarian and often vulnerable person. The author gives one a better understanding of  his true heart and soul verses the media portrayal of him. Whether you are an avid fan or someone just wanting a better understanding of Michael Jackson this book is an excellent read.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent. I watch it constantly and will probably wear out the disc . I may have to have an auto ship for it.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Pretty much same as I said about part one, I was just glad that the break-in to Gringot's was kept, along with the dragon and Harry's near death  experience. The special effects are well done.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It has been a while since an animated film made me straight out laugh. This brought back some great memories of being a kid in the arcade and the movie has a great message of being content with who you are and of others oversight of peoples feelings.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty cool. I recommend it for people who have some time to kill.I finished the game in a few hours. I found one spelling mistake. Cool story that is easy to follow. If your bored, go for it.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|99.9% of my calls are local calls and everytime I tried to make a local my phone would ask me, &#34;DO YOU WANT TO USE VIBER OR T-MOBILE TO MAKE THIS CALL?&#34; I dumped the program.
1452110581|5.0|Fun, fun, fun!  Loved the poems.  I thought I would pee myself with some of them.  Great book when you want to laugh.
B00992CF6W|4.0|love it sooooooo much but it needs to have lava water and u have to be able to make boats.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I have always enjoyed Lois Bujold's writing.  This book was fun to read and I enjoyed her expansion of Vorpatril.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|Very good ,well done, better than most i have seen of this type . Like the fact that is made the military look good.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|It was better than described. I am completely satisfied with the product. Why does it make me have to use so many words?
0307463745|4.0|This book is similar to \\"Getting Real\\" also from 37signals. It's mean for entrepreneurs and small businesses who want to remain lean and agile. It has some interesting ideas but it's not applicable to every company. Worth a read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse just under four months ago, and have been enjoying it except for a couple of things.<br /><br />I have had almost no problems with the programmable buttons... it's a little unintuitive to set up macros, and every once in a while it seems like I have to hit a button twice while playing a game to get it to do its programmed function, but overall I'm pretty happy with that and how it responds while gaming, especially since you can set up two different profiles.<br /><br />It fits my hand very well, it doesn't feel cheap and the included weight set is really cool for getting the inertia set like you want it.<br /><br />The ability to change the color on the lighted logo is a nice touch, but it's only useful when not actually using the mouse, because your hand covers it and all the other lights stay blue. But it looks like it's breathing and waiting for you to use it. You can set the color to match your other hardware lighting or even your room color ha ha.<br /><br />The problems I have are that the scroll wheel bounces my pages up and down... it is not smooth at all, and I've gotten to where I use the arrow/page up/page down keys to keep from getting frustrated, but it's a bother.  I've tried this in three different browsers and other document-type apps and it's all the same.<br /><br />Also, the settings seem to disappear. Every once in a while, I have to reset the pointer speed and logo colors, sometimes the same day without a reboot. A reinstall of the latest driver has not fixed this or the scroll issues.<br /><br />I haven't really noticed a difference in changing the polling rate or DPI... maybe that's more applicable to art applications, not sure, and there's nothing in the documentation that states how those should be used.<br /><br />I have dual monitors, and when you go into the config window, it splits right down the middle, so I have to drag it either left or right to get it onto one monitor.<br /><br />I'd really like to give this mouse 4.5 stars, but with the problems mentioned I can't - it's 3 stars for now.  It's still a good mouse for the price, though. I might have just gotten one where the scroll wheel is slightly malfunctioning, but unless there is a driver update soon that fixes it, I'm going to have to use a different mouse.<br /><br />----<br /><br />**** UPDATE 4/30/2013 - I received a phone call from Dave at AnkerDirect today. At first I practically yelled at him because I thought he was one of a rash of solicitors that had been bugging me the last couple of days. Once I calmed down and figured out who he was, it was smooth sailing from there on.<br /><br />Dave called to get feedback on the mouse.  He was exceptionally polite, paid real attention to what I was saying and was truly apologetic for the issues with the mouse. We went in depth on how I was using it, the things I liked, and the things I disliked.  He let me know that his IT department is working on the next model having all the lights having a programmable color since it has been so highly requested.<br /><br />The biggest thing, though, is that he had a FREE replacement mouse sent out today, and emailed me a pre-paid return postage label for the original mouse for me to send back when the new one comes in.<br /><br />This is professionalism and courtesy at its best.  You couldn't wish for better customer service.  Anker apparently, with their first venture into gaming mice, is dead serious about being as good as they can possibly be - listening to customer feedback is the best way to make a top product.<br /><br />Once the new mouse comes in, I'll have another update. :)<br /><br />----<br /><br />**** UPDATE 5/9/2013 - I got the replacement mouse very quickly, actually about 4 days ago.  It was another couple of days before I had time to try the new one out.... WOW!!! It's like getting a new car.  Turns out the scroll wheel actually was faulty! Without reinstalling the driver, I was able to just swap the mice and everythingis perfect.  The scroll wheel has a nice responsive touch to it now, and it works perfectly in every situation - browsing, documents, whatever.  My wife and I are so happy!  The settings have also been kept for the last few days as well.<br /><br />I forgot to mention earlier that the mouse also comes very nicely packaged, and has a very good, sturdy, long braided cord with a gold-plated USB connector.<br /><br />Anker had sent me a prepaid postage label.  I simply cut a slit in the mailer the new mouse came in, swapped the mice keeping everything else in the package, taped the mailer back up and taped the label on the mailer.  Easy!!<br /><br />I couldn't rate this mouse, or Anker, any more highly.  I am completely and absolutely pleased with both the mouse and the people at Anker.  I highly recommend this mouse to anyone, no matter how they use a mouse.  It just feels good (for a right-handed person, of course) and even with all the features, it's still such a good deal it's worth it for the weight adjustment and basic settings to use for the simpler everyday tasks.<br /><br />On the next version, it will be nice to see all the lights programmable... it would also be nice if one of the buttons on the left could be used as a -shift- or -control- key type of thing to give the scroll wheel additional functionality.<br /><br />Five stars well earned!! Kudos to the IT and support staff at Anker.

B0001Z6440|2.0|I had this disc before and it showed all three days of the battle.  The disc I received stopped right after the battle where Col Chamberlin stopped the confederate army on Little Round Top.  If there was supposed to be two disc I only received one.  I enjoyed the movie up to that point.  Larry B. Lee Scotland, Ar. 72141
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I see not only Bladerunner here but the seeds of Battlestar Galactica. Awesome novel. A must for sci fi enthusiasts.
B00003CY5J|5.0|we have been DeNiro fans for some time, had seen the move before, and really wanted it in my library. So far we have watched it a couple of time and our neighbors borrowed it so they could view it again.  So glad that Amazon has the old favorites.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I have to say, I'm lost for words to describe how bad this book is. What's advertised in the glowing sales blurb is the direct opposite of what you'll be getting.
B000FA675C|2.0|I picked this up as a promo for his latest on a whim and found it to be equivalent to a movie of the week, made for tv adventure matinee.<br /><br />Its characterization is cliche and he paints both his heroes and his villains with annoyingly broad strokes. I was especially put off by how Brown describes his hero with so very little humility. Robert Langdon is a cheesy self-insert who only dwells on his backstory to remind the reader it's there.<br /><br />Trust me. You're better of skipping the novel and renting the movie. At least Tom Hanks has charm.
B0040I09RM|1.0|Not all that realistic. Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1%ers. Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|An exciting story with just the right amount of difficulty. The hints really help you out of a pinch. Looking forward to the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|No instructions on how to play this game. I have even searched online with no results. Not worth the time.
0099548135|5.0|In fact in bored me when I read it. I barely could understand what it is written and often needed dictionary. But I could better understand Christianity, I understood how marvelous Anne Rice found such inspiration from religion to write this book. I always get fascinated by authors who show well known things in other light.<br /><br />Of course it was very philosophical book, hard to read and everything, but I think it was worth reading. And of course erotic scenes...which I liked very much in books.<br /><br />This book in fact changed all life of Lestat as it is seen in other books. This adventure changed all his life, changed everything in his personality. You must read all Vampire Chronicles to understand what this books mean. Everything is connected. In fact this book left some...emptiness. In my opinion it could be continue. The all story of Lestat after this adventure could still continue and I see tragic end or that good old ending.<br /><br />\\"Memnoch the devil\\" gave me a lot of thinking. Even passed long time after I finished this book, I still come back in my mind and think \\"what if...\\". Sometimes my mind wonders in this story and I cannot stop my mind, I simple sit and it comes back to me. I think it was most serious book of Vampire Chronicles. And it inspired me to read more about religion, it inspired me to write one story I still have no plot, not even name, nothing, just idea.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Just as delightful as i remember it being when i was a dreamy headed girl full of imagination. A definite must read.

B006UUK612|5.0|One of my absolute favorite childhood movies, and my kids now love it too. I could see the same look of excitement in their eyes as were in mine when I first saw this movie and the special effects are still pretty good for the time it was made. The whole movie has held up well through the years.
B003JTHWPA|1.0|This was one of the most boring books that I've yet to read. Sorry to say that I didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't hold my interest at all.
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|No question - Iced Earth presented their fans with a true gem.  This is simply not just their best live album ever, but one of the best ever in the genre.  Why did I buy this album?  First, I'm a fan.  But, that's not very useful if you are wondering whether you should get it, is it?  First should be that Iced Earth truly play inspired and true metal.  Emotion, dedication, love shown to their fans - all of it is there.  Second, the quality of the material is the highest.  Songs on this live album sound better than on their studio releases.  Third, the musicianship is second to none.  Finally, in Stu Iced Earth got the world class singer.  I don't care whether you're a fan of Dickinson, Halford, Dio, Ripper, Barlow or someone else, Stu will impress you.  If you're a metal fan you should own this record ...  If you're an Iced Earth fan, ... well, it's a no brainer.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The phrase 'God made them and matched them' comes to mind.  They each tell their story so sympathetically that your emotions about the other swing between extremes.<br />At the end you cease to have any sympathy except for their unfortunate expected baby.  Your feeling is, &#34;God, don't they deserve one another!&#34;<br />The story-telling is very clever and the convolutions of the narrative keep you on the edge of your chair.<br />I'm old-fashioned enough to want the good to win out.  But there aren't any good people so you are left with a jaded feeling of having spent too much of your precious time involved with these nasty people.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is a great album top to bottom.  Above average quality on nearly every song. Great energy!  It stands out when compared to the work that's being produced these days or had been produced 10-, 20-, 30- years ago (whatever is your preferred metal era).
B009HSPODE|5.0|Alice Munro is the doyenne of the short story. Her writing flows so smoothly carrying the reader along imperceptibly into the heart of each story. Her command of vocabulary is very subtle.  And her choice of subjects and what she makes of them gives the reader a view into people and situations outside the normal range of acts and emotions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky is finally getting out a bit into the real world. After years of being home schooled and without technology in her home, not even a tv, phone or computer, she is going to go to public school! The only problem is that her best friend, Six, who talked her into it is now heading over seas to participate in an exchange program. Sky must weather public school alone! Even though Six is her best friend and more like a sister, by association Sky has earned a reputation of being a slut. Sky has never done more than kiss a boy because for some inexplicable reason she doesn't feel anything when she is with a boy. Everything changes when Sky meets Dean Holder. From the moment their eyes meet, there is sizzling chemistry. What Sky doesn't know is where this intense attraction will lead. A relationship with Holder will take her on the highest of highs and down to the lowest of lows once the secrets come forth. Can the promise of love and courage see her through as she encounters the darkness of human evil?<br />What I Loved:<br />Normally I would lay out everything I liked and didn't like about this book, but today I am going to forgo that format because this is one of those books that got inside my head and brushed my soul and forever changed me! Yes indeed, it was that good. I read a review last year for this author's first book, Slammed, and was impressed. I even purchased a kindle copy when the book was still self pubbed, but unfortunately like to many of my ebook purchases it got shoved back in the reading order as I fulfilled blog commitments. What a mistake! Let me tell you, if you have books by Ms. Hoover drop everything and read them now! She is an incredibly talented author who knows how to make you feel. She packs in so much emotion into each and every scene and I couldn't believe how deeply I felt for the characters and their plight by the end of the book.<br />This is one of those books that starts out with a teenage romance that is all lust and attraction, and I was prepared for it to be a typical read. What I wasn't expecting was the intenseness of each and every scene. For instance, when Sky and Holder hang out for the first time, she wants him to kiss her desperately. He refuses because he knows her history of making out with boys and feeling nothing. Holder wants his first kiss with Sky to be memorable and amazing. What follows is a delicious dance of flirting and passion that evolves into the best non kiss I have ever read. It is just amazing.<br />I admit I am not the biggest fan of love scenes in books because I often end up feeling like a Peeping Tom, but this was not he case with this book. The love scenes are so well done and so full of passion and love that they are a pleasure to read. I was amazed time and time again at the depth of emotion Ms. Hoover was able to convey. The power of her writing is astonishing!<br />Now that I have babbled on about all the butterfly feelings of amazing first kisses and more, I must get to the darker stuff. At the midway point, this book takes a severe turn into the darkness of a man's heart. As Holder and Sky come together, they discover that they are nothing like their reputations. They are intensely kind people who want nothing more than love and acceptance. Unfortunately, they are both severely damaged and broken, even though Sky doesn't know it at the time. Holder is confronted by his haunting past and once the secrets come forth, it is like getting punched in the gut. After all the euphoria of the amazing romance, you are plunged into the past and you experience the loss of innocence of three young children as they are confronted with pure evil. It is absolutely heart wrenching to see how black the human soul can be. This evil threatens everything good and pure between Holder and Sky. I wish I could do it justice by explaining it in this review. The best I can do is tell you that it is one hell of a ride as you cringe in horror and your heart breaks for Holder and Sky andeverything they lost. Yet, just when things are at their darkest, a ray of pure sunshine filters through and scrubs away the black storm clouds. This beacon of hope is the purest love that exists between Sky and Holder. A love that is properly established through friendship and time. No insta-love or love triangles. It is the sweetest most passionate love that will remind you that despite all the evils of humanity, we can and do manage to overcome the evils because we have the capability to love and the courage to trust our hearts to another.<br />So go into this one and strap in for a roller coaster ride of emotions. I promise you that you will complete the trip as a changed person. You will smile and cry as you read this one and I think this book will speak to your soul. This is one of those books that you need to read. I am absolutely in awe of Ms. Hoover's talent, and I cannot believe it has taken this long for this superb indie writer to hit it big. This is exactly the diamond in the rough book that you are looking for in the indie genre. Thankfully, Ms. Hoover is now under contract and I am certain we will be treated with many more fantastic books from her in the future. I, for one, cannot wait! Luckily for me, the next book Hopeless #2 releases later this year and it is told from Holder's view point. You can bet that I have already pre ordered my copy. My parting words for you dear reader are do yourself a favor and drop everything and read this now! I dare you to come back and tell me that it didn't make you feel!<br />Here are too many good quotes from this read!<br />Favorite Quotations:<br />&#34;I seriously thought people only acted this way in books, but I'm witnessing firsthand that idiots actually exist.&#34;<br />&#34;It's too bad your mother won't let you have internet. It's an amazing place to discover facts about yourself that you never even knew.&#34;<br />&#34;I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.&#34;<br />&#34;The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.&#34;<br />&#34;I thought Mormons weren't allowed to have caffeine.&#34; Breckin shrugs. &#34;I decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay.&#34;<br />&#34;The only thing I'm certain about right now is that after this moment, I will never be the same.

No matter what happens between us in this life, this moment has just merged pieces of our souls together.&#34;<br />&#34;I'm not thinking about anything else right now but how much I love this boy and how much he loves me and how despite what's going on in my life, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else than in this moment with him.&#34;<br />&#34;The first time you kissed me?&#34; I say. &#34;That moment when your lips touched mine? You stole a piece of my heart that night.&#34;<br />&#34;The first time you told me you lived me because you weren't ready to tell me you loved me yet?&#34; I press my hand harder against his chest and I move myself closer to him, wanting to feel every part of me. &#34;Those words stole another piece of my heart.&#34;<br />&#34;I knew in that moment that I was in love with you. I was in love with the way you love me. When you wrapped your arms around me and held me, I knew that no matter what happened with my life, you were my home. You stole the biggest piece of my heart that night.&#34;<br />&#34;I never thought I would ever be able to trust a man enough to share my heart, much less hand it over completely.&#34;<br />&#34;Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.&#34;<br />&#34;I'm choosing to stand up taller.

B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is just as fun as the others. If you like the other two you will enjoy this. Have fun
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Tired of politics and this is what this movie is about.  It is how to buy votes in the House and Senate, a lot of what is going on today.<br />I thought the movie was boring and a waste of money.  Turned it off after 45 minutes.  Maybe it got better, but I was not about to waste any more time.  I believe Lincoln was one of our best Presidents, and I was hoping the film was more about his life.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|It was fun to relive the 80's for a few hours. Have only watched it once though. Quality is of the 80's not of today.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am currently watching the Downton Abbey series for the 3rd time.  Each time it gets more interesting.  Carson and Violet are great!
0545265355|4.0|Great trilogy! Enjoyed reading all three books. First one is the best though. Recommend Reading before the movies come out.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the seek and find touch. It almost makes you feel like you are Sherlock Holmes. Mystery games never get old or boring.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & ryan lewis never cease to impress! Every song gets better with every listen, the lyrics are so relevant and he has an attitude that is just damn sexy. Way to go guys!
B001JIFYSA|3.0|Actually, I would give this 3.5 stars.  I was expecting it to be at least a 4-star movie given that the folks that made Notting Hill also were the source for this one, and it has a great cast.  However, I was a little disappointed.  I enjoyed it, and it had some very good moments, but taken as a whole it was less satisfying than a film like Notting Hill, which I loved.  I didn't care for some of the pairings, which were a few too many for my taste. This gave me the feeling of it being a bit disjointed in places.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Excellent read!  Can't put it down.  This is the second time I've read it.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|The goal of That's My Fish is to get the most fish (Points) but not to get stuck in a dead end or have no moves left. Lots of levels to unlock but you only start out with one level, a square. You start out by placing a few Penguin on the board. Then pick a Penguin you placed and move as far as you want forwards. The last spot you were on will go away and you get that many points that were on that spot. If you get stuck on a little island with only you on it you will soon get eating by a WHALE! Others will do that to you but however you can trick the computer by making theme get stuck on a island. Very fun. Hours of fun.NOT worth 3 dollars but I got it on the day where it's free AKA free app of the day. Have fun playing Hey That's My Fish.
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|What begins as a promising idea leaves a very bad taste in the mouth of the viewer by the end of the film. There is something so loathesome about the exploitation of a truly damaged and vulnerable individual for cash and quasi fame that makes this offering beyond redemption. It presents Nev Shulman as the 'victim' of an internet fraud perpetrated by a dupliciatous vixen who toyed with his emotions and left him ragged with despair. I assume that Mr Shulman is educated. I assume he is functioning in the world. If he really did fall in love with a woman he had never met then it indicates a level of immaturity and naivety that beggars belief.  I think he and his pals saw it as a way of making a cheap film and parlaying that into somehting else - hence the Catfish television show. I sympathise with Angela and so will you after watching these smug New Yorkers - who by the way did not realise that chickens lay eggs EVERY day! - take this ladies' fragile existence and expose it for the world to see. A decent human being when confronted with the sadness of this person and her family would have shut it down and moved on. I had previously watched the Catfish television program with interest a few times until it became clear that EVERY epsiode was a variation on the same theme and that it gets old very quickly. Having watched the film I can see the real motivation of these guys and trust that the boredom is widespread and the show will sink without trace very soon. I hope Angela made some money out of it but I doubt it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|How sad yet amazing, I had a hard time putting this down. I hope Shin finds peace and happiness. I hope that Kim Jung Un sees the light some day.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I love  being able to use the Mac with a projector finally. It makes life so much easier at school.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book I would so recommend it to friends me and my daughter was both reading this and I finished first
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I love Dexter and his interior monologues, just a little hokey on the female leads, but it's still my favorite series.
0765325950|5.0|Come on, it's not like I can say anything about how great the series ending it without ruining the story. Anyone who buys this book is going to read it and going to love it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Best book ever!! Reminded me of many parts of Philadelphia<br /> Eagle  football.  You have to read this book....many many people suffer from many kinds of mental health issues...and really brings reality to it!!
1616960922|5.0|I usually like the epic novels, and when I got this book and saw how tiny it was I thought it couldn't be that good.<br />This story is excellent. I really enjoyed the short read. Such an interesting concept for a book; it is very engaging. I highly recommend it, and believe most anyone would appreciate it.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Truly a fan of Inda Arie CD's. I can't describe the amazing feeling you received that just inspires you  to listen to the message in each song.
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Picking a favorite song from this CD is difficult.  There are so many.  I still got a finger is funny and what many of us would love to sing to others. Granddaddy's Gun is touching, Boys 'Round Here is great! I highly recommend this CD.
B001XV09UG|5.0|This, like every Kubrick film, was a delight to watch. It was visually stunning and even emotionally striking at times. I felt moved by the movie and it's conflicts it presents.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|An excellent product. Keeps your legs fresher longer. Cool color. Reduces shin splints and calf fatigue. Reduces recovery time greatly!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Most of the music on this album is original and unique to Phillip Phillips. I have it in the house and in the car -- I love it that much.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|very pretty, VERY fun, perfect for TV accompaniment when not knitting - my one request is that there be a Zen mode, where there's no running clock nagging at your elbow - I only play the Puzzle Mode (ignore the clock) and my husband liked it so much, he also put it on his Kindle (he is fine with the clock)
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie leaves you with the choice of believing it is real or imagined. It's a beautifully staged and filmed movie.
B000I9X7M6|5.0|I adore Shakespeare, and totally love this movie to pieces so I often watch it before I fall a sleep or even when I should be studying. I love the tale of R&J &#60;3 Thanks!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am ok with saying I am an avid player who not only spent the money to get the game but I have in the end purchased the two expansions.  Each type of plague is unique and challenging on its own and never fails to  aggravate me when I think I've won to be out done by the elements.  If you like strategy games dealing in world domination, creepy children giggling and finding yourself evil cackling in the dark at your device then this is totally the game for you.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Thanks so much! It's so much fun to watch and remember everything that I loved about watching it the very first time!
B00094OBS4|5.0|This is a great CD and I know the intended recipient will enjoy it very miuch. It came in fine condition.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than the first. Finished it in about a day. Suzanne Collins does a fantastic job of keeping you glued, looking and waiting for the happy ending. Buying the<br />3rd right now!!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|it was suggested by someone at work.  exceptionally informative and it peaked my interest regarding  the Holocaust.  i have read more books about Shoah.  thanks.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|Been waiting for this CD to come out, and I have everything they ever put out. Unfortunately, this CD, even with the extra 4 songs, is highly disappointing. It will put you to sleep. DM is supposed to make you want to dance, not fall asleep. Sounds more like a slow religious CD. I'm glad I bought the latest CD by MESH that was recommended when buying DM... my first disc from MESH, and worth the money.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Almost believable stroy with GREAT action and well acted too with fantastic visuals. This is what comics books were to any kid young or old.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I bought this unit to accompany a pair of AKG semi-open studio cans.  I wanted to listen to my iPod without blowing out the inter amp and headphone jack.  I must say I'm a little underwhelmed...  First let me say the design and button layout is excellent.  No quams there (see the last paragraph of this review for more information.)  But the meat and potatoes of this is the amp.  And well, its okay...  Just okay.  It doesn't crank as high as I was hoping (of course that could be my specific application as I'm driving full sized studio phones.)  And in the upper volume end it does distort pretty noticeably.  Add to that some of the techno and metal I was listening to sounded distorted at lower volumes, I just wasn't impressed.  The E6 seems to have \\"preferences\\" on what kind of music it likes.  Classical, some pop, light rock all sound pretty good.  But drive something with a lot of dynamic range and it starts failing quick.  Now that said I don't hate this unit.  It has it's uses, but as catch-all-solve-all for driving large drivers from a mobile device or mp3 player, it's hit or miss.  You best sounding solution is still to route you device through a home stereo.<br /><br />The power button is a \\"slide and hold\\" type so you wont accidentally turn off the amp.  Quickly sliding the power button does change the EQ mode of the device.  It has 3 EQ modes and a no EQ mode.  I prefer EQ 1 which gently but not overly boosts bass.  I'm listening through a set of AKG K240s and the bass on those isn't overwhelming so headphones with more of a bass focus might give a differnt experience.  The opposite edge has the volume rocker switch.  I personally think this is a little solw to react to depression.  But I find a comfortable setting (MAX :) ) and use the volume control on the iPod.  This won't work however if your using a dock to 3.5mm adaptor.  The mode indicators are well thought out.  The main LED which shines through the belt clip attach point in the corner indicates charge and on status.  Red - Unit is off and charging, Blue - Unit is on and charged or not connected to a charger, Purple - unit is on and charging, Off - unit is off and charged or not connected to a charger.  There is a second small LED on the back side of the unit which uses colors to indicate EQ mode.  The included accessories are a nice touch.  A USB to mini-USB cable for charging, a short (4\\") 90 to 90 degree male to male headphone cable for uncluttered connection between source and the amp.  And a 2' straight plug, male to male for longer runs.  It ships with two belt clips as well.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|The situation described on the book, the IT problems, etc. ressonate deeply inside me. I had to work as IT manager for 3 years in a University and the problems there were almost identical to the problems described on The Phoenix Project. Unfortunately, politics dominate public universities and there's no chance to change anything on how things are done.
B000001GKC|5.0|I have all three of Karajan's Bruckner 7th's and I believe this is the most sublime of all of them. There seems to be a spirituality that I don't find in the previous two versions. I do like the 1975 version (which as far as sheer precision and orchestral perfection goes it equals this one but like I said misses the spiritual heights that are abundant in this version under discussion) just about as much but the sound quality of it suffers quite a bit compared to this 1989 version. The tempos are just about perfect throughout with great virtuosity coming from all the sections of the orchestra. Conducting this 7th was a fitting choice to be the last piece of music that he would record before his passing. I think this version would make Bruckner smile down from Heaven. THANK YOU HERBERT FOR YOUR LOVE AND ADVOCACY OF ANTON BRUCKNER. SHINE ON!!!
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|Foul language, excessive blood; typical for this producer. Not necessary, ruined the movie.  Foxx is good, however, as is co-star.  Just too vulgar.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The first works of Kurt Sutter, writer for Sons of Anarchy...this might be even more hard-hitting than SOA I'm glued.
1936608618|2.0|Stuff you can find on the internet or stuff you already knew.  Brian Mackenzie is a smart man but I felt that this book is geared more towards the person who doesn't have the internet or doesn't know how to use the internet.  Every thing in this book is readily available on the internet or common knowledge to those who invest anytime in learning.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the books and films. And this film doesn't disappoint! 'The Hobbit' is a wonderful action packed journey!!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I just noticed this on my kindle I think one of my kids must have doenloaded this app. It looks really cool and I only used it yeterday dfor the first time but I liked the way you can ge all thesezs options at the touch of a button. As I use it more Ill let you know if I love it or not. So far it iseems very easy to use and very convenient.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|Frustrating that if you are stuck on one you may NOT continue until you figure it out!  I finally deleted it.  It was fun while it lasted.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once you get higher into the game it gets much harder but the beginning is so addicting that you keep playing and playing
B000FA675C|5.0|A good story, very well written, really do not want to put this down.  I have the book in hardback and wanted to read it again.So, I got it on Kindle.  I LOVE MY KINDLE. It's lightweight, the size of the print can be adjusted and it only needs one hand to hold & turn pages.  Anyway, The Da Vinci Code is a really good book and the Kindle is really good on which to read it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is a great Bond movie, rates along with Sean Connery Bond, Daniel Craig is a awesome 007 Bond
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I really enjoy the special effects in this movie!  It's interesting how this correlates to Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy written in 1641.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Her music is always very contemplative in an unusual way. Excellent for Taiji practice and setting a meditative mood during the day.
0061122416|5.0|I loved this book. It is arguably a boy's journey to god hood. I won't ruin the story line for you all.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|My kids love them!  Now they know laughter keeps the fear away!<br /><br />Storyline quite predictable, but well, it is for the fun of the kids, it is worth the money.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is awesome. Wish there was more ways to get alot of credits.  Its a fun game but can also irritate you.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Didn't really know much about this show before purchasing, but from my kid's laughter, I'm pretty sure it is a good deal to get at USD19.90 when it is on sale.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent!!  Could not put it down. Nature or nurture, you be the judge. Expected the first turn of events. Surprised by the ending.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Both me and my son like playing this game and enjoyed the graphics the end was a little disappointing though but overall it was a nice game
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this rating because it was not a good dictionary the words that started with A's was way too long
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great Harry Bosch read.  Michael Connelly really knows how to weave a tale, and keep his readers on edge.  I eagerly await the next book.
1423140605|5.0|I chose this rating because one: I love this book, two: it arrived a day earlier than what I had expected, and three: it came in excelent, new condition! The only thing I disliked was that the corners were a little dog-eared and the back of the cover was a little bent at the bottom. I would recommend this product to all those who like Rick Riordan,  Percy Jackson/The Heros of Olympus, and like VERY good reads! :D
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Just discovered the arrow this month and I became addicted . I find myself buying two to three episodes a day. It is fun to watch
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Start with great basic material in the movie musical, add superb filmaking, an exceptional cast, technical excellence. and package it in digital picture and sound. Finish off with a choice of presentration formats, complete with highly satisfying extras, and you end up with an unsurpassed entertainment experience! The product is a real winner!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was a great movie.  The director did an excellent job. Acting was superb. It made me cry several times. I couldn't wait to watch it and I wasn't disappointed.
141659521X|5.0|Full of action, thrills, great dialogs. The older Mitch Rapp gets the more intense and lethal he gets. A must read for any of the series fans.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Hopefully this can help me loose the weight the I need to loose and maintain that moving forward. Easy reading
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love legal crime novels, but this takes the genre to a new level! There are so many different aspects to the story that keep you guessing to the end!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the recent upgrade.  Having a snapshot of the current temp &amp; condition of all my locations is great. Recommended for business travelers .
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. So fun and addicting. Buying coins and gold from Facebook lends a bit of savings but still only a few bucks for the bonus help. So far there's a different bonus of color splash vs color rearrangement when playing online vs tablet.
B000FA675C|4.0|This is a fast paced thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Read it some time ago, but took advantage of the free kindle download.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I am approximately half way through the book and am enjoying it. THe story moves along very well. I will read more of his books.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|the movie had got plot and was interesting but had to strain to see the action way to dark ok
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It's a cute movie. Very clever but a little predictable like most of this genre are. A great movie for kids.
B007RFDCQA|5.0|i love the movie. has always been one of my favorites!!  i would reccommend it. thank you amazon.com!! its great!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is my wife's favorite movie (after Gone With The Wind).  That's all the reason I needed to buy it.  I merely find it entertaining.  It's a subjective opinion.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|great product! Buy it now if you're looking for a Go Pro 3 red filter. Outstanding and worth the price
B005LAIHR2|4.0|No redeeming social value.  No hidden messages.  Just a fun time for escaping from reality.  I got it for the music, which is great, but the show was entertaining as well.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The beginning of this movie is a bit slow, but once it gets going it's pretty entertaining.  My family has developed the strange habit of saying &#34;Blah blah blah&#34; with the typical Dracula accent in various situations since watching this and we crack up every time.  Once you see this movie, you might develop the same habit.
B005D6O0IO|5.0|I give these 5 stars. They are amazingly comfortable and very cute. Surprising for a plastic shoe but they really are. I will be wearing these a lot. Get them' you won't be disappointed
B00466HN6S|5.0|Everyone in our house enjoys this DVD including me and my husband.  When we first rented the movie on Amazon Instant Video, I expected it to entertain the kids, but make me wish I didn't have to sit through it.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it really funny and pretty original.  As a bonus, there's nothing that upset my scaredy-pants 6 year old.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Love the main characters and how they develop during the shows....I was always been fascinated with the vikings culture and how they lived during their reign
B0094BB4TW|3.0|good, but facebook app for itouch is better. sometimes you àre unable to see full picture when a friend posts a story with pic
B000FA675C|5.0|Always a good read. Compelling and a great overall story some people get hung up on the religion thing but I love it
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|Way to long. There were some funny parts but seemed very repetitive.  Even my girlfriend asked me 4 time if it was over yet.
B005LJITS0|3.0|The move was well shot and had some cool special effects however, the story seemed lacking, almost as if they has rushed it out. All together however if you're a fan of the Green Lantern franchise they you will get some enjoyment out of this movie. It's worth watching at least once.
B000002G7G|5.0|This album displays the soft, beautiful side of TVU. From Pale Blue Eyes to Jesus, the band makes sure you get they're not just about avant garde music, they can really achieve delicate vocal harmonies and great singalongs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The turns and twist in this game is wonderful just when you think you have it mastered it throws you for a loop
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Nick Cave has been around with his Bad Seeds for quite a long time now. From the use of interesting references on the lyrics (wikipedia, Hannah Montana) to the appearance of a children choir, this is a very mature album.<br />This edition also offers you a DVD with two bonus songs, which are a bit more aggresive than the rest of the album.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book! It is the best book ever I love it!<br />I just love the hunger games it's the best!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus free is simple and easy to use. A basic calculator exactly what I wanted, great for quick uses.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love this. It is very aditictive when you die, you won't to get back up again.  You just have to try this game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Downloaded this as a backup to my phone alarm for a very early flight while of town and decided to keep it for future use.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Hot sex is terrific,but its the puzzle of &#34;who killed hi.&#34; And can Eva ever really trust Gideon and have a real relationship with him.  Would it be better to walk away?  I NEED the next book!!!!!!
B001TH16DI|1.0|THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCED PRODUCT I HAVE EVER SEEN!! THE ONLY SOUND CHOICES YOU HAVE ARE DOLBY 7.1 OR FRENCH 2.0 OR SPANISH  2.1. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SURROUND SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO BLAST THE SOUND TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE VOICES AT ALL. THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU AN OPTION TO HEAR IT IN AN ENGLISH 2.0.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|And I have bought it for my boss and his boss too!<br />Objective and straight forward... gives you the self re-assurance you need to continue in this battle!
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|this was my first mega book set and it icepack me coming back for more AND MORE AND well you get the point :)
076790592X|5.0|I wish I had read this book when I was much younger.  So much wise information given.  It will be a book I recommend to many others.
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|I hated this book and suffered to the very end hoping for some shred of decency. As a naturalist who has worked with animals most of my life this was very unrealistic and didn't hold the ideals that I felt the writer was trying to convey.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie was degrading to the human condition. Nothing redeeming. Please don't waste your time. Really, don't waste your time.
B002VT6C0K|4.0|I like the author's writing very much.  There were certain stories I liked better than others but Ms. Munro is one of the better<br />writers of fiction.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I just discovered this forgotten artist and he has  a special quality  and style of singing.  I am also looking forward to seeing him in concert in Nashville in May,
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I would recommend this book, it was great reading and it was the choice of our Book Club. Really like Tina Fey.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|While I was fully aware of various events that occurred over the first fifty years of the 20th century, the characters and stories within this book  are well developed and  crafted and with a lot of details that I was not familiar.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love restraunts and hello kitty so this is my interest.Just don't upgrade your shop until you get the idea of the game.also this gives picky boys privacy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series.  It's freaking hot!!  I was also happy to see the extra (Christian's view at the end), it gave me some insight as to who he was before Ana.  It made me smile, he was such a kid.  Anyway, this was my second time reading the series and it made me feel like some kinky goings on myself, lol.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book is a honest and excellent attempt at waking up people. It shakes  up some ideas that were indoctrinated upon ourselves as we were too young to challenge and really understand them. Thanks Dawkins, I feel more free now than I was before reading it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Such a fun game for the whole family. We all sit around and feed our dragons and watch the eggs hatch. Each member of our family has their own Dragon that they have named. It's just enjoyable for all. Thank you
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Best game ever it is just like GTA but for android or kindle or what ever they r called this game is awesome
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have owned Swivel Sweepers ever since they have been on the market. I could not live without owning one. It's great the kitchen and bathroom floors and berber carpet. I am not the type of woman that drags her vacuum cleaner out once a week. The swifter will pick up all the dirt and crumbs on the kitchen floor and messes in the bathroom also. I run mine whenever need be, especially once a week before I mop the kitchen and bathroom floors, it does a better job on hard floors than my vacuum does.<br />Just follow the directions for the charging the battery and I use a metal thread puller to clean the bristles, which works great. Once you've owned a Swivel Sweeper you can't imagine your life without one.
0452273331|3.0|I think Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is a great novel of great ideas.  I read it and Rand's The Fountainhead between my senior year of high school and my freshman year of college.  I recently reread (OK re-listened to) The Fountainhead and was not as impressed as I remember being 25 years ago.<br /><br />It's not that Rand isn't a great writer.  In my opinion, she is a great writer of fiction.  Her crisp dialogue, poetic descriptive passages, and ability to tightly weave a compelling story over hundreds of pages of tiny print testify to her skill as a novelist.  But I can't really figure out what appealed to me so much philosophically here.<br /><br />In the broadest sense, Rand's hero, innovative architect Howard Roark, is a hero I can cheer for.  He stands by his convictions even when it means bucking the world of architecture and losing business.  But in terms of aesthetics, Rand leaves no room for taste.  Whether the medium is architecture, sculpture, painting, or something else, there are technical and objective measures by which a work can be judged, but there is also the simple human reaction: some like it, some don't.  If you produce a work of art that is technically brilliant, but which I don't like, I am under no obligation to praise it, and you are wrong to be offended if I pan it.  But in the world of The Fountainhead, Roark's work is brilliant and correct, while all other architects produce derivative, contemptible trash.  Perhaps my view of aesthetics is overly simplistic, but Rand's is overly exclusive.<br /><br />Another point of contention I have with Rand is the view of the market in The Fountainhead.  Rand is a hero to proponents of free markets, and rightly so based on Atlas Shrugged.  But in The Fountainhead, market considerations take second place to aesthetics.  If I am a businessman, I make money by selling a product or service that others want to buy.  If I make something no one wants, even though it's a brilliant something, I will go out of business.  That does not make me a hero, it makes me a poor businessman.  Now, if it really is brilliant, hopefully I will find my market niche before I am completely bankrupt, and maybe I will even influence the market.  But if someone is producing something aesthetically bad, and people are buying it, we can criticize the product, and criticize the consumer, but we must defend the right of the producer.  If people like buildings that borrow design elements from several eras, the buildings maybe offend the refined sensibilities of a great architect like Roark, but the architect has the right to design it and the consumer has the right to pay him to do so.  Rand demonizes free exchange between free people of bad taste.  A true defender of free markets would not do so.<br /><br />Finally, Rand's heroine, Dominique Francon, is horrible.  Even though she admires Roark to the point of worshipping him, she uses her influence to stifle his early career.  Even though she is in love with him, she marries his detestable rival, whom she hates, to--to make some kind of point.  Then she marries another rival to--to make some other kind of point.  All the while she is in love with Roark and looks forward to the time when they can finally be together again.  What kind of sick, twisted romance is this?  Sure, defend Rand, tell me I am oversimplifying Dominque's complex motives.  I just think she's stupid.<br /><br />Well, this may not be the greatest review of The Fountainhead you have ever read.  But maybe you can see these points of contention I have with the book.  There is much to admire in Roark's steadfastly holding on to his integrity; that is the strength of the story.  But in the process of displaying Roark's brilliance and indefatigable spirit, Rand looks down her nose at anyone else with whom she does not agree and who does not measure up to her standard of genius.siness.

B00B1CGDTS|5.0|One of John Wayne's best flicks. I have been waiting a long time for this to be released. I was only slightly disappointed in the quality of the Blu-Ray conversion. I think they could have done a little bit better job of cleaning this 50 year old film. It looks more like an HD broadcast rather than a Blu-Ray disc. But still, its McLintock! and it is worth watching.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Emma Watson is a force. I only bought it to see her and I wasn't disappointed. But the entire cast was excellent. Overall the acting, story, and ideas were first rate. And of course, there is Emma Watson.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was written very well.  I thought that it was interesting and entertaining.  It was a book that I looked forward to reading as it progressed.  Imaginative plot.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|Ever wonder where all the jokes about haunted buildings being built over old burial grounds came from? Well, it was \\"Poltergeist.\\"<br /><br />This was the movie that not only immortalized the \\"They're heeeeeeere!\\" line, but tapped into the spookiness of everyday things -- the closet, the underside of a bed, a staticky TV or a closed door. Some of the special effects are a bit dated, but it gives you the feeling of being a young child who genuinely believed that a hellmouth exists in your closet. Or was that just me?<br /><br />The Freeling family lives the perfect suburban life. Steve (Craig T. Nelson) is a real-estate agent and Diane (JoBeth Williams) is a housewife; they have a lovely new home, a golden retriever and three kids -- teenage Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and barely-out-of-preschool Carol-Anne (Heather O'Rourke). All is lovely and well.<br /><br />Then... weird things start happening. Chairs start moving by themselves. Specters whirl out of the TV. Earthquakes. Then a tree smashes its way into the house and abducts Robbie  -- and while his parents rescue him, Carol-Anne is sucked into a vortex in her bedroom closet. I swear to you, none of this is even slightly as funny as it sounds.<br /><br />Now Carol-Anne is missing, and though her family can hear her occasionally, they have no idea where she is or how to find her. They call on a parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), who is totally out of her element. So she brings in an otherworldly psychic (Zelda Rubinstein), who may be their only hope of getting Carol-Anne back.<br /><br />\\"Poltergeist\\" is an odd movie. It's a genuinely horrifying, spooky movie that taps into a lot of primal fears that every child has -- scary trees, lightning, dark closets, things under beds, fizzing TVs in darkened rooms. The poltergeist activity is kind of cheesy-looking (A FLYING LAMP! SO SCARY!), but most of the things we see are genuinely disturbing, like a child almost getting eaten alive by a giant knotty tree.<br /><br />It's also one of those movies wise enough to save a lot of the horror for the end -- while there are plenty of scary moments earlier on, the last fifteen minutes are a relentless onslaught of skeletons, mud, thunder, screaming and a grotesque gulping portal to \\"the beast\\" appearing in the wall.<br /><br />But at the same time, \\"Poltergeist\\" has a strangely family-friendly vibe. It was directed by Tobe Hooper, but it has the unmistakeable fingerprints of producer/writer Steven Spielberg all over it. It focuses on an ordinary, harmless suburban family living their usual lives (their biggest problem is the death of a pet bird), which is suddenly thrown into chaos by outside forces. And unlike most horror movies, there isn't even a lot of violence... well, except for one grotesque hallucination.<br /><br />The late Heather O'Rourke is best remembered now for her \\"They're here\\" line, but she actually gave a pretty decent performance -- she had the affected quality of a child actor, but she also had raw talent. The scene where she's shrieking at the ghosts to stop tormenting her is just chilling.<br /><br />Nelson and Williams are excellent as the harried, increasingly terrified parents, as are Dunne and Robins as Carol-Anne's terrified siblings. You really feel that these people ARE a family, whatever annoying qualities they have, and that they will do anything to protect each other. And Zelda Rubenstein was just a lot of fun -- her childlike voice and quirkiness (\\"You're right. You go!\\") are just charming.<br /><br />\\"Poltergeist\\" is the scariest family film I have ever seen -- a genuinely spooky ghost story that keeps amping up the horror. Definitely a good movie, but don't watch it during a thunderstorm... near your closet... with a clown doll.giant knotty tree.<br /><br />It's also one of those movies wise enough to save a lot of the horror for the end -- while there are plenty of scary moments earlier on, the last fifteen minutes are a relentless onslaught of skeletons, mud, thunder, screaming and a grotesque gulping portal to \\"the beast\\" appearing in the wall.<br /><br />But at the same time, \\"Poltergeist\\" has a strangely family-friendly vibe.

B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have another movement automated nightlight that is also a flashlight that I love, with that one, however, you have to plug it into a wall socket.  This is more convenient for other areas like the back corner of a garage where you might store stuff and need light, but is too dark, the inside of a deep cabinet you need illuminated, a kid's closet where they can't reach the light switch, under a cabinet, etc.<br /><br />I chose this for a storage area attached to our back porch where we keep some caving supplies, batteries, etc.<br /><br />It is VERY easy to change the batteries no matter which option you choose for mounting:<br /><br />Option one: Simply attach the two screws to your wall, attach the nightlight, (it slides onto the screws) and whenever you need to change the batteries, it's a snap...just slide off,  and replace by sliding back on.I<br /><br />Option two: attach one side of the velcro sticky tab to your wall or cabinet, the other to your night light, and when it's time to change the batteries, simply detach the velcro from each other and replace, then reattach the velcro tabs.  I did notice another reviewer thought this was double sided sticky tape and was confused. It's not; it's actually velcro so it does work. (It may very well be that they upgraded the mounting options but at any rate, now it's simple to do.)<br /><br />I found the brightness level excellent and the motion detecting excellent as well.  It is operated via 8 LED lights so you get great illumination for such a small piece.<br /><br />Also, it does not stand out in one's decor; simply a very flat white round orb; quite discreet.<br /><br />The choice of LED bulbs provide longer life and energy saving.<br /><br />You can also set the light to simply be \\"ON\\". This makes it great if you put it, for example, over a bar.  It can illuminate that area when you know you'll be having a dinner party and want better illumination but the flatness makes it very discreet and there is no unsightly wiring you have to plug into outlets.<br /><br />Of course, the fact that it is motion sensored means you can also attach it under cabinets and have it turn on just when needed, like under the bar cabinet when you are opening a bottle of wine.<br /><br />I was provided the light for testing purposes in order to provide unbiased honest feedback.  The only negative feedback I have is that it did not come with batteries so be sure to buy 4 AA batteries.  It does come with all mounting hardware.wiring you have to plug into outlets.<br /><br />Of course, the fact that it is motion sensored means you can also attach it under cabinets and have it turn on just when needed, like under the bar cabinet when you are opening a bottle of wine.<br /><br />I was provided the light for testing purposes in order to provide unbiased honest feedback.

B00030590I|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This movie is amazing. But like many others have stated, Miramax simply does not do this film justice. Really. Do yourself a big favor and track down the Chinese or Elite Japanese version. I downloaded the movie (Chinese original version) before I bought it here and was absolutely taken aback by the beautiful masterwork in this story. The colors, the music, the characters, everything. But what I fell in love with was the dialogue. The translation was superb, concise and didn't glare out or detract from the movie.<br /><br />None of that transferred to the North American release. The picture itself was mediocre and the translation was completely different. Clumsy wording and flowery excesses replaced the verbal clarity and efficiency that moved me. The pounding Kodo drums and swelling violins fell flat next to the lead weight of the stupid dialogue which popped on the screen as a distracting garish yellow.  \\"Ruined\\" doesn't even do what Miramax did to this movie justice. They skewered it worse than Broken Sword at the end of the movie. Butchered. So disappointing.<br /><br />Sadly, this DVD is going in my pile destined for Goodwill, though letting someone repurchase this mutilated junk seems to kind of defeat the purpose.<br /><br />Will happily spend three times as much and buy foreign version.

0679720200|4.0|I first became aware of this book through the music of Jeff Johnson and when I had read it the ideas in it fascinated me. Like Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel, The Double, it is an interesting look at schizophrenia. To me, proof that it was well done is how disturbing the ending is.
1571200851|4.0|I was interested in this book as a quilter. It has beautiful projects and ideas. I found that the step by step photos were too tiny to be of great help. It is hard to see exactly how something is folded. It took a lot of trial and error to get a flower I was happy with. So, the book is beautiful, directions are not the best to achieve quick results.
B000X1R4S2|5.0|The story follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized by an evil being which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. Primarily appearing in the form of a clown, It attracts its preferred prey of young children. It deals with themes which would eventually become King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma, and the ugliness lurking behind the façade of traditional small-town values.<br />For me, the best bits are where it ties to King longest work... The Dark Tower.

6305513406|3.0|... I had forgotten how bad the first episode of Trek was. For all the &#34;bright future&#34; reputation the show has, the pilot (actually, the second pilot) is really very dark in attitude. It fosters the idea that the new and unknown are to be feared and destroyed.<br /><br />The Corbomite Manuever is better, and has a better ending. It's the first episode I remember seeing as a kid. It's a little slow and lacks any sort of action, but much better represents the Trek I came to love.<br /><br />My only other criticism is that there are only two episodes on the disc... They could easily have put for or five per disc. I would have been happier if it had three, in fact... with the actual pilot, pre-Kirk, leading it off.
0307352153|4.0|REVIEWED BY LAURA<br /><br />Near the beginning of this book, there is a sort of \\"quiz\\" to see if you are an introvert. Well, as I've always strongly suspected, yep, I am! I scored 14 out of 19 on the quiz, which puts me solidly on the introvert side of the introvert-extrovert divide. I suspect that many of the readers of this blog are also introverts--I think us bookworms tend to be more introverted on average.<br /><br />However, while it's tempting to think of introversion and extroversion as two nice big buckets that we can sort everyone into neatly, that is unfortunately not the case. If you were to see me when I'm around my closest friends and family, there's probably no way you'd think I'm an introvert--I can talk up a storm! And if you knew that I used to be completely comfortable performing stand-up and improv comedy in front of crowds, I'm sure you'd think that is definitely NOT something your typical introvert would find fun or pleasing. But here's the key--introvert is not a synonym for \\"shy\\" and extrovert is not a synonym for \\"outgoing.\\" It's much more complicated than that.<br /><br />In this book, Susan Cain examines these complications, succeeding in writing an interesting, practical, and very thought-provoking book. First of all, how do we even define introversion? As I alluded to, it's more than just being shy or outgoing. Some people suggest that a good definition is where you go when you need to \\"recharge your battery.\\" In other words, some people get energy from being around others, whereas some need solitude. It's not that introverts are antisocial or don't enjoy the company of others. It's just that, for example, after a full day of meetings they might not want to go out to a group dinner, preferring instead to go home and spend some time reading or knitting or whatever. Others suggest that introversion is highly associated with sensitivity to new situations. Introverts are much more likely to be uncomfortable when faced with novelty (I can attest...you can ask me about the first time I took a yoga class!).<br /><br />This book is in many ways Susan Cain's love letter to introverts. After reading this book I realize I'm lucky that I haven't had the experience that many introverts have had. Apparently, a lot of introverts have gone through life feeling as though something is wrong with THEM because they aren't outgoing enough or enthusiastic enough or just don't \\"fit in\\" right.<br /><br />This is because our culture conforms to something called \\"The Extrovert Ideal\\"--the belief that successful people should be outgoing and love teamwork and networking events. She traces the rise of this ideal as we moved from an agricultural economy to a sales and service-oriented culture. And the ideal has just gotten stronger in recent years, with the rise of social media, collaborative brainstorming sessions, and open office plans. The funny thing is, research has actually shown that group brainstorming sessions produce FEWER good ideas, and open office plans actually REDUCE productivity.<br /><br />The Extrovert Ideal is also a very culturally dependent phenomenon. In many Asian cultures, being quiet and retiring and, well, polite, is seen as a sign of respect. It's also partially why many Asian countries have for many years trounced the United States at math and science tests. While US kids are spending much of the day doing group work and learning social skills, children in Asian schools are spending time focusing on learning to think independently. Now, I'm not saying there's not a place for social skills or that they aren't important, but the key is that US kids are getting prepared for their future workplaces, which will demand teamwork, collaboration, and extensive networking. So that's fine, if that's the America we want to create. But if we want to encourage individual thinking and innovation...well, perhaps we are doing our kids a disservice.<br /><br />Most of the famous artists, inventors, thinkers, scientists, etc. of the last century have been, you guessed it, introverts. Cain describes many of these successful introverts and talks about how they've had to overcome cultural expectations in order to be successful. There are really interesting parts about what it means to be an introverted evangelical Christian, raising and encouraging introverted kids, and of course, introvert-extrovert love matches. Also, Rosa Parks = total introvert. One of my favorite parts of the book is when Cain describes how her act of defiance wouldn't have been as powerful if she had been an extrovert by nature (i.e., if everyone was just tired of hearing that Rosa Parks go on and on about how unfair bus policies were.)<br /><br />Lest you think the book portrays all extroverts as loud people who talk too much and don't like to think deeply about things, fear not. Cain also has a fair amount to say about the negatives about being an introvert--we may end up thinking too much and missing important opportunities, we are not as good at multitasking or reading social cues, etc. In short, there is no one \\"right\\" way to be. But since extroverts usually get all the press (possibly because they pretty much ARE the press), and they have their own \\"classics\\" (How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, for example), I think this book is hugely important contribution to the literature on personality.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />I listened to this book (and the narrator, Kathe Mazur, was quite excellent), but before I wrote this review, I actually had to go and check out a physical copy of it from the library. And I think before long I'll end up buying it, because I think it's one that I'll want to refer back to in the future. If you are at all interested in personality theories, you'll love this book. If you suspect that you are an introvert and want to hear about your strengths as well as ways to overcome some of the obstacles that society has placed in your way, this is definitely one to pick up. If you are an extrovert who suspects he/she is married to an introvert, this book might do wonders for your relationship.

B005LAIGW8|1.0|Ghost rider spirit of vengeance has got to be one of the worst movies ever. Everything I liked about the first one is gone our altered and cage's acting even got worse. It also has one of the lamest plots I was bored out of my mind trying to keep up with it as I didn't care much for the movie within the first 10 minutes and it didn't get much better from there. The effects even look cheaper and not as well done. So do I have anything good to say about this movie not really. Even if you liked the first one I think you could safely skip this one and miss nothing.

B000OVLBF8|2.0|I can't find too much to say about ghost rider that is positive but I will try anyways. The bike cage's character rides is very nice both before and after transformation. Eva mendes is pretty and sam Elliot does a great job. Now to the bad which starts with Nicholas cage's acting which I found to be over the top to the point of being comical and not very believable at all. Second the villians which for being things of such evil I found very unthreatening. The battles are over in minutes with it hardly ever feeling like they were a real threat to the ghost rider. The ghost rider had such potential to be a great movie but failed in the end I think. A story like this could have been a epic battle between good and evil but instead is watered and toned down for todays audiences. Everything comes off as a complete joke. And yes I know its based off a comic book and wasn't meant to be serious. But I still feel it could have been much more. Its one saving grace its miles ahead of the second one which isn't saying much.

The fact he is backed by actors like ed harris and sean connery who do a great acting job certainly doesn't hurt. The rock could have been a brainless action movie but thankfully there is a substantial story behind the explosions and gunfire. Which don't get me wrong the explosions and gunfire are great very intense and entertaining. Bottom line is the rock is a movie any action fan should enjoy.

B00BF123WG|2.0|Director accepted CIA's BS reasoning, and implied in the film, that torture led to locating Bin Laden, but it ended up being meticulous, dogged research that turned the tide.  Using a fashion-model camera approach to the ivory-skinned, perfectly coiffed agent trivialized her and her role. (See Claire Danes in &#34;Homeland&#34; for what real stress looks like in a beautiful face.)  All of which made me doubt that the agent who was killed in the suicide bombing was the only one to blame for that failure.<br /><br />Interesting part of the film was the raid itself.  Complex was larger than I had realized.  Nor did I know that local CIA operatives participated in the raid.  According to the film, they, and the Navy seals, conducted the operation professionally and bravely and with due compassion, and we could be proud of their part in taking down bin Laden.

1451626657|5.0|I only bought this because I destroyed my ex's copy. The whole situation reminded me of the classic &#34;let's just replace our son's dead hamster with one that looks exactly like it so he doesn't get sad.&#34; Worked like a charm.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|What can you say.  A DVD is a DVD.  If you like the movie you will like this product.  If you don't know the movie why would you buy it in the first place.
B008469DGY|5.0|I loved this game on my Iphone and love it more on my kindle fire hd 8.9...great to play while sitting on the bus in traffic!
0812983459|5.0|Harold Fry and his wife, Maureen, live in a small English village and don't have much in common anymore. Indeed, everything Harold does, or doesn't do, annoys Maureen and he can't defend himself. But one morning all that changes. He gets a letter, addressed in a feathery scrawl, from one Queenie Hennessy, a former colleague he hasn't seen in over 20 years. Queenie is in a hospice, 600 miles away, and is dying of cancer. She is writing to tell him good-bye. Harold immediately writes her back and goes out to mail the postcard. But on the way to the Post Office a strange thing happens. He stops for a snack at a garage and gets into a conversation with the young cashier there, who tells him it's faith that saves people, not medicine. And suddenly, on the spur of the moment, Harold decides to walk to the hospice, convinced that as long as he's walking Queenie will live. So, completely unprepared for the journey, he sets off, without a map, a phone, or even a decent pair of shoes, but determined to see it through. Along the way he meets a vast variety of people and is humbled by the many act of kindness he receives from total strangers. He also<br />thinks back on his life with Maureen, how they met at a dance and fell in love, and his sorrow at what he regards as his failure as a father. At home, Maureen, too, who initially was furious with Harold for leaving and thinks his quizotic journey is just another example of his foolishness, finds herself questioning her own behaviour and faults, and, to her surprise, misses Harold more and more. What happens when Harold, exhausted and spent, finally completes his journey, sees Queenie, and reunites with Maureen, is profoundly touching and confirms one's belief in the goodness of the human spirit. A lovely book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a culmination of a great cast and story that covers both sides of a English estate.It tells the story of the staff that works for the family and and how they often inter mix with each other.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The clip in the case was broken.  This is not worthy of the hobbit.  I love the movie, but not what was delivered to me.
1878424319|4.0|I saw Don Miguel Ruiz on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday and I fell in love with him. This book is outstanding and makes a lot of sense. Must read
B00973902K|4.0|Come on, what guy on the dating circuit would not wish for some girl to be willing to give out her phone number!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have to admit this game is very addictive. One of the best things about this game is that it has an option to allow up to play the levels with no time restriction. You can solve the puzzles at your own pace.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game with lots of my friends and together we made a epic world<br />and this is way easier to join others while it is really competive to see who is better
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I wanted more! Great movie! All the actors played their parts. The settings were great. The issue of slavery was dealt in a very human way. Lots of action, great 1-liners. I think I've seen this movie 18 times and it doesn't get old
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever!!:) my whole family plays the game. its a very cool game! we love it. the skateboards are cool
B007C52NY2|5.0|What a set of books to give someone as a gift or to keep for yourself. I purchased as a gift for a friend. She was very pleased.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|HANDS DOWN HUGH JACKMAN WAS AMAZING!!!!!! He should have won best actor for this!! it was heart-wrenching to see all the pain...but it was an amazing movie and all the actors were so good and well beyond prepared for their roles...it is like the best story about giving others second chances and seeing the good that can come of it...that, and when life gives you lemons make lemonade...awesome movie I'd recommend it to anyone!!
B00B9JDBSO|2.0|The Knife played themselves this time, self-abused by overwhelming pretentiousness. Don't get me wrong, I love these guys -- SILENT SHOUT is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I would even give Fever Ray a solid four stars -- but SHAKING THE HABITUAL is a generic noise album with nothing much to recommend it. My girlfriend heard some of the first half and said, \\"This sounds like a soundtrack. Is something about to go down?\\" That's when the serial killer kicked in my door and we had a knife fight, but it had nothing to do with The Knife! ( I kid. )<br /><br />In conclusion, I would like to put emphasis on the word 'generic'. If you have encountered noise type of albums before or watched very many hollywood movies then SHAKING THE HABITUAL isn't likely to be anthing new or interesting to you. Maybe if this album came out thirty years ago it would have been... well, not good, but at least ground breaking.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|I've had the &#34;Unplugged&#34; CD forever and decided that I enjoy it so much I bought it for my Kindle.  LOVE IT!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I enjoyed every minute except perhaps the final scene.  Hoping they will reconsider about Matthew!  Can't wait to order the next season.
8862931921|4.0|After years of using different sketchbooks I've settled on this one. Worth the extra expense from cheaper alternatives. Quality binding and construction along with the heavier, off white paper makes this my 'go-to' choice for sketching.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I love this band. There is so much soul and passion in their music. I can't wait until they release a new CD.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|This is the first novel of Nicholas Sparks I've read and I was sorely disappointed.  The plot is totally predictable and hokey.  Even the title is unfortunate.  If this is &#34;the best of Nicholas Sparks&#34; this is the last book of his I will ever buy.<br />When I say the plot is totally predictable, I refer to the book's ending.  When I read that a major character's son will die without a suitable heart transplant donor, I thought to myself, &#34; Oh no.  Surely the author will NOT do that.&#34;  It would be totally contrived.  Sadly, a few pages later, I discovered that Nicholas Sparks did do just that.  Totally contrived ending.  Totally unbelieveable.  Totally condescending to his readers.  Do not buy this book even if you love and adore Nicholas Sparks - unless of course this really is &#34;the best&#34; of the author's writing.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie is no exception to the other ones before it. My son loves every single movie with these characters. He has probably already watched this movie 6 or seven times since I purchased it. My husband enjoys watching this movie with him. Lots of fun and adventure.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|All of Buble's albums have been so top notch. This one however not so much. The cd feels rushed, the songs feel rushed, the production is way over done and too pop or doowop or something, and it just feels like a mess of music and styles. I agree with other reviewers who say it sounds like hes just going through the motions, which has never been his forte. I dont care for the beautiful day single Im sorry to say. This album may work on a cruise ship, which is the style/genre it really falls in. Campy songs and a mess of music. I hate saying these things because I love Buble, but I think this was hastily put together and is a roller coaster of noise and style. This years releases from artists are not exciting me, I dont know whats going on, I was disappointed with Diana Krall earlier this year and more recent with Sarah Brightman, and now Buble. Maybe I need to take a break from music? Anyway with all that said above, I do enjoy Have I Told you Lately that I Love You with Naturally 7. Actually the second half the album is a lot better than the first half. I am really digging his version of Youve Got a Friend in Me, its retro style kinda like something you would hear in a 60s movie and is just fun without being silly or campy like the first few songs. Like I said the second half of the album fares so much better and I am really enjoying it. Love Nevertheless with the Puppini Sisters too...The standout track is the last one, Young at Heart, now thats Buble!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What can I say. I am a big fan of this story and I loved getting more information on the background. We all enjoyed this film. Lots of action and amazing animation.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The book started out slow, but was an enjoyable read on my Kindle.  I enjoyed the people he met along the way.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I bought this movie for my son and I watched it with him, I loved the storyline. The graphics were beautiful and the characters were very unique with great appeal. I would recommend to anyone.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|This read is great and the painting is even better. I would recommend this book to everyone. it certainly gives one  a  whole new aspect of what life was like in her time.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This was a refreshing twist to a vampire story. The storyline was great and the characters were very interesting. A great little movie. My older daughter actually enjoyed this one and she doesn't watch many cartoon type movies anymore. My son loves this one as well.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|entertaining two hours, wahlberg is great in action films, it held my attention but it was just above average overall
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I am not usually a fan of Q. T. movies, but this one had a great story, fun characters, and humor to boot! I could have done without the extre-gorey effects, but that seems to be a Q.T. trademark. It definitely did not seem like I watched an almost 3-hour movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have read in a while...couldn't put it down! Didn't see the ending coming at all which is always nice.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It is a very okay game the layout is okay but the battles are amazing. If I had to buy this game I would that's how good this game is. It is so much fun and you will never<br />stop playing this game with a stranger beside you.
0545265355|5.0|I bought the trilogy on my reader. The trilogy is unforgettable. The ending of the world and this as the afterlife. The capitol that came after and the districts. The means for survival and the games to show who is in charge. The rebellion with Katniss leading the way. The loves and losses, the friendships, wow its so much more than what it is. Best trilogy!!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Great app for the Kindle fire. Looks like it would in a web browser without having to open it and navigate to the web site.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Like Mario brothers but with an Irish twist. You will loose track of time. It is really fun and good for all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book over for a fourth time. Now, it's on to the next two ones! Love it! -carly
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Lots of fun but you have to be fast to score well! I think anyone would like playing this game.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Funny and entertaining for audiences of all ages.  Hilarity ensues when an unlikely friendship forms between a culinarily gifted rat and the son of a great chef who did not inherit any of his father's talent for cooking.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|The headset is probably one of the best for its price. I've tested it on my PS3 and PC and never had any issues. Wish it was a little more compact but it's only a minor thing.
B00683JLXA|2.0|First of all, to the people who say this is a shameless clone of angry birds, let's keep in mind that angry birds itself is a clone. This theme that rovio took is by no means an original one... Just think about it. Castle Clout, Crush the Castle, and several other, lesser known ones are the base for angry birds... Angry birds has just see. more success. If you want an original game by rovio, I'd suggest bad piggies. that game is actually an original. also, this game seems like one of the lower-end games of thelis genre.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Packed with so much information and actual words that were used by real men of that era, I was completely intrigued and compelled to read on and on and on without a break.  I learned even more about Lincoln but what I really appreciated was getting to know the men he picked for his cabinet and why and how he did it.This book is such an in-depth look  at what was going on undercover re the war, political conventions and human relationships.  I sometimes felt like I was eavesdropping on a society ball at William Seward's or Salmon Chase with his beautiful and intelligent daughter Kate as his hostess.<br /><br /> I think Mr. Chase surprised me the most with his &#34;need&#34; to be president.  And if I once thought of him as upright and honest.  I no longer think of him that way. *(possible spoiler alert)  The man believed he never did anything wrong!!!  He was  brilliant  as Secretary of the Treasury, but weaseled around and manipulated anyone  who had influence to get him elected president ...&#34;..because the country needed him and NOT Lincoln for another four years. &#34;  He really believed he was God's gift and was therefore entitled to the office of president.  Lincoln kept him around for a long time even knowing Chase was speaking badly about him behind his back.  I think Chase was passive aggressive.  See what you think.<br /><br />Lincoln understood what he was up against during his first term.  Most of the men he chose had at one time been his enemies.  He handled them so astutely that some became his best friends and realized he wasn't the country bumpkin they had thought he was and they respected and admired him.  Wish we had a Lincoln now.<br /><br />I've read another book by Doris Kearns Goodwin about FDR and I enjoyed it immensely.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Good graphics, good acting, neat twist on the vikings/dragon/space man type.  I was really impressed with the movie, enjoyed it, no real boring parts.  They could have done more with Ron Perlman's part, he has such a great intro into the movie and then his role fizzles out.  One of those \\"yeah I'll watch that again\\" type of movies.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had just come to accept that there was nothing new to be had in games. Same puzzles, same stupid hidden objects...  And then I found this one. It's a 3D puzzle box that you turn, push, and pull on in search of keys for the many locks. Each chapter ends with a final lock that unfolds a whole new  (more complex) dimension of the box. It's not difficult, and there are hints, if you need them, . but they are hints, not answers. Things like &quot;Look for something inconsistent or out of place.&quot;  So they don't spoil the fun.<br /><br />It's a fairly short game, but I wasn't bothered by that. There's no padding put there just to extend it. More like a short movie that would lose its impact if you added filler to it. Well worth the money.
B00CJ6Q7AA|5.0|This show is incredible. The thought and detail put in to every characters actions, thoughts, emotions is unreal, as is the variety of themes they explore - and its only been four episodes!
B002XISFGS|4.0|The main reviews listed are for the updated DVD release of The Motion Picture.  However, this Blu Ray release is NOT the updated release, it is the Original Theatrical Release, with the effects flaws, film dirt, and all.<br /><br />That being said, it's still an excellent, if slow, movie.  The transfer and sound quality are both fair, and it looks solid on a 42\\" screen.  The only scenes that are grainy are when the V'ger probe arrives on the bridge, but that footage has looked distractingly grainy on every recording I've seen.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Slender the impossible game sucks and poop vs narwhal the impossible game of people who are not allowed contact with a lot of money and poop vs turtle
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This series exceeded expectations! Fantastic plots and acting carries this timeless classic into the 21st century! I would purchase this series if I were anyone that enjoys masterful acting at the peak of perfection from Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game Is so epic that I never play it because all my other games are better trolololololololololololo your papa style troll
0802473156|4.0|This is a must read book for all couples.  Saw Dr. Chapman on the Oprah show and I was curious about the book. Glad I purchased. It has helped me and my relationships.
0743297334|5.0|Book looked brand new.  I enjoyed reading<br />it very much.  Hemmingway is a great writer.<br />It was a fun, light and interesting read.  I would<br />recommend the book and the seller.
B0059R5Q08|4.0|a) Michael Fassbender<br /><br />b) Mia whatshername<br /><br />c) the story<br /><br />d) everything<br /><br />I love the tone and feel and tension and all of it.
B00ABO609A|4.0|great movie and it really prompts reflection on addiction and how we can fall in love and become enablers of addiction as well ... how painful to watch loved ones sink into self-harming use of addictive, murderous substances like crack ... but the focal dramatic journey in this film was the life path of the addicted man's co-dependent partner
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I love being able to watch the old shows on Prime!! :) The streaming is great, no issues. I did find that the HD was better than the regular streaming, so if you have Prime and do not have to pay for the HD, it does look better.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|classic hit musical ... who can't help but love this show? great acting and Michael York is awesome handsome to boot
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a huge fan of the books and movies. And yes, there are some added things that were not in the book but they tell a little of the background that was not explained in the other movies. It was still wonderful to watch and the minor changes were not an issue for me. If you are a true die hard it has to be like the book kind of person, you may not consider this 5 stars, but I absolutely loved it :)
B007FIY3VW|2.0|I bought this to be able to edit documents on the go. When it works, it can be handy. It took multiple tries before it recognized uploaded files.  File names cannot have spaces or special characters. Sometimes crashes when opening files.
B00428LIXO|1.0|Product quality is not what you expected no audio will replace the battery and still the same problem<br /><br />I miss her so much because I've always bought this brand and not had problems.<br />I would like to make me replenishing<br />thanks
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I originally started with this version of Draw, and after sometime and some enjoyment, I upgraded to the paid one.
1451696191|3.0|Maybe I'm biased because I saw the movie first, but the book just didn't cut it for me. I read it quite fast within three days, but it just wasn't as good as all the rave about it. Don't get me wrong it was an okay book and a very easy read. I think if i didn't see the movie first and have it to recall the scenes and emotion from it as I was reading, I don't think I would have even finished the book.<br />The movie however is astonishing, I never have bought a movie I saw on DVD. I was completely compelled to buy this one however, definitely see the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so riveting & full of twists & turns, it was impossible to put down!<br />I loved it!
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Very amazing story with a realistic ending. You love her until the last scene and you wish you could help her feel better. Tears were shed, just as a warning
B00005JLSE|4.0|it's well done and everyone involved is plenty skilled, but only liking half the cast i don't watch it as much as other movies i own. most of the time i'll just listen to the soundtrack and save time.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 shades you will love this. These two charictrts are in a slightly similar situation and have a heated affair.  But I love how they interact with each other. Just when you think things are great someone screws it up.
B002ZG976U|5.0|i love music, and elaborate shiny costumes, and theater pageantry, so liking musical films is a logical progression for me. i'd had my doubts about Christina as an actress, but this movie was moving and heartwarming, and i was glad to be proved wrong by her capability.
