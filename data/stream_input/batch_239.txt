6302719631|4.0|This adaptation of NA movie is \\"very\\" refreshing to see because it breaks away from the traditional style most JA's movies were created.  It also captured the Gothic and dark moods of NA and of Catherine Moorland's fantasy.  I consider this movie and the  book are underrated and over looked. I do hope readers and fan of JA will give this movie/novel a chance.
B000002UAR|5.0|in me adding another one? absolutely none of course. If only to say that 6 months or so ago i was a typical 16 year old who thought that coz the beatles were not from my time period,and my parents liked them, they were 'uncool'. One of my mates had been a major beatles fan for the past 3 years, and i had always took the p**s out of him for it. Then i let him borrow me 'Revolver' and i was just blown away by it. I had no idea they were this good! Since then i have acquired 8 beatles albums and 2 'past masters' albums, but this, the first i heard is still the best in my opinion. Its not coz there are no 'bad' songs on here coz the beatles rarely did 'bad' songs, and a lot of there albums contain no 'bad' songs. Its the sheer number of absolute great songs on this album that makes it my favourite. 'Taxman', 'Elanor Rigby', 'I'm Only Sleeping', 'Here, There and Everywhere', 'She Said She Said', And your Bird Can Sing', For No One', 'Got To Get You In To My life' and of course quite possibly my favourite Beatles song, 'Tomorrow Never Knows' all being great songs, and the others i have metioned are still very good. If your gonna start gettin in to the Beatles, i reccomend starting here with their best, and don't let your age put you off!
0151003084|5.0|Is it wrong to find unusual deaths of young children, from A to Z, so amusing? All drawn in classic Gorey style, the children are shown mere moments before their somewhat outlandish deaths. A fun &amp; brief coffee table book, my favourite is &quot;N is for Neville who died of ennui&quot; - the drawing is perfect!
B000060P79|5.0|The first time I heard of Simple Plan was at a concert that I went to (Little Stink, Portland, OR) they were the first show and they were AWESOME. They were way better then the other 4 bands, witch included GC. Then I met them and got thier autographs, and they were SO nice. So I bought thier CD, and it is so great. The songs are upbeat and overall this is the best CD I have got in a LONG time. I would definetly recomend it to anyone!
0060278234|5.0|I found this bok to be one of the best books I have ever read. Garth Nix weaves up fantasy, mystery, and adventure to create a genre of his own. It is a book anyone can enjoy and the characters are all developed with great detail. This is a book I couldn't put down you want to know what happens next. You can feel all the emotions of Lirael throughout the book it starts of with action with her wanting to kill herself. A awsome way to start a book. Ithink anybody could connect to  how Lirael feels left out. I hope you read this spectacular book
B00005O5CM|4.0|Robert Luketic's Legally Blonde is so over the top that any person with any level of normal intelligence and taste will be squirming in their seats and rolling their eyes for the first 10 minutes or so of the film.  The caricature is so outlandish and the kitsch ladled on so heavily that the film seems intent on blowing by parody to excessive farce.  However, the genuineness of Reese Witherspoon and the shift from California to Boston and the sorority house to the law school provide just enough dampening to allow you to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie.<br />And the movie is enjoyable.  Witherspoon has a genuine radiance on screen which, combined with her wonderful sense of comedic timing, allows one to forgo analysis of the obvious and hackneyed plot and concentrate on her quite considerable talents.  Moreover, Luketic, in what amounts to a heroic restraint these days, virtually completely forgoes the modern tendency in summer \\"fluff\\" movies to avoid cheap and tawdry sexual exploitation (the \\"bend & snap scene being the only real exception) and concentrate on the story, letting is focus on Reese's acting rather than her bosom.  (Way to go BOB!)<br />In the end one is left with a much better than average Summer-B-flick experience that is both entertaining and amusing in the extreme.
B000066NW0|5.0|Finally a girl with talent! Her punk/alternative sound will be sure to get you up out of your seat and dancing around! Songs like &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; will be sure to make you move. I enjoyed the whole album. Every track is unique and different from the one before it. The fact that this girl can write, has the look, and sound and is only 17 is pretty incredible. Hopefully she'll be around for a while. It's about time we got sometime with talent!
0671467212|3.0|To paraphrase the old nursery rhyme: \\"Ten little, nine little, eight little suspects.\\"  The suspects fall in rapid succession as the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to one after another.  This group of unlikely and unlikeable suspects find themselves marooned on a deserted island.  Each hides a dark secret, each is guilty of some past wrong.  An unknown avenger strikes them down one at a time, until . . . .  Christie pulls off her usual surprise ending and reveals a perpetrator no one would suspect.  Not her best work, but an entertaining read.
B000066NW0|4.0|I have a crush on Avril Lavigne, and let me tell you, she is the only crush I've ever had on a singer... But Avril Lavigne is definately something different. Above her great looks and confidence in showing her true self through her music is an amazing artist and musician. Her debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, is a very good &quot;freshman album&quot;, which I will appropriately call &quot;anything but ordinary&quot;. Avril certainly has an aptitude to write some great songs. One of the things I like about Avril Lavigne is that she's not afraid to be herself. She's such a punk skater chick, and she doesn't try to cover it up with make-up or preppy clothing. One of my favorite songs on the album, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, is definately worth checking out. My only problem with this album is that a few of the tracks (Things I'll Never Say, My World) were not to my liking. Not my style... And some of the songs take a while before they get any good... And track #1 (Losing Grip), a good song at first, gets kinda weird towards the middle, thus losing its previous coolness completely. But hey, these are but minor setbacks among the greatness of this surprisingly-good-for-a-debut album. If you're a fan of hott punk girls who can actually sing and write good rock/pop-punk music, you should really check out Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot;... Actually, even if you don't like that kinda stuff, buy it anyways!<br />P.S.- The production and mixing of the album contributes to this CD's cool sound.
0679735909|5.0|I'd never read A. S. Byatt's work before, but when a friend gave me \\"Possession\\" for Christmas, I decided to read it before the movie version came out (on August 16th, 2002). I finished it utterly in awe of Byatt's prodigious grasp of a wide range of subjects: poetry, fiction, Victorian manners and symbolism, academic jealousy, and more. She combines all these, not to mention a rollicking good mystery, in \\"Possession\\" with an assurance and ease that belie the complexity of the book.<br />Briefly, Byatt interweaves a modern-day academic mystery with a Victorian romance. Her modern-day main characters, Maud Bailey and Roland Michell, join forces to uncover the truth behind the many Victorian veils involved in covering up the Victorian romance between Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. The ending is supremely powerful and feels exactly right given the preceding pages. Byatt writes gorgeous, intricate poetry on the part of both Ash and LaMotte, and both poets come vividly to life via Byatt's poems and the letters she writes from their point of view. So, too, do Bailey and Michell come alive as flesh-and-blood characters here. Byatt's astonishing trick is to keep them separate, yet intertwined across the span of a century, and to make each of their wants and desires vividly real.<br />\\"Possession\\" is a masterful work. It gives me hope for the modern novel in a way no other book has in years. I salute Byatt for her imagination and her prose, not to mention her poetry. I stand in awe of this immensely rewarding book and recommend it highly.

B000066JES|5.0|Way back in 1991 I was introduced to Manowar and their incredible Kings of Metal CD.  that was 11 years ago, and the band was already over a decade old!<br />Manowar has never caught on here in America, and it's because of their 'cheesy' lyrics about honor in death, Vikings, and other Medieval topics.  Their music, however, is old-fashioned metal and for those who take the time to *listen* and not just react, Manowar is one of the most impressive bands out there.<br />Since they've never been big in America, I don't know how well the band does financially.  To the CD buyer - it doesn't matter.  Manowar negotiates their own contracts with labels.  They built their own studio, and once you pop in the latest CD, you'll know they spent GOBS of money in production.<br />So, what about the music?  I have to admit, it took me one listen all the way through to think \\"What was THAT?\\". Then, I realized, the ballads, the opera, the slower songs, the trilogy, and the heavy songs are all *powerful* and work well together!  What you're left with is an *awesome* album from a great band!!<BR>Highly recommended.
B00003CXI1|1.0|this movie was highly overrated if you are over the age of 10.<BR>it was way too long and if you are an adult there was not enough<BR>excitement to stay awake for. if you like magic and mystery turn<BR>to the wb on thursday nights and watch charmed. much more excitement for an adult than this will ever be. i still cannot <BR>figure out what the hoopla is all about unless you are a child.
B000001G1E|5.0|Get up off that thing and Dance! This box set and Queen of Soul is the reason why I bought a CD player in the 1990s because I LOVED my Albums with its two sides and more but this CD box set was an inspiration. I rang around and invited all of my friends to a King and Queen Soul party and played the two box sets all night in alternating funkadellaica. In life there are some things you think you'll never do. But all the limits are moved when you hear the funk and passion on STAR TIME. So FUNKing hot is this you'll need a drink. Sex Machine, Cold Sweat, Papa's Got A Brand New Bang, Hot Pants, I could go on forever. <br />Here's the deal. I live in England and Ska, Reggae, Funk, Pop and soul have equal field here so I love this, <BR>Barbra Streisand, Bowie, The Beatles and Bob Marley. But nothing in the World of music can take the place of this SuperBad Dude. Mother in heaven let the people know, If you want to be cool and hot and win the eye of like minded people and generate a stupor among the narrow minded, Play this any night of the week and let your troubles walk away because all you need in music is right here. The Godfather is no pretender, so bendover and do a back flip, knowing this is a man's world but it would be nothing, Nothing! without a woman on this earth. Can you feel it!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Though not for every taste, Moulin Rouge is one of the most original and inspring movies made in recent years. It is a acted half in voice, half in song. It is a classic love story about a rich-in-spirt but short on cash writer (Even McGregor) who falls in love with a beautiful, but largely inaccessble entertainer (Nicole Kidman). They embark upon creating what will be the best play of all time, and it is to be performed in the Moulin Rouge, a gentleman's club known for it's spectacular stage shows. The writer and actress and the writer embark on a clandestine love affair, while under the watchful eye of a powerful Duke, who is paying for the production and to whom she is promised. It is a story about love, overcoming aclass and circumstance.<br />While the story might not seem like much on paper, the way it was produced is sheer magic. The musical numbers are spectacular, and make Moulin Rouge worth repeated viewings. McGregor and Kidman are fantastic, lending their singing voices, while the incredible cast add the the majesty. Music lovers will notice modern pop songs inserted into the music productions, music from Madonna, Nirvana, Joe Cocker, and various others. You'll know them when you hear them.<br />The DVD package gives you everything you could possibly want: trailers, music videos, star profiles, &quot;making of&quot; specials, interviews, and other goodies. Once you see the movie, you will definitely want to check out  the extras, which show how much work and dedication went into making Moulin Rouge. While Moulin Rouge would be good to own in any format, it is best to own it on DVD, since you get all the extras, which are quality, not filler.<br />A lot of my friends loved this movie, and a lot of them hated it. It is all a matter of individual taste. I loved everything about this movie, and it will remain on my list of favorite movies.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I really think that we need more movies like Memento.  Memento scores big because of intellegence, maturity, and most of all being unique.  The problem with many movies is that they don't bring anything new to the screen, and don't have any depth or intellegent plots.  At first, Memento sounds like your average everyday movie, it's about a man who's wife was murdered and now he is seeking revenge.  This seems pretty boring, but it isn't, because there is one thing that makes this movie a whole lot more interesting.  Leonard, the man whos wife was murdered, got an injury on that same night, and because of it, he can not make new memories, he can remember everything that happened up until the injury, but everyting else just \\"fades,\\" as he says.  <br />One more idea that is brought to the movie is that it is shown in reverse, starting at the end of the movie's story and ending at the beginning.  It is a very intellegent idea, because it puts the watcher in Leonards shoes, you know what's going on at the moment, but you have no idea what just happened.  You may think that the movie will be boring because of this, but it left me on the edge of my seat nearly drooling becuase I wanted to find out what would happen next.<br />Memento's acting is amazing.  Guy Pearce puts on a very convincing performance of a nervous and confused Leonard.  Joe Pantoliano also does a great job as Leonards friend, yet you never know for sure who he is until the end of the movie.  Carrie-Ann Moss plays another one of Leonard's friends who puts on a great performance as a hard-to-impress yet understanding woman.<br />Memento is flawless, a masterpeice.  Every element that makes up a good movie is present here, it is a deep and intellegent movie that will keep you on the edge of you seat, thinking and always dying to find out what will happen next.  Without a doubt a 5 star movie, original, unique, exciting, and very intellegent, see this movie.

0393317552|4.0|Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power by Victor Davis Hanson is an interesting read.  The central thesis of the book is that the Western style of direct decisive infantry warfare, with roots in democracy and capitalism, has been historically superior and partly responsible for the Western Worlds superior position.  Hanson seeks to present his book as a kind of rebuttal to Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond.  <br />As to the latter objective. Hanson fails miserably for Hanson's and Diamond's theories are not inconsistent and Hanson's attempt to make them so detracts from the rest of the book..  Diamond's seeks to explain why it was the Spanish who conquered the Incas in 16th century Peru and not Incas who sailed to Madrid to conquer the Spanish.  He theorizes that the Spanish had greater access to domesticatable crops and animals and European geography allowed for an easier exchange of ideas from other burgeoning societies.  Hanson seeks to minimize the advantages of what  Diamond speaks of and instead focuses on military strategy, and western economic and political thought.  What Hanson misses is that without advanced military transport in the horse, the availability of sophisticated weapons, such as steel swords, rudimentary guns and cannon the Incas would never have been conquered.<br />Hanson's own treatment of the conquest of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) in 1520-1521 is the proof.  The Mexican Army utilized infantry tactics, since they did not have any calvary.  They fought decisive battles with their opponents, since like the ancient Greeks they had a war season.  While the Greeks was based on the harvest, the Mexican was based on the harvest and religious considerations.  While they also fought symbolic flower wars these were not the ones fought to protect their Empire.<br />The Spanish, with several hundred Spaniards and thousands of natives under Cortez, were able to defeat the Mexicans.  It was the horses, guns and eventually smallpox which were decisive. There can be no argument that Spain or Cortez operated in a democratic or that capitalism was the basis of their economy. One can even argue that what defeated the Aztecs was their penchant for human sacrifice and the desire to capture Cortez instead of killing him.  In numerous battles the Aztecs could have killed Cortez but did not.  <br />Hanson's and Diamond's book build on each other and offer a compelling explanation to justify each others theories.  Hanson unintentionally builds on Diamond's concepts to explain why societies with equal resources do not necessarily develop equally.<br />Otherwise, Hanson's book is well written and very interesting.  It is in the description of the battles and the campaigns where he excels.  It would have been better if Hanson had dealt with some of the possible exceptions to his theory - the century old Ottoman Empire, the supremacy of the Prussian military tradition which was hardly based on notions of democracy and the Russian almost suicidal defense of their homeland at Stalingrad.  Maybe he is saving that for his next book.
0780629450|4.0|I have studied and taught Hamlet for many years.  Branaugh is close, but still not \\"there.\\"  Why, for instance, the sexy scene with Ophelia?

Other distortions seem to be addressed to the audience, not doing honor to the author.<BR>When I ordered, wide screen seemed to be the only version available.  Not fond of all the black.
B0000636UN|5.0|Rock artists often get severely criticized when they go in a more &quot;pop&quot; direction.  Sometimes the criticism is justified while sometimes it isn't.  In this case, Sheryl Crow has put out an absolute masterpiece that is as essential a listen as her previous albums--even with its clearly &quot;more poppy&quot; direction.<br />&quot;Steve McQueen&quot; gets the album off to a fun, rocking start typical of other album leadoff efforts (see &quot;Maybe Angels&quot; from her second, self-titled album).  Following is the song that is already a big hit as of this writing--the ultimate sunny and fun summertime song &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;.  To me, this song is a candidate for single of the year.  You could not ask for a more fun or much catchier song.  &quot;You're An Original&quot; keeps the tempo going strong, then the slower but pretty &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; kicks in.  Next comes the also great title track, with fantastic melodies and lyrics like &quot;...c'mon, break my heart again, for old time's sake.&quot;  &quot;It's So Easy&quot; includes a strong vocal effort by Don Henley--a song reminiscent of Patti Smyth's &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough&quot; (also done with Don Henley, of course).<br />Later on the album, &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; flat out rocks to pick up the pace of the album once again; but it is followed by perhaps the most gorgeous ballad Sheryl Crow has ever done, &quot;Diamond Road&quot;.  Don't overlook this one--a gorgeous melodic masterpiece.  Another highlight is the last track, &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, in which Sheryl closes out her album in typically slow, understated fashion.  I might have to rate this one a bit above, say &quot;I Shall Believe&quot;, a somewhat similar sounding closing track from her first album.<br />In summary, this album is flat-out stunning...a pop/rock masterpiece that has a lot of fine guests while still showcasing the best talents of Sheryl Crow.  I am admitedly a bit surprised how many pop-soundingtracks there are on this album.  But in this case, it works absolutely perfectly.  Fantastic album, and a strongly recommended purchase.
0446608955|5.0|This is a sweet romance story that is not trashy or bad. It is the story of Jamie, the dowdy daughter of the minister, and Landon, a rebel. The ending is very sad. This book has a message in it - To treat others as you want to be treated. The book takes place in the 1950s while in the movie, it takes place in the 1990s. If you have seen the movie, though, you may be dissapointed because although the movie's great, it's not really like the book. Book lovers, you may be dissapointed about the movie. I, however, enjoyed both and I hope my review helps somebody.
B0000042MY|5.0|this is the best film in the world
0140288503|5.0|I am not a military expert or historian, but this book, to me, appeared about as real as it gets. Bowden does a good job of developing each of the many important charachters to a certain extent, enough to pull out your emotions for them. The pull this book had on me was stunning; I simply couldn't put it down. I hope Mark continues to write as real as he did in this book. I would recommend this to anyone with interest in the military or simply wants to read a good book. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00000JCOV|5.0|If you like metal then theres no reason why you shouldn't buy this cd. This is the first of SlipKnot's two albums. Their second one is called Iowa, and it's much different than this one. Iowa is INSANELY heavy and loud and focuses more on all out hardcore nu-metal. This album, on the other hand, while hard, is much more melodic, fast, and catchy. Which one is better? Just depends on your taste. <BR>Also Unlike Iowa, this album contains much more singing and rapping done by #8, Corey Taylor. The rest of the band consists of two percussionists, two guitarists, a bass guitarist, a DJ, a Mixer, and a drummer who is probably the best drummer I've ever heard. Believe me... he could probably kick-drum faster than you could drum with your hands. <br />1. 742617000027: Just a quick introuduction to the cd consisting of the words \\"The whole thing I think is ****\\" repeated over and over. <BR>2. (SiC) 9/10: A great starter song for the album... it's hard and fast all the way through. One of the better songs.<BR>3. Eyel Ess 10/10: Just awesome. One of my favorite songs.<BR>4. Wait and Bleed 9.5/10: Great vocals, great DJ skills, great song. A favorite.<BR>5. Surfacing 8.5/10: Didn't like it at first, but now I do a lot. It's considered the best song by a lot of people. Nevertheless, it's really good. <BR>6. Spit it Out 10/10: Probably my most favorite song. Great rapping done by Corey. It's a very fast song. Everyone will like it right when they hear it. <BR>7. Tattered & Torn 5/10: \\"If you understand this song you understand the clown\\". Well I'm sorry, I don't understand this song and I don't like it.<BR>8. Me in Side 8/10: Nice chorus.<BR>9. Liberate 10/10: Another one of my favorites. This has an AWESOME chorus.  <BR>10. Prosthetics 7/10: A weird song... but pretty good.<BR>11. No Life 9/10: Another awesome song, with some cool rapping. Another favorite.<BR>12. Diluted 7.5/10<BR>13. Only One 8/10<BR>14. Scissors 7/10: This strange 20 minute track actually consists of two songs and a very long scene where the band is watching a nasty tape while one of the band members is puking. I have no idea why it was put in there but oh well, it's pretty fun.<br />Overall, this is a must have cd for metal fans. It's hard, fast and raw and ranks as one of my favorite cds of all time. I probably liked Iowa just a LITTLE better than this. I recommend picking up Iowa if you like it REALLY hard and raw.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Here!  Here!  I agree with the previous reviews.  This is best CD I have purchased in years and years.  I listen to it nearly constantly.  I almost never love a song the first time I hear it, but when I heard \\"Don't know why\\" I was mezmerized.  I hastely grabbed a pen and scribbled the name and artist on my ARM while driving!  Her voice and pitch is perfect, dynamic, haunting and exhilerating.  I LOVE the arrangements of her own songs.  Yeah, the covers of the \\"classics\\" are nice, but I really like her (and her co-writers) stuff the best.  Like \\"One flight down\\" --man, how deep can you get?!  These songs just take me away to a great place in my mind.  Thank you, Nora Jones!  I cannot BELIEVE she's only 22!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was great in the theaters so I didn't even think twice about buying the DVD...The movie was pretty much play by play like the book except for some minor details that really didnt effect the overall plot.  In my oppionion the DVD is the best DVD ever!  It has cool puzzles that you must solve in order to access the special fetures which there are lots of!  My favorite was the interviews where they talked about the second movie and gave hints on what we will see in that one.  To top it off you can pop the DVD in to your computer and access even more stuff!  <BR>For me the special fetures are the only reason to buy a DVD this one has more fun fetures then any other in my collection!  It is a must have!!
B000021XS0|5.0|I reviewed this album when I bought it two years ago. Now I like it even more than then. If ever a perfect and complete piece of musical composition was created this is it. I listened to the whole album twice tonight and its like the music ifuses you with emotion. I like technical wizardry, and believe me there is enough of that on this album, but if you listen past the millions of notes then you realise its a musical masterpiece that grips you in its intensity and won't let go. I listened to Six Degrees but it does not come near Scenes. It seems like perfection happens only once in an artitst's life. Go and buy it now, but beware - its totally addictive.
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|This soundtrack is of criminally short length.  Over half the tracks are just a tease when they could've been so much more.  Many will start out like they are whole songs, but seem to be cut prematurely when they're actually not.  The longer tracks are absolutely beautiful, and they make you realize what the short tracks COULD'VE been if they were extended past the 30 second mark.  I can't believe the longest track on here is only about 3 minutes and 45 seconds long.  There's nothing bad about the instrumentation or composition at all; the only glaringly huge problem is that the majority of the songs are over before you know it.  Also, I disagree with the reviewer who said the 'Conga' songs don't fit the rest of the album.  Personally, I think they're a bit on the nightmarish side because they seem like they should be upbeat but they're somehow not.  The 'Conga' songs have a weird underlying creepiness that's hard to pinpoint; it reminds me of something that should be fun but ends up going out of control.  Since I've never seen the film to this soundtrack but know its premise, I'm guessing these are the parts where of the characters are tripping, but I could be wrong.  Anyway, the songs are five-star quality, but be prepared to be disappointed because most are so short.  If you like this soundtrack,  check out the &quot;Insomnia&quot; soundtrack by David Julyan; it's a bit on the depressing side as well, but then again, people don't listen to this kind of stuff to feel happy.<br />3.5 stars
B00004Z459|5.0|i love this cd. my brother owns it and i have listened to every song practically a thousand times but guess what you never get tired of them because they are all unique. my fave song on it is one step closer.  first of all crawling and in the end both great songs. my least favorite song is a place for my head and i would still give that 8 out of 10.

B000056IKS|5.0|There is only one word for this CD: Divine.<br />This is considered one of the essentials of the highly original &quot;kraut rock&quot; genre, a subgenre of prog rock.  Although this CD can be a little overrated, it is still absolutely worth purchasing.<br />The first track, Hallogallo is a minimalistic affair with drums and a hypnotic guitar lead.  The occasional electronic texture pops in on this song.  A standout track.<br />The next song opens up with a sample, then plods along slowly, building some slight tension.  Then, near the end of the song, BOOM, a small noise cacophony wakes you up from your stupor.<br />The next track is more minimalistic percussion goodness.  <br />The next track is very calming; samples of moving water are included, and you can really set this to sleep to.<br />Finally, the infamous song, Negativland, starts with some chaos.  This is the most punkish song on this CD, with throbbing hypnotic bass going along.  A definite standout.<br />The final track starts with some soft whispers, and generally is a very calm song.<br />The much heralded kraut rock scene (Thank you, Julian Cope and Steven Stapleton!!) is certainly worth checking out for fans of left field music and Mr Bungle fans who think that Mike Patton is the most original thinker of music who ever lived...think again.

B00003CXDU|5.0|Tim Allen is the has-been star of a Star Trek-type program whose  cast now does trekkie shows, until real aliens beam them all up for a real space adventure.  It's silly but very funny thanks to the clever script that doesn't take the characters too seriously (except for Alan Rickman's character who, luckily for us, takes himself way too seriously).  Allen is spot-on as the Captain Kirk wannabe.  It's laugh out loud funny!

The movie itself is so much better than your classic Disney movies of Cinderella or whatever. Fun happy movie that will leave you in a great mood every time you'll view this classic.
B00000DC10|5.0|\\"They told me the classics never go out of style, but they do...\\"  And with that \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" begins and Refused totally rewrites the history of punk rock-and music in general.  Refused takes a few lyrical and musical cues from the early nineties hardcore band Born Against, then brings everything up to a whole new level, deftly combining punk with metal, techno, and even jazz.  No punk band has ever explored the places Refused goes with standout tracks like \\"The Deadly Rythm,\\"  \\"Refused are F***ing Dead,\\" and of course, the immortal \\"New Noise\\".  Even at it's most experimental and subdued, this album is an envigorating listen.<BR>   Sure, plenty of other punk bands talk about revolution, but only Refused seems willing to create truly revolutionary music to back up their radical anti-captialist views. In a few years \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" will become akin to Minor Threat's \\"Complete Discography\\"- a timeless classic and prerequisite listening for anyone seriously into underground music.
B000066NW0|5.0|I just wanted to tell everyone to go buy Avril Lavignes new CD Let Go because it is the BEST CD! The songs have a really good beat and they are all awesome! Avril Lavigne is so awesome and if you can only buy 1 CD this month I suggest you buy this one!
6300185249|5.0|Tom Hanks and Shelley Long star as lovers remodling a big, broken-down old house. Tom is a lawyer; Shelley is a musician who was previously involved with the very funny conductor Alexander Godunov. The inevitable horrors of remodling are played for laughs with lots of slapstick comedy. The stars are delightful together and the script is witty. If you've ever remodled a house, or been in love, you'll enjoy this film!
B000055Y0Y|5.0|One of Clint's best movies, but of course they all seem to be his best! This is a wonderful DVD, with great quality, and well worth buying for you collection!!!
B00005QIPH|1.0|The Strokes are an incredibly image-consious band concocted by a record label to try to sell the same boring alternative music that's been polluting the airwaves for years as \\"indie-rock.\\"  Dorks who know absolutely nothing about music and are easily influenced by hype will probablly get into this and feel real cool. So if you are the type of person who shops at hot topic all the time and likes putting little pins with the British flag on them in your clothing, then this is your new favorite album.  However, if you are interested in listening to something intelligent and unique, steer clear of this at all costs.
B00005QIPH|5.0|While so many of the real critics are going ga-ga over this, and many amatuers like me are attacking it or loving it, I stand away from the foolishness.<BR><BR>Is This it opens with the title track, and makes it's point, it's semi-laid back garage rock.  The Strokes don't lay on the fuzz and hard rock riffs like Mooney Suzuki, or have the Kinksesque sound of the Hives, they insted go for the Velvet Underground type of New York artiness.  I do think that the VU sound is highly publicised but not that true.  They do have an element of Velvet Undergroundishness, but are all together  their own sort of thing.<BR><BR>Lyrics are interesting, the sound is interesting, with a laid back glazed eye sort of sound.  Sort of like their out on drugs, but not really too out, hard to explain.<BR><BR>As always, listen to the CD.
6300182282|5.0|Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn star as married (to other people) folks who meet once a year at the same cottage for an affair.  The film spans many years during which each person faces life-altering challenges and joys.  The couple share these and become even closer because of them.  Alda and Burstyn are delightful together. The script is funny, bittersweet, and lovely.
6300214753|5.0|This movie is Hughes' best. However, you have to be 20 or under to really find it amusing. I agree it is childish and stupid, but I am in the under 20 category, so I like that.<br />The movie does lag, and Ferris' addresses to the camera should have continued throughout the movie. Funny for the right group of people.<br />I have been reading other reviews and I have two comments:<br />1) Maybe I should watch the DVD to find out if your low ratings are warranted. Need to get a DVD player first.<br />2) i think some of you people need spelling lessons. Americans that is, I can understand the foreigners' struggles, but you Americans, c'mon. <br />Sorry for being so mean.
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM is a new genre of music. Nobody has done anykind of music like that.<br />So how bout I give it a ...... 12<br />Well.... there we are then...a 12<br />well anyways THIS ALBUM ROCKS
B000002KIE|5.0|There are two types of punk in my head, those bands which follow the Sex Pistols, and those who follow the Ramones.<BR>The Sex Pistols were much more hardcore, with a nasty buzzing sound.<BR>The Ramones were silly with the punk sound of powerchords, of course bands like Green Day are firmly in this school.<BR>Out of all the punk records that I own, this is the only one which I listen to alot.  Mainly because they are punk while distancing themselves away from punk.  this makes them much more listenable than say Minor Threat or Black Flag.  In a way the Dead Kennedys are one of the few bands that have this same sort of feeling.  Making them listenable even when I don't feel like listening to punk per-say.<BR>Over all I sugest the Sex Pistols only album because it's music goes over all the BS that is the Sex Pistols, and in the end shows that they could make a great album and just weren't fashion like so many other bands of their time.  Never mind the Bollocks... will last forever as far as I'm considered.
B00003CX6P|4.0|Well gosh.  So I just watched the movie.  Somehow even though it got a fair amount of press and most of my friends saw it, I never had before, and I'd never really picked up on the plot.  I remember I wanted to rent it one night but my boyfriend refused.  He'd seen it and he said he couldn't go through that again.  Now I see what he was talking about.  This is one of those films that just makes you smack your forehead over and over again in disbelief and horror.  I won't get deep into the plot; suffice it to say that Damon's Tom Ripley weaves rather a tangled web for himself and for all who are unfortunate enough to come into contact with him.  He is a consummate character study in duplicity.  To begin with, it's the 1950's, and he likes guys.  That'll teach you to lie.  He's sent to Italy to round up some loaded tycoon's spoiled brat son (\\"Dickie,\\" played by Jude Law), and wouldn't you know it, he promptly falls for the brat and his romantic lifestyle.  This inevitably leads to serious trouble, since Dickie is manifestly heterosexual and hooked up with an even-more-mannered-and-posh-than-usual Gwyneth Paltrow.   As soon as he begins to suspect Ripley's secret crush, he turns on him and tries to get rid of him - but it's too late.  Hijinks ensue.<br />The reason this is such a difficult movie to watch is that Ripley's pathology makes it impossible to empathize with him at any point.  He does not redeem himself; he shows practically no real remorse for anything he does; and it is clear by the end of the movie that he will never stop of his own accord.  He proves himself incapable of the love he so desperately wants, because he has no conscience, no soul, no honor or virtue or character.  He thinks it better to be a \\"pretend somebody than a real nobody\\" - but in his case this amounts to far more than just the putting on of airs.  In his case his pretensions have subsumed his humanity - have made him inhuman.  <br />The final, tragic scene really nails this home.  It'sa great movie, perfectly effective, and I never want to see it again.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is great. Great effects, great action, great acting, great cast,great EVERYTHING. The DVD left me speechless. But I did manage to let out one word, &quot;SWEEEEEET&quot; Keanu Reeves is my hero.
B0000636UN|1.0|I LLLLLLLUUUUUUUUVVVVVV Sheryl Crow...<BR>I Detest this album.<br />She seems to have completely relinquished her depth, articulation, irony, and artistry to release a mediocre collection of rushed fillers.  What is going on?  She has so much power.  So much ability.  She can, and has altered mind-sets and points of view, raised politcal and social awareness, and asked the world to take a look in the proverbial pond reflection, smoke a cig and laugh.  NOW it's a bunch of subjective self centered incoherent babble that is not worthy of a true Crow fan's hard earned duckets.  This album is in short Dry, lazy, and flamboyantly uninspired.  For once this lyrical genious has ABSOLUTELY NOTHIN' TO SAY!  No wonder 3 of the only attempted songs are at the very beginning...<br />This is a mid-life crisis set to music!...  C'mon C'mon Sheryl!<BR>she needs to lock herself in her house and put her second album on repeat for a good month or two...that'll snap her out of it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|C'mon George!! What happened?? The first three were of course, great. But Episode I was just Ok. I had waited a really long time for this one to come out, and I was somewhat disapointed. Better luck in the next movies.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Making Movies is the only Dire Straits album that truly delivers on the band's potential to be one of rock's greatest. No endless guitar noodling, no aimless, endless instrumental passages - just some of the pithist lyrics ever written about romance, set to music that could hail a pharoah!<br />     Although &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot; and &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; are usually acknowledged to be the album's standout tracks, my personal favorites are &quot;Skateaway&quot; and &quot;Solid Rock.&quot; These songs celebrate the simplicity and tactical wisdom of keeping one's emotions at a fair distance from everyone else - and yourself.  <br />     Roy Bittan's keyboards allow Mark Knopler to focus and condense the song structures here - much as he would do on Bob Seger's 1982 release, The Distance.&quot;Solid Rock&quot; is the best Chuck Berry song I've ever heard that wasn't written by Chuck himself! The risk-taking protagonist of &quot;Skateaway&quot; is a direction tha would be more sucessfully addressed on Love Over Gold in 1982, but the guitar riff's breakneck  pace draws us into the scene anyway.  Even the semingly camp &quot;Les Boys&quot;  reminds us that there all KINDS of risks to be taken in life.<br />     This is one of the 10 best albums of the 1980's, and should be heard by anyone who has a love for literate, insightful  words married to breakneck barrom music!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Yes, I did read all four books and loved 'em all. J.K. Rowling has a great imagination. I would think it would be tough to think up ideas like that and write them down. <br />I've tried to write short stories that I think off the top of my head, and I don't even have the patience. So I definately give Rowling props for doing an awesome series, and agreeing to make a great movie.
0345451325|5.0|I am generally discriminate of new fiction/science fiction because I've been fairly disappointed in the lack of quality and style I find in recent fiction.<BR>BUT...this is a great book. I couldnt put it down. Great character development. Nothing was silly or unbelievable.
0446677450|1.0|I could write a book on all that's wrong with this book.  But, given the limited space here, I'll boil it down to just a few basic points:<br />1.  The notion that you don't need a formal education to be successful is nonsense.  Being successful with limited formal education is the exception rather than the rule.  Knowledge is power, and the first, most logical place to gain that knowledge is in school.  The need to hand down this knowledge from generation to generation is the reason schools exist in the first place.  This is not to say that school teaches you everything you need to know to be successful, but it does lay the foundation for further learning.  Kiyosaki misses this entirely and does a disservice to his readers by deemphasizing (even eschewing) formal education.  <br />2.  The obvious contempt Kiyosaki has for his natural father (Poor Dad) simply because he was not materialistic enough leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  The ultimate goal of a self-help book -- and that's what this book is -- should be to help people attain greater happiness in their lives.  In the case of financial self-help books, this should manifest itself in the form of balanced financial advice, not disdain for those who refuse to kneel at the golden altar of capitalism.  You can be rich without being consumed with money.  You can be wealthy without selling your soul. <br />Part of being successful - at anything - is learning balance.  I had to learn the hard way that it's difficult to accomplish great things in one area of your life when the platform on which it stands (the rest of your life) is collapsing as you work.  Not only is Kiyosaki's advice bad from a personal happiness perspective (being consumed by money tends to alienate people with souls, and being alone is no fast ticket to being happy), but it will leave you unable to accomplish its purported singular aim - that of getting rich - because most people need balance in their lives to be truly successful at anything, including making money.<br />3.  Kiyosaki is without standing.  He is without credentials.  There is nothing in his background to suggest that he is qualified to tell other people how to acquire wealth.  Note that I don't subscribe to the notion that one must be wealthy in order to advise others on how to acquire wealth, but it certainly helps.  Just as a fat doctor can give his patients sound advice on how to lose weight (\\"Exercise more, eat less\\"), so can people who've not yet attained great wealth advise others on financial matters.  But, there's one important qualification here: _they should disclose their own background and level of success -- their qualifications -- so that people can properly evaluate it for what it is_.  Kiyosaki doesn't do this.  In fact, he does just the opposite.  He claims to have amassed great wealth, but speaks in such generalities that we have no idea just how much he's made or how he made it.  Perhaps he never really made any money at either investing or real estate -- perhaps what wealth he has came from selling books and conducting seminars telling people how to become wealthy.    <br />4.  The advice Kiyosaki proffers is unsound financially and often borders on illegality.  Much of what he says betrays an obvious lack of financial acumen and basic understanding about the world of investing.  His recommendations about investment-related matters such as tax law and general property management principles are frequently wrong and will bankrupt you or land you in jail if you follow them.  For example, he throws in a good dose of the old \\"inc yourself\\" mindset, emphasizing, over and over, the many benefits of incorporating over remaining a sole proprietorship.  This type of thinking was proven wrongheaded many years ago, and there's very little advantage (and many disadvantages) to incorporating as an individual investor.  I would say it is, at best, a wash for the average investor.  Deducting personal expenditures simply because you have incorporated is not only unethical, it is illegal - the IRS requires that the expenses you deduct be both reasonable and business-related, regardless of whether you incorporate.  And keep in mind that deducting an expensive \\"business\\" trip to Vegas may save you the tax on that money, but it won't give you back the money itself, which -- given that you're merely a shell of a corporation - was your money to start with.  IOW, you'd be cutting off your finances to spite the IRS - not the most direct route to financial independence.<br />And one last thing:  true to form, even Kiyosaki's attempt to swindle us is astonishingly simplistic.  That is, the tactics he uses to try to sell his wares - generalities, anecdotes, unverifiable claims, platitudes and the like - are the crude tools of the charlatan.  If you're going to try to swindle me, the least you could do is try something new, something more sophisticated than the average street hustler.  It reminds me of the disgust I felt as a kid when I paid a dollar to see the mermaid behind the curtain at a carnival sideshow and got back there only to find that they didn't even have a real girl in costume - they had used a manikin!  I didn't expect to find a real mermaid, but I was aghast that they didn't even have the decency to use a real girl.  The book is a crude piece of unsophisticated drivel that plays on the financial ignorance and greed of the masses.  And please don't give me the \\"it made me think about my finances\\" argument.  The IRS does that for you every April 15th - that doesn't mean they have any concern for your financial wellbeing.  Kiyosaki has about as much interest in making you rich as the IRS does.  If you think the IRS exists to make you wealthy, go ahead and buy this book.  If not, run - don't walk - the other way.
0312265859|5.0|I've been waiting for this book since I finished book #7 ... and I wasn't dissapointed.  Janet has once again written a wonderful, funny, can't put the book down novel.  I loved it!  I highly recommend this book ... a must have if you're a Janet fan.
B000002UB6|4.0|No one will claim &quot;Let it Be&quot; to be the best Beatles album. The uneasy moments eliminate any comparisons between it and &quot;Sergeant Pepper,&quot; for example. But it contains enough bright moments to make it notable in rock and roll history. Here is my opinion on each of the &quot;Let it Be&quot; tracks:<br />1. &quot;Two of Us&quot;(4 stars)- A real foot-stomper; snappy little number with a big hook during the chorus.<br />2. &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;(3 stars)- A notable Lennon track.<br />3. &quot;Across the Universe&quot;(3.5 stars)- Sweet, almost sappy Lennon; very unusual for his usual style; classic tune but not well produced; muffled sound.<br />4. &quot;I Me Mine&quot;(2.5 stars)- Average Harrison moment.<br />5. &quot;Dig It&quot;(2.5 stars)- Incomplete recording with a strong resemblance to 60's Dylan. This might have been a great tune, but with a play time of :50, we'll never know.<br />6. &quot;Let it Be&quot;(5 stars)- One of the greatest ballads ever written. The single version has a more recognizable and in my opinion better guitar solo.<br />7. &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;(3 stars)- Another incomplete here; has a country feel that represents the diversity of the Beatles' musical tastes during this period.<br />8. &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;(4 stars)- This has a wonderful guitar hook courtesy of Mr. Dark Horse; great song.<br />9. &quot;One After 909&quot;(4 stars)- Takes Lennon/McCartney back to their original sound that developed in Liverpool during the early 60's; showed they could still rock and roll.<br />10. &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;(5 stars)- This is one of the better Beatles songs written. I am one of the few who feels like the strings add flavor.<br />11. &quot;For You Blue&quot;(4.5 stars)- This is one of the most overlooked Beatles tracks, especially by George Harrison; includes fabulous blues axe work and a catchy chorus.  <br />12. &quot;Get Back&quot; (5 stars)- There isn't much to say about this song because everyoneknows the chorus and a verse or two. I hear this song on my local classic rock station twice a week.
B000002J0G|5.0|\\"Low\\" showcases Testatment in peak form.  The precision metal assault for which the band was known is in place as always.  Songs like the opening title track and \\"All I Could Bleed\\" boast killer, forceful melodies, led by Chuck Billy's traditional howling vocals.  The musicianship is razor-sharp, befitting a lineup with James Murphy and Eric Peterson on guitars.  The riffs are tight, the solos shine, and the bass and drums thump precisely in the background.  Ultimately, though, it's the album's diversity that raises it into the elite.  I don't care much for ballads, but \\"Trail of Tears\\" is a terrific tune, with excellent playing and some mournful vocals about the problems faced by American Indians.  On some songs, most notably \\"Dog Faced Gods,\\" Chuck introduced low, death-metalesque timbres into his vocals, foreshadowing the band's future direction.  Chuck doesn't have the best death metal voice out there, but it's good enough, and it's nice to have some variety injected into the mix.  An outstanding album, like all Testament albums that I've heard.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I'm married to an original web-head (original meaning he actually purchased, read and collected the first Spider-Man comics back in the 60's...I'm saying this not to be boastful but to more or less date us, he-he) so I inevitably I had to go see this movie with my husband on one of his repeat viewings (My husband, by the way, said they got everything right...he even did not mind the organic web shooter).  I loved this movie and thought it was great.  It had great writing, great acting and a great story.  True, there was CGI involved; but in no way was it overused and shoved into your face like Star Wars Episode 2 (see my review for that movie here...).  Tobey Maguire IS Spidey.  I don't know about the rest of the female viewers, but I will say this much...that kiss scene was supremely erotic (albeit was Kirsten Dunst's/Mary Jane's obvious 'wet t-shirt' really necessary?  Just the rain would have been fine).  Willem Dafoe deftly portrays the tortured business tycoon Norman Osborne who descends into his evil alter-ego, the Green Goblin, by his own will.<br />Although I never read a Spider-Man comic book in my life (my husband is obviously the resident Spidey-Expert here in our household) I do know the words to the original cartoon series song.  It was a cool nostalgia kick (and major point score with the hubby) to get to sing along at the end of the movie!<br />A MUST-SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN...REPEAT VIEWINGS HIGHLY SUGGESTED.
B00003CXBK|5.0|if you do not own this, buy it, steal it, just get it.<br />Mononoke Hime is one of those true classics, like Ghost in the Shell or Akira. The animation is absolutely beautiful and this is a movie that will stay with you forever. I personally have watched it over and over and I can't get enough of it. <br />If you like a beautiful story, amazing animation and want to be entertained and challenged get this movie. I have yet to meet someone who does not like it. It's a true gem.<br />AH (Illustrator)
B00005OAIE|5.0|Somewhere, cast against the shallowness of the teenie-bopper era, along with the horribly, horribly boring stuff that bands like Nickelback and Creed (they all sound exactly the same) put out, comes out John Mayer.  The vibes on this album are incredible.  Where the \\"enlightened\\" editor who wrote a review on this album made it like it was an album whining about his life, it is far more just a coming-of-age masterpiece.  I'm not going to say that this is the best album I've ever heard, but I am going to say this is the by far one of the best in the past few years.  Mayer struggles with everything that each and every one of us struggles with -- rejection, humiliation, and occasionally, triumph...however -- in contrast to what we all do -- like brooding, he put those experiences into catchy, damn good songs.  His songwriting showcases his wit, and his tunes showcase his tremendous musical talent.  He's a one-in-a-million artist.  His cult following is growing incredibly, also.  Sadly, though, he's also falling into the clutches of MTV...so buy this album before you see him on TRL.  Hurry, you're running out of time.  Fall in love with the album before Carson Daly tries to explain the meaning behind songs.
B000002BFZ|5.0|First things first: this is not the album for fans who only liked the blistering \\"grunge\\" sound of Pearl Jam's debut, \\"Ten\\".  This album, their fourth studio album, expands on the slight artistic direction change introduced in \\"Vitalogy\\" and pretty much shows us that there aren't any more Alives, Jeremies, or Even Flows coming our way.  Pearl Jam proves that they are indeed a progressive, maturing band, and that they have destroyed the grunge label, only to emerge a smarter, craftier, and perhaps more talented band.  Gone are the over-polished sounds of \\"Vs.\\" and the weirdo interludes of \\"Vitalogy\\"; here is a band in their most stripped-down, yet most experimental, form thus far.  From the beginning, the listener almost immediately gets the impression that this is not the long-haired, flannel-wearing \\"grunge\\" band that saturated airwaves in the early 90's.  Sure, there are a few rocking songs here (\\"Hail, Hail\\", \\"Habit\\", \\"Lukin\\"), but the album as a whole is a much quieter piece, with songs such as \\"Sometimes\\", \\"In My Tree\\", \\"Off He Goes\\", and the haunting \\"Present Tense\\" showcasing a much mellower, more eclectic sound that is yet to be topped.  It may be a little hard to digest at first, but after repeated listenings, the album begins to grow on the listener (it grew on me, at least).  The band has grown in their songwriting and performing skills, and every song on this album is amazing.  Look no further; this is Pearl Jam's ultimate masterpiece.
B00004U30D|5.0|When 'American Beauty' was released it brought fresh life into Hollywood cinema (coupled with 'Fight Club' that same year, we were especially lucky).  Directed by English theatre-director Sam Mendes and written with intense sensitivity by Alan Ball it is one of the great movies of the century.  The story of a disfunctional family, each separated by their own wishes for fulfilment and by the people around them may sound dull but 'American Beauty' breathes a different kind of life into it.<br />It centres around the dry Lester Burnham (Spacey), who narrates the story from beyond the grave.  Stuck in a dead marriage to wife Caroline (Bening) and a boring job he witnesses an epiphany in the shape of Angela, the best friend of his daughter Jane.  Thinking his years after high school to be a waste he starts getting himself in shape, smoking pot and even pursuing Angela.  The amazing thing about this movie is that it doesn't merely focus on Spacey but on all the people around him, each with their own dreams, hopes and failures which Mendes treats with a care and sensitivity unusual to most films.  For instance, Caroline may be pushy but she's cracking up inside, Jane has concerns about her body and even Angela is worried that she might not be perfect after all.<br />Another interesting thing is that Spacey isn't the hero as you'd expect him to be.  Sure we admire him, the guy that decides to take his life by the reigns, but we admire neighbour and Jane's boyfriend Ricky (Bentley) even more.  This is because despite being trapped at home with an abusive father and a mother who is intriguingly unhinged he still feels gratitude for all the beauty that the world has to offer.  If this sounds clichéd, cheesy or pretentious then you obviously haven't seen the film, which displays all this beauty before our eyes alongside all the misery and heartache.  Add the this the implication that Bentley believes in a higher power guiding us may be as much due to his own wisdom as it is tohis horrific home life and it becomes a statement of great weight.<br />Of course, the intelligence of the movie is just one of the many things that make it.  The cinematography constantly emphasises the 'life is beautiful' theme, with gorgeous red roses, blood and voluptuous lipstick all vying for your attention.  In addition, it would be hard to find a collection of actors that are more accomplised in the role they play, all giving the performances of their respective careers.  Spacey is even better than he was in 'The Usual Suspects', Bening shows a different side to the career woman of many movie stereotypes, Birch portrays the disappointment of early adulthood perfectly, Bentley is so astute it's almost disconcerting and Suvari is sublime as the Venus-image/frightened little girl.  Add to the mix a dollop of brilliant humour and you have what is probably one of the most important movies of the 90's, quite possibly even the century.
0140380221|5.0|I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total. I think every child growing up should know this story. It's a classic. It's enchanting and heart warming and I'm sure boys and girls alike would enjoy it. The movies are also enjoyable. There are 3 versions that I can think of.

B00001OH82|4.0|Gabrels' playing makes the mediocre songs fascinating. Basically the songs are just a background for him to do his thing. The music has a lot of intricacies which is why I am still listening to this album regularly more than a decade after it came out.<br />Too bad Bowie disbanded the band. Soupy Sales' sons on drums and bass are good too.
B000000H57|5.0|Type O Negative broke new ground with \\"Bloody Kisses,\\" an album that explored the limits of slow gothic dirge and blended it with fast metal attitude. It mixed provocative subject matter and imagery with a touch of self-parody. Now with \\"October Rust,\\" the band took a new direction, continuing musically along the path of \\"Bloody Kisses,\\" but employing a more naturalistic atmosphere. With songs like \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen,\\" \\"Red Water (Christmas Mourning),\\" and a cover of Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" this album gives the impression that it was written while the band was out camping in the middle of the forrest, spending many cold autumn nights reminiscing on whatever they could think of to provide good lyrics. \\"Love You to Death\\" is a classic ballad, full of erotic energy as well as romantic sentimentality. It's a great song for couples to stargaze to right before making out. \\"Wolf Moon (Including Zoanthropic Paranoia)\\" is probably the best song on the album, with infectious riffs and a wonderful chorus, as well as the obligatory Peter Steele Gregorian Chant. \\"Haunted\\" is the song that got me into Type O Negative, so I have a lot of love for this song, even though it is about ten minutes long. And finally of course, the hit single in praise of bisexuality and threesomes, \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend,\\" a strange mix of '60's psychedelia and '90's gothic metal. A classic track.<BR>\\"October Rust\\" is an album that grows on you. It wasn't as immediate or as harsh or as fast as \\"Bloody Kisses,\\" but this is hardly a bad thing. It shows the band progressing musically without losing the ability to mock themselves in the process. An underrated album to be sure...give it a chance.
B00000J2PH|5.0|What is there left to say about this classic work which has not already been expressed a thousand times before? Thirty years later they are still releasing new remastered versions of &quot;Tapestry&quot;, the album still appears on Billboard magazine's &quot;Pop Catalog Chart&quot; and 11 million persons have already purchased a copy of this definitive work...can they all be wrong?  No.  Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; song-for-song and as a whole, whether one listens to it beginning to end or pushes the &quot;shuffle&quot; button on his CD player, is an album of major songs with &quot;success&quot; stitched all over it.<br />King's uncomplicated phrasing, confident piano style and soft arrangements on this work were a major influence on the singer-songwriter movement of the early 70s.  It is impossible to list a favorite here...the heartfelt directness found in &quot;So Far Away&quot; and &quot;Home Again&quot;...the spiritual yearning in &quot;Way Over Yonder&quot;...the joyousness of &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; moving into the upbeat &quot;Where You Lead&quot;...and the mystical, masterful storytelling found in the title track itself...this is an album of memorable songs.  In fact, the tunes here have been recorded so often by King herself, played so many times on the air and covered so frequently by other artists that listening back to &quot;Tapestry&quot; nowadays is like turning on 45 minutes of good, random FM radio...everything is familiar!<br />The new edition of &quot;Tapestry&quot; includes an interesting and upbeat missing bonus track.  In &quot;Out in the Cold&quot;, Carole King surprisingly is the &quot;bad girl&quot; who has been stepping out on her man (a bit out of character perhaps for her during those songwriting days.  It is understandable why they decided to omit it originally from the album.) Concluding the set is a live bonus track of &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot; recorded a few years later during her &quot;Fantasy&quot; era.  Both additional tracks are plesant addendums to an already remarkable work.<br />As phenominal as &quot;Tapestry&quot; is, my favorite albums by King follow in the few years after the release of &quot;Tapestry&quot;.  Check out &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; to hear some of her greatest and most prolific work.  I likewise include her newest album...the incredible &quot;Love Makes the World&quot; in the category of greatness as well.
079073463X|4.0|I'm not really all that into the Fantasy genre but I did like Ladyhawke and thought it was a very interesting movie and the love story of Isabeau and Etienne was beautiful and it was nice to see Rutger Hauer playing a nicer guy since he seems to mostly play villains so it was just nice to see him play Etienne. I also liked Matthew Broadrick he was just too cute.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone is a great addition to the earlier written book.  My recomendations are to read the book first then watch the movie as an added visual.  The movies recreates the book just as I had pictured it while reading it.  I think this is a must for everyone especially the ones who have read the series.  Can't wait for November when the next one comes out!!

B00004Z3AV|5.0|One of the most successful British rock groups of the seventies and eighties, Queen started as a quasi-glam rock group but evolved a style all their own, combining elements of pop, rock, heavy metal and a few operatic touches.<br /><br />Bohemian rhapsody, their biggest hit, was twice a UK number one hit - first on its original release and second on its release to raise money for AIDS charities, following the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury due to AIDS. The song also made the American top ten twice - first on its original release and second following its use in Wayne's world, a few months after Freddie's death, when it made number two. This classic song, seven-minute mini rock opera, overshadows everything else that Queen recorded, but they made plenty of other great music.<br /><br />Queen had two other UK number one hits - Under pressure (with David Bowie) and Innuendo. They also had five UK number two hits (Killer queen, Somebody to love, We are the champions, Crazy little thing called love and Radio gaga) and three UK number three hits (I want to break free, A kind of magic, I want it all) as well as some other UK top ten hits including You're my best friend, Another one bites the dust, It's a hard life and One vision.<br /><br />Freddie Mercury has a great voice, many of the songs are great, the arrangements are exciting, and there is no other band like them. Apart from his music as lead singer of Queen, Freddie recorded a few other hits, also featured in this collection. These include Barcelona (a duet with Montserrat Caballe) and a great cover of the old Platters classic, The great pretender.<br /><br />Queen were truly unique - it's not often you can say that about any singer or group - and this collection contains all their classic tracks.<br /><br />This set is a repackaging of the three Queen greatest hits. I bought this at my local (British) shop, but I note that it has since been released in this form in America. Rather than pay import prices, you'll find it cheaper to buy the domestic edition.dition.
B000002B1M|5.0|This album is a classic, Nas's best CD yet. Many people think that Illmatic is the best album released by Nas and I have no problem with that, I just think that the production on this album is better. The rhymes on some of the songs are some of the best lyrics in hip-hop today. The production is solid. The best songs on this album are \\"The Message,\\" \\"Affirmative Action,\\" \\"Take it in Blood\\" and \\"Street Dreams\\" which has the same beat from 2pac's \\"All Eyes on Me.\\" This is an Album all rap fans should have and if you are a Nas fan, you probably already have this album. Buy this Album!!! Highly Recomended!!!
0312265859|3.0|Stephanie Plum, Trenton, NJ's most incompetent bounty hunter, returns in \\"Hard Eight,\\" Janet Evanovich's latest volume chronicling her (mis)adventures.  Thankfully, it's much better than \\"Hot Six\\" and \\"Seven Up\\"--there's no annoying Joyce Barnhart, only one incident of Bob barfing, and Ranger and Stephanie finally do it after three books' worth of buildup.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a darker edge to the story--Stephanie searches for a mother and child fleeing on a custody bond, only to stumble up against a psychopath with a war games fetish who's intent on finding the pair himself.  Several scenes are downright chilling, not a usual thing in an Evanovich novel.  Most of the book, though, is typical breezy Stephanie, which makes the scary scenes that much more so.  Evanovich also seems to have recovered her knack for humor--this is the first time I've laughed aloud reading a Plum book in a while.<br />However, I do have a couple of bones to pick with Evanovich.  First, the exploding cars thing is getting VERY old.  It's interesting that Evanovich doesn't mention that New Jersey has the highest auto-insurance rates in the nation, because if Stephanie were real she'd have to pay about ten grand a year in car insurance (THREE of her cars are blown up in \\"Hard Eight\\").  Second, the shtick with the easy capture turning impossible is getting to be very annoying as well.  With her last two books, it seems like Evanovich is trying to take Stephanie into a little bit more serious territory, but still trying to make concessions to the fluff fans who just want to read about Stephanie and Morelli and Ranger and Grandma Mazur making dirty remarks.  \\"Hard Eight\\" put me very much in mind of Harlan Coben's early novels, which also have that weird mix of laugh-out-loud humor and incredibly dark scenes.  In the end, though, it's reawakened my interest in the Stephanie Plum series--but, Janet, let up on a poor Jersey girl and let her keep ONE car, okay?
B00005YUNY|5.0|An Excellent Production, Pure and Simple.  The band encountered many obsticles in this Live production, the biggest being the issue of using a different local orchestra for each region or town they played in, and also that Larry Groupe (The original conductor and key person who wrote many of the orchestra parts with the band could not stay for the entire tour).  However though I understand that Larry hand-picked the conductor that you see in this production and it all still works very fluidly.  Songs like Ritual and Gates of Delerium worked exceptionally well and the sound quality is top notch.  Yes is still the only band I know of that will still take the risks for music sake. And may I add on a personal note, that the orchestra had (on this performance night), a collection of rather attractive females in the orchestra that later joined the band on stage for the Roundabout finale.  They all danced to the song and brought a nice ending to the show.<br /><br />  The DVD itself is full of computer generated landscapes that open the show.  This is the first time I've seen a Yes inspired Landscape, (not quite a Roger Dean piece of Artwork, but not intentional either) brought to life vividly in moving digital computer generated animation.  I'm also glad they showed some behind the scenes at the Mann Music Center Show in Philadelphia.  I was at this show and it left me speechless.  This band continues, as I would like to believe, for the music and their fans.  I believe Jon Anderson is in his bliss right now.  They are again performing epics, and new epics, still realizing their dream.  In the age where a two to three minute song is the max for radio airplay, Yes receives Standing ovations each evening for their 20+ minute epics.  I remember Jon in an interview mentioning that the idea of making an epic song is to carry the audience and listener on a journey and this DVD will allow you to feel this energy.  My hats off to the Band and the hope that the work continues.  Yes is extremely underappreciated by the masses, but it is our little secret (the fans)....they know this.  There is such a family atmosphere at a Yes show, you pretty much know you can talk to anyone there and most are well versed with the Music and the Band.  My best to the Band, their family and the Fans....<br />David Carlin&lt;BRs is extremely underappreciated by the masses, but it is our little secret (the fans)....they know this.

B00003Q43A|5.0|ID4 is one of the best alien thrillers in a while. Will Smith's performance is great and full of humor. He is, of course, the best actor in the film. Jeff Goldblum's prformance is wonderful too. Jeff plays a computer geek who is the one who saves the world by figuring out a way to shut down the alien's shields.<BR>      The performance that is unforgetable is Bill Pullman as the President of the USA. His speech to the fighter pilots is unbelievable and unforgettable. The scene is moving and makes you feel like you could do anything. <BR>      You will not be dissapointed!<BR>      PS: Watch the skies!
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you could wear out a CD by playing it, I would have worn this one out long ago. It's a magnificent collection of bluegrass, gospel and old-time country tunes.
0553381709|5.0|When will this book be released in true paperback?<BR>I have the previous 2 books in paperback, and want to match them all up in my collection.  Trade paperback is nice, but doesn't fit on my bookshelf.
B00000DC7J|5.0|I will try to be brief in light of the quality of the other reviewers. Two quick points. This man is as unique a musical visionary as Monk, Ornette Coleman, Mingus, or Jimi Hendrix. Like them, he is best heard with his own group. Fernando Suarez Paz (violin) Pable Ziegler (piano), Horacio Malvicino, Sr. (guitar), Hector Console (bass) along with Piazolla on bandoneon comprised one of the greatest quartets in the history of music. Like Coltrane's classic quartet, or some of Muddy Water's groups, these guys present an entire genre of music at its best.<BR>If you are new to Piazolla, some of the melodies will seem almost cliched. This is where the cliches came from. This is why the melodies became standards- because when this group plays them you can hear the joy of discovery, the intensely passionate nature of Piazolla's sound universe.<BR>This is not necessarily music for everyone- what is? But this is a great album by one of the unique voices in the music of the twentieth century. You owe it to your heart and your soul to give it a listen.
6302732875|4.0|As stange as it can be, I can't stand Mamet's plays, but likes him as a movie director. Well, this play is not directed by him, but the brilliant cast makes the diference between stage and screen. Everybody's talking too much in this real estate's world. Of course, it was supposed to be written for theater. Just add Al Pacino [with an unforgettable monologue], Jack Lemmon [at his best], Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, a disturbing, thus excellent apparition of Alec Baldwin who plays with cynicism like others drink tea, Jonathan Pryce... and you have sunshine in winter.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was about 4-5 years ago...I instantly  LOVED it!!  I am a super-duper action fan and this is such a well made film!!  No wonder why this movie was nomiated for an Academy Award!!<br />If you like action and down &amp; dirty acting, you'll LOVE this film!  Everyone must see this movie!!
0441172717|5.0|I originally read _Dune_ as a serial in the old Analog magazine (in the '60s I think). It was then and, after 40 years as an SF reader, it still remains the single greatest SF novel I have ever read. I am not as impressed by the author's sequels, and even less so by son Brian's prequels of recent years (though I have read them all because I cannot get enough of the world Mr. Herbert created for us.) If you will read only one SF novel, this is the one to read.
0312265859|4.0|This was an easy and fun read, like the other Stephanie Plum novels. Trying not to compare it to the others in the series, I think the love triangle is still interesting, and the central case was, yes, a bit different and a little darker, but quite compelling. To balance, Evanovich made the peripherals a bit too wacky (being chased by a rabbit? c'mon). There's alot of heart and humor in Evanovich's novels. <br />If I did have any real gripes with this book, it would be these two: <br />1. Evanovich needs to spend less time rehashing past novels. I know it's a service for first time readers, but it takes away from the story. Do it all in a prologue. <br />2. Stephanie Plum needs to spend less time questioning and doubting and whining about the job she has. I know it gives the character a bit more conflict and depth, but it's getting old, especially when it doesn't go anywhere. <br />Evanovich is one of my favorite authors. I look forward to the next in the series.
B000065V1V|4.0|The best song on the album, &quot;Cactus&quot; is a Pixies cover.  That is NOT a criticism.  Bowie does for &quot;Cactus&quot; what Jimi Hendrix did for Bob Dylan's &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; -- he makes it his own.<br />This album is similar to, but less daring than, &quot;Station to Station&quot;, but anything compared to that classic record pales by comparison.  <br />What I particularly like about &quot;Heathen&quot; is that 1)Bowie's two best assests - his voice and his personality - are front and center.  This is a well produced record.
1587990717|4.0|\\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is a thought-provoking tale about the role of chance in choosing winners and losers in the markets.  Taleb extends his lessons to somewhat broader avenues of life, but the strength of the book is in conveying the basics of his view of quantitative finance.   His discussions of the limitations human emotions put on trading rationally and how social context determines ones notion of success are also very good.<br />While Taleb has some clearly valid criticisms to make of academic financial theories, it should be pointed out that the assumption underlying his own trading strategy - that of obtaining larger gains when betting on rare events than losses when betting against likely events - may also change.   One needs to understand that models and theories are approximations to the truth.   His statement that Newtonian physics is \\"wrong\\" gets to the heart of the matter.  High-rise buildings are designed just fine without general relativity.  In this context, Newton's laws are as right as they need to be.  And insofar as the context of Black-Scholes type models hold, they are useful as well and provide something for further theory to build upon.  That widespread use of strategies based on a financial model in turn changes the system that was originally modeled is a unique pitfall that also needs notice.<br />\\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is somewhat meandering, but I nonetheless found the book to flow quite fluidly.  I enjoyed his writing style, even if he was at times a bit pompous (I particularly liked his use of George Will as a whipping boy.)  As a non-quantitative book, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is an accessible way to hear the worthwhile things Taleb has to say.
B000056NX5|3.0|I was very much looking forward to watching this.  My parents had the brown covered, two albumn set of JCSS... and I long ago learned of (and viewed) the delightful 1973 film version.  It was dated the first time I saw it-- so much so that it seems less out of place now that retroing to the 70s is a respectable business.<br />And then came along this one.<br />Had I not seen the first film and never seen or heard JCSS performed, I would have adored this movie.  It has a good deal going for it.  The must, as always, rocks.  Renee Castle carrys off Mary Magdalene's tunes without a hitch.  Simon Zealotes, a character that has never stood out, for me, previously grabbed me in as performed by Tony Vincent.  I experience an eerie joy each time Jerome Pradon's Judas mocks JC.  The DVD also has a fun &quot;making of&quot;-- with Tim Rice and A.L.W. prominent throughout-- discussing with candor what they were (and were not) trying to accomplish.<br />So, why three stars?  Most of the blame-- and blame is the correct word, since this film could have been great-- lies with Gelnn Carter as Jesus.  The shortest sentence in the bible, allegedly, is, &quot;Jesus wept.&quot;  You would not know it from watching Carter's Christ.  No, in this version: Jesus pouted.  Again and again.  The character of Jesus with his big pouty face (from the beginning when Judas questions Mary M. to the end when is whipped) hurt the film and detracted from its credibility.  (Perhaps if you watch on a small enough screen this would not be a problem.) I suspect that Carter is used to performing on stage and so he overdose it so that the backrow knows he is crying.  Unfortunately, the camera puts us in front of the front row, directly in front of his face, and he just looks silly.<br />And then there is Herod.  I guess it is not really fair to be critical.  I doubt anyone will ever match Josh Mostel's Herod.  This Herod was okay.  But the scene has so much potential, it is disappointed to see it carried off only adequately.<br />In short, if you are only going to see one, then stick with the 1973 version.  It is superior.  But there is a lot to enjoy on the DVD-- It is not a waste of time.

B000003S5H|4.0|I first heard of Air when I purchased soundtrack of Virgin Suicides.  I was very impressed with the song Ce Matin La, and the reviews that I read of Moon Safari were very favorable.  The music is very good, and I can't help but feel the sonds of Steely Dan when I listen to this album, although that may just be my own unique impression of the music.  Some of the songs have a disco feel and some are simply lovely to hear with a certain feel of vulnerability.  &quot;All I need's a peace of mind, then I can celebrate&quot; might sound cheesey until you hear the beauty that makes this song come together.  &quot;Remember&quot; is comical with the computer-sounding vocals, very cool with bass rif and drum beat.  A great album to put on when you are busy doing some task that needs to have some music playing that allows you to not be distracted, yet does allow you to get into a groove to the music.  I am glad that I was introduce to this music as a result of Sofia Coppla icluding them on the excellent soundtrack of Virgin Suicides.
B00000JCB2|1.0|My friends have tried to get me to like this album but its not possible. They seriously lack any atmosphere or melody and I think Limbonic Art and Ephel Duath are way better. Please stop that horrible guitar sound and the vocalist is so condesending its painful.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's cd &quot;let go&quot; is wonderful.  It's one of those cd's where you can listen to the whole thing without getting bored instead of just 1 or 2 songs.
0345350499|5.0|Simply unbelievable.  This must truly have been a labour of love for Marion Zimmer Bradley -- it is so intricate.  The ever-familiar Arthur legend is thrown through a new twist by telling the story through the lives of its women.   The religious and spiritual aspects of the book are most intriguing and thought provoking.  A very long read -- and well worth every minute!!
B00004RFFS|5.0|Words cannot describe how good this movie is. A Beautiful story of vampires. Highly reccomend this movie to anyone.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is obviously better than just \\"Complicated.\\"  Her entire album is filled with hits, none that seem like they don't come from anywhere but the heart.  She is not to be comparied to Alanis or anyone of that nature for she is in a league way on her own.  \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Unwanted\\", \\"Nobody's Fool\\" are just a few of the excellent songs on her album.  If you don't have it, you should!!!
B000063S6Z|5.0|There were only a few songs on \\"Play\\" that I absolutley loved. These were  \\"Porcelain\\", \\"Why Does my Heart Feel So Bad\\", \\"Rushing\\", \\"Everloving\\", and \\"Guitar, Flute and String\\". This CD takes those and makes a whole CD with this style and I love it!!!!!!! Highly recomend if you liked the songs I listed, buy this CD!!
0345350499|5.0|Marion must have the magic of Avalon beacuase I read this book starving for more every time I read some more.  Despite the enormous size of this book, by the end I was yearning for more<br />   The first part of the book is about Morgaine, a dark little woman gifted with the sight.  She is sent to Avalon with her Ant Viviane for training in the will of the Goddess and the art of Druid magic.  Viviane sends her to do thee godesses will in a sacred ritual.  After the ritual in her naieveness, has found Vivianne betrayed her by the ultimate betrayl of her brother king Authur.  In haste she leaves Avalon and renounces the sight. From here Gwenhwyfar controls Authur by forcing him to betray Avalon and become a christian king.  Even though Gwenhwyfar appears so pious she hides secretly longing for Lancelet.<br />  In the last patrs of this book, Morgaine relizes her duty to Avalon after a most horicfic death,  even though she may be called harlot and witch.  Gwenhwyfar now has total control of Authur, now Morgaine ust return Avalon to power by having Authur restore his oath to Avalon ortaking the one tool of his power.<br />   I thought it to be a ironic ending, I even cried.  The characters moved me so deeply by the time of the end of the book I wished that all of the characters were young again, and ready to start over a new story.<br />          This was a marvelous book. If you love Authuranian legends this book is a must buy.  I hope you enjoyed
B000068FY0|4.0|It's the little things that matter most. A&amp;M's earlier release of Crime of the Century sounded awful. Supertramp's most ambitious prog-rock album certainly deserved better; Mobile Fidelity Sound's release of the album was a big improvement. Of all the Supertramp reissues this year, Crime sounds best; it's sound is fuller, bigger and finally matches the ambitious concept behind the album.<br />It's a crime that A&amp;M chose not to reissue this fine album with any audio extras or notes. Crime is as bare bones as reissues come; the original lyrics and artwork are featured but, sadly, there's no comments from any of the band members. If Rhino had reissued this album, you can be sure that the album would have been packed with extras (an example of how it should be done is the 2 disc debut album by the Cars. The original single disc is also available but the 2 disc version is available for the fans).<br />Should you purchase this album? If you like or love Supertramp, frankly, the answer is yes. This album has never sounded quite this good before. Kudos on the sound but two thumbs down on the packaging. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.
B000005IRG|5.0|CBGB's punk of the late 1970s consisted of a lot more than two chords and a grudge, as this album proves. Television played with an intricate and sophisticated two-guitar attack, lines intertwining in ingenius ways. The title track is arguably one of the top ten guitar rock tracks by any band ever. <br />If you like this album, you should also seek out other high points of that era - Richard Hell and the Voidoids' &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, the Talking Heads' &quot;77&quot;, etc.
B000068FWC|5.0|Full of wit, cynicism and rich melodies, Breakfast In America was the band's last gasp; Famous Last Words was little more a whimper from a songwriting team that had delivered a basketful of great pop songs.<br />Starting life as a prog rock band with jazz leanings, Supertramp was on the road to nowhere fast after the release of their second album. Founding member Rick Davies with original member Roger Hodgson became the only two hold overs for Supertramp version 2. The band's third album was everything that previous albums were not;Incorporating rich, witty lyrics, sharp concise hooks and tasty melodies Supertramp V.2 produced Crime of the Century.<br />Suddenly, Supertramp found an appreciative audience. Breakfast in America was V.2's 4th album and, arguably their best. Hodgson's tendancy to write quirky, catchy pop songs meshed well with Davies' melodic invention. At turns darkly cynical and hopeful, Breakfast in America became their biggest hit.<br />It's also one of the band's most successful concept albums. Using America as a template for examining the excess of the world (among many other things), BIA is loaded to the gills with the band's catchies material. The arrangements sparkle with witty musical touches. Although neither Hodgson nor Davies are the most gifted of vocalist, both have pleasant voices that work well with the material.<br />Usually when companies reissue albums it's to reinvigorate the sales of an artist's back catalog. In other words, they want to [pull] fans into purchasing the same thing twice. BIA is as bare bones as they come as a reissue; there are no liner notes, no interviews or comments about the making of the album. The only way to tell the difference between this edition and the earlier one put out by A&M, is the sound quality. Bill Levenson and his crew have done a great job of transfering BIA. It hasn't sounded this vital on a mainstream release in years.<br />The MFS version issued a decade ago was a marked improvement over the original CD. In terms of clarity and sharpness it is still the \\"gold\\" standard. The newly reissued BIA holds up quite well in comparison although I do prefer the MFS on certain tracks vs. the newly remastered edition.

B000003S09|5.0|At the end of the 60's, most rock music had gone back to the basics with groups like The Band or Creedence Clearwater Revival.  King Crimson was one of the first bands to explore progressive rock.  Pink Floyd was evolving from their Syd Barrett period and they were still a few years away from their classic \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". I don't think Greg Lake ever sang better, and it has one of the greatest album covers.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is without a doubt one of those CDs that just improves with each listen.  While Kamera and Heavy Metal Drummer are what keep you listening the first couple go-rounds, the more dense and sonically diverse songs grow on you.  And, as you continue to listen to this disk, you realize that Kamera and Heavy Metal Drummer are much more than simple ear candy.<br />The hype surrounding this CD is over the top, which has no doubt caused a bit of a backlash among those music listeners who fancy themselves to be on the cutting-edge and are concerned about liking something that so many other people like.  Regardless of whether the unanimity of critical praise and the at least modest commercial success has caused Wilco to drift into the &quot;overhyped&quot; category of more than a few self-appointed arbiters of cool, the music on the CD speaks for itself.  If you like good music, buy this CD and give it a chance. You won't be sorry.
B000066C1N|5.0|After I saw the movie, I knew that I had to get this CD...  Every song is great on this CD, where can you find that?  Some of my favorites are &quot;Here I Am&quot;, &quot;Get Off My Back&quot;, &amp; absolute favorite is &quot;I Will Always Return&quot;.<br />The movie is great, the music is great, everything about this is great!  Something about this movie just gives you a lot of hope in otherwise frightful times.  This movie and its scores give the listener and viewer something to look to for forgetting the reality that we live in and finding yourself in the old west!  Its a feelgood type that wont let you down!<br />Go see the movie and get the CD, you wont be disappointed!
B000002J03|5.0|One of the things that makes me sad about listening to Led Zeppelin II is that I wasn't alive at the time to have experienced it when it was originally released.  When I was in college in the early 90's, my friend introduced me to Led Zeppelin by playing this very album.  His father had the LP, and as I sat there listening to Whole Lotta Love for the first time, I couldn't believe my ears.  It's like everything I had heard up to that point was simply a copy of what I was hearing on this album... and that stuff wasn't as good as this.  Catchy, hard-hitting, funky, and soulful, Led Zeppelin represents each and every reason why rock and roll will never die, and proves even further why the music on this album continues to endure to this very day (and will continue to do so as long as these albums continue to be reissued).<br />One of the reasons why I decided to write this review was because I recently watched the movie \\"Almost Famous\\", a movie that I've seen probably 25-30 times since its release, and everytime the scene plays where 11-year old William is looking through his sister's albums, I get goosebumps.  Cameron Crowe knows his music.  From The Who's \\"Tommy\\", the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\", to the very album being reviewed here, each album cover's image that flashes on the screen is a reminder of how wonderful an expression of emotion music is.<br />Led Zeppelin II is incredible from the first song to the last.  There isn't a bad track on here.  While the percussion \\"break\\" in Moby Dick threw me off the first time I heard it, the complexity, energy, and sheer craziness of John Bonham's drumming is something that you learn to appreciate rather quickly.  John Paul Jones' basswork is flawless.  His grooves gel the songs together like only he can, being both fierce and delicate at the same time.  You just have to shake your head at how good it sounds.  And then you have the frontmen, Page and Plant, who provide both awesome and intricate guitarwork, and vocals from theheavens.  It's rare to listen to an album that feels so even, and when it's over, you're left thirsting for more.  Zeppelin II represents the best that the band had to offer, in my opinion, which is why it is easily among my top 5 albums of all time.  You don't outgrow it; it grows with you.
B00005O5CM|5.0|i absolutely love this movie. i thought it would be stupid, but it is just one of those movies that makes you feel good. it is all around cute and every time i watch it, it gets better & better.
B00005KFUM|4.0|I heard this album by accident when my 13 year old daughter brought it home, and I was stunned by it. I have to say (with affection) that it's wasted on her, and I'm not sure there are many other teenagers around who will grasp why Muse are so important. In fact you probably have to be a 40-something like me to fully appreciate who their influences have been and what the young band has done with them.<br />The trouble with Muse is that they make the creation of superb art rock look so easy that most listeners will take it for granted. Unless you've been around a few years and listened to a few other bands' attempts to create this sort of music, then you may fail to appreciate the unique mix of creative talent, inspiration, sheer hard work, and encyclopaedic knowledge of rock history that must have gone into this project. <br />Sadly, the only influence most reviewers on this site have spotted has been Radiohead. That's fair enough up to a point. Matt Bellamy sounds a bit like Thom Yorke on some songs, and Muse owe Radiohead an even more important debt: It's only because Radiohead carved out a mass market for this kind of art-rock back in the late 90's that there is an opening for new bands like Muse now. However, it is unfair to write Muse off as copyists. On the contrary, they have in some respects surpassed Radiohead at their best, matching the sonic ambition of Radiohead's later work without sacrificing the melodic sweep and the compelling hooks that made \\"The Bends\\" so listenable. What's more, Bellamy's voice is a considerably more flexible and emotionally powerful instrument than Yorke's, and embraces far older and deeper influences going right back to the late '60's.  Van der Graaf Generator is the most obvious influence, but there's also a heavy sprinkling of King Crimson, at least a nod to middle-period U2, a hint of Japan and others if you listen for them. It's all very British, but encyclopaedic for all that.    <br />The key structural difference betweenMuse and that first wave of prog bands is a welcome one: Muse have learned to say in a four-minute song what some of the seventies prog-rockers needed a 20 minute mini-concerto for. They have some way to go before they outgun the older bands for sheer musical virtuosity, but even that is no bad thing. At least this never pretends to be anything but rock - a boundary that some of the old prog bands came dangerously close to crossing - and they have all the time and talent in the world to refine their art. <br />So what will you hear? Among a wealth of styles, you'll get delicate baroque-style keyboard arpeggios, some thundering ostinato bass lines, crunching splintery guitar, rock solid percussion, and possibly the most awesome, spine-tingling rock vocalising you've ever heard. Ultimately, it must be said, the band has so far broken little new ground. They seem to have been concentrating so far on drawing their influences together and weaving them into whole cloth for the new decade. But they are still amazingly young for this sort of mature work, and the intelligence and awesome technique they have brought to the task promises to propel them to the front rank.
B000002IP1|4.0|But Seriously, Another Day in Paradise was the only track I heard on the televion show and watched the video of Phil there. Oh Boy, this was great to pick up the choice and I luv the tracks there. Honestly, not all songs I luv but, Another day in paradise is one sure to rate five stars and is the best I find of the Phil collins stuff. Something happened on the way to heaven is a good number with a tempo beat and I wish it would rain has a lively luv song notes sung by phil, soft and cheery. Colors bring in a different mood n is a classic song. Find a way to my heart has clear voice of Phil though I feel its a bit slow. A good pick for a change, a retro pick - Another day in Paradise! That's Phil collins how I know n luv to listen this number, not to miss!
B00005J4HH|5.0|Origin of Symmetry is the sound of the future. A grinding bass with biting guitar riffs and sweet simple samples with desperate jeff Buckly like falsetto lyrics on top, you hardly get a moments rest as one breathless tune is thrashed out after another. Not since the Pixies' Doolittle has there been such an intense and dazzling start to an Album as the first five songs leave you in a state of stupified reflection.  <BR>It's a bitter sweet ride as Muse pour out their souls with a crashing, ground breaking array of samples and guitar interacting beautifully with a hyperventilating voice which highlights a cross over into much daker, murkier territory than the much compared Radiohead, it's personal with Muse. They show on OOS more ideas than most bands show in a career and guitar music is in a much healthier state because of it. Can't wait for the next effort from these three.
B00005RY7X|1.0|I can't even begin. For one, the lyrics are as simplistic as I once was inclined to believe humanly possible. I mean seriously, I could pull better writing out of the exact place Andrew W.K's personality represents. Number two, who told this kid he could dance? Or sing? Or have talent? That man who lied to him, my friend, is the reason for capital punishment. But if you come away with anything from my review, remember this...DON'T BUY THIS FLIPPING CD. DON'T!
B00005J4HH|5.0|Muse simply explode into life on Origin of Symmetry. An exhilirating bass clashing seamlessly against gringing guitars, cascading samples and a Jeff Buckly like falsetto voice.<BR>To compare with Radiohead is obvious but they take the Bends and rip it to shreds with a far more penetrative style than Radiohead where ever able to achieve on the afore mentioned album. On OOS they walk the tight rope between oblivion and transcendence beautifully. They proove that there is still much innovation to be derived from a simple guitar, bass and drum line up and have definitly created a new benchmark in guitar music. Not since the Pixies Doolittle has there been such an opening to an Album, with the opening five tracks leaving you gasping for air with their mixture of intense lyrics crossed with mind bending guitar riffs. Muse simply put have more ideas on OOS than the Foo Fighters, Linkin Park, Smashing pumpkins and Faith no More have had in their entire careers. Their third album will proove to be one of the most anticipated in years.
B000002A33|5.0|I've liked \\"grunge music\\" for quite a while, and when I eventually heard of the Screaming Trees, I downloaded the song Nearly Lost You. I liked it, but didn't think of it as anything special. After reading so much praise for Dust however, I decided to take a chance when I saw it second hand in a local record shop. I was blown away on the first listen.<br />Psychedelia and folk are genres I've never been drawn to, but the Screaming Trees have created such a unique, touching, folk/metal/psychedelia/grunge/genres-I-can't-quite-pinpoint hybrid it's impossible to resist.<BR>Mark Lanegan shines: a husky, gorgeous voice that perfectly compliments the music, with moving and beautiful lyrics that match the quality of those of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.<BR>From the first frantic burst of Halo of Ashes to the final fading melancholy of Gospel Plow, every song is a winner.<br />I wouldn't class this as a grunge album, but I think it will appeal to open-minded fans of the genre. Criminally ignored and among my top five favourites, I consider Dust to be the most versatile (and perhaps one of the best) rock albums ever.
0743216458|3.0|This book can be summed up without much effort: A story of America's best written at the level of a high-school term paper.
0312265859|2.0|I have to admit I am a great fan of the series but now Janet Evanovich did it: I'm quitting! I can't believe she wrote this book! The last 50 pages were awful. If she thought she had to change something to keep her fans still interested in the series she could have wrote something that was funny but \\"Hard Eight\\" definitely was NOT funny. It's a hard-boiled crime novel and nothing I wanted to read as Stephanie Plum series fan. All I can say is I am totally disappointed, I could have saved my money.
B00005YUNY|5.0|When I first heard that YES was going to tour with an orchestra I was very skeptical about the quality of the orchestra arrangements. Some members of YES tried a few years ago to orchestrate a few songs from the Yes catalog and the result was something like Yanni meets the Moodies with extra Cheese! This DVD has none of that. It is a powerful performance with very appropriate arrangements. The delivery of Gates of Delirium and Ritual are perfect. Tom Brislin is brilliant on keyboards , his stage act reminded me of Patrick Moraz and Keith Emerson. Anderson's voice has never been better, and I can say the same about each one of the guys, they all master their instruments. They band sounds fantastic. I am VERY glad about the option to remove the animations from the concert, the animations just get in the way (I really dislike the KEYS DVD because of that, who wants to see a woman hanging from a cliff when Rick Wakeman is playing the minimoog at the speed of light?). The picture quality is the best I have seen so far for any DVD concert (including Stings newest), the sound is also very well equalized. You can hear orchestra and band perfectly. If you are going to buy only one YES DVD or ANY concert DVD per say make this one your choice.
0312265859|2.0|In many ways, \\"Hard Eight\\" is a typical Stephanie Plum novel.  You've got your love triangle, you've got your bad car-ma, you've got your tag-along bounty hunter wannabe's.  There are some fun moments, but overall, the book reads like a rough draft rushed to the press.<br />\\"Hard Eight\\" hits the ground running as neighbor Mabel Markowitz makes a tearful plea to Steph - find her granddaughter and great-granddaughter or she'll lose her house.  Nothing makes a Burg woman more uncomfortable than an outright display of emotion, and Steph reluctantly agrees to help.  In the course of her search, she crosses the wrong kind of folks, and, as usual, finds herself up to her neck in very bad guys.<br />Unfortunately, a story with so much promise fizzles out in the midst of tepid new characters - such as lawyer Albert Kloughn, whose big recurring joke is that people call him \\"clown\\" and he's forced to repeatedly spell his name - and storylines which wrap up a bit too hastily for all the time and emotion invested.<br />Perhaps the biggest disappointment is in how the Ranger/Morelli love triangle is handled, with swift, forced, and out-of-character pronouncements stuffed in between dead bodies and exploding vehicles.  One of the series' most endearing qualities has been the emotional tango Steph has been dancing with these two sexy guys.  In \\"Hard Eight\\" the tango turns into an awkward clomp through muddy terrain, with no one staying true to character.<br />While I don't begrudge Evanovich her well-earned success, I wish it didn't come at the cost of the quality of the work.  The more visible an author is, the higher the pressure to turn out the next money-maker, and sadly that's how \\"Hard Eight\\" felt to me as I read it.  Another draft would have done wonders for the book... here's hoping Evanovich has the time to do the series justice with \\"Nine.\\"
B00005OAIE|4.0|I think this is one of the better albums I've heard recently. I don't understand the criticism for his music. He's got a fine voice (though I will concede the similarities to Dave Matthews are justified). There's an honesty to his songs that I have not heard in quite a while. I'm happy I've discovered his music.

B00005OWIU|3.0|It is my opinion that the music contained in this cd is very entertaining. it is a nice score. however, the music was not what i was looking for in the film. it just doesnt fit. i think that they should have released this seperate from the film.
0792844882|5.0|This is not what you think it is. It is a story about one woman's journey, which takes place in Las Vegas. What I like about the movie is that the Elizabeth Berkley character tries to survive her life which is totally messed up. I have seen it at least 10 times at theaters, still want to watch it over and over on DVD. I have seen other Paul Verhoeven's films such as \\"Robojox,\\" \\"Starbugs\\" and \\"Invisible Man in Love,\\" but this one is one hellba movie. I have heard that Paul Verhoeven and the writer talk about the sequel to it right after the movie came out. I hope that happens in the near future.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I never really was a Britney Spears fan but I bought this CD because I had heard several songs and really liked them. After hearing the whole entire CD, I realized I had wasted my money. Most of the songs have the same beat, and her cover of \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" sucks, and the songs that were somewhat good got old fast. If your a pop music fan you will probably like this CD, but other then that most people won't like it.
B000003BEV|5.0|In 1967, the year of Beatles released &quot;Sgt Peppers&quot;, the Rolling Stones makes&quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; a massive hit.This is a classical album and was my favorite album.2000 Light Years From Home&quot; can still transmit a pretty handsome case of the Fear. Bill Wyman's &quot;In Another Land&quot; is as thin as his phased vocal.the Stones came up with some good songs. Their psychedelic majesties request is classic and a great satire to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper
B000066NW0|5.0|People may see Avril Lavigne as just another Michelle Branch, as it seems everyone is listening to this new wave of girls that are actually writing and playing instruments, unlike Britney and J.Lo. But Avril is much more than that. Her songs are very relatable and likeable. I, myself normally listen to heavy rock. And I was surprised to find myself humming along to &quot;Complicated&quot; when I heard it. It's great to see a GIRL redifining &quot;punk,&quot; because is not just about screaming into a microphone and chucking a gutiar halfway across the stage. Punk is about creating your own style, and that's exactly Avril Lavigne. She has every aspect of what &quot;punk&quot; is. Just having fun. But she is also evjoyable for people who aren't into punk. Countless times have I seen preppies going around singing 'take off all your preppy clothes.' The lyrics of her songs are things I can really relate to. Skater Boy is definitly my favorite song, and I feel it is a perfect example of the pettiness of many people who only go for looks alone. Her lyrics are inspiring and it's great to see that not all musically talented girls are girly-girl pop lovers. Thanks for representing people like me Avril!
B000002KGT|4.0|Rumours deserves the pedestal it has achieved as a result of its tremendous sales, in comparison with all those monster-hit albums that many of us wonder about.  Most of the songs on Rumours are instantly familiar to listeners as a result of constant radio airplay.  The lyrics generally cover the ups and downs of relationships, dealing with disaffection as well as warmth but with an overall positive spin.  The combination of this with the cheerfulness of the music yields very nice results.  Of course, the tightness of the group, enhanced by great arrangements and production, helps explain the album's commercial success.  But most important in my view is a natural quality, a spontaneity, that the songs feature, bearing in mind the album's crisp melodies and bright beats.  This spontaneity overlaps with the notion of smoothness but also can be distinguished from it.  Furthermore, it is important that the crafting of the songs serves to embellish rather than counteract it.  (In contrast to, for example, those on The Doors' Strange Days, brilliantly produced and a masterpiece, but without the spontaneity of the group's debut.)  <br />Think, for example, of the mellifluous sound and Stevie Nicks' vocals on \\"Dreams.\\"  (Is there anyone reading this who does not know that song or others I mention?)  \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" are perfect examples of excellent pop songs in the most positive sense of such a characterization.  It is Christine McVie's vocals that grace \\"You Make Loving Fun,\\" with a similar texture to Stevie and \\"Dreams.\\"  An interesting question for me and everyone else with respect to Rumours:  What is your favorite song?  Is there any CD for which the answer is more unpredictable?  My choice (easily) is the gorgeous \\"I Don't Want to Know,\\" Stevie Nicks' lovely voice (sorry if I emphasize her Lindsey) and everything else.  Having said all this, I know there are still some of you out there who do not own Rumours.  It certainly would not be a bad idea ifyou did.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Bagdad Cafe is an odd film, and I mean that as a compliment.  The characters are all greatly flawed individuals who, as the film starts, are largely unhappy.  CCH Pounder plays Brenda who owns the cafe.  This woman could scare the hide off a cat with that shrill voice that drives her husband off to park in the desert and observe her with binoculars for the rest of the film.  Jasmin, the Bavarian German who likes her coffee strong, is fat and seems to change clothes regularly despite having a suitcase supposedly filled only with men's clothes.  She is not the typical Hollywood star, but she comes to win our hearts.  Jack Palance as Rudy Cox, the set painter from Hollywood, lives in a trailer and sees the world through rose colored glasses.  His costumes are pure Santa Monica Boulevard chic.  He charms us as he falls in love.  The sequence of paintings he does as Jasmin gets progressively less dressed is hysterical.  The other characters are also unique.  Brenda's son who also has a son, a baby, wants nothing more than to play piano all day.  The daughter dresses in trendy teenage garb and seems to repeatedly run off with anything with two legs and pants.  Debbie, the tatoo artist, seems like an S&M freak, and eventually leaves because \\"there is too much harmony.\\"<br />The thing I love about this film is that most all of the characters change.  Jasmin's unfolding is glorious.  The themes in the movie of racial misunderstanding and harmony are also interesting.  Jasmin has never seen blacks and pictures herself in tribal Africa being roasted for dinner.  She's amazed at how light the palms of Brenda's daughter's hand is, a simple detail but beautiful in its innocent sense of wonder.  The DVD version doesn't add a tremendous amount of extras such as bonus material, but the movie itself is the reward.  If you like upbeat films somewhat off the beaten track, seek out this cinematic gem.
B000002GDJ|4.0|In their second album, Reggatta de Blanc, The Police begin to refine the hard-hitting sound of their debut.  In addition, while they had reggae in their first album, they include more on this CD, superior to that of \\"Roxanne,\\" in my view.  Indeed, the group's ability to infuse rock with reggae elements frequently and with consistent success is one of its strongest legacies.  Examples here are \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" a big single and signature tune for them as well as one of my favorites, and \\"Bring on the Night.\\"  The punk influence can be heard on such songs as \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"No Time This Time.\\"  Whether rawer, as on their debut, or more refined, The Police's punk sound is musically superior and more appealing than what is normally heard from groups more strictly associated with the genre.  Perhaps the best song is \\"Walking on the Moon,\\" with its soft, sweet atmosphere supporting Sting's beautiful poetry, and its lovely chorus.  But Reggatta de Blanc is loaded with good tracks, including the radiant title instrumental.  One of the reasons I feel the group rarely wastes a cut is that even songs generally considered weaker are still catchy and feature sharp melodic sounds and good, crisp beats.  Sting helps the situation by usually placing the song title within the catchiest musical parts.
B00005JKG7|5.0|It's hard to believe that the same John Carpenter who produced three of my favorite fright flicks ever (Halloween, The Thing, and The Fog) could, in 2000, make something as dismal and unwatchable as Ghosts of Mars! Well, if those classics are his legacy, then so be it, because they are three of the best. The Fog is one of those neat, atmospheric and spooky little horror movies that nobody cares to make anymore - or if they do, they ...it up with fake-looking CGI monsters and cuisinart editing geared toward the short-attention spans of the MTV generation. So thank God they are finally dusting off this classic and giving it the real DVD treatment! I mean, I've had this on VHS tape for many years, but to know that I'll soon see it in 2:35 ratio, in crisp digital sound + vision, well, I can't wait! A Carpenter, and genre, classic!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Movies like Requiem For A Dream are like giant arrows that point out the flaws of voting bodies like The Academy Awards....this film should have swept the Oscars, should have won Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress....instead we get safe pap like Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts.....<br />   Requiem For a Dream follows four characters as they follow their dreams...and we see their dreams become nightmares. Ellen Burstyn gives maybe the best motion picture performance I've ever seen. Not HER best ever...THE BEST EVER. I have never seen an actor or actress lay themselves bare like this before. Watching the sweet, lonely Sara Goldfarb become a speed freak is bad enough, but the paths followed by her son Harry (Jared Leto), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, a true revelation..), and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)are equally harrowing; By the end of the film I felt like I had been sent through the wringer.....<br />   The DVD has some of the most clever packaging I've seen in quite some time: It's presented like an infomercial for Sara's favorite TV personality, Tappy Tibbins, played by Christopher MacDonald. There are a lot of extras, and I was particularly happy to see Ellen Burstyn interview Author Hubert Selby, Jr.- it was VERY illuminating.<br />  As an unflinching portrait of addiction, Requiem ranks right up there with Trainspotting, and should be required viewing for all High School students thinking of experimenting with drugs.
B000002UAR|5.0|So much hyperbole and b.s. has been written about the Beatles--both pro and con--that it's easy to forget how great and fresh they were.  REVOLVER has to rank as their finest studio album; hell, one of the great studio albums ever produced by anybody, anywhere, anytime. This remaster of the british(that is, international)14-track stereo Lp remains a pure masterwork of creativity, imagination, obscurity and the mastery of the recording process.  <BR>   Upon U.S. release in September 1966, the album had only 11 tracks.  That was because, needing more songs to pad out the YESTERDAY &amp; TODAY compilation, Capitol asked UK EMI for a few tracks.  This sent George Martin to the reels, hastily mixing three songs(&quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; &quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; &quot;Dr. Robert&quot;)to mono and shipping them over here.  By the time the UK mono and stereo Lp came out, though, those mixes had changed, and what you hear on this CD are the final mixdowns for everything, as intended by the band and producer(well, in stereo, that is; a shame the mono mix of the Lp isn't on CD--well worth hearing, believe me).   <BR>   The stereo CD retains one little glitch inherent to the stereo master.  &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; has a flubbed backing lyric(by John Lennon)in the last verse relative to the 45(mono)version; although this was finally fixed on the YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, it remains here, as well as on the otherwise impeccable 1.  The rest of the songs need no further comment by me, or you; greatness this inherent can be heard without the hyperbole or b.s.
B000002JB3|2.0|Since his solo career started in the 80's Phil Collins has been a mastermind of pop music from the second British Invasion. As his time came into the mid 90's, he had no place to go on the radio, and in the mainstream.<br />His 1996 album, Dance Into The Light, is a bit more upbeat than Collins previous albums. Although the album is a complete turn from his 1993 album, Both Sides, the music proved to be a sorrowful project. The songs here are very much in-between, and only two songs stand out very well on the album, Dance Into The Light, and It's In Your Eyes. The music borrows the feel of African rhythms and effects, but is nowhere near Peter Gabriel's triumphs in African Beats. Surprisingly, the album was Phil's last studio albbum, before announcing his departure from Genesis that same year.<br />Although Phil Collins created many hit songs, this album isn't as big of a keeper as his 80's albums, or his days with Genesis. Dance this one out of the light.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|As a remastered CD, 1 doesn't live up to the high standard set by the YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, but what's here is as clean as has ever been heard, from original mono(Tracks 1-3)and stereo(everything else)mixdowns.  The import 2-Lp vinyl is a more impressive package--the CD booklet graphics seem so minor by comparison--but there are plenty of international 45 sleeve/label reproductions, brief liner notes by producer George Martin, and most of all, great music.  Unlike the 2-CD sets of 1962-1966 and 1967-1970, this is also good value for your money.  Convenient that 27 #1 US/UK hits just about fills up the alotted CD space, but that's what we want, isn't it?
B000002UAX|4.0|To this day, producer George Martin insists that, had the legendary &quot;White Album&quot;(correct title: THE BEATLES)been a 1-disc package, instead of the 2-Lp set it became, it might have been among their greatest.  Well, Sir George, don't take this personally, but in its own way it remains great in spite of itself, and most of all in spite of the fact that you could cull apart enough cuts to make a whole John Lennon or Paul McCartney solo Lp apiece; a George Harrison EP; and a Ringo Starr single.  <BR>   This most fascinating yet imperfect of original Beatles albums got a decent--if not outstanding--CD remastering here, from the stereo mixdown.  Again, a shame no mono counterpart has been officially released, since so many cuts in mono are so different sounding, differently edited, mixed and speeded, etc.  As it is, the stereo CD is still a great experience, showcasing the group's incredible diversity and wild flux of ideas. Granted, &quot;Revolution 9&quot; remains hopelessly oddball, and some tracks sound like demo knockoffs never quite finished.  No matter, because it's the best of it that keeps you coming back again and again.  <BR>   And anyway, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;(sleep in peace, George)justified the whole enterprise.  That, and the ferocious &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; the moving &quot;Julia&quot;(John)and &quot;I Will&quot;(Paul), the silly &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,&quot; the despairing &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; the benediction of &quot;Good Night.&quot;  Overall, pretty darn close to perfect for such a sprawling imperfection of an album.
B000002UAF|3.0|Third in the series of Beatles reissues on CD, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was taken from the UK mono master.  Like the other three early Parlophone albums issued in mono, a good idea badly executed.  First, there was enough space to add the stereo master as well, which not only would have been value for money but of decent historical significance as well.  Producer George Martin's preference for mono is all well and good, but as the genius behind the incredibly dubious original stereo mix of SGT. PEPPER, should hardly have been given the last word on putting these initial Beatles CD titles out in mono only.  Granted, the mono mixes here are strong, dense, and--where applicable--the proper 45 mixes.  But beyond the fact that this should all sound better--and did on vinyl--it's still only half the story.  <BR>   After 1, time to fix this--and the others, too. Great music, but unsatisfying digitalization--and, thus, the half-hearted rating for an otherwise great album.
0451169514|5.0|Well, first off if i havn't heard of the movie It, I probaly wound have never heard of Stephen King's existence. You see, when I first started It i liked it. And so on and so forth... anyway i was blown away of how King could create characters that seem so real. That including Pennywise ( gulp )... After a few months of deciphering It's meaning. ( mind you, every book has a meaning and i usually solve them in a few days or so ) A few months and it took me to do that, since i have bacicly no socail life...then it hit me It was a minor character this book is about how each kid dealt with that psycological horror haunting Derry for eons. Though i wouldn't reccomend people who hate long stories i still do. Remember THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE................
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Too seldom is the concept of a blind mourner treated on film, and more seldom still that it is treated well.  The final episode of M*A*S*H comes to mind, as does Radio Flyer, but until Memento, these two titles were alone, unique to this subject matter.  Other films have tried, such as Jacob's Ladder, but sadly, this film falls short of the emotional impact found in the first two, and now in Memento.   <BR>Simply put, our protagonist is so damaged by grief, so bludgeoned by sadness that he chooses not to remember the event, or denies to the fullest extent the fall out of the tragedy. <BR> <BR>Beautifully executed, this concept, in Memento.
B000001FY9|5.0|Reggae has captured the hearts of many people, especially when it came from Bob Marely. Marley is a giant similar to Elvis Presley: both continue to sell vast numbers of records long after their deaths, and both are clear leaders of their respective genres. This album is the most perfect selection possible. The running order is unbeatable, and unforgetable songs including Jamming, Is This Love, and No Woman No Cry. This album also includes 2 bonus track, Easy Shanking and Punky Reggae Party. If anyone puts in a cd at any time of the day, Legend will have to be your best choice.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord of the Rings soundtrack is pretty good, despite the fact that it has it's dark moments( the parts of the soundtrack that sound scary)Tracks #1,2,9,10,11,17 and 18 are the best.#17 is my favorite track. The music is very moving and inspirational. There are some parts of the soundtrack that are very powerful and there are other parts that are peaceful. So peaceful that you can fall asleep.Overall, the music is excellent.<br />If you like James Horner or Hans Zimmer's work, I would recommend this soundtrack.
B000062TU1|2.0|I first heard of Harry Potter when I was in class one day when I heard about H.P. My dad ordered the 1st 4 books and I said (at first by the way!) that i didn't want them. I hate turning down gifts though... Then that faithful day happened, I heard about Harry Potter and the Sorseror's Stone. Then I read all of the books out so far. Then I was hooked. Then They said a movie about the first book was in production. I saw the trailers, didn't need spoilers, I read the book. I couldn't see it in theatures. It came out on video and I saw it. I was thouroghly disappointed that they left Peeves out, and made Hermione a smart-@$$ know-it-all. But don't let that remark fool you, I was making a statment. Anyway Quiddich was awesome, Snapes acting sucked, he sounded like some 60's hippe who just discovered crack... The end was also a downer when there was only 2 things protecting the stone, not 4. Well maybe the rest won't be not-so-good. Avereage movie, not aweful.
B00005CCA9|2.0|Anyone who can perform this piece at such a high level in front of thousands is impressive to me, but on a relative scale, it's not even close to Evgeny Kissin's performance.  Much of the tempi are simply way too fast for any of Rachmaninoff's articulate and detail-oriented composing to be appreciated.  Argerich's level of intensity is great and the high speed can be exciting, but from someone who generally performs things too fast, myself, this is too fast.  Kissin's, on the other hand, isn't too slow--there are many passages that I could only dream of being able to perform as fast as him.  His tempi are slow enough so that the listener can take in all of the nuances, colors, rhythms, and anything else that might be overlooked with the faster Argerich tempo.  If you appreciate controlled performing (without sacrificing excitement), Argerich simply doesn't match up to Kissin.
B00003CXXS|1.0|OK, where is hammond? This crappy movie is....well...crappy. I'm sorry to say this but I am a JP fan ever since the first movie. The reason enough this [stinks] is that there is not enough back ground to these characters. I mean what happened between the first movie and then? Did the palentoligist hook up with the whiny women? Did Hammond croak?<br /> They instantly srug off the t-rex so the SO NARROW IT IS CHEESY SPINOSARUS COULD TAKE OVER. Why? The other thing is THE RAPTERS ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN SUPER INTELLEGENT. THEY ALSO HAVE WHINY TAG-ALONGS SUCH AS THOSE TWO PEOPLE PORTRAYING TO BE RICH. I don't need to rant on and on... get a book untill anouther better seaquil comes out.
B000066NW0|5.0|...Avril makes it seem as if pop has actually become good. I am into the hardest rock you could think of, and even I love this cd. It is an awesome buy and songs like \\"Things I'll never say\\" and \\" Nobody's Fool\\" make her awesome vocals seem even better. So go out and buy it, you have nothing to lose. There are only about 2 mediocre songs in it, and that's definetly a safe bet...
0441008356|5.0|It's amazing to me that this is Alastair Reynold's first novel, and I hope to see more of the same from him.  The book is enjoyable not only as excellent &quot;hard-core&quot; science fiction, but also because of good character development, fascinating plot lines, and first-rate writing.  At first, I was thrown off somewhat by his use of phrases and references to events or things that had not yet been defined or described, but quickly learned to expect explanations down the road.  The book is brilliantly well-written, and readers will find his references to strange words and events to be part of the overall style that makes this book so good.<BR><BR><BR>If you're new to Sci-Fi or a seasoned reader, you'll find this book enjoyable, pleasantly long, and satisfying.
6305657947|2.0|If you liked this picture you'll love the real one.  This picture, while entertaining, can't hold a candle to the one starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway!
B0000636UN|4.0|I've been a fan of Sheryl Crow since her first commercial release, and this is by far my favorite release.  My husband bought this for me last week, and I haven't taken it out of my car's CD player since.<br />This is the brightest of her CDs, and I for one, welcome the change.  I'm all for dark music, but sometimes, a change will do you good (sorry for that!).  She has a great duet with Don Henley on &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; which is a song she wrote with her country music songwriter sister.  I love the title track, and this song just exudes with the influce that the country rock of the 70s has had on her, as well as &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; which she says on her website is actually inspired by Steve Miller (check out the hoo-hoos that sound like they're almost straight from &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;).<br />One of the most fun things about this CD is the guest artists.  Of course, a CD with Stevie Nicks and Don Henley (of course, she sand back up on Henley's 1989 &quot;End of the Innocence&quot;) is hard for me not to like.  But she incorporates Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines, Emmylou Harris and others seamlessly.  I was suprised to see Gwenyth Paltrow on that list as well- she has a nice voice, but the surprise came when I realized she's on the same CD with all these greats.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I heard it first from my boyfriend and loved it from then on.  It's such an awesome album... a good background when you're making love or just snuggling. The voice and rhythm are very much in sync.  You won't regret buying it.
B000002N2P|5.0|When Green Day was ousted from the punk world after the release of \\"Dookie\\" the band needed an album to respond to their critics. And long behold, the result of all this anger and frustration was possibly their best album to date, \\"Insomniac\\". Something just seemed to click, while their previous albums were good, this one just seemed to be a cut above the rest.<br />The opening track \\"Armatage Shanks\\" kicks things off with an agessive start, and is immeaditly followed by an album packed full of great songs. While every track is worthy of praise, several stand out such as \\"Brat\\", \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", \\"Bab's Uvula Who?\\", \\"86\\", \\"Panic Song\\", \\"Brain Stew\\", \\"Jaded\\" and \\"Walking Contradiction\\". <br />Now, many will argue that earlier albums such as \\"Kerplunk\\" or \\"Dookie\\" were Green Day's best work. Some even say that \\"Nimrod\\" was their finest effort because of it's display of incredible growth by the band. And I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so if you feel a different album was better so be it. But in my opinon \\"Insomniac\\" was Green Day at their best. The music was on point, the lyrics were on point, the band came together in a way that hadn't been seen prior to \\"Insomniac\\" and hasn't been seen since then. <br />The premier album from one of the most evolved and matured bands of the 90s. If you were considering picking up a Green Day album for the first time, I'd highly recommend \\"Dookie\\" first. \\"Insomniac\\" appeals more to the fan who's had at least one Green Day album listening prior. An incredible album, be sure not to miss out on this one if your a Green Day fan.
B000066AXC|5.0|Having spent the last 35 years working with schizophrenic patients and viewing/reading much of the information put out by the media, I think that this movie presented some important information in a positive manner. John Nash's life-long struggle with schizophrenia was realistically and carefully portrayed by Russell Crowe.  So many movies and articles are very negative and/or distorted concerning mental illness.  Schizophrenia is now considered a physical illness just as diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic disorders.  It is time for the public to learn more about what is possible especially in light of the new medications now available, and this movie was done with care and compassion. It is entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Many people, without any medical background, have seen this movie more than once. Ron Howard did an excellent job communicating to the public the life of this brilliant man. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005NW02|5.0|In a word,WOW!  With their second album System have achieved a musical effort worthy of any metal gods.  Powerfull yet elegant,every song has its own style and meaning.  At first the music may seem wierd,but keep listening.  Such a diffrent approach to music is a shock to the SYSTEM.  The infectious groves and inspired lyrics will soon have you hooked.  This is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Buy this album NOW!
0451627768|4.0|I picked up this book both because I am curious about how evolution works and for its historical value. I am glad I read it and would recommend it to others with a few caveats. I have a limited understanding of biology (basically what I remember from bio 101) and this book is definately heavy on scientific lingo. I would often be lost or have to read something many times in an effort to understand it. I also have been told this many of the ideas expressed in it are no longer valid in modern evolutionary theory. The book was written over a hundred years ago, so this is to be expected. Still, the book has much value. Many times as I found myself wondering what Darwin was talking about, I would suddenly have a wave of comprehension and feel very vindicated. All I'm saying is, don't give up on the book. As soon as you start to think it is not worth your time to read it, it will be. That was my experience, at least. If looking to skip the more time consuming parts, one might consider reading the introduction, the first few chapters, and the last chapter, and still probably coming away with a relatively good idea of the book's meaning.
B00003CX95|5.0|My dad and I never really liked the same movies too much. He loved John Wayne movies, either as a two-fisted cattle baron or &quot;Jap&quot; fighter, if you care to use such a term. I love martial arts films... always have, and always will (and since John Wayne's stance on Asians was pretty clear, you can guess my choice in movies went over like a fart in church at my house). But there were a handful of movies that we really bonded over. The &quot;Rocky&quot; series, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Over the Top&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and &quot;Braveheart&quot;. <BR>I'm not Scottish, I don't claim some long lost Scottish heritage, and I don't know Scottish history. All I know is that we loved this movie. He liked the epic story and action, I liked the performances and all that. We didn't get even get up to go the bathroom or anything. We were so enthralled, we didn't pay attention to the 3 hour length at all. The dramatic scenes were incredibly moving. So far as I know, this is the only movie, besides &quot;The Lion King&quot;, that both my father and I ever cried at. And, like &quot;Rudy&quot; before it, I simultaneously tear up and get a big charge when this great film comes to its stirring conclusion. My father even stood up and applauded at the end, and, as anyone in my family could tell you, finding a movie to get my dad on his feet and give an ovation was no small feat.<BR>I'm biased about Braveheart, so what? Share this movie with someone you care about. Rant. Cheer. Cry if you want. It's worth it.
B0000640SA|5.0|I was forced to see Mulholland Drive \\"Two Times\\" because I didn't do good the first time.  I am forced to see the Memento 40 times with the same scenes over and over again but this movie is fun to see.  I give it five stars because it is not boring, and it is very funny sometimes.  I like detective story.  This movie has it all.  It is very fun to see how a person is being used in so many different way.
B00005JKED|5.0|I've had many conversations with my friends about this movie. Conversations turned into debates. Debates turned into arguments. And there are many, many things to argue about concerning this particular movie, which I guess is part of its allure, at least for me. Whether it was realistic or not. Whether Denzel's performance, while indisputably good, was Oscar-worthy or not. Whether it was too violent, or simply a portrayal of the violence that goes on every day in a big city.<br />One at a time.<br />I believe this movie is realistic in all aspects dealing with the situations on the street. There are vicious people who's kill you just as soon as look at you. People who are out to get your money and your livelihood. People out to take your heart, sometimes literally. I believe that there are no clear-cut right or wrong answers out on the street. You just have to stick to some basic code of conduct and hope everything works itself out. I believe that not all cops are the knights-in-shining-armor people would like them to be in this post-September 11th world. That's probably not the most fashionable thing to say right now, but that's what I believe. I believe that mostly good and decent men can be corrupted by that sense of power and authority. And since my father was a cop in West Philly for 20 years, I have a pretty fair basis for my beliefs.<br />Whether Denzel's performance was Oscar-worthy or not... I don't put much stock in the Academy Awards myself. Usually, the Academy's criteria and mine differ a great deal. But they are supposed to reward people for excellence in film, and on that basis, Denzel certainly did deserve it. You could see the subtle shifts in Alonzo's character from scene to scene. Now, I didn't believe the character was stereotypical. If anything could be construed as stereotypical, it was his street persona. But that was only a persona, only a part of the character. It was the glimpses of the good man still lurking inside that made the characterfresh and original. There isn't another actor working today that could've captured all those nuances. No Hopkins, no DeNiro, no Pacino, no Rush... nobody. He most definitely earned that Oscar, for what it's worth. And even if--IF--it was only a \\"freebie\\" for ignoring his tour-de-force performance as Malcolm X, it was certainly no different from Russell Crowe's situation last year, when he won for \\"Gladiator\\" after being passed over for \\"The Insider\\" a year before. And that reparation didn't even have the added wrinkle of any white actors having been ignored for 3 decades.<br />About the violence... I've never lived in LA. I've never even been off the East Coast, so I can't say I know how it is there. But I do know how it is here. This movie has no more violence in it than anything you might see on 52nd Street, or K & A, or 5th and Lehigh, or the Badlands, or even Broad and Olney, where I saw a crackhead jump on the hood of a man's car and promptly get the [stuff] beaten out of him. (If you live in Philly, or have ever lived here for an extended period, you know the areas I'm talking about.) It's not violent for the sake of violence, like other Hollywood movies. It's violent because it's a reflection of a certain lifestyle which happens to be very violent sometimes. That's what I believe. <br />Now I don't think that my opinion will change anybody's mind about this movie one way or the other, but maybe it'll help you see the other side of the argument. But if you haven't seen the movie, don't let this review or any other review sway you. Watch it with an open mind and judge for yourself.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is not just another war movie. <BR> I have seen \\"We were Soldiers...\\" twice on the big-screen. I own the soundtrack, book, and in about 2 months I will own the DVD.<BR> The book is much more personal but the movie is undeniably incredible.<BR> Mel Gibson ~outstanding~, Greg Kinnear ~excellent~, Sam Elliott ~flawless~. I knew that I had seen the actor playing Sergeant Major Basil Plumley before but until I saw the credits I didn't realize it was Sam Elliott. I believe Sam might have a shot at a nomination or an award.<BR> Madeleine Stowe, Keri Russell, and the rest of the ladies did a great job of showing the results of war at home.<br /> This movie is a tribute to our Vietnam Veterans who have gone without thanks for far too long. I hope this is the beginning to a new era for them.
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie came out on video a few months after my father died. I saw it at the Blockbuster, rented it and, needless to say, I cried like a baby. Having gained a few years' perspective and lost a bit of grief, I still like this movie just as much as when I first rented it (and bought it soon after). Even without all my emotional Samsonite, it stands on its own two feet as a great movie. The performances were excellent. The incomparable Andre Braugher, one of my dad's faves from &quot;Homicide&quot;, and Randy Quaid's kid brother wsn't too bad either :-). In defense of Jim Caviezel's supposedly &quot;wooden&quot; performance, he was playing the character exactly the way it should've been played. As an emotionally crippled man who's been shell-shocked by the horrible cards Fate has dealt him. I identified with his character very strongly when I first saw it. On a personal note, this movie kinda jumpstarted the healing process for me when I was feeling lost, and for that reason, this movie will always be on my shelf. Any format they decide to come up with: VHS, DVD, even if they decide to bring back Beta, there'll always be a place for &quot;Frequency&quot; in my collection.
0553260111|1.0|I feel like I must have tripped into \\"The Twilight Zone\\" when I read favorable reviews for \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"  This is the worst book I've ever actually finished.  I didn't finish it because I cared what happened, I finished it because I was stupid enough to spend [...] on this [...].  I haven't done an official count yet, but every character in the book combine to say \\"Oh [...]!\\" about 300 times.  The question \\"Why?\\" takes up about 1/3 of the book - and cheese and sap cover the rest.  The action is as overly dramatic as the romance, but the plot is just plain dumb.  Nothing frustrated me more while reading this book than discovering, with every chapter, that it was just getting worse.  Because of some unfortunate rift in the universe, Robert Ludlum is wealthy, but many people with actual talent are not.
B00005J6UP|4.0|Imagine that you are on a treasure hunt.  Your house is about to be wrecked, and you are afraid of being separated from your friends. Therefore, you have to find this treasure to pay for your house and tobe able to stay.  You're feeling a little depressed, but brave.  You will have to take an adventure to find the treasure and save the day. This what you will see if you watch &quot;The Goonies&quot;.<br /> In &quot;The Goonies&quot;, the super plot had lots of action.  The plot's obstacles were exciting.  The plot development made sense. Each time they escaped a new obstacle, they got another clue about the way to the treasure.  The climax was very awesome.  The denouement made the movie stop at a fantastic ending.  There were a lot of props and they were kind of scary, but in a good way.  A lot of the props were used as obstacles, and it made the movie more enjoyable.  The movie was humorous, too.  The characters did lots of funny things.  Overall, there was much to like about &quot;The Goonies&quot;.<br /> Even though we really enjoyed &quot;The Goonies&quot;, it had some flaws.  It had some words that were not appropriate and not really necessary.  There were a few small plot holes, although they weren't that noticeable.  Some scenes of the movie were pretty scary.  This movie would not be a good choice for children below the age of six.<br /> We recommend &quot;The Goonies&quot; for kids and adults.   Although there were flaws, it was a very good and exciting movie.  We hope you think &quot;The Goonies&quot; was a great movie, too.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is awesome!!  I can't stop listening to it!!  I was first introduced to John Mayer's music in an unlikely spot--my bio room.  My teacher would play his CD all the time and I got curious after hearing a lot of stuff that I liked, so I went out and bought the album.  All of the songs on the album are worthwhile and most are very relatable to my life.  John is so talented!!  He writes brilliantly crafted songs, is an amazing guitarist, and has a smooth and distinguishing voice.  <BR>Analysis of the songs:<br />1. No Such Thing: the 1st single off the album.  I really, really like this song and it was one of the initial reasons I bought the album.<br />2. Why Georgia: one of my favorites, if not my favorite.  The melody is great and the words are touching to me...I can relate well.<br />3. My Stupid Mouth: the other reason I bought &quot;Room For Squares&quot;.  Another one of my favorites.  I relate very well to the idea in this song of being self-conscious and wanting people to like you.<br />4. Your Body Is A Wonderland: Great song...another of my favorites.  Easy to sing along to and somewhat of a tenderness to it.<br />5. Neon:  Mayer's guitar skills show a lot in this one.  Also easy to sing along to...great song.<br />6. City Love: not my favorite on the album...but only because the others on the album are so good.  If this were on most other albums, it would be one of my favorites.  Good song.<br />7. 83: Very relatable...about wanting to go back to the past when things were easier...how true.  John Mayer's vocals sound really good in this one as well as the guitars.<br />8. 3x5: One of my favorites...Mayer's voice sounds extra smooth and the tune is very nice.  A lot going on in this song but it all blends nicely...it doesn't sound like too much is happening at once.<br />9. Love Song For No One: Alson very relatable...about not wanting to be alone anymore.  In my case, I understand this a lot because Mayer discusses being in his room writing about hypothetical lovers...which is something I do in my own songs until I find someone.<br />10. Back To You: One of my favorites...a lot of people's favorite.  Great melody and it's impossible not to sing along to.<br />11. Great Indoors: Touching.  A good song.<br />12. Not Myself: Another very good song.  A lot of people relate well to this one.<br />13. Null song...perhaps to avoid bad luck??<br />14. St. Patrick's Day: Another of my favorites (what can I say? I have a lot :) )  The tune is very nice and the guitar playing also shows itself a lot in this.  A combination of many sounds and instruments.  Great blend.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is a great album for someone of any musical taste and I have not met a single person who hasn't at least enjoyed the album.  Most people I have spoken to about the album have loved it.  John Mayer is amazing and you should DEFINITELY buy this album!!
B00005J6UP|4.0|What if your home were about to be torn down and turned into a golf course?  You are worried that you will never see your friends again.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could find some way to stop it? You decide to look for a treasure.  You look with your friends so that you will all be able to find the gold and stay together.  This is the main plot of &quot;The Goonies&quot;<br /> &quot;The Goonies&quot; was a great movie.  It had a simply great plot that will blow you away.  There were quite a few funny parts.  There were some amazing obstacles and you didn't know if the boys would get away past them.  The action was incredibly tense.  The climax was very exciting, and the denouement was a good relief.  The screenwriter did a terrific job with the screenplay.  The cast put a lot of effort into their performances.  Overall, we really enjoyed this movie.<br /> In spite of our enjoyment, there were some flaws with &quot;The Goonies&quot;.  We noticed a few small plot holes, but they weren't that bad.   Also, there was inappropriate language, and it just wasn't necessary.  Some of the humor was a little inappropriate, too.  This movie is scary in a bad way because things suddenly jump out at the characters.  We think that children under the age of six should not see &quot;The Goonies&quot;.<br /> We recommend &quot;The Goonies&quot; for kids and adults who like adventure movies. Even though it has flaws, we think it's a great movie.  We hope you enjoy this movie as much as we did.

B000065U1N|4.0|Many people have said &quot;oh this movie had no plot&quot;, or &quot;oh this movie had great action&quot;, but that's not what this movie is about.  You aren't supposed to watch this movie and then feel happy like you just watched a great comedy.  This movie portrays what war is really like.  After viewing this movie you should have a greater sense of respect for all of our soldiers that are fighting in any war.  This is not a &quot;Gladiator&quot; or &quot;Braveheart&quot;, this movie runs more along the lines of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Ewan McGregor, aka Obi Wan Kenobi, is SO AWESOME IN THIS FILM.  Personally, i didn't know he could sing until this came out, and i couldn't believe it!!!!! Ewan's voice is sooooooooo wonderful that you won't be able to stop listening (or at least i can't stop listening).  When he sings, the world listens.  The songs are great, and the lyrics are even better.  You won't believe your ears!
B00004XONN|4.0|Musically, this is definitely a step back from ok comp and the bends. This is partly because of the almost complete absence of guitarists Johnny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien. There are lots more keyboards and synthesizers, some of which are good, some of which are just strange, but which always fit Thom Yorke's smarmy vocals.<br />Lyrically, it's nothing better or worse than their previous work: occasionally insightful, (pseudo?)intellectual, often pretentious but always interesting.<br />Like many people, I think the standout tracks are Idioteque and Optimistic. However, the most underrated track on the album is the title song. Laden with a beautiful, soft piano, good drumming and fitting lyrics (we've got heads on sticks/ you've got ventriloquists), it is an excellent addition.<br />It is not an easily simplified album, as the lyrics are complex and metaphorical, and the musical layout for many of the songs is, well, different. After a few listens, though, you will begin to realize that although it is covered in obscurity, it is an excellent album
B00005RY7X|5.0|When I first saw the video for \\"Party Hard\\" I wasn't sure what to think. The band looked like a bunch of death-metallers. In front was a screaming, convulsing, energetic frontman thrashing around and screaming God-knows-what. However, the music was something else. The song sounded like something you'd hear at a football game. Only with the energy of the game and the crowd mixed in with the music. I had never heard a more energetic song in my life. The guitar is simple beyond belief, and the song structure was pretty straightforward. But something was amiss. Then I realized: You don't get this stuff anymore.<br />Andrew W.K. is not the 'savior of rock'. In fact, he's far from it. All the people reviewing I Get Wet and giving it 1 star, well, you're also missing the point. This guy is here to do one thing--and that is to have a good time. The lyrics are too childish for him to be actually serious. The music is too much spiked-up midtempo metal meeting 80's new wave to not be a rehash or a joke. Andrew W.K. released this CD as a tribute to good times. Note the laughable references to partying in his song titles. He is packing songs with his vocal energy and the catchiest heavy music around to awaken the primeval human instincts within everyone: to get up and dance. Every song has that irresistible hook to it.<br />On his website, there is even a Q+A section where fans can ask him questions about anything, from touring, to music, to Andrew W.K. himself. He replies to EACH ONE personally. His responses indicate he loves music and loves life. Do the same. Get the CD and awaken that need, that desire, that feeling, within you. It may be simple, and childish, but it's catchy, it's heavy, and it's real. Get Wet.
6304508611|5.0|Carrie<br />Do you remember High School as a time of ridicule and scorn? If so then Carrie is the movie for you. Based on Stephen Kings first novel published in 1974, \\"Carrie\\" is a relentless thriller that is filled with the kind of shocks missing from most of today's so called shockers. Carrie White (A superb Sissy Spacek who was Oscar Nominated for her performance) is a teenager attending High School. She lives with her religious fanatic mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie also receiving a well-deserved Oscar Nomination). Her mother slept with a man named Ralph White and after they married Margaret and Ralph tried not have sex with each other as she thought she was sinning against the Lord.  They did for a while abstain from the illicit act but one night she gave in to Ralph's urges and she had sex thus producing a child. Now Ralph is gone and Margaret is left to raise Carrie in her own way. Carrie has no friends at school and at home suffers scorn from her mother when she comes home one afternoon feeling terrible after having her first period in the girls change room during a shower after gym.  The other girls chant cruel words like \\" Plug it up\\" and throw tampons at her in utter disgust. After being spoken to by the teacher, She takes Carrie to the principles office where he decides to send her home for the day. Her Mother reacts by saying that it is the Lord's way of chastising her. She even calls Carries breasts \\"Dirty Pillows.\\" Carrie is upset that her mother never told her about puberty. Her mother simply shrugs it off and locks her daughter in a small closet where she is told to pray to the good lord and beg for forgiveness. At school one of Carries tormentors Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels upset at what happened and decides to coerce her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom as a sign of good will toward her. After much discussion he accepts and thus a date to the prom for Carrie is assured. As Carrie prepares for the biggest night of her life, one of her enemies plans retaliation against Carrie for getting her into serious trouble. Her boyfriend and his cohorts hatch a plan so sick and twisted that no one will ever forget it. Oh my did we forget to mention that Carrie has developed a power so strong and dangerous that nothing can stop her dangerous powers of telekinesis form unleashing a hellish fury of blood and carnage. What makes this 1976 classic so good is how well the filmmaker's have adapted king's excellent book of the same name. As well the direction By Brian De Palma (Mission Impossible) and the performances by the entire cast are magnificent. But most of all the movie has one of the best climaxes in film history.  It features a scene so scary and gory that it will scare the heck right of you. You have to see it to believe it.  Carrie has everything you could ask for in a horror movie. It is smart, scary and even funny. And it still holds up today as one of the best horror movies ever made. <BR>Review: ***** out of five
0312265859|4.0|As usual pace overall is good. Would like to see more of the Ranger character.  Morelli is now somewhat of a sobersides. I think Stephanie needs to progrss rather than stay in the same timewarp<br />Still a good buy
B00004XPQL|3.0|Final Destination <BR>As I sit down to write this review I am trying hard not to recall the events of recent tragedies in the skies. It seems such a shame that people died in such brutal fashion. Even though this is a review I can't help but think of all of those poor people. That aside this is a nifty little thriller that rises above the typical teen horror movie genre clich's that have ruined some horror movies (\\"Scream 3\\"). The movie tells the story of what happens when death comes a calling and you have to figure out when exactly it is coming to get you. Devon Sawa plays Alex a guy heading to France with his friends on a school trip. While on the plane Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to explode and after a major commotion is thrown off the plane along with some others. Well after you know what happens the survivors who were not on the plane find themselves the victim of Death as it comes a calling trying to kill them because as one strange character puts it \\"You can't cheat death\\". As the survivors die one by one Alex realizes that the killings are occurring the order of which they sat on the airplane. Now Alex must outwit death before it kills everyone including himself. The movie features allot of suspense and jolts to startle even the most fearless viewer. What bothers me about the film though is that the plot never really ends on a satisfactory level leaving us with questions that may never be answered until the unnecessary sequel (for which the film's climax sets up) Still the movie is a fairly good one if you just don't think about it too much too much.

0425098478|1.0|This is a must-read for anyone who is managed by someone else. I can't believe this is still popular and recommended as a guide for managing people. Its top-down philosophy (sort of a \\"manager knows best\\" approach) assumes that subordinates must be praised and punished based upon the manager's notion of what's right and wrong.<br />In an environment where professionals with different skill-sets work in teams to accomplish common goals, this book is more dangerous than helpful. So read this to protect yourself from anyone who manages you this way.  A much better alternative is \\"The 59-Second Employee\\" by Andre and Ward, if you need to know \\"how to stay one second ahead of your One-Minute manager\\".
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down<br />The sacrifices made in war are immeasurable. There are heroes that die fighting for the sake of our nation. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is the latest Hollywood movie to re create a tragic event in the history of America. Based on the book by Mark Bowden, it tells a story so tragic that one cannot forget the consequences of war or it's aftermath. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a moving tribute to a day in which lives were lost in a mission that was to have been simply a routine capture of a known criminal. However the terror that awaited the soldiers sent on this mission was something that they would never forget. Directed by Ridley Scott (\\"Alien\\") \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is the chilling look at war that a much bigger film like \\"Pearl Harbor\\" should have been. You won't find much sappiness in this picture. A star driven picture, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is an extremely well made movie. The war scenes are spectacular and riveting. You really are glued to the screen. Taken from a true event that happened in 1993 the film dramatizes what happens when a military raid goes disastrously wrong and lives are lost. 18 Americans lost their lives with 70 or more wounded and within days, president Bill Clinton Pulled out the troops. At that time is said that at least 300,000 Somalis had died of starvation. The Somali warlords were interested in protecting their turf and not feeding their people. The film's main purpose is to accurately as possible tell the story as it happened and to whom it happened. The plan seemed simple. The American's would stage a surprise raid by helicopter-borne troops, joined on the ground by forces, meeting a warlord's top lieutenants.  Intelligence claimed that they discovered the time and location of a meeting of lieutenants of the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. They hired a taxi with a black cross on the roof and the driver to park next to the building where the meeting will take place. That way they can guide the airborne troops, who will come down on ropes andwith the joint effort of ground forces surround the building and take prisoners. Trouble is that the enemy is much better equipped weapons wise and can call on reinforcements quickly also because they are better positioned. The mission was thought to be so straightforward that some troops left behind their canteens and night vision gear. They though they would return to base in mere hours. As we now know it didn't go as they planed. Enemy rockets took down two of the helicopters while the warlord's troops gathered quickly and surrounded the U.S. strongholds. Because of poor conditions and roadblocks a support convoy was prevented from approaching. No matter how much the American's gave the mission was still by all accounts a catastrophe. I wonder did the American's really think they were invincible?  To enjoy this movie we have to understand the people and their mission. The crew consists of Eversmann (Josh Hartnett, \\"Pearl Harbor\\") a staff sergeant in charge of one of the raids. He does a much better job here than he did in \\"Pearl Harbor\\". Grimes Ewan McGregor (\\"Moulin Rouge\\") is a ranger specialist who possesses great coffee making skills. Sanderson (William Fichtner, \\"Switch Back\\") is the rebellious soldier who is trying to do what he thinks is right. Garrison (Sam Shepard, \\"Country\\") is the General running the ill-fated mission. The movie is not interested in who the big stars are but rather showcasing the people as the soldiers fighting for a cause that some understand or think is justified. Some say that thanks to the training they went through the soldiers were able to defend themselves when they were left hi and dry. It is been said that this episode showed the American's weakened resolve towards terrorism, which was a precursor to the tragic events of September 11. Whether or not that is true I cannot say, but I can say that this movie is a riveting reminder of a day that no one will forget. Review: **** out of five
6304806426|5.0|...<br />This film is set around a time of World War, at the collapse of European imperialism, when the established thinking of the world was 'carve it up...first come first served...winner take all'. Events would ultimately precipitate a drastic change in this approach<br />The characters represented in this film's story have one overriding thing in common, they none of them recognise the borders between them...which is the underlying script here. Even the Bedouin tribes help the Hungarian Count they find in the desert, no questions asked, and it is only those characters in the film whose sole purpose is the propagation of demarcations and boundaries that distinguish the protagonists at war, (best shown by the British infantrymen of whom the unlucky count seeks aid) who perceive the 'them & us' mentality that needs must accompany historical conflicts<br />This is a film about the horrors of war told through the lives of some very different characters from very different places, some you'll like more than others, flawed and even despicable maybe but never threatening and never the architects of such destruction as is wrought about them<br />... (Indian Princes sat in the House of Lords, the British Parliament, making law for this country two centuries ago, Victoria had a Jewish Prime Minister..Disraeli...a very admired man...the enlightened are all quite integrated you know<br />... These are people and flawed like any of us. Like any of us, had they known their fate ...in hindsight...then they may have played their parts differently and so would we all. Again perfect pious people...look to yourselves.<br />The very fact that these professionals out in the desert were the inadvertent architects of yet more boundaries placed as drawn lines upon maps of the world, the harvest of such previous pennings they suffered from and the fruits of which we suffer still is beyond poignant...it is sublime irony.<br />A truly remarkable story about the everyday really. Beautifullydone throughout and by all.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|Cast Away <BR>The first thought I had after seeing this film was whether or not I fully understood all of what I had seen. Posing this question will undoubtedly offer no easy answers, which for a film like Cast Away is probably a good thing. Cast Away begins with Fed Ex Executive Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks in another stellar performance) explaining to his employee's that quote \\"We live by the clock\\". It's Christmas Eve and Chuck is enjoying a good meal with family and friends when his beeper rings and he finds himself forced to go out on a quick job. He tells his beautiful girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) that he will be home in time for new years celebrations. He promises. However a tragic plane crash into the ocean (which is very thrilling and realistic) changes all that. Now Chuck will no longer be living by the clock because he's now got all the time in the world. A trailer that gives away the entire movie ruined cast Away for many people. A spokes man for 20th Century Fox Entertainment said that Cast Away is movie about a man lost at sea and how he deals with coming home to world of change. Frankly I do not see it that way. I am a firm believer that people want to be surprised when they go to the movies. The only other quibble I have about the movie is the ending from which I think we the viewers are left with too many questions. Besides those problems I walked out of the theatre feeling really satisfied with what I had seen. The acting is top flight. The cinematography is excellent and the score is also a plus. One thing to mention to people is that there isn't allot of dialogue in the movie which may turn some people off. However, those people not too fussy may find this film truly riveting. For me it was a breathtaking experience.  Review: **** out of five
B000066JES|2.0|Manowar are always boasting how they are the heaviest, loudest and fastest band on the planet  (I guess they've never been to a Slayer show).  I knew there was a pretty good chance this would suck, as Manowar haven't really been able to capture the greatness of \\"Battle Hymns\\" or \\"Into Glory Ride\\" in their later material, but I hesitantly picked it up anyway. Somewhere after whose two great albums, they became obsessed with False Metal power ballads and stupid choir-type stuff.  In that respect, this album does not disappoint.  There's Eric Adams singing an opera tune, there's a rendition of \\"when Johnny comes marching home again\\" or something like that (I had to fast forward, I couldn't take it), and an Elvis cover.  Jeez, guys, that's real heavy!!  The only thing that's listenable on the whole thing is the last three or so tracks which do indeed live up to the tradition. But the problem is having to sit thru all the rubbish on the first half to get to the good stuff.  Sorry, guys, but in terms of heaviness, bands like Electric Wizard, Pungent Stench, and of course Slayer wipe you up.
B00005QDW1|1.0|First I must say that I loved No Doubt's &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. Their songs like &quot;Spider Webs&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot; simply amazed me. Then came &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot;. I sort of liked it but felt Gwen was kind of getting greedy with the spotlight and leaving the rest of the band out. Songs like &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; showed their slacking but not enough to really worry about. Now Gwen is bigger than ever. She's collaborated with big stars like Eve and Moby and is everywhere you look. I can see why the other members don't get along with her. And finally came this junk. Gwen with her big goofy mouth. Nearly every song on here seems repetitive with the chorus going over and over again. What happened to the more punky No Doubt in their first. I can't say this is a good record, not even a decent one. If you really like repetitive pop music where you can here only the lead singer's voice and a bit of music in the background this is exactly you. If you want the old (and better) No Doubt, then buy their old stuff.
0441003257|5.0|i should have seen it coming...<br />put two wacky british writers... and what do you get? only the most hilarious, totally wicked, astoundingly mind-boggling adventure ever to be written!<br />amazingly i've only known gaiman recently, since his book &quot;american gods&quot; made such a big hullabaloo; and i've only heard of pratchett and seen his books in the stores, never actually reading any of it. &quot;good omens&quot; is actually my first formal introduction to both of the writers, and if this book is any indication, it is good omens indeed...<br />the story of the coming of the anticrist is very important in christiandom, and i admit it takes a lot of imagination (and caustic humor) to make the ages-old prophesy work in such a bizarre setting. there's crawley (aka the snake-demon-thingie that tempted eve in eden) who drives around london in a 1926 bentley as the rep of hell and aziraphale (the angel and rep of heaven) who also happens to be a rare book dealer. much to their chagrin, they found that both actually *liked* each other and also *humans* in general! throw in a couple of bungling witchfinders, the important book called &quot;the nice and accurate prophesies of agnes nutter&quot;, her descendent (ditto a witch), a 'painted jezebel', some tibetan monks, the lost continent of atlantis, aliens, nuclear reactors and anything else you can find in the colorful landscape called the isle of britain, a good dose of cynical humor, stir together and you will get &quot;good omens&quot;.<br />never have i read anything quite close to this book. pratchett and gaiman are a great team, their ideas blending nicely to make such a complicated plot stay focused and eliminate the hair-tearing episodes that usually accompany books of a lesser pedigree. i can only shake my head at the wacky anecdotes and the portrayal of certain characters in amazement.<br />definitely one of the best books around... try not to give your neighbors a heart attack with your shouts of uncontrolled laughter while reading this book, okay?
0871137380|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie, which wasn't too bad. The beginning of the book seemed a little slow paced at first, but quickly picked up as I read more into it. The entire story comes off into one big report really and jumps from one character to the next, but other than that it's great to read in your spare time.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  If you like the single &quot;No such thing&quot; you'll love the whole album.  I highly recommend this buy.  It is fun, yet smooth, music that is enjoyable to many.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think that Avril Lavigne totally rocks. She writes her own music, plays the guitar, she sings, she sk8ts, and she is beautiful what more can you ask for. She does not care what people think about her and that's totally cool she is herselk. AVRIL totally rocks
0385335482|5.0|I found the book to be very funny, easy reading and it really gets you hooked.  Read it every second I had of free time.  I could really relate to Becky (specially in the compulsive shopping).  Definetely a pick me up when you are down.  I like the way she stands up for herself, does not let anyone run her over.  I definetely loved going through all the adventures not knowing what to expect.  I also loved the second book.  Hope there is a third one.
0195073401|5.0|This book has gained so much popularity and has been subject to reviews/critiques for quite a long time already. It is now used as a standard textbook/reference for a graduate level microeconomics course in almost any university around the world. One simply cannot do without this book since it contains so much stuff inside, not only microeconomics. As the other reviewers have noted, for someone to be able to learn from this book, he/she should have first studied mathematics/mathematical economics at the level of Sydsaeter/Hammond, Chiang, and Simon/Blume (the authors are arranged according to the level of mathematics in their corresponding textbooks).  For economics majors who want to pursue a Masters Degree in economics, it would be better to study mathematics/mathematical economics (perhaps on your own) as early as possible (say, at the start of your sophomore year), so that you would not have a difficult time at the Master's Level.  One more thing I'd like to add is that the solutions manual written by Chiaki Hara et al. is available at Oxford University Press, although I do not know if it is sold to everyone or only to instructors.

B00002Z88D|5.0|I've heard a lot of people bad-mouth Metallica for selling out over the later years of their career.  I don't agree.  All Metallica has done is kept up with the times.  They may not be writing songs like Whiplash and Seek And Destroy anymore, but the reason they don't is, the only people that want to hear stuff like that now, are the people who liked it back then!  This album is just plain incredible.  The quality of the recording is flawless and the reworks of the songs, enabling the integration of the orchestra are perfect.  Metallica has just gotten better with age.  I like the versions of the old songs much better on this album then on the originals.  They're just more mature.  Buy this album, it's a classic.  I never get tired of it...
0553381709|5.0|This is by far the best recent fantasy epic. I highly recommend all three, and I'll be buying the fourth as soon as it comes out.

B000065U1N|1.0|the whole time i watched this movie, i wanted to shut my eyes and just listen to the songs in the background....that is litterally how horrible this movie is. it lacks everything in a good movie but gore and gunfire, which is highly repetitive throughout the movie. the plot is simply too confusing, the characters unidentifiable and dislikable, all is just a mass of frames set together to make a seemingly &quot;good&quot; film, yet i was greatly dissapointed.
0446677450|1.0|A friend gave me this book and I read most of it.  The tone struck me as kind of odd and the book didn't seem to be saying very much.  From the people I have grown up with, I have seen that rich people's kids are almost as likely as those of poor people to be bad with money.  This goes against the hypothises of this not-very-convincing book.  I have since found out that the author fictionalized much of his story (I should have read the fine print).  If there was a rich dad, I suspect that his advise was to write self-help books and promote them like crazy.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album came as quite a surprise to me, with more complex song structures and much more of a progressive metal/rock feel to it than other Tool albums.  Since many other reviewers have already reviewed the album in-depth, song by song, I'll just give an overview of my impressions.  The songs are arranged in an incredible way, moving from loud/heavy chugging riffs to soft melodic beats.  Maynard's lyrics are intelligent as usual, and his voice shows greater range and depth than on Undertow or Aenima.  <br />This album definitely isn't for those with a short musical attention span, and it blows away the [terrible] nu-metal/pop-punk junk that has been selling so well recently.  I highly recommend it....possibly the best album of 2001.

0140288503|4.0|Bowden does a great job of giving you the details of the rangers and the Delta forces mission to capture or kill Aidid, a Somali warlord. You will learn the heroism and bravery of the men who fought in the streets of Somalia and gave their lives in a foreign land. Cool historical tidbits come up - like that there was only one black man in the outfit while they were in a black country - Somalia. Bowden will also describe the horors and just plain strangeness of war.<BR>To be a 5 star book, this book would have the delve into the politics of the war and the UN. This book is told from the soldier's perspective - \\"To not know why, but to do or die.\\" There is not enough background material in this book to fully understand why the US and UN were in Somalia and understand how things changed from a stricly humanitarium mission protecting convoys to a fully military action involving trying to nab the most powerful man in Somalia. Sure there is some cursory explanation, but not more than you would have gotten from reading the newspaper, and definitely not the level of detail that Bowden provided for the firefights! Surely he could have spared a couple of pages?<BR>Why is this important? Because ultimately while reading this book you start to wonder whether the US and UN screwed up in Somalia or not? Did they go to far? Was the switch from protecting convoys to taking down Aidid justified and practical? You will ask these questions after reading this book, but not find anwers here.
0345451325|5.0|this was one of the best books i have ever read in my life.  The game was awesome and the book was just as good. The plot was incredible and it never got boring.  One of the best things about the book was that even though i have beaten the game a couple of times, i didnt get to a part that i said &quot;this is boring, i learned all this in the game&quot;.  even people who know nothing about the game would enjoy it without confusion.  the only downside (hardly a problem) was that it skipped around a little. one chapter it was 20 years later than the last.still a great book!!

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Although marketed as a kids' movie, SHREK is one of those films with layers. (Much like an onion, or an ogre...) Our antihero is a reclusive green scary ogre (Shrek, voiced by the excellent Mike Myers) who lives in a swamp. His sidekick, an enthusiastic talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has decided that Shrek is his best friend. Shrek, unused to people trying to befriend him instead of running away in terror, reluctantly lets Donkey stay with him. When his swamp is invaded by an assortment of fairy-tale creatures, a deeply annoyed Shrek is determined to talk to Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who has evicted these creatures from Duloc. Unfortunately, the only person who's willing to accompany him on this journey is the ever-eager Donkey, and so they set off, Shrek regretting this decision every time Donkey opens his mouth. (\\"The trick is getting him to shut up,\\" he laments.)<br />On arriving in Duloc, Shrek finds himself caught in the middle of a competition of knights to see which one will earn the \\"right\\" to rescue a sleeping Princess Fiona from a castle. (\\"Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make,\\" the vertically-challenged Lord Farquaad, who wishes to marry her, tells them.) He ends up being chosen to go on this mission, and in return, he will get his swamp back.<br />In one of the \\"awww!\\" moments of the movie, Shrek manoeuvres Donkey across the rickety bridge to the castle by shaking it until Donkey makes his own way over, rather than turn back. It's a perfect example of how fond Shrek has become of his friend, although he would never admit it. On finding the princess, he unceremoniously drags her out of there. Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is not impressed. She was expecting a more romantic rescue, and is disappointed that the helmeted Shrek won't even recite an epic poem or a sonnet for her. (\\"A limerick?\\" she suggests in desperation.)<br />\\"You didn't slay the dragon??\\" she asks in horror as the fire-breathing monster comes after her and Shrek. As it turns out, though, the dragon is female, lonely and looking for love - which she finds in the form of Donkey. He isn't too pleased about this. \\"I'm an asthmatic!\\" he pleads.<br />As the three journey back to Duloc, Fiona grows past her initial horror at Shrek's appearance, while her lack of helplessness is shown as she successfully fights off an attacker. The Merry Men show up, of course, and do a bit of Riverdance. Shrek and Fiona blow up reptiles and hand them to one another, walking along romantically with their animal balloons. Donkey and Shrek's late-night conversations point out Shrek's hidden loneliness and isolation. \\"They judge me before they even know me,\\" he says sadly. And how could a beautiful princess like Fiona ever love such a hideous beast as him?<br />But the beauty of this film is that these misfits - the ugly ogre, the lonely dragon, the talking donkey, the cursed princess - suit each other perfectly. It plays with the stereotypical fairy tale characters (lord, ogre, princess) and turns them on their head, while giving us a happy ending that tells us that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and that love and friendship are wonderful things to have. So the moral of the story is . . . ogres are really lovely people, talking donkeys are fun to have around, and if you're an evil diminutive ruler of a kingdom, you might just get eaten by a dragon.Shrek. As it turns out, though, the dragon is female, lonely and looking for love - which she finds in the form of Donkey. He isn't too pleased about this. \\"I'm an asthmatic!\\" he pleads.<br />As the three journey back to Duloc, Fiona grows past her initial horror at Shrek's appearance, while her lack of helplessness is shown as she successfully fights off an attacker. The Merry Men show up, of course, and do a bit of Riverdance. Shrek and Fiona blow up reptiles and hand them to one another, walking along romantically with their animal balloons. Donkey and Shrek's late-night conversations point out Shrek's hidden loneliness and isolation. \\"They judge me before they even know me,\\" he says sadly. And how could a beautiful princess like Fiona ever love such a hideous beast as him?<br />But the beauty of this film is that these misfits - the ugly ogre, the lonely dragon, the talking donkey, the cursed princess - suit each other perfectly. It plays with the stereotypical fairy tale characters (lord, ogre, princess) and turns them on their head, while giving us a happy ending that tells us that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and that love and friendship are wonderful things to have. So the moral of the story is . . . ogres are really lovely people, talking donkeys are fun to have around, and if you're an evil diminutive ruler of a kingdom, you might just get eaten by a dragon.
B000002KGT|5.0|&quot;Rumours&quot; is one of the best selling records of all time... But, why? The answer is that this record from Fleetwood Mac contains 11 tracks that made this record a production with eleven classics. <BR> &quot;Don't Stop&quot; and &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; were major radio hits in terms of airplay. Everybody knows that songs. &quot;Dreams&quot; is one of my favourites songs of &quot;Rumours&quot;. It shows why Stevie Nicks is one of the best female voices in Rock history. The open track &quot;Second Hand News&quot; has a great Country touch, while &quot;The Chain&quot; is, probably, the best produced song of the record. &quot;Songbird&quot; is the major ballad of the album. Beautiful! &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is another highlight. An epic one...<BR> Globaly, &quot;Rumours&quot; is essential for any TRUE music fan because, like I said before, the 11 songs in it are classic ones. Superb!
B000000OE7|5.0|...quite frankly, so depressing at times that you'll be wondering why you love it so much. Because this is one of Queen's best albums, probably my favourite one. Every single song is stunning - the vocals (mostly Freddie, singing with such incredible power and emotion that it's hard to believe the majority of these songs were recorded just months before his death) are amazing, the music is fabulous. Two songs Freddie recorded on his solo album, Mr Bad Guy, appear on this CD (Made In Heaven, I Was Born To Love You), and with added background material from Roger, Brian and John, they really do improve. Heaven For Everyone, which was originally a song by The Cross with Freddie on vocals, is reworked into a Queen song, and is one of their best. Too Much Love Will Kill You was released as a solo single for Brian in the early '90s, but the Queen version is pretty damn good too.<br />The rest of the album consists of rock ballads at their best. The emotional Mother Love, the gospel-esque Let Me Live, the upbeat My Life Has Been Saved, the achingly beautiful A Winter's Tale, the powerful It's A Beautiful Day... all are exceptional tracks. You Don't Fool Me is a much-looked-down-upon dance track, but one I happen to enjoy.<br />And really, it gets less melancholy the fiftieth time you hear it...
B00004BZ0N|5.0|In the Punk scene we had two major names: The Sex Pistols and The Clash. If \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\"(1977) is, indeed, a revolutionary Punk album, a classic and a great record, \\"London Calling\\" is, problably, the masterpiece of Punk Rock music.<BR> From the self-titled track hit single \\"London Calling\\" to the last song \\"Train In Vain\\", The Clash offered a superb mix of styles beyond the basic Punk sound of the whole record. We have the \\"jazzy\\" \\"Jimmy Jazz\\", the great glamour-pop of \\"Hateful\\" or the close-to-Bowie \\"The Card Cheat\\", reggae titles like \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" and \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" or the reggae/ska sound of \\"Revolution Rock\\", simple Rock N'Roll in \\"Death Or Glory\\" or the pop-based \\"Lover's Rock\\". <BR> Above all that we have a superb production work by Guy Stevens and, of course, the pure Punk Rock interpretations that give to \\"London Calling\\" the title of \\"The greatest Punk record EVER\\". Don't miss this! Essential to any CD's collection...
B000000OAN|5.0|A tongue-in-cheek eclectic masterpiece which kicks off with the gloriously take-this-and-shove-it-where-the-sun-doesn't-shine 'tribute' to their ex-manager, \\"Death On Two Legs\\". After that we have the wonderfully bouncy \\"Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon\\" - sixty-seven seconds of pure fun. Roger Taylor takes over lead vocals for his ode to automobiles, \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\". Moving along, \\"You're My Best Friend\\" is a fabulous piano-driven, upbeat piece written by John Deacon. \\"'39\\" is one of my favourites from the album ('favourite being relative, of course) with Brian May discussing \\"the land that our grandchildren knew\\" as he strums on his guitar. And if someone would care to explain that one to me, please do, because it makes less sense than \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". ;) \\"Sweet Lady\\" is a fairly typical rock ballad, not much else to say about it. \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" is another one of those wonderfully fun songs. Be prepared for urges to jump up and tap-dance while beaming brightly to hit you as you listen to it. \\"The Prophet's Song\\" is arguably the best song here, an epic eight-minute tale of the end of the world. (But of course!) \\"Love Of My Life\\", in its original, pre-anthemic form, with gorgeous instrumental backing, is stunning. \\"Good Company\\" features Brian on vocals again - and the ukelele. As for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" - well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Six minutes of ballad/opera/rock with completely absurd lyrics. Hopefully 'Mama, just killed a man...' was a metaphor for something... 'I see a little silhouetto of a man...' The CD ends with \\"God Save The Queen\\" (instrumental) unless you count the unneccessary remixes that have been tacked on to the end of this edition, but I'd prefer not to. Superb work - recorded in '74, still amazing today.
6304240554|5.0|This movie is the best horror movie that i have ever seen and one of the best movies of any genre ever.  It is everything that I would want a sequel to be, 1)GOOD , 2)Original , 3)It surpasses the original &quot;Night&quot;(even though I still love this movie also).  Romero is the King of zombies.  Hail to the King, Baby!
B0000508U6|5.0|What can be added when a cd has over 360 reviews? Not much, but I really want to add my five stars because \\"Parachutes\\" is incredible. A friend told me I had to hear Coldplay and upon first listen I shrugged. Joyfully it's one of THOSE cd's where it opens up after repeated listenings and pulls you in. Sorry for the upcoming cliche but it is like a drug, a very good drug, that draws you into its world, a very beautiful world.
B000002GJ7|2.0|I purchased the vinyl version of this album long ago, when I was 15. I was very impressed by the guitar skills of Nuno Bettencourt, and I liked the anthemic &quot;More Than Words&quot;. Ten years after, I can safely say the album has lost most of its appeal: no one is interested anymore in faster-than-light guitar solos, and the metal-flavoured pop of these guys sounds quite silly, a useless heritage of 80s. Besides, in the same years a few really groundbreaking album surfaced (eg Pearl Jam's Ten, Nirvana's Nevermind) that showed where good rock music was heading, definitely away from this stuff. I consider Pornograffitti a mistake in my &quot;career&quot; as a listener.
B00003W8NO|5.0|I always told myself I preferred Toy Story 2, but when my sister finally got a copy of the first one, I sat down to watch it again - and was totally blown away.  Toy Story 2 is just a fun movie, with action and humour and great graphics, but this is actually pretty angsty.  Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen (was I the only one who was cheering and punching the air in the confrontation scene?) and Woody's jealousy is really well portrayed, not dumbed down at all.  The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch (although it'd be nice to have a more central female character.)  I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't buy this for the under-fives unless your child is a horror junkie.  My sister (who is five) still gets scared by the scenes in Sid's room and insists on someone watching the movie with her for that reason.  However, overall this is one of my favourite kid movies and well worth a watch however old you are.
B0000683U7|5.0|I love North By Northwest and was thrilled to be notified of a limited collectors edition.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. is the all time one in a life time hard rocker. Go out and buy his cd, or go to his site and check out his music selection. His latest single is &quot;she Is Beautiful&quot;, it's a great song , now GO and listen to it.
0380789035|1.0|I'm sorry to have the only negative review thus far, but I've got to be honest. \\"Epic\\" is a good word for this book, but it is not a good book.<br />There are too many characters, many different plots (which I  normally don't mind, but in this case I found them confusing), and the main \\"plot\\" was (in my mind) not a plot at all, but a mish-mash of stories about old gods from various parts of the world and how they had lost their power in today's world.<br />Some of the subplots (such as the murder mystery) and the inhabitants of the town of Lakeside were brief respites from the otherwise tiresome, dragged out, dark, and sad aspects of this book. I found myself not really caring about any of the \\"gods\\", and found the resolution of their \\"battle\\" anticlimactic. The main character's fate is comparable to Jesus dying for the benefit of others; then he is resurrected, but this event just doesn't make sense in the context of the book.<br />I would advise avoidance of this book unless you want something long, dreary, and scattered. Usually I take books I've read to the library for others to read. This one I am tempted to throw in the recycle bin.
B00004XONN|5.0|OK, listened to the album in it's entirety, and I'm confused. I can't really tell you if it's good or bad. I can't tell what music is. I pretty much lost everything I knew about music in this album. I don't know what it is. Have you noticed, that either people absolutely love this album, or they think it's a joke. Some people, you can tell - make certain music to either<BR>A. expose the population to it's stupidity to sell records (most commercial rap artists)<BR>B. simply to put pop music by using simplistic riffs and lyrics making them accesible (what they call selling-out)<BR>C. make music that is meaningful to them, the music that makes their ears ring (what we associate with the best music artists<BR>or and very rare...<BR>D. confuse you completely, make you think about yourself, your taste in music, leaving you completely rearranged.. <br />Radiohead leaves us with D. a lesson in psychology, the people who give this album 1's and 5's are two different types of people. How they seperated us?? Open-mindedness? Sanity? I have no idea - that's why you can only give this album a 1 (for not even being music) or a 5 (for its brilliance).. I choose 5
B0000009S3|5.0|I was searching through my parent's record collection one day, when I stumbled across a certain Frank Zappa album. I'd heard a bit about him, so I put it on. Now I generally listen to metal, but Zappa's guitar work and the trippiness of the music intrigued me. Now, the record has found its way to my room.<br />Take a moxture of rock, jazz and even a bit of funk and blues. Throw it all into lengthy improvisations and catchy yet serious melodies and you have Hot Rats. Willie The Pimp is definately my favourite song on the album. Not many people are capable of creating such lengthy guitar solos that never get boring. Captain Beefheart's vocals are also very cool on this track. They are also the only vocals on the album - it is mostly instrumental jamming music. This album is new for me in that it has inspired me to listen to other forms of music. Hot Rats is simply a fantastic album.<br />N.B. I am reviewing the original vynil version that I have in front of me now. The CD re-release is meant to have some significant changes like some additions and lengthening of songs and some different mixing in the sound. Something about Zappa feeling that no song was ever finished. Either way, buy it now!
B00000G3PA|1.0|In my life I have seen many a bad film but this is without question the absolute biggest load of garbage of film I have ever witnessed.  Only a bunch of scientifically ignorant ignoramuses would be entertained by this nonsense.  I cannot even begin to describe how bad this film is.  The producers should be thrown into exile.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne seems pretty generic when you first see her, I'll admit. You might not even think that much of \\"Complicated,\\" but what she's done with this album is prove that she is not your one-hit-wonder flash in the pan teeny-bopper in need of a proper tee-shirt like so many of the other choices out there right now.<br />Her songs range from things so simple and sentimental like \\"Nobody's Fool\\" with all its spoken parts to the crusty and calloused \\"Losing Grip.\\" Avril is able to flow with surprising ease between ferocious rock songs and softer pop rock such as \\"Complicated.\\"<br />My personal favorite song of Avril's is the generic and easily-applicable \\"Anything but Ordinary\\" which includes awesome lyrics like \\"Is it enough to love is enough to breathe?\\" and \\"sometimes I get so weird/I even freak myself out/I laugh myself to sleep it's my/lullaby.\\" <br />Another really beautiful song is \\"Tomorrow\\" (\\"Not today today today today today.. tomorrow will change\\") which is softly sung like a lullaby. <br />The album is perfect from \\"Losing Grip\\" right to the Matrix Mix of \\"complicated\\" (one of the best mixes in a long time, very similar to the song but more hard rock-edged). <br />I think this small-town Canadian skater-punk is really going to make it big. My prediction? Watch your back, Alanis!
0312265859|5.0|I normally wait until a book has been out at least a few weeks and then buy it used or at least reduced....Not Janet's books! I am always on the \\"list\\" to get my hands on them as soon as they are released. This latest adventure is not a disappointment. I prefer to think of Stephanie as more \\"mature\\" and \\"serious\\" rather than to think of this book as different and less fluffy than the author's previous books. I loved it...start to finish. Anyone that has not read the previous 7 books should start with One For The Money and read them in order so that they can fully appreciate all of the characters. All are present and accounted for in Hard Eight with the introduction of yet another wannabe bounty hunter. Janet has the sense of humor that keeps the faithful glued to the book from the time we sit down until we turn the last page. I hope she never tires of Stephanie because I know I won't. The only disappointment now is that I'll have to wait at least a year for book nine! Nobody makes me laugh out loud all through a book like Janet Evanovich does. Thank you!
6305428352|5.0|This movie never ceases to amaze me.  The plot is unique, the acting is superb, and the conflicts and resolutions are exceptional.  <BR>Richard Dreyfuss plays a musician named Glen Holland who becomes a music teacher in 1965 in order to make a decent living for his wife, who becomes pregnant.  He goes against his will, and he really hates the job at first because his style is too dry and the students were unresponsive.  There was simply no connection between the teacher and the students.  <br />However, Dreyfuss develops a teaching style built around how music can change one's life.  And this movie is about how each and every one of his students' lives were touched by Dreyfuss and his passion for music.  <BR>However, it is not all peaches and cream.  There are some very sad aspects to this movie.  Mr. Holland's first and only son is born deaf, which must was disappointing and heartbreaking for such a music fan as Mr. Holland.  Mr. Holland is faced with the challenge of teaching music to his deaf son.  I'm not going to give away the ending, but one moving part of this movieis the fact that even Mr. Holland's deaf son can understand the power of musicians like John Lennon.<BR>This movie is truly moving and has a powerful message regarding musics profound influence.  I recommend this movie to everybody; it is a fine piece of work.
6301640659|3.0|It's not hard to tell that Cruising is from the director of The French Connection and The Exorcist.  On the French Connection side of the cinematic coin, Cruising has the same documentary like and gritty, urban noir texture.  On the other it has The Exorcist's blunt edged shock tactics, shoving unsettling imagery in the viewers face at every opportunity to do so.<br />Body parts are found in the rivers around NYC while a serial killer is hacking up men that frequent hardcore S&M gay leather bars.  Desperate to close two unsavory cases (and not caring whether they are truly linked or not) top cop Paul Sorvino sends in rookie Al Pacino (who fits the victim profile) to lure the killer out of the shadows.  The case seems to have an effect on Pacino's character, but director William Friedkin is far too objective, letting the unsavory events unfold without allowing the viewer to become emotionally involved in them, so it all seems shock for shock's sake.  This movie was extremely controverisal when first released and (judging from the polarized reviews here) still packs a powerful and unnerving punch.  Recommended for those that want a dark and disturbing ride.
B00005OAIE|5.0|He did a fab job.  The lyrics are inventive and the tunes can't help but to find their way into your shower or your car.  Way to go, John!  It's great.  Enough said.
076783819X|4.0|As another reviewer suggested, this is a movie that should be watched twice in order to catch all the nuances, but you may not want to watch it a second time.  This is really strong stuff, especially after Sept. 11th and, before that, after the Oklahoma City bombing.  <br />It is, however, well produced and directed.  It grabs us from the first with the neighbor boy badly injured by 4th of July fireworks....something symbolic about that.  Along with college professor Jeff Bridges, we become better acquainted with the neighbors who reminded me, while there is no marked similarity between the two films, of Rosemary's neighbors in ROSEMARY'S BABY.<br />This is a thriller, and during the final 20 minutes appears to be leading to a predictable though exciting climax.  Don't be fooled, though.<br />However, it did leave me with a question.  As in many thrillers, the bad guys are right wing zealots.  Aren't there any dangerous liberals out there?
0385503954|5.0|One of the best of the year, hands down. McEwan has such a mastery of words: lyrical, evocative, beautiful. Each sentence is the craft of a master. He is able to evoke rich characters and to convey the nuances of unspoken feelings.<br />The story and structure raise the questions that for my money, make reading worthwhile: what is an author? what is fiction? how does an author deal with the immense pressure of having total control...of being \\"god\\"?<br />reviewers caution: This is not an \\"easy read\\". It challenges the reader and demands that the reader has an appreciation of language and the role of fiction. If you are that reader, this is your book. You won't be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Being a musician myself, I am very critical of the music I listen to.  I like a little bit of everything...from the heaviest metal, to progressive, to bluegrass, to soul soothing jazz.  A few fellow musicians mentioned this CD and I gave the title track a listen.  I was nothing short of AMAZED.  The rest of the CD is just as beautifully composed.  I haven't heard anything in years that could touch my ears the way this CD has.  If you want a CD that reaches inside and speaks to your heart and sooths your soul...look no father than Norah Jones.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I saw Paul in Washington DC on his Driving USA tour;I also received a bootleg copy of his concert in San Jose.  All in all, the concert was amazing.  I found it incredible to hear old Beatles numbers and Wings classics done onstage.  The songs at the concert which I wasn't too happy with were the ones off this new album.  Most of the songs on this album are the ROTTEN APPLE!  What's up with the counting on the title track?  And the repetitiveness of \\"Freedom\\"?  And the SLOW SONGS!!!  It was a big step down from Run Devil Run, and his concert at the Cavern Club in 1999.  I give the concert 5 stars, or even 10, but the album only about 3 (and that's being TOO NICE, but I love Paul.)  It is a very, very Lonely Road indeed, which leaves Paul as a Nowhere Man out in space.  I hope his next album is better.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone movie, called \\"The Wizard of Oz of Our Time,\\" by the \\"thumb's up\\" dudes, is a fantastic movie that stays painfully faithful to the book.<br />The DVD, however, is only slightly rewarding in the Extras department. Disc 1 contains the movie and the trailers (all three), and the source of my *ahem* unpleasant feelings is Disc 2.<br />Catching the Snitch is a maddening thing. You can also learn the philosophies of the four Hogwarts houses, but that's [not the case] if you have the book. \\"Interviews\\" is very interesting, and the Deleted Scenes are okay (loved the extra minutes of the Potions class). The DVD-ROM aspect of the thing is less than what I expected, but it's okay.<br />If you were expecting the DVD of the century... just watch the movie. The DVD's okay, but nothing special to me, and not enough to notch a full star off.
B00005ATQI|5.0|\\"The Shining\\" is simply not just another slasher film. I don't know about you, but I don't find it scary when a person is just chopped up out of nowhere. No, that's not scary at all. You have to build up suspense. And \\"The Shining\\" does that beautifully. One way it does it the music. This and Halloween have the most creepy musical score I've ever heard. The organ notes that if you think about it, sound like a child screaming, now that really chilled me. Another way is how nothing that scary happens almost through out the whole first half of the movie. Now, don't get me wrong. It's still utterly terrifying, and scary thing DO happen, just nothing to do with the dad, that much. It's the second half where he really goes \\"nuts\\". There's things that aren't ever really explained too, such as why why blood pours out of the elevator. Obviously from some unlucky victim of the past, but they never say who. There was way to much blood for it to be from the two little girls and their mom. And that just makes you wonder. This movie has some very memorable parts that went down in horror movie history. You can't say that about \\"I know what you did last summer\\" or any other amusing, but just not scary slashers. I mean, I can still freak out my friend by saying \\"Redrum!\\" in Tony's voice.
0792156684|5.0|Unlike Pearl Harbor, the love story in this picture works, mainly because of the two talented leading actors. And the movie as a whole is very good, extremely entertaining and heatbreaking in the end. Not to mention the technical aspects of the film, which are simply brilliant.
0312265859|5.0|As usual, this book was worth the wait and the first hardcover book I have bought this year that was not a huge diappointment (e.g. Cornwell's Isle of Dogs). There is the usual laugh out loud parts, and Grandma Mazur and Lula are their usual hilarious self. I must say, however, that I would have been deeply disappointed if Evanovich had not lived up to the deal with Ranger and Stephanie and she did not disappoint. Nevertheless, a few more details would have helped. After all, this is Ranger we are talking about! Even Vinnie did a bit of work this time, which was a nice surprise. Great stuff, but could have used another cliffhanger.

B000066JLO|5.0|This SACD version offers considerably improved sound quality  over any CD remastered versions (K-2, etc). The hiss you hear from CD and LP is virtually gone. This gives listeners greater clarity and depth in sound. Unfortunately, this makes the background noise of the audience with their chats, laughs and silverware more noticeable. This could be disturbing to seriously devoted Bill Evans fans, although Paul Motian, the only living member of the trio, has recently mentioned in the Swing Journal's interview that the chatty audience never bothered the trio in those days. DSD technology, which SACD is based, has ehabled us to get closer to the real thing beyond any level achived by CD technology. Considering the fact that the information captured in the original master tape 41 years ago is well within the CD specifications, it is a wonder that DSD technology can bring even greater sound quality. Paul Motian testifies that the trio's earlier performances during their two-week engagement was better than what was played on that last Sunday. If I had a time machine, I would go back with the latest DSD recording equipment and record the superior perforamnce of the previous Sunday. Can you imagine that Bill Evans Trio was only the warm up band for a chorus group that Sunday afternoon?
B000001E7V|5.0|Trip-hop is dead in 2002. Its brief streak of brilliance was spearheaded by a close succession of critically-acclaimed albums. But trip-hop has its formal limitations and there's only so much you can do with it before you fall into a blueprint. The sound and ideas at the time were novel, but like any good subgenre it was killed off by lesser copycats such as Sneaker Pimps and such. In retrospect, Tricky's \\"Maxinquaye\\" should be considered the heavy epitome of trip-hop's glory days. Massive Attack might have possessed a sheen sense of urban cool and Portishead pushed its emotional tortured diva game to its limits, but it was \\"Maxinquaye\\" that to this day remains a dark impenetrable release haunted by dark secrets. The album is preceeded by a eerie past - the death of Tricky's (b. Adrian Thaws) mother - which you can't deny that when deaths surround an album - it makes the album that much more three-dimensional (see Nirvana's \\"In Utero\\" or Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"Life After Death\\"). Morbid, but true. More than any other artist, Tricky has the ability to create an atmosphere out of scratch. On \\"Maxinquaye\\", the beats create a humid claustrophobic stench of gasoline and acid. It's been described as \\"post-apocalyptic\\" which is probably the most accurate single-word description - the music will invoke images of fallen buildings, shattered junk piles,dust curtains, and a sun that shines with the power of a dying flashlight through dense clouds. Pianos cry, flutes whistle, bells tinkle in a lonely wind, throbbing beats swell, and old souls lumber thorough the remains bemoaning some horrible tragedy. The songs themselves trudge slowly, with Tricky crawling through the dust and dirt, voice choked up with a chemical-induced rasp. Martine-Topley Bird offsets the ugliness, but even the gorgeous singing seems trapped within the living hell. There's not so much a conversation between Tricky and Martine as it just seems weird echoes of sexual tension. It's beauty in destruction - the way a gnarled black steel sculpture can seem ugly in its bent overburdned position yet all at once oddly disaffecting. This album puts hip-hop's samapedelic culture within a context - \\"Maxinquaye\\" invokes the past and casts them as ghosts amongst a barren world. Take a journey through Tricky's world where hell is around the corner and you might just find that the light is at the end of the tunnel.
B000066NW0|5.0|2 words. Avril rocks. Shes 17, sings, plays the guitar, and kicks butt. Her songs are meaningful, relatable, catchy, and not teen-sugar-bubble-gum-pop like most young singers these days. Her songs are relatable to teens everywhere, such as \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Unwanted\\", \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"Naked\\". She also mixes in a little of her own funk with rockin' tracks such as \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"My World\\". This is a definate must buy!

B000002GJS|5.0|Bryan Adams' Waking Up The Neighbours is arguably one of the best rock albums ever made, in history.  I'd just like to address the people that are putting this album down for its lyrics and criticizing Adams for working with production-god Mutt Lange: wake up!  This album sold 15 million copies worldwide, so I'd say you and others with your opinions are definitely the minority.  So what if the majority of the album's songs have a love-based theme?  People relate to love!  That's why this is such a great album.  You can relate to it.  Also, there are some great party tunes on here.  People like to have fun, and they can relate to love.  Duh!  But on the musical hand, Mutt Lange and Bryan made the music completely flawless.  It's impossible to find even one miniscule imperfection on any track.  And although nearly eighty minutes long, it is truly amazing that an artist can have a whopping fifteen tracks and have everyone be high-caliber.  When I first heard this I thought, this had to be a long album, because if it hadn't have been nearly eighty minutes, a much-needed song may have been left out.  Every one of these songs could have (and should have) been a radio smash.  The songs are incredible, BA's voice is magnificent, the band is superb, and Mutt Lange...well, he's just a god.  I consider it a sacrilege not to own this album!  I don't care who you are and what kind of music you like, just BUY IT!
B00003CXAR|5.0|Jaws is one of the few films that surpasses the novel from which it sprang.  Jaws is a very simple film, without the convoluted side-stories of the book.  A man-eating shark lurks off the beaches of a small island that depends on tourist dollars.  Three men set off in a boat to hunt down and kill the shark, but the sheer size of the animal makes it a struggle for survival.  The film works wonderfully, and is filled with great performances, great filming, and sure direction from Steven Spielberg.  <br />The film doesn't get the credit it deserves, in my opinion.  This is likely because it spawned a number of cut-rate sequels and imitators.  The filming and effects are superb, even by today's standards.  It is well-known that the mechanical shark did not work for most of the shoot, forcing Spielberg to film as a thriller where the shark is only glimpsed most of the time.  In fact, the film benefits from this method because by the time you actually see the shark, you are so immersed in the story that you don't notice the effect.<br />The human performances are consistently good.  The trio at the heart of the action are well cast and have great on-screen chemistry.  The supporting actors are also good.  The photography, much of it on the sea, gives a feeling of menace (beneath the waves) and isolation (one ship on the vast ocean).  And, of course, John William's Oscar-winning soundtrack is a masterpiece of mood.<br />Unfortunately, this DVD is not enough!  The picture and sound are as good as expected.  There is an hour-long documentary on the making of Jaws that is fun and informative.  However....  where's the director's commentary?  A film with as storied a history as this surely deserves a commentary from Spielberg and/or the producers.  There are a couple of cut scenes and outtakes on the disc, but they only fuel a desire for more, especially since the documentary has a number of clips that are not in the film or in the extra material on the DVD.  Therefore, I lookforward to an even better DVD sometime in the future.
0767830555|5.0|\\"Taxi Driver\\" is a classic, no matter what anyone says.  It's even considred one of the best 100 films of all time by the American Film Institute.  That alone says a lot, because a film donesn't reach that spot by accident.  This is a timely classic that continues to entertain people all around over and over again.<br />Directed by the great Martin Scorsese, this is the story about a man named, Travis Bickle.  He cannot sleep so he decides to be a taxi driver by night.  From his job he has seen the worst of the worst, and every day he seems to be losing his mind.  He turns psychotic every day and it only gets worse.  It eventually gets to the point where Travis wants to kill someone; anyone.  This is a terrifying glimpse into the darkest parts of city life that very few dare to explore.  This is the tale of one man who has had enough.<br />The movie is very well directed and written.  It is beautiful, dark, and haunting.  Disturbing as it may be, the story has such realism to it.  Robert De Niro outdoes himself in this film.  You can sense his drifting into madness so clear that it's scary.  They could have not achieved this goal if they had casted someone else for the role.<br />My favorite scene in the movie has to be when De Niro is talking to the secret service man.  It's so funny and yet so chilling at the same time.  And, of course, who can forget watching De Niro talking to himself in the mirror.  \\"You talkin' to ME?\\"<br />This new DVD version is beautiful.  The picture quality is outstanding, considering how old this film is, and that I once had the older version that just came out when DVDs were only getting started.  Lots of special features on this disk.  If you have the older version of this movie and you love this picture, I urge you to go and get this newer version of the DVD.  It is ten times better.<br />This is a classic, and no one can ever take that away.  However, keep in mind that since this is a classic, it does not mean that you will like the movie.  I cannot tell you if you will like it or not, and neither can anybody else.  Just because \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a classic didn't change the fact that I didn't like that movie.  If you are currious to see it, then rent it and see if you enjoy it.  Even if it turns out that you don't like it, I clearly doubt that this will be the worst rental you will choose.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a magnificent work of art, and it is film-making like you have never seen.

0375507507|4.0|As one might expect, a tale of a child growing up amid a vicious bush war in Africa would be interesting and this book is definately that.  Ms. Fuller lists the traumas of life in Rhodesia during the war including her parents warning her not to startle them or they might shoot her, a policeman warning her and other children not to pick up gaily decorated packages because they could be booby-trapped, and other harrowing tidbits.  However, in spite of everything, she and her family survived which is a testament to their strength of spirit.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in that period.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, this is possibly the best CD I have. Not only does this rockin chick have a totally rad voice, but I truly admire her song writing ability.  The lyrics to these songs are poignant and truly inspirational in a superficial teenager sort of way. <BR>I first heard her song \\"complicated\\" on MTV2 at like 6 in the morning and I listened to what she was singing about people being fake and I absolutely loved her.  I immediately joined her e-team and was one of the first people I know to have her CD. For anyone who is sick of Britney and Christina, this is the CD for you.  I am more of a punk rawk fan myself, with Greenday and Less Than Jake, and Catch 22 posters all over my room, but this CD is truly inspirational.  At 10.99 or less, this is the CD that everyone should own.  If you already own it than congratulations, you're one of the few people I consider cool.  The most wonderful thing about this CD is that all the songs sound different, it doesn't get monotonous like many other CD's I own.  Check out \\"Mobile\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" best damn songs on the CD.  Buy it, you'll love it.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|What can I say about 'Raging Bull'? It's my favorite movie of all time, the title character is played by my favorite actor of all time, and the director is my favorite director of all time.<BR>Any questions? :)<br />What a way to start out the 80s! The decade before you had the birth of such films like 'Mean Streets,' 'Taxi Driver,'(both directed by Marty Scorsese), 'The Deer Hunter,'(Cimino)'The Godfather (Parts 1 &amp; 2)and 'Apocalypse Now.'(all by Coppola).<br />..Then Marty comes back with a tour de force film that examines the trials and tribulations of an ordinary man's soul.<br />Robert De Niro, in his second Oscar-winning performance, portrays 1940s Bronx boxer, Jake La Motta. What's so interesing about this movie, as well as practically ALL of Scorsese's cinematic gems, is that here you have an ordinary man trying to live an ordinary life by his own standards but can't because the local hoods have other plans for him. He's in constant struggle of normalcy and answering to a 'higher' power.<BR>Jake La Motta is a lot like Charles Foster Kane (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;). He wins support and followers just as quickly as he loses them while losing those who loved him in the process.In essence, this film bears a lot of similarities with &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;<br />La Motta is a tragic figure, a victim of his own self-disgust and complexities. He fights in two rings: the actual boxing ring and the domestic ring that includes the two people he loves most, his brother Joey (Joe Pesci)and wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty). Because he keeps what he feels for both so close to the surface, it eventually erupts and drives them both away. At heart, La Motta is a closet romantic. He becomes smitten with a fifteen-year-old Vickie the first time he sees her and she becomes his trophy and ideal. In the scenes where Jake is looking at her, there is no sound. It's as if this young girl's presence takes Jake completely out of reality. It's amazing to watch scenes with Moriarty and De Niro. When he pines for her, when he meets her, marries her, and even when the marriage goes sour. <br />It's also absolutely mesmerizing to watch De Niro transform in front of the cameras. He goes from a promising boxer to a burnt-out has-been. De Niro gained over 60 pounds for the scenes later in the film. He still holds the world record for the most weight an actor has put on in preparation for a role. It's absolutely incredible. De Niro, you're the best there is and the best there ever will be! <br />Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci give flawless perfomances. They deservably won best supporting actor/actress nods for this film. It started Moriarty's career and reignited Pesci's.(You're awesome, Joe! :))The cinematography and editing is top-notch. It doesn't any better than this. And Marty...dearest Marty, you're a master! In my book, that best director Oscar should've gone to you years ago! You're number one!

It is one of my all time favorites and  give it all thumbs up. Betty Bacall steals the show as the vain,manipulative mother. I was mad when they tried to control Rose's eating habits and all. Then Mimi Rogers describing without no shame of her fantasies on the lunch line gets a kick out of me. IT is good
B000065VB9|5.0|Peter Gabriel's 3rd self-titled solo album from 1980, aka \\"PG3\\" or \\"Melting Face\\" (see cover art), finds Gabriel taking a walk on the darker side. It's an album with a more sinister, ominous feel to many of it's songs, and the results are simply unforgettable. This is a watershed work for the former Genesis singer, which foreshadows Gabriel's world music flavored albums that would follow. \\"PG3\\" still stands today as one of his best efforts (many fans name \\"PG3\\" as their favorite Gabriel album, and why not?). The dark opening track, the self-explanatory \\"Intruder,\\" sets up the album perfectly, with eerie thud-drumming from Gabriel's old friend Phil Collins, equally-eerie piano plucking by Gabriel himself, and the sound of wires being pulled and cut. \\"No Self Control\\" is another striking shade of black, perfectly conveying the helplessness of the song's character. After the sax solo \\"Start\\" comes the fabulous rocker \\"I Don't Remember,\\" arguably Gabriel's best song ever. It's a ferocious tune that lingers in the head long after the concluding guitar feedback fades off into the distance. \\"Family Snapshot\\" tells the powerful tale of a sniper, whose surprising motives are revealed at the song's end. Brilliant songs continue in the second half, including the memorable \\"Lead A Normal Life,\\" a haunting tune about isolation, and the Gabriel staple \\"Biko,\\" about murdered South African leader Steven Biko, which closes the album. Once again, Gabriel's singing, songwriting and musicianship can't be beat, and his cast of supporting players, including Collins, guitarists Robert Fripp & David Rhodes, bassist Tony Levin, drummer Jerry Marotta & singer Kate Bush brilliantly help Gabriel bring this extraordinary material to life.How hilarious then, that Peter Gabriel's original record label, Atlantic, actually dropped him from the label because, shockingly, they hated \\"PG3,\\" considering the album not only uncommercial, but bad! Thankfully, Gabriel stuck to his guns about the album, refusing to change a single note of it, and took it to Geffen Records instead, which became his new label. \\"PG3\\" was released to unanimous critical acclaim, and, as Peter Gabriel proudly says, Atlantic's regretted it ever since. Way to go, Pete. :-)using to change a single note of it, and took it to Geffen Records instead, which became his new label. \\"PG3\\" was released to unanimous critical acclaim, and, as Peter Gabriel proudly says, Atlantic's regretted it ever since.

0780626494|5.0|This is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever watched.  It is worth watching over and over.  Brendan Frasier is adorable as a young man raised by parents that were stuck in the Fifties.  A comical view of how &quot;our world&quot; would look to someone from the past.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I bought this after hearing \\"How You Remind Me\\" on the radio. I immediately fell in love with \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Too Bad\\", \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" and \\"Never Again\\". Of those four, \\"Too Bad\\" and \\"Never Again\\" have become singles. \\"Just For\\" I liked right away, being filled with the anger and bitterness that makes an awesome rock song. \\"Hangnail\\" has a really catchy chorus, and once you remember the whole thing it's great to sing along to. \\"Where Do I Hide\\" and \\"Money Bought\\" both have great choruses and background music, which is what I first liked \\"How You Remind Me\\" for, while \\"Good Times Gone\\" slows it down a little to form a more peaceful, guitar filled song that ends the album nicely.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I have to say after listening to it, that it would not have been a waste of money at full price. This album is exceptional. Listen to tracks like \\"Get Here\\", \\"Neon\\", and \\"The Great Indoors\\", and you'll know what I mean. It doesn't break any boundaries, but it is solid all the way through. And it is worth having in your collection. I can listen to it day after day.
B00003CXTG|1.0|For the most part, Pearl Harbor holds true to the actual events of that fateful day in 1941, but unfortunately the historical depiction takes a back seat to the typical love triangle that seems to be in fashion these days, as if, like Titanic, the historical recreation of a story to which most viewers already know the ending must have something of interest to draw people to the box office.<br /><br />Although the battle sequences of the actual attack on Ford Island are spectacular and seamless, I found laughable the idea that Ben Afleck and Josh Hartnett not only single-handedly drove off the first wave of Japanese warplanes, but also managed to find time to make it to one of the on-base hospitals to donate a couple of pints of blood for the wounded before dashing off to end their hectic day on the hull of the Arizona, assisting with the rescue efforts. Whew! I'm glad these guys were on our side!<br /><br />Alas, the film doesn't quite know what it is: a documentary of a &#34;day that will live in infamy&#34;, or a sappy love story set against a backdrop of WW II. Many WW II war buffs, not to mention veterans, will be disappointed, despite the film's accuracy; but then, this segment of the movie-going market is dwindling. Pearl Harbor seems geared toward young people who swoon over the two male co-stars and watch to find out which one wins the girl, with nary a care that the men who fought and died in this battle and all of the battles in WW II helped shape the world in the second half of the 20th century as well as the early part of the 21st century. For my money, Saving Private Ryan, although the story's premise was purely fiction, was a much better film because it more accurately depicted the horrors of war.<br /><br />Four stars for the attempt to accurately depict the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, but overall, one star for relegating our parent's 9/11 to the background of a tacky love triangle.

B00005J6SZ|3.0|This the record that launched Madonna.  And the hit songs Material Girl, Like A Virgin, Angel, and Dress You Up are all fairly catchy.  However, the rest of the material is a bit substandard.  Some flash, some emotion on Love Don't Live Here Anymore but little in terms of great lyrics for great instrumental definition.  And the last three songs really just fill up the album.<br />Definitely some good moments but I would settle for the Immaculate Collection when compiling Madonna recordings.
B000002GMT|4.0|It was so very long ago that I heard Abba for the first time.  Before disco, before New Wave, Abba was fresh, usually fun, pop music.  The fact that the two female lead singers were beautiful and the two male singers were attractive likely helped the group's popularity.<br />For about 8 years, 1974 to 1982, if Abba sang and released a song, it was almost instantly a hit.  It would be difficult to explain to someone today the popularity of the group, given that the music is very light and relatively simple by today's standards.  However, the fact remains that their music was catchy, and you could easily find yourself singing along.<br />This CD was a follow on to \\"Abba Gold\\", and I believe it is the better CD of the two.  \\"Abba Gold\\" was primarily filled with music that made it into the top 40, and most of that into the top 10, in either Great Britain, The United States, or Australia.  Often the music made it into the top in all three countries.  \\"More Abba Gold\\" includes the rest of Abba's released hit singles, and a number of other gems that were considered good examples of Abba's music.<br />Read the other reviewers for their picks.  Among my favorites are \\"Eagle\\", \\"The Visitors\\", \\"Our Last Summer\\", \\"I Wonder (Departure)\\", \\"Lovelight\\", \\"I Am the City\\", \\"Cassandra\\", \\"Under Attack\\", and \\"When All Is Said and Done\\".  After having listened to these songs you'll realize that most of these songs were not monster released hits, but are artistically and musically more satisfying than songs like \\"Dancing Queen\\" and \\"Waterloo\\".<br />The other songs on this CD are generally okay as well.  Certainly I have no objections to the selections on this CD.  I play it much more than \\"Abba Gold\\" because of the aforementioned selections, which tend to be more serious and more representative of what Abba was capable of performing.<br />If you like the pure pop sound of Abba, stick with \\"Abba Gold\\".  If you want a sampler of Abba that expands beyond the pop hits, then start with \\"More Abba Gold\\".  You may find that the music Abba was capable of producing entices you to buy their albums.<br />I am not prepared to comment on the sound quality of the reproduction.

However, my memory could be flawed as well.  If you see a reviewer comparing the original vinyl recordings and the CD version, and seems to be objective, listen to that reviewer.

B000056K04|5.0|I've been fan of the DMB since \\"Under the table and dreaming\\" cd, I've collected every cd, and I've been old enough to appreciate them since the beginning. I love this album just the same, but in it's own unique way. They are the only band I can say that I like every album of theirs for very different reasons. <BR>Fans of Dave Matthews who think this album is bad just can't open their minds. If you want the band to be the same with every album, then why listen to them? I'm sure that's not what attracted you to them to begin with. Every song on \\"EveryDay\\" is great, I think \\"I Did It\\" is the weakest, but \\"Fool To Think\\", with the 9/8 time signature in the chrous blows me away. <BR>This is a keeper for all lovers of music, it reaches to non-Dave Matthews fans, which is why a lot of Die-hards don't like it.<br />Too bad for them, because they are missing out!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is not your ordinary artist. She wrote her own music when others could do it for her. Avril talks about real subjects that go on in our everyday lives, although most of it is surrounded with teenagers in their everyday lives. She never worries about what other people think of her. Avril wasn't afraid to take the steps and try to reach stardom, even if it meant getting a couple of bumps on the way. Avril's song &quot;Complicated,&quot; to me is a song that tells a short story of a friendship that has gone wrong, where one friend decides to change the way they look to impress other people, and not be themselves instead. Her song &quot;Sk8er Boi,&quot; is a way to tell people not to judge other people by how they look and who you see them as, because one day they may turn out to be something more than what you had expected. Avril Lavigne's CD &quot;Let Go,&quot; is a CD for every teenager who is dealing with difficult choices in their lives, and need to hear that other people are going through the same situations, that they are not alone. To sum up this CD it's one of the best I've ever heard in my fourteen years of living. She is so down to earth and she's not afraid to show it either. Avril is one of the best artists I've ever heard and her CD is one that should be in everyone's CD collection.

B00005JKJA|1.0|This is as bad, if not worse than THE LOST HIGHWAY. It's hard to believe this scatological piece of so-called film noir came from the same man who made ERASERHEAD, THE ELEPHANT MAN, BLUE VELVET, WILD AT HEART, and THE STRAIGHT STORY. David Lynch has ultimately lost his edge when it comes to translating his nightmarish perception of reality. The slow paranoid timing, brooding music, and geek show symbolism is becoming self-indulgent and pretentious. Not to mention boring. That's right all you Lyncheads.....Boooorrrrriinnnggg. Just because it's paint splatters on a canvas doesn't make it great art.<br /><br />Robert Ebert says this is one of the best movies of the year and he still doesn't know what it means. What does that say about what he and other critics value about film as art? Should we immmediately elevate this film to importance because everyone says you have to see it twice to understand it? Because Roger Ebert and the other pseudo intelligentsia tell us how brilliant it is? Something about a dual identity? Who cares? The journey was tedious and full of holes. Yes, sometimes great art is not understood the first time and should be viewed again and reassessed. But I was squirming in my seat the first time. I'd rather have root canal than sit through this mess again. Yes, sometimes great art doesn't even have to have meaning.(and I assure you this film is meaningless) But for God's sake at least make it interesting. Watching this film was like watching paint dry. At times it was like watching a really bad television program. Twin Peaks it's not. I don't mind being challenged by convoluted writing, but I know when I'm being mentally masturbated.<br />David Lynch is not a good writer and needs to start optioning projects from The Writer's Guild. Discuss this in the coffee house amongst yourselves. Me......I'd rather watch L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, again. Or.... THE MAN WHO WASN&quot;T THERE, again. If you like stylishly bizarre film noir, see that instead. It's far superior. The Coen Brothers do David Lynch better than Lynch, who is quickly becoming a parody of himself. If you're reading this you're probably a Lynchead and pressing the NO button by now. But don't be fooled. The Emperor has no clothes. It's blaringly obvious that this man's vision is puerile.<br />I can see why this was scrapped as a Television Series. If Television Executives can smell the stink when the Movie Critics can't; head for the shelters you sheep, the world is coming to an end.<br />David Lynch died with punk rock. He's over. Lynch, I wasted 2 and half hours of my life and I want 'em back!! I'm tired of looking inside your head. It's empty. It's time to fill it up with something new.<br /><br />  Signed, a former Lynchead.erior. The Coen Brothers do David Lynch better than Lynch, who is quickly becoming a parody of himself.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Like many people who write reviews, I tend toward slight grade inflation. Every once in a while, I have to go back and down-grade a bunch of films I reviewed, because a great film comes along and shows me what is really possible given a talented cast and great script in the hands of a good director. This is such a film. The first two acts set up our expectations - a nervous young man with a troubled past and a lot of barely concealed anger is abused in various ways by both kids and adults. He tries to stay in control, but some darkness within makes him stop taking his anti-psychotic medication even as he tries vainly to fight off visions of \\"the end of the world\\", brought to him by the ghost of Bad Times Yet to Come in the form of a satanic-looking rabbit. Family and frinds just watch as our hero starts circling the bowl. When will he crack ? Then the bomb goes off and this film rockets to my \\"must buy\\" list. Not only did I not get a Columbine-style \\"gun battle\\" that the marketing for this film seemed to promise, I found I was in the middle of a supernatural thriller. I will not say much, except that subplots and strange phenomena abound, which are resolved in one of the best third acts I can recall. I waited in vain for the payoff we usually get with supernatural thrillers in which the \\"unspeakable evil\\" shows up and is actually quite speakable, if not outright lame. What I got was worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (\\"The Sixth Sense\\"). This remarkable achievement came not through trickery (hiding the Bad Thing) or cheats (making the Bad Thing invincible), but through not letting the the plot swallow the characters. Instead, the characters are drawn so well that when the Bad Thing reveals itself, (note: the Bad Thing is actually worse than anything we could have expected - it is classic in scope and scale) the characters act accordingly and the emotional payoff just rocks. The resolution of the film was so strong that while I watched it, I was taken in, but when I thinkback about the events early in the film in context of what I know comes later, I get serious chills. The DVD contains several fully-realized scenes and extensions of scenes in the film, some of which I wish were in the film or at least watchable as part of the main narrative. The commentary, what I heard of it (Blockbuster, two days on a new release is NOT enough!), was insightful, as well it might be given how much was going on in this film. See it, see it see it.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This and its companion album at San Quentin represent some of the best live music recordings I think anyone can own. Cash plays many of his signature tunes, but here they come across with energy, immediacy, and power. The live performance is captured brilliantly, right down to the &quot;water that came off of Luther's boots...&quot; Future wife June Carter and the Tennessee Three join Cash for a number of world-class tunes. Everyone whom I know that has heard this album has loved it.
B000001FA4|4.0|This is the favorite U2 album of many people I know, including one friend whose 5-star review inspired me to write my own review.  I love this album, but I also think it has some weak points.  &quot;Pride&quot; is an incredibly moving song, but it has been played and performed so much that its impact is diluted (sort of like U2's &quot;Free Bird&quot; or &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;).  &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot; is simply a waste of time, with six minutes of Bono just making up lyrics as he goes along (true!).  And the whole album sounds muddy at times: sonically, lyrically, and thematically.  It often seems like a test run for The Joshua Tree, with some ideas working, some not.<br />On the other hand, this is still U2 and this is one of their classic albums, with an atmospheric, ethereal (that word is badly overused in describing this album, but it's the most apt description) sound unlike any of their other albums.  &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; are great, evocative songs--musical journeys through desolate, wintry landscapes.  &quot;Bad&quot; is one of U2's absolute best songs, the harrowing sound of a spent, defeated human being struggling to stay afloat.  I even like &quot;Promenade&quot; and &quot;Fourth of July&quot;.  They strike some people as trifling little throwaways; to me they sound mysterious and haunting, like most of this album.<br />In short, this is truly an essential U2 album.  I have my reservations, but only because I believe the brilliance of War, Achtung Baby, and Zooropa outweighs the formidable strengths of this one.
B00003CXI1|4.0|When I first saw the film in the movies, I didn't like it. However, on seeing it again on DVD no less it actually isn't too bad. The cuts from the book were intelligent ones that did not detract from the story. Certainly it is quality above most films out there.
1570426457|5.0|This was definitely one of the best stories I've ever listened to. Great murder mystery with so many twists and turns that you don't know which way you are going, and just when you think it's all wrapped up it turns again. I will definitely be looking into more of the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly, because the character is so real, he has regular emotions and his dialogue is natural. I highly recommend this book whether it be audio or paper, get this one you won't be disappointed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw the ads for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; last summer, I was skeptic. I thought that it looked silly and that musicals were becoming outdated. After hearing about all of the acclaim and recognition it received, I gave it a chance -- an action I did not regret. The plot revolves around a courtesan in the Moulin Rouge and a bohemian writer who fall in love but a jealous duke, who holds the deeds to the brothel, is a barrier.<br />The movie really starts shining when the two lovebirds meet in a hilarious bedroom scene. The costumes, sets, and music are beautifully extravagant but the finale scene is the best, where the designers and art directors put most Las Vegas shows to shame. The story is touching and I hate to admit it but I almost cried in the end.<br />Non-believers will have no choice but to be impressed visually and to be affected emotionally. Those who are already fans will enjoy the extended music scenes and appease their curiousity regarding the minds and labour that went into the project. I highly recommend this for everyone.
B000050XEI|5.0|[look at the track list]!! I love this cd!!  I do admit it is a bit short, but that doesn't bug me!!  it's worth it!  I love wild child, a day without rain, and i just love it!!  However, if you like this cd, I can almost guarantee you'll like Watermark too!  I have a friend whom i recently went on a trip with, and we were talking about sailor moon and she started humming a version of \\"Orinoco Flow [sail away]\\" and said she heard it on the radio and couldn't get it out of her head and i said, \\"Oh, that's Enya!\\" She was listening to my DW/OR and Watermark cd's (The only ones i have) for the rest of the trip!!  I love enya's stuff, there's a song for every mood you're in, really music for everyone!!  A day w/o rain is similar to watermark...  both short, both with a couple similar songs...  really nice sounds, and on watermark, I love \\"Orinoco Flow\\" \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Storms in Africa {I and II}\\" !!  I would just buy the Cd, but if what everyone else is saying about length bugs you, rent it from the library first.
B000002N2Z|5.0|alltough korn gets all the credit deftones was also a great influence to a lot of nu-metalbands (cold, finch, glassjaw,etc.) and with their first major release they show why. The album immediately kicks off with an amazing riff so dark and yet so catchy. Camillo aka chino moreno is one of the best metal vocalist in the world (together with maynard keenan from tool and phil Anselmo from pantera)and is capable of writing great poetic lyrics (listen to the fantastic hidden track: fist). To me this is the second best nu-metalrelease available (after life is peachy). a must have for nu-metalfanatics
0385484518|5.0|This man with a brief time to live managed to accomplish more in that period of time than some people do after several decades. The book served as a reminder that life is quite short and can be cut off without warning. Regardless of whatever time remains even if brief can be productive, meaningful and fulfilling. <br />A little repetitive at times and somestimes boarded on preachy but conveyed an important message.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm a NY based jazz musician who listens to a lot of radio, and when I heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot; late at night on an alternative station, which I think was before the record really &quot;hit&quot;, I was really impressed- it has one of the best chorus hooks I've heard in a pop tune in a long time. So I bought the record, and I have to say- if CDs could wear out, my copy would be. The melodies really stick with me, and while maybe the lyrics aren't quite at the level yet of say, Joni Mitchell or something, give the kid a break- he's still in his 20s! I think it really is a terrific record, with truly little filler and some very memorable and heartfelt tunes. Also impeccably produced, with great guitar playing. And check out that nostalgic synth line on &quot;'83&quot;- it totally took me back to that time. Moreover, anyone who can write a line like &quot;one pair of candy lips and your bubblegum toungue&quot; is alright with me! I'd love to play with this guy.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus is still the funk rock band that we've come to know of, but this time Incubus turns the other face and shows its melodic and introspective side. This is evident in the less rock-ish songs scattered throughout the playlist, such as the brooding \\"11 Am\\" and the excellent acoustic of \\"Mexico\\". There is the tender love song \\"Echo\\" where Boyd sings beautifully. There is also the innovative \\"Just a Phase\\" that blends acoustic guitar, classical strings and subtle turntable tweaks. <br />Boyd¡¦s lyrics are reflective as usual: \\"Temporaryism has been the ¡¥Black Plague¡¦ and the ¡¥Jesus¡¦ of our age. I know I must sound opinionated, maybe biased and quite possibly jaded. But sooner than later they¡¦ll be throwing quarters at you on stage.\\" <br />Incubus has its sensitive side, but this doesn't mean it's gone entirely soft. These guys can still ROCK, as in with \\"Blood on the Ground\\", \\"Under My Umbrella\\" and \\"Have You Ever\\". The half-funk and half-melodic exuberance of \\"Nice to Know You\\" is addicting. Einziger and Lance create a powerful, kick-ass blend of guitars and bass in \\"Circles\\". Then there is the mind-blowing energy of ¡§Wish You Were Here¡¨. Last on the list is the exceptional ¡§Aqueous Transmission¡¨, which combines cool Middle Eastern strings with classical Western as well. The sound is lavish and soothing, very original. <br />Incubus obviously employs new tricks from its CD sleeve, which makes Morning View a quite impressive album. It has fresh guitar styles, tight rhythms and powerful lyrics that evoke feeling for each song. Boyd¡¦s more personal and mature songwriting ranges from blissful, brooding, to fierce. He writes like a poet and sings like¡K.a rock star, what else. However, the band must not be lumped together with the typical whining nu-metal gigs proliferating the music scene today. Incubus is proof that good guys can rock hard.
B00005JKL8|2.0|I'm trying to figure out what movie everyone else who reviewed this has seen, since it had to be different than the one I saw, which was extremely poor. If you are looking for a non-feasible, flashy, \\"try to make us feel patriotic movie,\\" this qualifies. But if you're looking for a quality movie without obvious loopholes, as I do, avoid it like the plague.<br />Owen Wilson's acting is sad. Not only is the character he plays the stereotypical \\"frustrated navy pilot trying to be a hot shot daredevil who turns out to be a hero in the end,\\" but his portrayl of the character only helps to emphasize why you hate those characters. And up until now, I did not think I could dislike any character Gene Hackman played, but this movie proved me wrong. Though I say so with no discredit to Hackman as the primary disease in this movie was the script itself.<br />There are a couple unique tactics the director takes with it, such as sudden pause frames and slow-motion takes. And the special efforts are of course great. But nothing could have saved this script. Overall, it's a very lackluster attempt, and I only gave it a two stars instead of one because Hollywood has done worse. If you want to see Hackman in a real Navy officer role, do yourself a favor and go with \\"Crimson Tide.\\"
B00003CXI1|3.0|The DVD movie is as expected, good all around and complete.  The 2nd DVD in the set - the one with the extra features, hidden scenes, etc is seriously defective.  It WILL LOCK UP your home dvd player every single time if you have one of a group of dvd player makes.  All Aiwa and Zenith at a minimum are affected by this.  More models out there as well.  So far, Warner Brothers has done NOTHING in the US though they have replaced the 2nd disk in the United Kingdom for some reason.  If you enter Olivanders wand shoppe and select any of the wand boxes, the dvd locks up and only a power off will allow you to exit and restart.  If you want it for the movie only and don't care about the 2nd disk, get it.  If you want to enjoy the added features, make sure you test someone elses copy on your DVD player BEFORE YOU BUY or wait to purchase the rental copies for less than full price later this year (2002).
B000001DTM|5.0|They weren't supposed to sound like this - swirling pounding dance-beat techno-pop. I wanted them to remain the angry young rebels who had first captured my imagination. This was all wrong - the sort of stuff cynically manufactured by bopper mavens to sucker screaming adolescents.<br />Then I listened to the songs, listened to the raw emotional force in Bono's lyrics, the straight-from-the-gut intensity in The Edge's guitar work, the compelling heartbeat and elemental thumping of Clayton's and Mullen's baseline and drums. And I realized that it was the furthest thing from a dance album. They had taken a musical form and transcended it. Sheer, mad, genius.<br />This album has so much going for it, it's hard to know where to begin. On the simplest level it has catchy tunes and countless hooks. Ignore the lyrics and you can sway to the seductive beat of the music. But these are not simple beats. There is a sophistication to the crafting of each song that just screams U2. More critically, the lyrics cannot be ignored. They get in your face and won't go away. And unlike the pap that most bands turn out, Bono's lyrics are invariably worthy. Here he gets personal and lays it all out. Love and irony, passion and rejection, he goes from the heights of ecstasy to the pits of despair, yet never descends into Hollywood angst or manufactured melodrama. He keeps it tight and spare, and in so doing, maintains his honesty. There's a yearning, searching quality to his voice that makes these songs among the most soulful he has ever recorded.<br />The rest of the boys match each lyrical phrase with equal musical deeds. This is music making on an altogether higher plane.<br />I know that everyone has a favourite song from this album. But frankly, I can't pick one out without feeling that I am doing an injustice to the others. Such balance speaks volumes for the quality of the whole. One of the best albums in the rock pantheon.
B000002HMH|5.0|Load has to be one of the greatest CD's I've ever listened to. But they have toned down alot from what they used to be and people call them sell-outs. That is such an outrageous comment. First of all if you were a true Metallica fan you would respect them for trying to put something out that would sell. Don't get me wrong they do sound softer but metal music in the 90's is much different than 80's metal and Metallica adapted to that change.People, they are just trying to make money and put something out that you like and trying to do both of those is very hard. So all in all a very good album. But if you are into 80's metal I would not recomend this album.
052594527X|4.0|This book is a quick, light read - I read it in one day - but it is nevertheless very beautiful. The writing is simple and the story fairly straightforward (that does not mean predictable or boring). One thing that I particularly liked is the way the author dealt with the problem of writing in the first person. How can the narrator think in the way the author wants to write? The author wants to tell you details about the light or the way someone looks, but that's often unnatural for the character narrating the story. In this case, Griet (the girl with the pearl earring) is herself sensitive to the aesthetic details of the world around her and so can naturally use the language of the author. And Chevalier allows the reader to see or hear these details with perfect clarity. On the very first page, for example, someone's voice is described as &quot;bright as polished brass&quot; and another's as &quot;low and dark like the wood of the table&quot;. Lovely, evocative descriptions - and it is perfectly believable that Griet would think in those terms.<br />Although I have seen the painting of the title reproduced many times, after reading the book, it is now one of my life goals to see the painting &quot;in the flesh&quot;. (After seeing the Girl with a Milk Jug in real life after years of seeing it in reproduction, I know it will not disappoint.) I'm sure this book excites many readers to discover or rediscover Vermeer's wonderful paintings.<br />I give the book four stars, not because there is anything *wrong* with it - it's just that it can't go in the same category as my absolute favourites such as by Pearl Buck or Thomas Hardy!
B00005OAIE|5.0|A friend sent me a copy of &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; (live) and at first I thought some of the lyrics were a bit cheesy (bubblegum tongue? come on) but I soon fell completely in love with the acoustic guitar and Mayer's soothing, romantic voice.  After downloading several of his songs from the Internet, I purchased the album, and have playing it on repeat ever since (about three months) and recommended it to all my friends.<br />Despite the fact that this album does have a pop appeal and some of the songs are played on radio stations alongside Britney Spears and N'sync, many of the songs have much deeper meanings (when you really listen to the lyrics).  On &quot;No Such Thing&quot; Mayer croons about being different for not following the typical college track of many young people, and &quot;...they read all the books but can't find the answers...&quot; It is a great song that many people can relate to as they find themselve struggling with the same questions and decisions.  &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; is a sweet, romantic song that has an amazing melody.  My other favorites on the album (although I like them all) include &quot;City Love&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot; and &quot;83&quot;<br />I'm a huge acoustic guitar fan, and hearing Mayer's music only makes me hungry for more of it.  The live songs I've downloaded are even better and I can't wait to see him in concert.  Get this album, you will love it... listen to the whole thing through, all of the songs are amazing.  Essential for any collection.
0345350499|5.0|This was a beautiful book. At times I cried my eyes out. This book tells the story of Morgaine, daughter of Igraine, who is destinied to sit in the Shrine of the Great Goddess as her High Priestess. It follows Morgaine through the Stages of Life ; Maiden, Mother, and finally Wise-Woman. The book is set in Arthurian Britain, when Christianity is growing and the ancient ways of Nature are being forgotten. Viviane, who is the first High Priestess of Ceridwen, is caught in a battle to keep the Ways of the Druids from vanishing from the world of men forever in to the World of Fairy. Viviane prophecizes the coming of a Great King who will unite the followers of Christ with the Old People of the Goddess, and save Britain form Saxon barbarians. This King is Arthur. Viviane takes Morgaine to be fostered on the Isle of Avalon to become a priestess of the Druid wisdom and the Great Goddess. After Morgaine had been initiated into the secrets of Avalon, she is sent by Viviane to play the Role of the Goddess in the Rites of Beltane. Contrary to what some may believe, this is an ancient shamanistic ritual to honor the life giving forces of the Divine, which is known in that day as the Great Goddess. Morgaine invokes into her self the Power of the Goddess, while Arthur (who is playing the role of the God) invokes into himself the Masculine Force of the Universe. They join in union and have a child. This is not incest in the way certain folk are thinking. In this ritual, as it says in the book, Morgaine and Arthur are only man and woman before the World Mother. This seems to be one of the most urking things in the book, but if ignorant folk would comprehend it right, then it wouldn't be. This book is not Anti-God. The message of this book is that Names are how we identify God. But that God is in all things and only Love and the Power that moves the whole of Creation. At the end of the book, Morgaine is in the Chapel of Mary on the Isle of Glastonbury, and she sees that all the Godsare one God, and that the Great Mother will never withdraw from the world, but will only change her form. It was very moving when Morgaine sat with the young Nun in training and prayed before the altar of the Holy Mother of Christ, and sees the Sacred Grail which had been moved form this world in the hands of her Mother, Igraine. This, as it says in the letter form Diana L. Paxson &quot;expresses a truth beyond dogma.&quot; I give this book 5 stars for its beauty and passion. It is truly a work of art.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Although I am a real sucker for Stevie's older stuff ie Edge of Seventeen, Stand Back, Stop Draggin my Heart Around, I found this CD to be refreshing.  A suprise Christmas gift, I had to warm up to the new stuff.  However I think that Stevie adapts to the new sounds that we hear today while simutaneously retaining her old sound and spirit that her listeners have grown to relish.  She keeps on rocking!
0425152251|5.0|i don't know why a bunch of people don't like this book, but i do. not only is it two stories in one, it also teaches the reader about the history of philosophy in an easy and enjoyable way, and makes the reader look at the world in a whole new way. this definantly deserves five stars. it should be ten stars on a five star scale.
0316776963|3.0|I read this book for my local bookclub, and I must say that if I had never read it in my lifetime, I don't think I ever would have missed it.  However, the essays were written well and most were funny.  I would be interested in reading a full-fledged novel if David Sedaris ever chose to write one.<br />Me Talk Pretty One Day is a book of autobiographical essays that tell the story of the author's childhood and the strange behavior of his parents in relation to jazz, food, dogs and so on.  Other essays talk about the many jobs taken on by Sedaris, the move to Paris with his boyfriend, Hugh, and his life living in a foreign country.  I laughed most of the time; however, the mediocre essays far outweighed the fabulous ones.  My favorites are Go Carolina, You Can't Kill the Rooster, The Youth in Asia, Big Boy, The Last Show, and I'll Eat What He's Wearing.  All the others had humor in them, but fell short of my own knee-slapping expectations.<br />Of course, this is just one opinion and mine may not be of the popular variety.  I am just the type of reader that enjoys novels more than short stories (or essays) and therefore did not find Me Talk Pretty One Day to be particularly fascinating.  I don't regret reading it, but the hype was too much for me.  Mr. Sedaris, call me when you have a novel out -- I'll be the first in line.
0451167716|1.0|This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. This was more than a little surprising since the Godfather is one of my favorite movies. This book is so bad it is hard to understand why Coppola decided to make the movie, although I am glad he did. The hackneyed prose and added attention to the Johnny Fontane character make for pure boredom. If you are contemplating reading this book, I suggest devoting your time to watching the movies instead. It takes about as much time to read this simplistic book as to watch the first two movies.
B000065U1N|1.0|I'm not reviewing the plot or filmography, just the issue that the 95+% of us that don't own HDTV's will have to put up with only seeing this on half the screen while running the risk of burning bands on the upper and lower portion of the screen. Did it have to be this way? No. The folks that made the Harry Potter DVD got it right...offers full screen that's just great. Only by refusing to buy half-arsed DVD's like this, will people that don't have HDTV's get the message across. And to those who are looking to buy HDTV soon...research carefully cause the standards they are a changin'....recent article in Business Week points out it's not ready for prime time.
B000002C1W|4.0|In 1985 Roger Waters decided he wanted to break from his contract with Pink Floyd manager Steve O' Rourke and forge ahead with his own solo career. He asked David Gilmour to back him on this, promising him he would give him the name Pink Floyd to use as he wished (not that it was his to give), threatening legal action otherwise--a threat he would soon follow through with. Like many people, Gilmour wasn't too keen on being threatened , so naturally he turned down Waters and went off to make a new Floyd record. The result is an album of great songs, rather than an album with a full blown concept. In fact it pretty much falls in step behind pre-Dark Side work in that way and seems to have satisfied most fans of the old Floyd who were getting really fed up with Roger's bleak view of the world (why is it our society tends to put more importance and relevance on pain and suffering than it does on peace and love?) So naturally when Gilmour wrote an album filled with his views on new beginnings with a positive slant (Leaning to Fly); the unholy concept of wishing for a little peace in the world (On the Turning Away); and the dreamlike observations of a certain band member adrift in his own world of gloom and doom (Yet Another Movie), people dismissed the work as being pointless. For many people apparently the point to life is to complain and to get pleasure from hearing others complain. If that's what is important to you, and not great music laced with poetic observations rather than straight forward venom flung at your ears unceasingly, then by all means avoid this record.
038533558X|5.0|A great book, even better than TELL NO ONE (a good book as well), with pages that kept me going and an ending that literally gave me goosebumps. <br />&quot;Brilliant&quot; isn't a word I use a lot. This book fits it, though. The dialog. The characters. The twists. It's all there.<br />If there were any justice in the publishing world (yeah right), this book would be at the top of the bestseller lists. Coben's writing blows other &quot;top authors&quot; away.

0316666343|1.0|The Lovely Bones was a huge disappointment and I am embarrassed to have fallen for the pre-release hype that led me to purchase it.

B000067IZ3|5.0|This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.<br />Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial and ignores all the standard warning circles, until it is nearly too late<br />Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance . He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican gweneral, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.<br />Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego business man, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold boodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!<br />There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.ng trial.

B00003CXA2|3.0|I agree with the reviewer below. this movie was okay and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" should've won. By the way, ANYBODY could've played the Forest Gump character, it's not a hard role to act out. Why would you make a movie about an idiot? It's way too overrated.
B0000024ZT|5.0|&quot;Greetings&quot; has always been my favorite Springsteen &quot;record&quot;, so I must disagree with some of the other reviews I've seen here. The lyrical quality of this album is not to be topped. You can just see the sages of the subway, riding their line of balance, holding on by just a thread, and feel the compression and pressure in the claustrophobic subway car in the vocal, which sounds like Bruce is struggling for breath until he's able to break &quot;out of that hole&quot; and can breathe again.<br />And the hopeful exhuberance of &quot;Does this bus stop at 82nd Street&quot; descends seemlessly into the despair of &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; so perfectly that for a long long time I considered them one song.<br />I highly recommend this album to any one who is a &quot;word person&quot;, or who wants to see the ancestoral roots of some of the characters found on later works.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Let me start by saying this, if you liked Play for the upbeat fast songs then you may not like &quot;18,&quot; but, if you enjoyed the slow jams as much as the fast ones of Play then 18 will be great for your money.  18 is a very melancholy record, however it is very beautiful.  I could see many classical music listeners liking this album because it is very easy to listen to, it does not contain a &quot;Machete&quot; type song like Play did.  In fact, the closest it gets to fast is the song &quot;Jam For the Ladies&quot; which is pretty mediocre when compared to the fast songs of Play.  But every other song on this album is great.  Just don't listen to this on a long drive that you need to stay awake because you won't, this is mean to soothe your soul and make you feel a little better about yourself, and possibly smile.
B000065U1N|3.0|When I saw &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; I found my self grimmacing and becoming unnerved. This film has THE most realistic battle scenes ever committed to film. They put everything into this one: graphic war scenes, confusion of war (you hardly knew where you were), friensdhip and comraderie, and the overall sense of sadness that this actually happened.<br />  The DVD is nothing to praise. All it has on it are talent files, trailers for &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;The One,&quot; and a production featurette! Great Film, Average DVD! Movie Grade: A (4 Stars); DVD Grade: C+ (3 Stars).
B00003CXB4|5.0|I have to disagree with the Amazon.com review of this title for young kids. My two year old has been watching it for ages and absolutely loves it. When she first got into it (when she was sick at the beginning of 2002), she had it on over and over again with no nightmares or any other problems. It is exciting, awe-inspiring and quite breathtaking at times. One of Disney best ever movies. Well done!
B00005YUNY|5.0|A quite superb DVD of a quite superb concert.

0061020680|5.0|\\"Mort\\" is the 4th Discworld novel.  Alternatively, it's the 1st in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  It's also the best of the series up to that point.  An excellent book with some of the best writing I've ever read.  In this book, Pratchett develops Death and transforms him from a flat, cameo-like persona to a recurring, fairly central, far-more-LIFE-like role.  Wonderful book.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Yes, it was hard to understand but I couldn't stop watching it --which is quite an achievement on Lynch's part, when you consider some of the difficulties here: <br />- the wrenching change in the story line, <br />- segments which make sense only after the film is over, or which seem to have been transplanted wholesale from a different film altogether, and<br />- the confusing dual identities of the two female leads.<br />All this is more than balanced by many fascinating (albeit puzzling and disjointed) scenes, much gorgeous imagery, and the sheer curiosity factor -- what does it all mean? Males in the audience are also well-rewarded by the classic beauty of Laura Harring, who like Helen of Troy possesses a face that could launch a thousand ships. <br />Was this really a legitimate effort at filmmaking? Or was it just an attempt to salvage something -- anything -- out of the rejected pilot, beefed up with some extra footage shot later, including a scorching lesbian love scene? I suppose I don't much care. But for those who do, see [...] (Entertainment Weekly's website) for one person's interesting and plausible explanation of the story line, some of which seems to have been arrived at by at least one contributor here.<br />I can't get the film out of my head, and can't wait to see it again. I'm sure it's coming soon in DVD format to my small room with no windows or doors.
0061020710|3.0|This is the first in Pratchett's Discworld series (one of the best series of books ever written).  As such, it's an absolute MUST READ for everyone.  Unfortunately, the book isn't one of the excellent ones in the series.  It's nowhere near being a bad book.  It's just not an excellent one.  It's OK.  Along with being the first in the whole series, this book is also the first in the Rincewind subseries (&#34;The Color of Magic,&#34; &#34;The Light Fantastic,&#34; &#34;Sourcery,&#34; &#34;Eric,&#34; &#34;Interesting Times,&#34; and &#34;The Last Continent&#34;).  Since Rincewind and the Luggage are recurring motifs in the series, you definitely have to read this.  I rate this book at an OK 3 stars out of 5 (the series, as a whole, would get 5 out of 5).
B00005U11Z|5.0|If I could give this Journey DVD 100 stars, I would! This may very well be the best DVD I have ever purchased. I collect mostly music-related DVDs instead of movie DVDs: concerts, rockumentaries, musicals,etc. Of the many I own, this one knocked me out! It's not just the sound quality which is superb, it is the feeling that you are right there at the concert with these masterful musicians. I had the oppourtunity to see the \\"new\\" Journey recently. I was apprehensive because I've been a fan of Journey since \\"Infinity.\\" Well, I now own their \\"Arrival\\" CD. For those who think there can not be a Journey without Steve Perry, you need to watch this DVD. Steve Augeri is awesome! Yes, we will always love Steve Perry, but let's give the new guy a break - and a listen! He is helping keep the Journey legacy alive! And, he does it with style and great vocal talent. I was in the second row to see Journey. Watching this DVD, I felt like I was in the second row again. What struck me about Journey when I saw them live was how they played to the audience. They connected with the audience. Another thing that impressed me was how nice they are. Yes, nice! (Of course, I am one of those who thinks the rock & rollers of my era - I'm 41 - are the true nice people, the good guys, the honest and down to earth men of the world - instead of the hypocritical evangelists and politicians. Musicians are among the best people who walk the face of the earth!) At the concert I attended, sitting in the front were two young girls, probably around 13 years old, with their mothers - new Journey fans were these youngsters! Steve Augeri and Ross Valory made it a point to smile and wave at them periodically as well as relate to other audience members. Valory is also quite the comedian on stage! Being in the second row, I could witness all of these things. When it came time to give the drumstick to a lucky audience member - Steve made sure he walked over to the side of the stage where the children were, leanover painstakingly and give the screaming new, young Journey fans the beloved prize. I thought, \\"Wow! What a nice guy!\\" Later, he stood on the side of the stage signing autographs and shaking hands in the middle of the concert during Journey's instrumental \\"Kohoutek.\\" I'd never seen this before and was quite impressed! Nice guys - absoutely! And, this also comes across on the Journey 2001 DVD as well as how well they get along as a group and how much fun they have playing together. The \\"new\\" Steve, originally from the band \\"Tall Stories\\" is obviously humbled and thrilled (and, for the most part, says so) to be with the incredible Ross Valory, Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon. Let's face it! Neal Schon is a very underrated guitarist. Schon rocks! He ranks up there with the greats like Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Peter Frampton. The man sets that guitar on fire! And Cain - well, he is up there with keyboard players like Elton John and Billy Joel. He is absolute perfection on keyboards. You should also check out their solo, instrumental recordings. Such talent assembled on one stage and it is all captured on this DVD. If you love Journey - don't think twice. Just buy this DVD, crank it up and have a concert in your living room. During the concert I saw, Journey did a salute to America. Yes, it was after the horrible events of Sept. 11th. It was probably the most moving tribute I'd seen. Chills went through me. I had those same chills watching this video. I feel music very deeply. I feel the music of Journey way down deep in the inner core of my being. If you are not moved when you hear (and see) their live rendition of \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" then I don't know what is wrong with you. I own many concert videos and DVDs. This is my favorite! Incidentally, I saw Journey in a small arena in a small town - Poplar Bluff, Missouri. The rock ensemble didn't seem to mind that they were playing for a smaller audience than usual. Not at all! They played for us as if we were anaudience of 50,000 instead of 5,000. Great showmen! Great music! Great DVD!
0446677450|4.0|This book is not as detailed as I had hoped, not surprising though since it would give away too many secrets and not allow for future books to be sold.  I mean really, the guy is making his &quot;millions&quot; off of all of us buying his books on how to get rich!
B00005K3OT|5.0|I was in France during the winter months and loved it.... the movie depicts the winds and landscape wonderfully.  It's a great reminder of my trip.  I wish though that you could select French as a spoken language on the DVD.
B000065U1N|3.0|Black Hawk Down is not an awe-inspiring movie, as the title indicates.Overall, its confusing. The fighting is random and most of the events shown in the movie never really happend. Amazingly, the ending was so abrupt. The American Forces retreated and this was not actually shown in the movie. International assistance such as the Pakistani support for the U.S was extremely eppigrammatic in the movie, amid the fact that it wasnt.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is not a movie for everyone.  Its nonlinear plot is not a series of flashbacks that accompany a \\"time forward\\" plot.  It traces the actions of the protagonist- Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential} back to the beginning of his present state.<br />Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix) plays the quintessential cypher personality of a manipulator as he guides Leonard to a heart stopping climax.  Or are we following the fantasy of a damaged brain confabulating to survive?  Leonard is driven by revenge - he believes.  His drive and discipline are perverted by Teddy (Pantoliano), by the beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix), even the manager of the motel he uses as his home base.<br />Leonard's loss of short term memory exposes a disturbing riddle of reality.  Do we create our experiences?  Or do we follow our memories to 'paint' our existence?<br />As Leonard states early in the movie, memories are notoriously innacurate.<br />So where does this leave Leonard?<br />Oustanding performances and edge-of-your-seat suspense spin Memento into a memorable experience.
0425152251|5.0|i don't know why a bunch of people don't like this book and give it any less than the five stars it deserves. this is my favorite book ever. not only is it TWO stories in one, it also teaches the reader about the history of philosophy in an EASY and ENJOYABLE way and makes the reader look at the world in whole new ways!... what other novel does that?...
B00005JKNF|1.0|This movie just ends up being nothing. It's a comedy that isn't funny, a drama that isn't dramatic, and a mystery that isn't that mysterious. I jsut felt like I had wasted 2 hours when I left the theater, and thats never a good sign.
B000002U8G|4.0|This is not the best pink floyd but it is so much better than, say, Troy Nilsson, who is remarkably obvious in his playing and who can not really do what he wants.  Meddle is 4 guys doing what they CAN rather than trying to do what they can't.  An amateur like Troy Nilsson, for instance, is trying to be a pro when he clearly is not.  Meddle is the real deal!
0553296981|5.0|Like many, I read this book in elementary school. It was one of the most moving, powerful experiences I've ever had. We all know the story by now. Anne Frank and her family are Jews hiding from the Nazis during World War II. The book is Anne's diary about her time in hiding.<br />Every detail of Anne's experience rang true -- there were no doubts in my mind as I read it that this truly was Anne's diary, even though I knew parts of it were missing. The way she wrote spoke to me as a human being in general, but as a 12 year old it was amazing to me to realize that this person who was going through such an awful ordeal also had some of the same feelings, experiences, emotions, worries, hopes, and dreams that I did. Anne Frank's diary encouraged me to start keeping my own. This is obviously a book about World War II, but it's also about adolescence, the human condition, families, and writing. It's possibly one of the most important books of the 20th century.
B000066NW0|5.0|I just bought this cd two days ago and I have been listening to it non-stop. It's just amazing how personal all the songs are, but I can still connect to all of them. I'm completely hooked to Avril, she's probably the most talented new artist I've seen in a really long time.
B000002KN8|3.0|If you are a devoted Depeche or electronica fan, then you need this, to complete your understanding.  If you need to revisit your roots and you like the music that beat the soundtrack to the 1980's, then you need this.  If you're outside of those categories, then this is a perfectly good example of the way good synth-pop was made, back in the days before people took the mick out of the casio keyboard sound, and it was damned good synth-pop too.  Unfortunately for it, but fortunately for the four (now three) boys from Basildon, it's pretty much been eclipsed by the standard of work they've since produced.  That doesn't make it a bad album though.
6305971099|4.0|Me again. Can't stop writing these things. Anyway I agree that this is one of the best Halloween movies. I mean what the hell were they thinking when they completely went off topic about Michael. He's what started the whole flick!<br />Plus I'm glad he's chasing someone other then Jamie. Don't get me wrong, she's the Queen of Scream Queens, but it's always fun to add other characters.
014028009X|4.0|After moping around the house sick during the long-awaited 4-day weekend, I decided to get myself some reading to lift my depressed spirits. This book is just what the doctor ordered. \\"Bridget\\" is a very quick read; you can polish it off in a day easily and you'll be laughing out loud the entire time. I kept expecting the neighbors to drop by and say \\"What are you doing in there?!\\"<br />Sadly, this book rings true for too many females, regardless of age or nationality. Discontentment with work, men, body image, and family are obviously universal. Misery loves company and \\"Bridget\\" proves it. Nothing lifts the spirits like realizing that you're no more (or less) neurotic than most everyone else. \\"The therapeutic value of a [reality check] is without parallel.\\" Buy this book!
B000065U1N|5.0|We watched this movie on a summer afternoon, but it seemed like we were transported into the middle of the battle.  Very realistic tension (e.g. trying to save the soldier with the femoral artery leg wound).  From a technical perspective, great realism with helicopters, RPGs, machine gun fire, etc.<br />Some comic relief, especially early on (of course).  Not a movie for the squeamish.  <br />Overall, very good.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Hopefully this bubblegum garbage will end soon. .... The music is all heavily over produced, her voice is over produced, the lyrics are horrible. She can't sing....
0930289455|5.0|This is by far the best Joker story in the entire world.  It gives the reason to why Barbara Gordon is in a wheelchair now, and it shows some of the Joker's past.  By far, a great great addition to your Batman Collection.
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate SG-1 has been among the highest rated and most viewed sci-fi shows on televison.  On Showtime, on Sci-fi, or on some local channel like FOX, millions of viewers have tuned in each week to follow the adventures of sci-fi greatest heros.  They're not great because they have advanced technology or they're futuristic.  They're great, because they are ordinary and they exist now, and deal with today's problems.  This is a convention that sci-fi fans have not seen properly utilized in a long time.  In Stargate SG-1, the environments, the conflicts, are as new and exciting to the characters as they are to the audience.  This fact, combined with great story telling, numerous extensive story arcs, and an awesome cast, provides for a powerful and original series.<br />However, for people like me, who were unfortunate enough to get hooked on the series pretty late after the premier date (try a season and a half too late) many questions remain unanswered, especially on the several-episode-long story arcs.  That's why owning these early seasons is so great.  In a show where one episode like 'The Fifth Race' can make a huge difference in the rest of the series, being able to go back on my own time and see any missed episodes is the greatest thing since sliced bread and recording VCRs.<br />Anyway, Season One may have introduced the characters, but Season Two is where most of the extended plot lines begin, such as the Tocrah.  If you're like me and you missed a few, okay a lot, of the old episodes, this DVD pack is the ultimate place to catch up.  And if you've never seen an episode, well then, I say buy the packs, sit back and enjoy the ride.  I promise you won't regret it.
B00000IAU3|4.0|This CD is really good if you like listening to the words of a song the beat could be better thow.  As I said you really have to lisson to the words. I do recomend the CD to anyone tho isn't a buble gum pop fan and enjoys poetry.
B000002J1S|5.0|I listened to this album when I was in high school in the UK, when I was going through my prog rock phase (Tales of Topographic Oceans etc.) and at the time thought it a little samey - recently started to listen to it again, and although parts of it are a little corny and don't seem to fit in with the general Odyssey of Rael, it is a compelling work. A wonderful combination of good tunes and great lyrics, especially certain individual lines which are close to poetry at times.
0060090367|4.0|Claire's husband James has just left her for another woman. Claire is left stunned and humiliated and now has the responsibility of raising her newborn child by herself. She leaves London for Dublin to stay with her family. A new man, the beautiful Adam, enters her life and James tries to weasel his way in. &quot;Watermelon&quot; is funny, witty, emotional and touching. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you will cheer for Claire! Keyes cleverly takes the reader through the emotional stages of breakup: Denial, Despair, Anger, Nostalgia and Acceptance. There are a few minor details in this novel that conflict with each other and some circumstances seem too good to be true, yet this book is a wonderful example of good British comedy. If you liked Bridget Jones' Diary (Fielding) you will most assuredly enjoy Marian Keyes &quot;Watermelon&quot;.
B00005R2M3|4.0|When you hear a Latin artist has released an English language album, you assume there will be plenty of bland love lyrics set to the kind of music you hear piped into your local Chi-Chi's Mexican Restaurant, where you try to enjoy a Cancun Combination Platter while trumpets blare in your ears.<br />Sexy Shakira blazes a pretty impressive pop album, with minor missteps. She used an Spanish/English dictionary and a thesaurus, and while some of the the songs are a little awkward, Shakira throws in so much ear candy, you will not care. Her album title refers to love being a jumble of so many different things, like a bunch of clothes in a washer. Song by song:<br />1. Objection (Tango)<BR>Angry, kick butt song suffers from goofy tango opening that reminded me of Weird Al Yankovic, before the whole thing went into B-52s territory. Cool midway rap smacks me of T'Pau.<br />2. Underneath Your Clothes<BR>A song about looking further than skin deep, Shakira's voice is great and raw. Cool opening line: \\"You're a song/ Written by the hands of God\\".<br />3. Whenever, Wherever<BR>Current radio hit about obsessive love is a great dance track, with English lyrics cowritten by Gloria Estefan.<br />4. Rules<BR>A Go-Go's riff kicks off a pure pop song with such an '80's feel, I felt a longing for \\"Night Tracks\\" and Yuri Andropov!<br />5. The One<BR>Another heartfelt love song, which turns into a hard rock ballad part way through. A great balance, though, with Shakira's voice making the song.<br />6. Ready for the Good Times<BR>Shakira goes '70's disco in funky dance song. She has found love, and will never let go. Where else will you hear a reference to seven legged cats?!<br />7. Fool<BR>Sad lyrics about hating a mate so much, the pain becomes pleasure, made more effective by a folk opening breaking into another power ballad.<br />8. Te Dejo Madrid<BR>Spanish language song is not translated in the liner notes, but sounds incredible!<br />9. Poem to a Horse<BR>Weird title to a song about trying to reach someone completely wrapped up in themselves. Best line: \\"You keep on aiming for the top/ And quit before you sweat a drop\\".<br />10. Que Me Quedes Tu<BR>Another Spanish language pop song that sounds great, but I do not remember enough of Senora Playa's high school Spanish class to know what Shakira is singing.<br />11. Eyes Like Yours<BR>Smoldering lyrics about traveling the world to find the title cranial organs fits well with Asian Indian type instruments. George Harrison would be proud.<br />12. Suerte<BR>Spanish language version of \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" seems to flow better that the earlier song.<br />13. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)<BR>Spanish language version of \\"Objection (Tango)\\" seems to flow about the same as the earlier song.<br />This is a very good personal album, full of different songs. I was reminded of songs by everyone from Metallica to Falco, but Shakira makes all of these her own. She produced, and either wrote or cowrote all the songs, and I am looking forward to her next move.  I highly recommend this album, Shakira's songs are a breath of fresh air in a sometimes smoggy pop field.<br />All of the song lines quoted are directly from the liner notes (when I was able to take my eyes off the very photogenic songstress).
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavinge was lying when she said she was not ordinary.  Her music, in fact, sounds very similar to most other songs, just (slightly) heavier.  It is a mixture of Britney Spears, Pink and many other pop artists.  Don't get me wrong, the songs are good, I especially like Skater Boy and Complicated, but if you are a non-pop type of person and looking for something punk, Avril Lavinge is not the way to go.  If, however, you like pop, this is a pretty good CD, with really catchy tunes.  Oh, and one other problem: She should hire someone to write the lyrics for her, they are somewhat immature.
B00005UQ9F|1.0|UUck!  Horrible!<BR>It pretends to be a real film, but it's just a mess masquerading as a psychological thriller.  A completely disappointing waste of time.
B00005Y7OJ|2.0|After the eloquent crisis of \\"Behaviour\\" and the utter euphoria of \\"Very\\", \\"Bilingual\\" represents a major anticlimax for the Pet Shop Boys. <br />I was absolutely shocked to hear the monotonous, tuneless rhythms of Discotecca, Single and Metamorphosis after looking so forward to this album! It appears PSBs have tried to incoporate somewhat of a Spanish theme into this album, but they have not followed it through! What we end up with, then, is an awful pastiche of discordant Latin American rhythms and woeful electronica.<br />Perhaps i'm being a bit harsh on PSB. The album does, after all, pick up in the middle with the pleasant - if innocuous - \\"Se La Vita E.\\" And the album's highlight - \\"A Red Letter Day\\" - would have been certainly worthy of inclusion on \\"Very\\" or \\"Behaviour.\\"<br />Nonetheless, this is incredibly disappointing given the talent of the PSBs!
0345451325|5.0|This is a great read for any one who is a fan of the game or action sci-fi.
B000002J0B|5.0|First, let me start by saying this: This album is one great 40 minutes of listening. All the songs are idividually good, and are even better when listened to as a whole. <br />Houses Of The Holy starts off with The Song Remains The same, a great rock song and it made the Best Of Latter Days album. It has some great guitar work in it, but Plant's vocals in it aren't his best IMHO. Still, a great song and a great opener for the album. <BR> <BR>From there, it's The Rain Song, a nice sounding, acoustic, mellow song. It's one of the longer songs on the album, lasting over 7 minutes, but 7 minutes of musical goodness. Another great song. <BR> <BR>After The Rain Song is my favorite song on the album: Over The Hills And Far Away. It starts off with a pretty cool acoustic part then the drums and electric guitar come in and the song just rocks. The guitar solo in it is also great and so are the vocals. One of the highlights of the album, should've made it to the Best Of Latter Days album. <br /> <BR>Next in the 8-song line-up is The Crunge. This song is kind of strange. It has complex lyrics, a swingish beat, and some funky synthesizer stuff. Not my favorite song on the album, but by no means bad.<BR> <BR>Dancing Days comes next in the line-up. This is a cool song, I like it a lot. It's your standard zeppelin distorted guitar sound, rock song. Good vocals by Plant in this one.<BR> <BR>The next song I love and on consideration, maybe it's the best song on the album... hard to tell, they're all good. Anyway, great guitar, great lyrics, and great vocals. Plant really gets the feeling of the song in this one, a heartbroken guy who has just been turned by a girl and can't let her go. I love the guitar and reggae sound in this song, the whole song is simply great.<BR> <BR>No Quarter is next on the list and also made the Best Of Latter Days album. Once again, great guitar work in this song, and the vocals are decent, but not the best. Actually, this song has really grown on me... I've come to like it a lot. <BR> <BR>The Ocean is the last song on the album and really closes the album with an explosive bang. With a a cool, simple guitar riff and power chords, this song just rocks. Actually, this song has really grown on me and I love it... one of my favorite songs ever.<BR> <BR>This whole album is great, another masterpiece by one of the greatest bands ever, Led Zeppelin. All I have left to say is this: Rock on!
0316666343|5.0|This may be the best book you'll read this year; perhaps the best book of 2002.  Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant.  If you want a first-hand experience with what writing should be, treat yourself to The Lovely Bones.
B000066NW0|5.0|As a major music junkie, I buy a lot of CDs and listen to a lot of music.  I don't buy into trends such as boy bands or pretty blond singers like Britney Spears.  The kind of music I thrive on is REAL.  You may or may not know what I'm talking about.  REAL music is the stuff that brings you to tears the first time you listen to it.  You blast this REAL music so loud it's all around you, and you just drown in it.  You know the feeling.  You want to play that music for everyone in the world.  Rarely do you find a full album of this REAL stuff.  After hearing Avril's single \\"Complicated\\", and reading a little sidebar about her in some teen magazine in which she said \\"I don't write ooh baby songs\\", I was compelled to check this chick out.  I bought \\"Let Go\\" the day it came out and listened to the whole thing.  I was absolutely stunned.  Today it's quite popular for a teenaged girl to play guitar and write her own songs, so that's kind of what I expected.  When I got through the first thirty seconds of the first track, \\"Losing Grip\\", I was literally fighting back tears.  The lyrics spoke to me, and touched me.  The music hooks and bends and flows so well.  It's unlike anything I've ever heard.  The rest of the album is equally enveloping.  Every single other song is so awesome, I can't describe it in words.  I've never heard a girl rock this hard.  As a fellow singer-songwriter-guitarist, she inspires me to write what I feel, and not what I think would sound good to other people.  This is why I feel that I need to tell the largest amount of people I can about this absolutely amazing album.  I would give it 1,000 stars if the rating system permitted.  You NEED to get it.  It's worth every penny it costs, and I've already made five copies of it in case one gets lost.  Ok, I'm paranoid.  But you need this CD.  I'm now officially addicted to Avril.  And unlike petty trends and stupid fads, the kind of music that is Avril Lavigne won't ever go away.  Because, she's Anything But Ordinary.  And that, in my opinion, is the best thing you can possibly be.  You'll never tire of this album.  Buy it now, my friends.  While you still can.  But don't just take my word for it... listen to some of the clips, I guarantee that this will become one of you favorite discs.
0312265859|5.0|Unlike some series which start to die out around the 5th or 6th go-around, the Stephanie Plum series just keeps getting better and better.  <br />There was still the usual happy-go-lucky, in-your-face humor always present in the previous episodes, but there was also a more serious side to this outing in that the bad guys were really nasty.  I for one, liked it.  It showed a depth to Stephanie that we were not acquainted with before.<br />Can't wait for the next one!!
0385503954|5.0|This is an amazingly good book.  The narrative begins at a manor house in England in the mid-1930s, subsequently shifts to the battlefield and to London during World War II, and briefly ends with a family reunion in 1999.  Each of these settings is vividly and movingly presented, but even more significant is McEwan's ability to convey the rich internal lives and differing perspectives of his characters.  The book might seem a bit slow at first, as McEwan elaborately sets the stage for everything that follows.  But once the first critical event occurs, it is almost impossible not to wonder and care about what will happen next.  Almost every scene is perfect and affecting, and the ending (which I will not spoil) is exactly right.
0792840461|4.0|Fun, Colorful, glamorous, cool ... a little dated yes.... but if those fashion/action/montages so popular in 60's and 70's films are out ... why did they invent MTV! This move is cool, period. Characters are chilly and calculating, but fun. Who wouldn't like to be that cunning. McQueen is the epitome of minimal, Dunaway (as always) is both gorgeous and amazing. One of the last real screen divas ... she can go from the most subtle of subtle to soooo over the top! A must have for film buffs.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Laundry Service is one of the most infectious pop albums of late, even before the first track \\"Objection\\" has finished. <br />Shakira's unique vocals and songwriting style shine through the album's complications. It's most obvious that this is Shakira's first English-language album. The songs are very simplistic, and quite honestly, Shakira does trip over some lyrics, \\"Wherever, Whenever\\" is a fun song but I didn't understand much of the lyrics. When I can sing the Spanish version \\"Suerte\\" by heart, and I can't the English, I find that a bit odd. (I know no Spanish, and actually took high-school French.)<br />Still, despite that reservation, the album is quite fun. From the disco-ish \\"Ready for the Good Times,\\" to the country/rock \\"Fool,\\" to power ballad \\"The One,\\" you can sing along to each song after only one listen. In fact, the album has an interesting sound as a whole, with standard rock, Arabic, and \\"surfer music\\" elements to it.<br />Shakira's on her way to huge stardom in the US. That fact that she was a featured diva on VH1's Divas Las Vegas concert says something. Look for this album, and it's first two singles \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" to do very well at the 2003 Grammys.
0345440900|3.0|Tracy Hogg, nanny-to-the-stars, has a pretty solid philosophy when it comes to babyrearing. I didn't like it at first, but then I started to understand it a little better. She's a bit ethnocentric and sometimes comes across as a little preachy, but this book can be very helpful when you've got a crying child and can't fathom a reason why. More useful for 2-4 month old babies, since it's pretty tough to put a newborn on a routine (they pretty much run the place for the first few weeks). In a nutshell, though, that's what she advocates: get 'em into a regular pattern...
B00005LC3Y|5.0|What Kubrick had in mind in this movie was: what does it take to turn a normal young man into a killer. Well he starts out with stripping the characters down in a dehumanizing boot camp and then he sets them out loaded to the teeth with weapons.  This movie is shocking, funny and unforgetable.  Probibly the best war movie ever made.  The term \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is the casing that surrounds a bullit.  Well it is also suppose to signify what these kids end up like after boot camp and then even more so after the war.  Hard, hollow and made to kill.  I love it how Kubrick uses the Mickey Mouse song at the end when the soldiers are marching through Hue city(which is burning to the ground).  He offers the most voilent scenes with the most light hearted music.  But there is a poetic point behind this that surpasses irony and it was mentioned half way through the move.  The duality of man.  Creating and destroying all in one breath.  And it was represented time and time again throughout Kubrick's movies.  Wathch this movie and you will not be disapointed.
0312265859|1.0|Okay, so I love this series for the characters and not the  \\"everybody knows who done it\\" storylines.  The fact that the cliffhangers are all of the \\"will she or won't she do him or the other guy\\" variety sort of begs for that level of interest.  So sue me - I was very interested.  While the storyline may be darker this time around, it seems to me that Stephanie's wit and kick ass presence continued to dim right along with it.  She seems to think less of herself when, based on her track record, she should be absolutely 100% behind herself.  Her continued self-doubt after all this time is annoying and not very entertaining.  I recommended this series to my 20something daughter as an object lesson in snatching victory out of the jaws a defeat.  My mistake. AND what the heck is Ranger (a formerly intriguing character and sexy character - something my daughter and I definitely agreed on!!!) doing sounding and acting like her ex-(for good reason if you ask me)-fiance Joe Morelli.  Stephanie's interest in Ranger, a man who didn't treat her like a moron, was one of her most promising qualities.  But noooooo -  suddenly in the eighth book this popular male character (just check out all the fan fic written about him)is making fun of her just like the guy she was smart enough to dump (the one who thinks she should get a job at a button factory - who by the way is the same FTA she brought to heel in the amazingly funny and unique first book).  The author has even given Ranger one of Morelli's more annoying and most often repeated quips - \\"You want me bad.\\"  Puleeeeze. Along with him channeling Morelli she's given him a relationship with a mysterious \\"other woman\\" to annoy and further mess with Stephanie's practically absent self-esteem(what the heck happend to Morelli's mysterious relationship with Teri Gilman that used to mess with Stephanie's self-esteem?).  Adding insult to injury, from a character continuity standpoint the author has made Ranger as sexually predatory as Morelli was at the beginning of the series.  Yuck!  It's like invasion of the body snatchers only not as plausible and certainly not as much fun.  My advice to the author is forget the attempts at romance and concentrate on giving us back a strong female protagonist and interesting storylines minus the overused plot devices and stereotypical characters (for the love of God please loose Mooner).  This isn't character development, it's character assasination.  The characters that were one the heart of this series are no longer recognizable or very likable.
6305078564|5.0|I purchased the initial full screen release of the A&E Adaptation about four years ago and have been extremely happy with it.  Recently, it was released wide-screen.  I purchased it, and was fortunate enough to be able to return it for the following reasons: the wide-screen version seems to present a washed-out image, colors tend to fade and the performances, especially those of the two stars, do not have the same impact as the original release because the wide-screen creates a distance.  I wonder how the production was initially shot.  Was it full-screen or wide?  <br />I feel very grateful to possess this release and will cherish it for years to come.  I do hope that they do not discontinue it.<br />By the way, when will \\"Reckless,\\" another British production, be released DVD?
B00005QZ7U|1.0|In fact, I weep for every artist whose songs were picked out for \\"Moulin Rouge\\" (not Madonna, though, but that's a different review). Adding in popular songs in a movie that's supposed to take place in the early 1900's would normally be kitschy at best, but every song in here is taken a bit too literally in the film and robs what little depth and emotion this film could have had. To add insult to injury, Ewan McGregor speaks rather than sings, Nicole Kidman disguses her un-talent by singing in an airy, breathy voice reminiscient of Mandy Moore, and GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY WHY DID THEY USE A NIRVANA SONG?!<BR>As to not rant forever on the music, I'll go to other topics: the story was so utterly predictable that my grandmother left the room, even though there was at least an hour left of the film. The actors don't fit the characters, so it's very difficult to feel any sympathy for them. The cinematography is motion-sickness inducing at best and MTV-style at worst. On a positive note, the sets are visual eye candy, but pretty looks do not a good movie make. Have I mentioned that I sobbed with remorse when I heard them remake \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"?<BR>I don't want to go on. It fills me with pain just thinking about this movie. But if you like movies like \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", by all means see this movie. If not, avoid it like the DVD casing was coated with lead paint.
B000065U1N|1.0|The only thing I found worthwhile about this movie was its  soundtrack.  Otherwise, the depiction of the events that occurred on that mission are not only obscure in the movie, but entirely inaccurate.  The movie aims at making some quick bucks by riding on the patriotic environment of the US right now, but its xenophobic portrayal of the Somali people and generally, all non-Americans is both disgusting and ignorant.  Most people know very little of that event, and I guarantee you that what people now believe what happened is what Black Hawk Down was so kind to depict.
B00005JKL8|5.0|After seeing the commercial for Behind Enemy Lines I didn't think that the movie was that good. But after watching Behind Enemy Lines I knew I was wrong. The movie was great. It is the best war movie I've seen it recent years. The cast for this movie did a great job. Especially Owen Wilson(Zoolander,Shanghai Noon), Gene Hackman(Hoosiers, Enemy of the State), and John Moore(The Saint). You should own this movie cause it is so good that your gonna see it more than once.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I never really listened to Enrique before, but after listening to \\"ESCAPE\\" on the radio, I do believe I became an instant fan! I also like \\"Don't turn off the light\\" from hearing both songs on the radio and after listening to the samples, I am going out to buy the CD. The music is very upbeats and gets you to feeling good, and no matter where I am I must dance. I am glad to say I am a new fan of his music.
B00003CXFG|5.0|It seems like whenever I hear or read a reference to Pitch Black, there is a comparison to 'Alien' (this seems to please/displease people to varying degrees), and I guess I can see where that comes from; the movie is gritty, there's a lot of tension, it's what you'd bill as a 'sci-fi horror' film, and of course, there's the creatures themselves which don't really look all that much like the 'Aliens' if you were to put them together in a line-up, yet, they somehow remind you of them (maybe it's the choppers and the lack of eyes)...however, I think Pitch Black worked on two levels; as a sci-fi horror/suspense movie, which Alien/Aliens definately did, but also on another level which frankly none of the Alien pictures did, in my opinion - the cast of characters get stuck in a similar predicament as the Marines in Aliens did, cut off from everyone with limited resources in the middle of a nest of horrifying killer aliens, but rather than being compltely action or suspense-driven Pitch Black takes the time to wonder how people stuck in this situation might actually react, and how they might end up interacting with each other.  Every character really kind of looks inside themselves and they (and we along with them) find out what they're really made of.  It's this aspect that I think makes the film a cut above; it's easy to look at the plot, the aliens, the genre, and write it off as another Alien clone, but I think it's what you DO with the material that makes the difference, and that's true in this case.  If you don't care about that stuff, it's still a great sci-fi horror picture - if you're more interested in seeing people get eaten by aliens, you'll get to see that in this movie, and it's great on that level.  If you care about the struggle of the characters; the struggle with the aliens, with each other, and with themselves, then you'll get something there, as well, which really you don't often get in a movie like this (seems like no one ever bothers to throw that stuff in).  I really liked the characters of Riddick and Fry, I thought it was a great juxtaposition; Fry started out as one kind of person, and found that under extreme circumstances she was a different, better kind of person, and Riddick, who starts off as one kind of person, finds inspiration in Fry I think, and finds maybe he's not so far gone as he and everyone else thought.  You're not going to get that in most movies like this, which is why I say 'better than you might think'.  It didn't take off like Alien, either, so who knows, you might not ever get it again, so if you're a sci-fi fan, check out Pitch Black.ff in).

B00005TT77|5.0|I always thought that the soundtrack completes the movie- and the creators of I am Sam certainly did an excellent job doing this!  Unlike other movies whose songs have absolutely nothing to do with the movie, the music from I am Sam ties in perfectly with the movie.  I usually don't enjoy covers of great songs, but I think the artists were all well chosen for each song.  Being a Beatles fan myself, I don't think anyone else will be disappointed; instead, I think you will enjoy this soundtrack.
0553260111|5.0|First things first...<br />A lot of learned people I speak to tend to \\"diss\\" Ludlum as \\"pop\\" writing or bad litterature.  The fact is, I've read a lot of the classics and tomes that are frequently regarded as priceless material, (Tolstoy, Dickens, Shakespear, etc. etc.) and I cannot think of any that even touch this book, [...] this trilogy, in suspense and drama.  They grasp your attention from the start, and never let go.  All aspects of life, both human and material, are examined, and dealt with with both grace AND shock - all through the eyes of an amnesiac spy and a woman who believes in him.  The complexities and shear brilliance of plot are second to none. (the Supremacy and Ultimatum books are just as good, in my opinion)  <br /> Ludlum in this trilogy is at his very best.  In many of his other volumes, a distinct pattern is obvious in his structures; nazis, old nazis or new nazis are the bad guys, while a male spy and his girl are out to save the world, etc.  Don't get me wrong, I've read most of his other books and found them all good, but they ARE formulaic. They are comperable to Rossini Operas (overtures in particular); Good overall = all the same, yet all different =   all at the same time.  <br />In this trilogy however, his imagination, knowledge of covert ops and the DEPTH of his psychological character profiles are un-matched, and perhaps even un-matchable.<br />All three books are a must read.  They are fine independently from one another, but really should be read in order for the full effect.<br />By the way, the new movie is ok, but it's nowhere near the book; as usual, read the book first, and complain about the movie after.  Whats with the removal of the French-Canadian anyways?!!  Shame!  I can hardly believe Ludlum was part of the production at all.<br />G
B000001DYD|5.0|This review is not only on the LP &quot;Rid of Me&quot; but PJ Harvey as an artist as a whole. There is almost no other artist ive heard that can capture the magic of making music like PJ Harvey.  Every single one of her 5 albums have their own style and sound, all different from one another.  She exploded onto the music scene with Dry, a pure indie-rock record.  Then this CD.  This CD is definately her rawest, most edgy and emotional recording.  To bring you my love was next, which in my opinion is her very best, and most experimental.  Its unlike anything she had done and has the most variety on a single album.  Moving onto &quot;is this desire?&quot; where she experiments with some dark trip hop beats mixed with her trademark lyrics.  Then onto her latest, &quot;Stories from the City...&quot; where she seems to have gone back to her earlier roots somewhat, but instead the lyrics are alot more mature, less raw and punkish, and seem even happy at times.  She is awesome in concert also, as i saw her open for U2.  There is no other artist that is as talented or as raw, or has the sheer music genius that PJ has.
0312265859|5.0|After some disappointment with the seventh installment in the Stephanie Plum series, I approached this one with some trepidation.  But, Stephanie and Joe, Ranger and Lula, Bob and Grandma Mazur are back!!  And they are better than ever in a novel that is a little darker than its predecessors, but a good solid story full of the belly laughs we've all come to expect in a Plum!! I am now eagerly awaiting #9--only about a year to go!!
B000068TPN|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  Its about time that Hollywood produced a movie that depicts the men who fought in Vietnam not as drug addicted, massacring imperialists, but as couragous young Americans who fought for something larger than themselves.<BR>Too often popular culture denigrates the Vietnam war as something that was completely needless and a unworthy venture.  However, when looked at more carefully,the Vietnam war easily could have come to a more successful conclusion if the campus activists and Jane Fonda's of America had not assured the North Vietnamese government that we were not fighting as a nation united.   Leave it to Mel Gibson to make a movie that finally gives the veterans a fair shake.  Definitely worth watching.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Bryan Singer's &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is a breathtaking crime thriller that exceeded all expectations after its 1995 release and to me represents the zenith of filmmaking. Singer himself creates the story using complicated and beautiful shots and an uncompromising vision. This man knows what he wants. And this is to bring Christopher McQuarrie's script to life. The script itself is a magnificent twister that leaves all ends loose. It is quite simply sheer brilliance. Kevin Spacey's performance, though, is the key to the movie's success. If Kevin could not pull off the subtleties required of a character of such importance the movie would not have worked at all. His performance is simply amazing in its difficulty and aim. Great supporting roles by Gabriel Byrne and Benicio Del Toro (with one of the funniest movie accents of all time). And the ending literally left me with my mouth open. At the end of this movie, I was simply in awe. It had managed to capture me and fascinate me in a manner few others have.
0780622553|4.0|This movie is an engrossing rendition of the sci-fi type that stresses the multiplicities of realities and showcases bizzare aliens. Moreover, this film adopts specific philosophical stances, such as the repudiation of physicalism, and the lack of objectivity in the universe. However, the film complements humanity in a unique fashion in that it demonstrates that individuality cannot be manifactured or duplicated -- moreover, it exhibits the irrationality of collective minds and the like. The movie has definite parallels to the Matrix. However, dont expect the fast-slinging action like that seen in the Matrix. The film focuses on haunting the psyche through strange circumstances rather than wowing the audience with impressive violence. However, it is an intriguing and engrossing film that should be seen by sci-fi junkies and aliens alike.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is really cute! There are some messages that we should pay attention to:<BR>- The importance of the laughter instead of screaming. <BR>- The harm of the prejudice<BR>- Sometimes physical strenght is not what is needed to solve a   problem<BR>You should really watch this movie and pay attention to these messages and others that I may have forgotten.<br />This is definitely not a movie only for kids...
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This film is a testament to the thesis that we create our realities -- sometimes more than other times. Leonard, a man who suffered a freak injury that prevents his attention span from exceeding 5 minutes, is faced with solving the case of his wife's murder. The problem with him is -- are the clues that he finds mere edifices that he uses to inviegle himself into finding \\"a killer\\" (as opposed to \\"the killer\\") or are the clues legitimate, and are they properly founded upon? At the end (or the beginning), however, after he finds \\"the killer\\", he sets off on another parallel journey to apprehend the other killer...In the end, we just realize that he is creating his own reality and the backwards chronology helps to illustrate this point poignantly. Three cheers to the cinematography
079284632X|5.0|This version isn't the best, but get it anyway. I saw the complete uncut format. It is a very  rare copy to find, but I saw it. It is depressing, disturbing, bruttal, and scary, wich is why alot of people don't like this movie. It talks about harsh subjects, and is painfully realistic. This is true horror. Scream isn't, this is one of the most disturbing films ever. Buy it. Watch it alone in the dark and dwell upon the dark sinister things that were in this movie and imagine yourself in there shoes. That's the way to get the ultimate experience! Rate this movie by the scarieness not the version!
B000002L9M|5.0|Black Celebration is vintage Depeche Mode. From the subtle to the heart pounding, Depeche Mode does it again to perfection. The CD opens with \\"Black Celebration\\", an ode to nihilism and perhaps satanism. Perhaps the most recognized track is the gripping \\"Stripped\\", with the memorable line, \\"Let me see you make decisions -- without your televisions.\\" Depeche Mode is subtly haunting, and unlike other \\"gothic\\" bands, they dont need to raise their voice to make a point. Indeed, the charm that Depeche Mode has that distinguishes itself from other goth bands lies in the lead singer's beautiful voice, coupled with the timeless electronic beats. If you havent listened to Depeche Mode, I strongly suggest starting off with this album. A must buy.
B00003OSSL|3.0|Critically lambasted and widely ignored upon its release in 1999, \\"Random Hearts\\", a Harrison Ford-Kristin Scott Thomas vehicle, is really not that bad.  It's less than stellar and the pieces don't always fit very well, but the performances are actually quite nice, Scott Thomas's especially.  While I would not consider this film a masterpiece by any means, fans of these two actors might enjoy renting it some Saturday night.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This was a great movie I loved the way it told the story of a man who really needed to be recognizedfor his great achivments. The actors and actresses worked beautifully in this drama.
0913866156|5.0|I've been reading with Thoth for 13 years and for me it is the only deck I get truly accurate readings from.  Just to let perspective buyers know that this deck is not for the faint of heart, those only interested in white magick, or those who cannot handle a fair amount of shadow with their sunlight.  One more thing, this deck chose me a long time ago and I never read with the Rider-Waite or any other &quot;beginning&quot; decks.  Do not start with this deck, otherwise you may find yourself unable to read with anything else.  I am attempting to teach a young lady the Tarot right now, and am having a great deal of difficulty because of this.  I will not allow her the Thoth, and so it is hard to explain a beginner deck to one of the uninitiated.  For those of you who have been chosen by the deck, you probably know what I mean.  For those just starting out, do look at The Golden Rider-Waite as the colors are much prettier than the original.
0553381709|5.0|This is the third book in what is turning out to be a great saga.  In many fantasy series the main characters are given great powers but can't seem to use them until the last battle when it saves the day and vanquishes the bad guy.  This novel along with the saga doesn't do that.  Characters must get by like everyone else using the sharpness of their minds as well as their blades.  No character is unbeatable or unkillable, no character suddenly learns to use his magic power, no character is truly good or evil.  This is what gives the books it's appeal the realness and believablity of how the characters behave. <BR>There is magic, dragons, monsters in abundance but subtly done so they aren't central to the story and characters accomplishments.
B000065KFV|1.0|Please, save yourself some aggravation and wait for Miramax to release an official Region One DVD! Peter Jackson's luscious cinematography, originally screened in 2.35:1, when cropped to 1.33:1 is enough to make you cry. Audio is poor two-channel stereo, and there are no extra features. I purchased this Canadian import over a year ago because I love the film, but I've watched it only once because of its inferior quality. Have patience!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've never written a review before, but I just had to for this C.D. I first heard Nora Jones song &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and I found her voice incredibly beautiful and soothing. It is a must buy. It is quite different than any other artist that is out there currently. She is quite a talented 22 year old. If you want a C.D. that makes you feel relaxed, happy, etc. this is the one for you!
0792156684|1.0|This movie was a TOTAL chick-flick. If leonardo dicaprio was not in it, and that girl did not take her shirt off,I am not sure if people would like it. That song was song by AT LEAST one girl out of 20 at the time. I actually saw this movie, and it was horrible. The boat was cool.I'll give it that, and only that.If you want to see a good movie, watch GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.it'll make you cry, not as much I would make you if you liked this movie.
B000066FUB|4.0|not only was 'i am sam' a beautiful, poignant and touching film, it also had a brag-worthy soundtrack. and due to the fact that over half of these new renditions of beatles songs are not actually featured on the movie, the cd is a must-have accompaniment. from traditionally predictable covers of 'blackbird', 'i'm only sleeping' and 'you've got to hide your love away' to less-predictable versions ('help!', 'julia' and 'let it be') to the completely bizarre (listen to grandaddy's rendition of 'revolution') - this disc is so good it's important.<br />but if you're going to shell out the dollars for it, you might want to consider the import version, featuring a far-superior version of 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' by aimee mann - one that adds an almost preferrable denouement to a glorious disc. i'd give the disc 5 stars, because it really is that good. it's just that i'd like to replace the black crowes with ms.mann - that's all.
B00000JTEP|4.0|Of  course I liked this CD; it's Joni Mitchell.  I like Joni's unique voice and style. I like this CD especially because Little Green was written for Joni's daughter, whom she'd lost to adoption.  They're happily reunited now.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This CD is the kind you listen to while leaning back into a large, warm bubble bath and tasting with strawberries and champagne. Enrique Iglesias has a way performing his songs, as if whispering in your ear, enticing you with erotic messages that really make you think about love in all it's different forms. As a student of erotica, I would love to sit down and share a long, deep discussion regarding his thoughts and beliefs on women, sex, and romance -- ideas seemingly advanced for one so young. (Poor me!! Unlike his other fans, I have to mentally picture him a little older before I can freely fantasize about him...Hee Hee) In a way of speaking, this album is as close as me or other fans can get to that actual conversation. An album filled with intimacy, intrigue and depth. I can't wait to see more! Someone tell that boy to write faster!!!
B000002TWN|5.0|Minister's son, Michael D'Angelo Archer really made a massive impact with his organic soulful sound on this his 1995 debut.<br />Making his name on \\"U Will Know\\" (Which he co-wrote and co-produced) with Black Men United the talented, multi-instrumetalist Richmond VA native made his own muse apparent here. Instead of following the mainstream definitons of what \\"R&B\\" had come to define, D took it all the way back. He clearly is a true lover of peak era soul music, wearing influences like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Prince on his sleeve. This can be observed right down to a superlative, chilled cover of Smokey Robinson's classic \\"Cruisin'\\".<br />That song is a true highlight and was a single release. As was the anthemic title track, which is a head nodding, drugs/female double entendre (Not unlike The Rolling Stones did with same title 25 years previously) opening, which incoroporates Mr Archer's hip-hop generation roots.<br />The album has a laid back, jazzy vibe throughout and the Raphael Saadiq co-produced ode to his woman \\"Lady\\" exemplifies this.<br />There isn't a weak song to be found but other favourites of mine include the brooding ...and gospel soaked closing number \\"Higher\\". \\"Dreamin' Eyes\\" was a worthy single release as well.<br />D'Angelo took a five year break before his next album but the influence of this album endured all the while and proved one of the main catalysts in the genre the media came to know as \\"neo soul\\", although beyond categorisation, this album is just superb music.<br />Check out the \\"Live At Jazz Cafe, London\\" Japanese import CD too for the live experience.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is often dismissed by people as a &quot;good&quot; movie because of the subject matter of a blonde chick going to Harvard to pursue her boyfriend. Yeah the premise is kind of demeaning. BUT, in the long run Elle delivers a stellar performance of a woman going after her dreams against the odds of people not believing in her.<br />Bruiser, the dog, adds an extra dose of sugar to this film, as does the obscene amounts of pink. Reese Witherspoon is a great actress who can pull off the &quot;determined girl&quot; character really well (see &quot;Election&quot;). This is a very light-hearted movie, reminscent of &quot;Clueless&quot; in its talk and clothing. Girls will definately love it. The writing is laugh-out-loud funny as are every single one of the characters.<br />The DVD features are excellent such as some documentaries on the movie that are informative as well as cute, plus you'll see some deleted scenes.<br />So in the words of Elle, &quot;Don't be skeered,&quot; check this flick out!
B00005QXDD|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect here.  I'm a big fan of Jack Black, he's hilarious in every interview I've seen of him, and every movie he's been in, and he's also a very talented singer and guitarist.  So, I wanted to see what this album was like.<br />Well, first off, this is funny stuff.  The lyrics are goofy, dirty, and just plain fun.  However, this album just feels kind of thrown together.  \\"Wonderboy\\" and \\"Tribute\\" are both fantastic songs.  Funny lyrics, great music, they're just perfect (they even got mainstream attention, which I never would have expected).  But, a lot of this album just seems like a bunch of small jokes and loose ideas put to music.  Plus, the songs are all pretty short, half of them are under two minutes.  It almost feels like a grindcore album, with all the short songs.<br />In the case of a \\"joke album\\", one might not expect such good musicianship, but one thing this album has without question is some great music.  The acoustic guitarwork is all very well-done, and pretty creative (unlike Jimmy Fallon and Adam Sandler, who just do bar chords).  Kyle gass is a great guitarist, with more than a little experience in classical guitar.  Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters steps up for drum duties, and does a great job as always.  He also plays guitar on occasion throughout the album.<br />Besides the aforementioned two, there are a few other great songs here.  \\"Rock your Socks\\" does just that.  Great hard rocking tune.  Impressive drumwork from Dave, and Kyle's classical solo rules.  \\"...Her Gently\\" is odd, in that it has the feel of an emotional ballad, yet manages to be really funny at the same time.  I'm guessing that's hard to do.  \\"City Hall\\" is a bit too long, but a great closer, with some great music (featuring some fast rhythms that almost sound like Slayer unplugged).  The other songs have funny lyrics, but are really too short to be anything.  It almost seems like they were just making stuff up as they were going along.<br />I'm sure I'm putting WAY too much rational thought into this, but I really think this album needed a bit more time put into it.  These guys are obviously capable of making a great song, so they need to just sit down and crank out a whole album of them.  This was a decent start, but come on  Jack and Kyle, next time you gotta blow us away with a masterpiece.  I know you can do it!  I look forward to the next album, I feel it's gonna be great.I'm putting WAY too much rational thought into this, but I really think this album needed a bit more time put into it.

014100018X|5.0|Amid the myriad novels one can read, there are a rare few which are truly a boisterous and grand celebration of life.   This is one of those.   Written in a sublime and tasty prose, full of sensual detail and delight, this is an extreme pleasure to read from first word to last delicious morsel.   There's also just a hint of magic here that again never fails to enchant.   Harris's characters are huge and memorable from the valiantly wicked while dying Armande to the romantic mystery Roux to the charmingly vile priest Reynaude.   Subtle, but lovingly playful, there is everything to recommend this novel.   Admirers of the prose of Isabel Allende, Alice Hoffman, Laura Esquivel, Jorge Amado, and many of the other magical realists will also enjoy Harris, but this book is for anyone who loves a good story, richly told.
B000002HPT|5.0|I cannot for the life of me figure out how anyone could rationally conclude that this is a sellout. It's just as epic and &quot;progressive&quot; as anything else they've done.  Perhaps there is a bit more restraint than normal, but there's more to progressive music than just over the top musicianship.<br />This album is eclectic, diverse, technical, and very solid.  I enjoyed every single song on here.  &quot;New Millenium&quot; is an amazing opener, with a slight techno vibe.  There are some more laid-back, &quot;radio-friendly&quot; tracks, like &quot;Hollow Years&quot;, &quot;You Not Me&quot;, and &quot;Anna Lee&quot;, but they're still perfect, and way too good for radio.  Remember, they've always had a &quot;breather&quot; track on every album (&quot;Another Day&quot; on I&amp;W, &quot;The Silent Man&quot; on &quot;Awake&quot;, and &quot;Through her Eyes&quot; on SFAM).  You've also got heavier, more fercious tracks, like &quot;Burning My Soul&quot; and &quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; (the latter of which has one of my all-time favorite lines, &quot;a daily dose of eMpTyV will flush your brain right down the drain&quot;), and even some epics, like &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; and the fantastic closer, &quot;Trial of Tears&quot;.<br />I feel I could probably go on about this album forever, but I'll wrap it up.  I was really not prepared for this level of perfection.  The people who don't like this must be really narrow-minded, because it's almost impossible not to enjoy.  This is every bit as progressive as anything by Rush and Queensryche, no more commercial than the &quot;gods of music&quot;, the Beatles, and far superior to anything by any of those bands without the slightest shred of doubt.  If you really love Dream Theater, buy this without hesitation.  It is beyond words.
B000002LMK|5.0|Neil Young - who was once sued by his own record company for making \\"unrepresentative\\" records - has certainly done his share of experimentation throughout his career. This one where he pushes all his pretensions aside, and just lets it rock. Just as his next album, Harvest Moon, is an explicit sequel to his famous 1971 Harvest album, Ragged Glory is, in many ways, a sequel to his 1969 album of guitar jams, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The first two songs, Country Home and White Line (songs from the 70's that were never released), set the pace for the record: heavy, long on jam, and yet still melodic. The record is certainly a jam - over 63 minutes of music are distributed among its 10 tracks, with three of them hovering around 10-minute range - and there is plenty of raging, burning fretwork (not to mention some incidenary rhythm work), but Neil and Crazy Horse never lose sight of melody. All the songs are hard-hitting: there are no acoustic folk ballads here. The album pretty much shares one consistent mood - that of \\"beat-you-over-the-head\\" raging guitar work. The only real break from this mode is the closing track, Mother Earth (Natural Anthem) which is an absolute feast of distortion. Unlike Young's previous album, the lyrically ambitious Freedom, the words here are sharp and to the point - while still being meaninful and memorable. We see Young keeping it concise here. It's true that there isn't much variety here, but what is here is immaculate. An essential purpose for fans of Neil Young's heavier side.
0790729628|3.0|This is the first occasion upon which I've seen a director's cut and wished it was the theatrical release.  While Harrison Ford's voiceover may have been poorly executed and a bit cheesy, this version, which edits it out, seems slower, poorly paced, and was harder for people who hadn't been familiar with the movie to follow.<br />I don't think there was enough background written into Bladerunner, and the lack of narration both obviates and aggrivates this flaw.  This cut would have been much better if the additional dream material and the less &quot;happy ending&quot; resolution were added in, and the cheeseball narration remained in as well.  Unfortunately, and somewhat shockingly, this director's cut is not an improvement over the original- it's not even as good.
B000002MY3|5.0|I only wish I could give more than 5 stars! This is truly one of the best albums ever. It is raw, layered, and terrific. I love every song on this album. I got this a while ago and still I love it til this day. My favorite of the whole album has to be You Oughta Know. It's energy and care-free lyrics made it stand out and sound great. Ironic, Head Over Feet, and You Learn are also great songs. All of the songs on this album are great and truly can be cherished forever. If you liked this album as much as I did, go get yourself her other two hits: Under Rug Swept, and Suppose Former Infatuation Junkie.
B00005JKNC|4.0|Jim Carrey did a wonderful job in this movie, playing Luke, an amnesiac who is not really who people think he is. Like his character in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, this was not a comedic role and shows his versatility as an actor. In the beginning of the movie, he is Peter, a rather sketchy Hollywood screenwriter. As Luke, he assumes an very different persona.<br />The slow pace and the length of this film permit full character development. Viewers really get to know the characters and to care about them and their lives. Especially wonderful in her role was Laurie Holden, an actress who was new to me but who did a magnificent job in the role of Carrey's girlfriend. Her down-to-earth performance was right on target.<br />The Majestic, a run-down movie theater, becomes the rallying point for the townspeople - a symbol of the re-birth of a young man who has returned from the dead and the regeneration of a town which lost over 60 young men in the war. The entire town embraces Luke and rallies behind he and his father as they attempt to resuscitate the defunct theater.<br />This ode to America and its freedoms came as a welcome change. It was a delightful, easy-to-watch, nostalgic movie with a feel-good message, showing patriotic, small-town values. What could be wrong with that?
B00003Q438|5.0|James Cameron has given himself a personal reputation that a lot of people would call the very best, however, his films are very broad, usually filled with adventure and often exciting and interesting.<br />From The Terminator to Titanic, James Cameron has thrilled and excited audiences all over the world. This story is one of those that borders on intellectual and fantasy.<br />This DVD has two versions of the film on it. It has the original theatrical release and then the \\"directors cut\\". The DC is much better. It explains what happens and what motivates the \\"aliens\\" to do what they are doing.<br />I remember seeing this in the theatre and wondering \\"why?\\" Ed Harris is great. Elizabeth Mastriantonio is fabulous and all the supporting cast really shines. Even Cameron's favorite bad guy - Michael Bein is intense.<br />The special effects are very good and the visuals are very colorful. It is technically a very good film to watch. The story is simple. \\"We are not alone.\\" (Heard that before?)<br />The DVD is wonderful. The menus and scene changes and all the behind the scenes are the very best. It is great for film and special effects enthusiasts. It is full of information. This is a good one to own!
B00005RY7X|5.0|nothing this year has come even close to touching the sheer dudeness of this album full of instant beer commercial classics.
1573300403|5.0|Michael Jackson is incredible. His energy and magic of dance is amazing. This collection of Videos on this DVD is some of the best. This DVD includes some of the most intricate videos ever as well as the longest. Very well done.<br />Technically they are flawless and interesting. If you are Michael fan - you'll love this. If you are not - getting this CD will let you see the creative talent of him, his producers, writers and directors have been.<br />Children will love the visuals and adults should get the messages. This is a fun DVD for everyone to watch and enjoy at home. I just wish it had commentary by him making these videos. That would have been the best ever!
0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is more mature than and, in my opinion, superior to the prequel Ender's Game. In order to partially atone for the xenocide he committed in Ender's Game, Ender Wiggin now spends his time traveling to various planets to speak for dead people upon request, usually many years after the death due to the relativistic effects of near light speed travel. Before each speaking, Ender researches and attempts to figure out what the dead person would have said about his or her own life.<br />Well, that's mostly what Ender's been up to since his Battle School days and how he's been able to learn extraordinary empathic skills, but it's not what this book's about despite the title! A new intelligent alien species has been discovered on a planet called Lusitania, where a small Catholic community of Portuguese colonists has established the settlement of Milagre, partly in order to be isolated and safe from non-Catholic influences. The community now includes two scientific posts: a xenologer who studies the aliens (the humans call them piggies due to their appearance) and a xenobiologist who primarily works on improving agricultural productivity on this alien world.<br />One fateful night transforms the colonists' perceptions of the piggies.  The aliens torture and butcher Pipo the xenologer in cold blood, keeping him alive as they open his body with a wooden knife and remove organs. Soon after, Ender is called to speak Pipo's death by Milagre's young xenobiologist named Novinha, who was very fond of Pipo. Novinha is crucial to the story because she has sole access to computer files holding the terrible secret of why the piggies killed Pipo; she has sealed them with multiple layers of security to prevent others from learning the secret and dying the same way Pipo did. Due to relativity, Ender's voyage seems to take about a week for him but when he lands on Lusitania twenty-two years have gone by. Novinha is a widow with a large dysfunctional family. Her late husband Marcao has died of a strange congenital disease. Pipo's son Libo has met the same horrible death as Pipo at the piggies' hands. But otherwise, nothing much has changed. Not much significant progress has been made in learning about the piggies.<br />The real reasons Ender comes out to Lusitania and leaves his beloved sister Valentine behind are to understand the piggies and explain them to humankind and to carry out a promise he made to the one remaining survivor of the species he destroyed at the end of Ender's Game. But he gets more than he bargained for when he encounters this mysterious race whose ways are completely different from our own. Once again, Ender pulls off the impossible by revealing their mysteries. And in doing so, Ender turns the whole town of Milagre upside down!<br />It's a great plot the whole way through and a couple times I had to force myself to put the book down to do other things (minor things like eat, sleep, go to work, etc). I liked Ender's Game but this one definitely surpasses it for adult readers. Very highly recommended!
B00005O5CM|4.0|The plot isn't original and the jokes are predictable but that doesn't keep this movie from being suprisingly entertaining.  Reese Witherspoon steals the show as the dumb blonde who steals the show at Harvard Law School.  The cast does a great job of bringing a freshness to this stereotypical comedy.  This movie is also quite clean compared to other recent teen movies.
B00005T30L|3.0|3 1/2<br />It's very typical for these kind of film's to be more liked by the &quot;underground&quot; anti-everything crowd then main stream audiences. It appeals more to the teenager who feels the same way  Enid does. (Love her name btw) Thora Birch truly brings out the &quot;Daria&quot; like depressing charm in this not-so-unique but well done role. BTW-She looked absolutely cute through out this whole film, I totally fell for her with that short black hair, bold glasses, and perky outfits. She is such a doll! Too bad it seems like she lost all that weight now. ANYWAY <br />The movie has some great comedic moments following our pal Enid through her pessimistic look at life. Like when she get's a job at the theatre and the art class scenes to name two. While at first it seems creepy   that she likes this old dude Steve Buscemi they each have a charm that makes them perfect for eachother. Steve plays the dud like no one else can, but he always has a dignity about him. The movie is colorfuly and is really nice to watch it has a 50's charm in the decor and feel of the sets. The supporting cast is a riot and makes for an all round good 2hrs of film.<br />The film is not flawed though, while I'm all for endings that one can discuss with others. I feel that the Enid character didn't have any sort of redemption at the end. She talked about dissapointing everyone, and yet does nothing to fix this. I felt so bad for Steve at the end that I just couldn't appreciate what happens at the end. I know it's  supposed to symbolize that their ARE NO certainties in life, and there will always be things that suprise you. Enid realized this and went for it, BUT she should have fixed things with Steve before she left, I cannot forgive her for this.<br />Well if you like these Village-type movies or anti-everything  Art house films check out Waking Life, Fight Club, Mulholland Dr., or Vanilla Sky
B000065V1V|5.0|David Bowie fans may or may not rejoice with David Bowie's new release, \\"Heathen\\". Taken as a whole, it would seem Bowie's most consisten work in years. Three cover songs, \\"Cactus\\", \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" and \\"I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship\\" and nine originals that all sound fresh and vibrant. Gone are the noodlings from 1999's \\"Hours...\\", 1997's \\"Earthling\\", 1995's \\"Outside\\" and 1993's \\"Black Tie White Noise\\". Of the nine originals, stand out tracks include \\"Sunday\\", \\"Slow Burn\\", \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone\\", ,\\"Everyone Says 'Hi'\\", \\"A Better Future\\" and \\"Heathen (The Rays)\\". Consistent, with good hooks would best capitulate \\"Heathen\\". Those who had written Bowie off as having little more to offer, with his most creative days behind him, can now take notice. If it takes Tony Visconti to bring Bowie back into focus, here's to more collaborations!
B000002LPD|4.0|First of all, yes I'm one of those VH fans for whom VH was my favorite band during the DLR era and I just never could get into the Sammy Hagar stuff.  It's not that I was nuts about Dave either.  He wasn't why I was into the band.  And it's not that I wasn't prepared to like Hagar.  I just never thought the band gelled together after Roth left.<br />But \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" made me reconsider.  This is the first album with Hagar, in my opinion, that actually sounds like Van Halen.  The others had a song here and there that sounded like Van Halen, and a lot of songs that sounded like Sammy Hagar solo material (with guitar and drums by Eddie and Alex).  This album has a certain confidence and passion that was just lacking on 5150 and OU812.<br />Hagar also forgot to write a cheesy pop ballad with the word \\"love\\" in the title for this album.  I can't say I'm disappointed by that.  All Van Hagar albums have a few radio friendly ballads, and the couple on this album, \\"Right Now\\" and \\"The Dream is Over\\" are way better.  \\"Top of the World\\" isn't a ballad, but it's also poppy and also much better than the pop songs on the earlier Van Hagar albums.  And they finally figured out how to rock!  \\"Poundcake\\" may have stupid lyrics, but it's pretty cool.  \\"Judgement Day\\" is even better.<br />My only remaining comment is about the title of the album.  I don't want to sound like a stuffed shirt, but come on.  Did \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" suggest this title?  I've always found it funny that Hagar writes these sappy love ballads and then also makes some of the most sexist and immature comments in other songs.  I don't know if the title was his idea, but I'm guessing \\"yes.\\"<br />Not a bad album though.  Check it out.
B00006690F|4.0|When I first heard about EMINEM I thought \\"Yikes, not another Vanilla Ice\\" but I was sorely wrong.  The lyrics and music are both catchy and clever and although you may find yourself skipping a song here or there, the majority of songs are worth the hearing. Being a lady, it's hard not to wanna shout - \\"Quit it with the misogynistic stereotypin'\\"- which is just as bad and prolific a pastime as rascim - but the music and lyrics on most of the album make it worth buying.  I can't help but conjure the image of EMINEM duking it out with his mom and ex-wife on the Jerry Springer show while listening to \\"Cleaning out my closet\\" which is funny and scary at the same time...
B000002MUQ|3.0|It might even be the second best Hagar era album, behind \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.\\"  We get two Hagar style ballads with the word \\"love\\" in the title.  Oh joy.  Oh rapture.  Actually, they're not that bad.  But they are a little sappy.  And then when you have a song about hookers on the album (Amsterdam) the lovey-dovey pop-rockers come across as rather fake.<br />Eddie sounds pretty good again, meaning his guitar isn't quite so thick with the dreaded Eventide Harmonizer.  But it's still not dry and raw.<br />\\"Balance\\" is pretty good, but far from classic.  For fans only.
0312265859|2.0|Once again the book after a big cliffhanger has left me disappointed.  Not that it wasn't a good story, it was.  It had a lot of classic Stephanie moments.  I just don't understand how two of the major characters could be so different in this book from the previous seven.  Neither Ranger, nor Morelli seemed like themselves.  And speaking of Ranger, I waited seven books for a resolution that came in 2 paragraphs and a \\"I've got to go?\\"  Nope, sorry, this book was a big disappointment to me.  I'm not so sure I will even bother with book 9.
B000002LEM|3.0|Overall this is a pretty good listen.  However, it also displays some of the problems of the early Hagar era, which I'll address point by point.<br />1)  Sounds like an uneven mixture of Van Halen type tunes and Hagar solo type tunes.  \\"Cabo Wabo\\" sounds like VH, mostly.  Songs like \\"When It's Love\\" sound like Hagar solo.  Consequently, the album sounds rather inconsistent.<br />2)  The second album with a \\"love\\" ballad.  Hagar will remain pretty consistent with this.  He can be really sappy in one song, and then really crude in another.  Here \\"Black and Blue\\" is his crude lyrics song, and also one of the stupidest.<br />3)  The drums.  He's using some sort of drum triggers.  Also, the production can be really shrill sounding - cymbals.<br />4)  Eddie should turn off the Eventide Harmonizer.  His guitar tone is WAAAAAYYY overprocessed.<br />So, in summary, it's ok, but completely non-essential Van Halen.
B000068TP0|5.0|This compilation of music is Shakira's absolute best.  Her music in Spanish is far better than in English, though the English is still good.  This album is so moving, addicting, and unique, I must have played it 100 times!  DEFINATELY WORTH YOUR WHILE!!
B000065U1N|5.0|There is a plot.<br />What? You need it spelled out for you? Okay! Here is the plot: The mission was to take down the two political figureheads that are noted at the beginning of the film. The mission was a failure because the powers that be would not grant our soldiers adequate firepower and back up to handle the mission (which failed weeks prior if you listened to the dialogue). An emergency situation ensued and from that comes our story. <br />Marines don't leave Marines behind. When the first blackhawk went down the mission objective was changed and changed again when a second &quot;bird&quot; went down.  By now in the movie, the Somalians had become extremely unruly and began cornering those left behind. The only option left for them was to retreat into the peace zone. That's your plot. <br />What more do you need? Ridley Scott kept the story as grounded in fact as possible. Henceforth, he didn't get involved with creating fictional dialogue or attempting to recreate these real life people on the screen.  We know little about those men now just as we did then. The idea was not to let you get to know them, but to know what they went through. <br />Oh, and I love this one: overlong. Yeah, nice word!
B00005JKJA|2.0|This is not a masterpiece, nor is it in any sense horrible.<br />THis movie was a pretty good movie, if you know what to ignore.  There are plenty of scenes in this movie that you could take completely out, and it would have no effect at all.  Why?  Because many of the scenes are thrown in there, for apparently no reason.  <br />Yes, I got the point of the movie.  But some of the dots do not connect, and a lot of people try to act smart by saying they love this movie.  By saying you love a movie with some parts that made no sense, some people might be &quot;What a smart person, they got it and I didn't.&quot;  Well, that's pretty much what it comes down to with Lynch and his fans.  I know a lot of what it is symbolism and illusion.  But it's just not needed.<br />Some of the stuff that gets thrown into this movie would be like randomly throwing some paint on a finished, very well made portrait.  It only hurts it and it would have been better if left out.  Which is why this movie only gets 2 stars.
B000051Y0G|4.0|This is the official CD of the 1980s as the decade of excess! Somewhere between a novelty album and a must-have classic, Cyndi Lauper really shines on &quot;She's So Unusual&quot;!<br />Her voice is very um, different! She's like a cross between a cartoon character, Madonna, and a country singer from Jersey! Not that it's a bad thing. The key here is not to take the album too seriously. Cyndi just wanted to have fun, not make the defining social commentary of the decade! Although, between &quot;Money Changes Everything's&quot; materialistic outlook, the fact that &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; was written by Prince, and the 100% Pure 80s sound of &quot;Witness&quot; and especially &quot;She Bop&quot;....not to mention the aching &quot;flashbacks to warm nights almost left behind&quot; - in other words, the intense relationships and memories of the 80s that come back with the verses of &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;All Through the Night&quot;! I guess in that sense, it really did encompass the social feel of the 80s!!<br />I'll admit, some of the songs on this CD are almost embarrassingly silly (I'll Kiss You, Yeah Yeah, and He's So Unusual) but like I said, you have to keep an open mind in order to enjoy them at all!<br />The live tracks on the CD are a great bonus, too! Slightly different and almost better versions of &quot;Money&quot; &quot;She Bop&quot; and &quot;All Through The Night&quot;. Essentially, I think everyone who is familiar with Cyndi has some kind of memory associated with the songs on this CD, and it's one of the best there is for 80s reminiscing or if you just wanna have fun.....
B000065U1N|5.0|For those of you who didn't like this for lack of a plot- to each his own.  That, though, I do not believe was supposed to be the purpose for this film.  This was based on actual events.  That day actually happened.  What you saw wasn't a story made up with twists and turns and purpose.  What this film was was an experience for us to see what really happens in time of war.  When you hear that a pilot got killed in a military exercise overseas, this is what really happens.  This is how these people die.  The way the press reports it, the whole concept really goes over our heads.  The fact that we hear about the military being in Somalia, Afganistan, etc, but are totally disconnected to the experience of these soldiers is the reason this film is so good.  It shows us what is going on while we are on our way to work, watching T.V., playing with our kids.  It sure brought out my respect and admiration for these Rangers depicted in the film and all U.S. Military Officers everywhere.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is just unbelievably good.  I can't believe anyone actually had the nerve to give this less than 5 stars.  Blasphemy, I say!  I've been a Maiden fan since about '98 or so (doesn't seem long, I know, but I'm only 16, just be glad I even know who they are), and I was really excited to hear about this album.  I had already bought most of their stuff by this time, and though I didn't expect much, it was great to get a new Maiden album since getting into them.  I never expected it to be half this good.<br />I just can't figure out what's supposed to be bad about this.  It's very melodic, but still hard-rocking, and the songs are just so incredibly well-made.  I mean, with 6 guys in the band, you'd think it'd be a mess, but this album still managed to sound very organized.  Janick Gers, despite what anyone says, is a great guitarist, and he works well with Dave and Adrian.  Nicko pounds out some of his best drumwork to date, and Bruce puts on a stellar performance rivaling that of \\"The Chemical Wedding\\".  If I had to pick a favorite, I'd go with \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\".  You gotta love that intro, and Nicko's drumming on this one is just so cool (I'm a decent drummer myself, but man I'd kill to have that kind of coordination).  But man, every song here is a winner.<br />I still think \\"Powerslave\\" is and always will be Maiden's best, but there is no denying how awesome and well-made this album is.  If you like Maiden, buy this.  It's just plain good.
B00000IO4J|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time I was not scared at all or even thought that I should be I just enjoyed it. When I saw it again I realized that some people might find the movie stupid but I think it is funny. When you see the part where one of the teachers taken over by aliens head is cut off and it's running around looking for its body it is hilarious. If you are easily scared this movie will still be good but you will enjoy it differently than I did. If you are a Josh Hartnett fan you will be disappointed because this is not one of his better movies but on the plus side the ever-talented Elijah Wood does a wonderful job like always.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I found this CD sitting about the house one day (It's my mom's), and decided to give it a spin. Wow, I'm speechless! This is really amazing music. They take elements of techno and pop, and fuse them with all these ethnic elements, and the result is stunning. \\"Return to Innocence\\" is just a great song, I got all these weird images in my head, I can't really explain it. But really, I enjoyed this whole thing. <br />I wouldn't have bought a greatest hits album, I'd like to find some of their studio stuff. I don't care how many albums I have to buy, I want them all. Enigma will take you to another world, and you'll never want to leave.
B00006690G|5.0|...  This album blows his other albums away musically.  It's alot different than his earlier albums because he tries to take his music to the next level.  He succeeds.  It's not your typical rap album.  He's still negative, there's still hints of mysogeny thrown in here and there, and there's still alot of hate, but that's what Eminem's music is all about.  However, there's alot more to this album than just the hate and anger.  A few songs on this album give you a rare glimpse into Eminem's other, more sensitive side.  And believe it or not they are still good.  There's also alot more to this album than the lyrics or the beat.  Some of the songs have trumpets, there's background clips from war movies, one song whose entire duration is accompanied by the Aerosmith song Dream On, and some songs contain more creepy elements like you might expect from Marilyn Manson.  If you are very single minded and don't like to hear anything other than putting people down, and talking [stuff] about people, then you should still like this album although you will be missing out.  However you probably won't like it as much as his first album.  For those of you who like Eminem but have a more varied musical palette, this album should blow you away.
0671004107|5.0|Before I read this book, I did not have just one, single favorite book.  I had multitudes of favorites, and my favorite for the time was only determined by which book I had read the most recently.  This book tops them all, in the story, the emotions, the basic ideas, it's just completely awesome.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone.
B000066NW0|5.0|This Cd is totally awesome.  Its raw meat and tearin up all the countdowns.  The cd is &quot;anthing but ordinary&quot; and Im &quot;losing grip&quot;  just listening to it.  She choose to drop out of school which was a big risk but she proved that a girl can make it out there on the guys skater-punk territory.  She has the whole package and more.<BR>-Vanessa
B000056QE5|5.0|In Feb. of 2001 I remember Mary Poppins was on TV and having not seen it for so many years - not since I was a secure, happy little girl and my parents were still married, anyway - I nearly froze when I heard the Chim-Chimney song wafting up the stairwell. I didn't watch the whole movie, but just the slight memory the songs can bring back is enough to reiterate the past in its entirety. <BR>Which is why I completely recommend the soundtrack! If you don't want to sit through the 3 hrs+ movie (or you DO but you just can't justify spending all that time!) then get the soundtrack and remember what it was like to be a little kid!<BR>The songs are great to take you back to any mood - from being sick and cozy on the couch, gazing, shiny-eyed, out the raindrop-laced window at the streetlamps and singing \\"Feed the Birds\\", to swinging in the backyard on a summer day when it's about to rain, you and your sister together taunting your only brother with the women's rights creed \\"Sister Suffragette\\", or seeing the world in the sense that it's pictured in \\"Jolly Holiday\\" (Have you ever seen the grass so green? Or a bluer sky?)<br />I know everyone has distinct memories from this movie and if they are sentimental and almost melancholily happy, get this soundtrack and reminisce whichever part of your childhood you're in the mood for - they're almost all on here!
0449002128|3.0|In a story as current as today's headlines, author Daniel Silva introduces us to Gabriel Allon, an Israeli agent coaxed out of retirement with the assignment to kill Palestinian terrorist Tariq Al-Hourani before Tariq can strike again at those engaged in negotiating for peace in the Middle East.  Tariq is responsible for the murder of Gabriel's wife years earlier, giving him a personal stake in his mission, but also leaving him ambivalent about participating in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.<br />THE KILL ARTIST features a devious spymaster, a mysterious stranger in a seaside village, a beautiful woman with questionable motives, a cat-and-mouse game in which it is never quite clear who is the hunter and who is the hunted, and just enough Le-Carre-esque consideration of the psychological toll of a life of espionage.  Where have we read this before?  In Silva's previous novels, \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" and \\"The Marching Season,\\" giving the reader a sense of déjà vu.  All of Silva's typical plot and character elements come together nicely, making for an entertaining, exciting, and easy-to-follow (as spy novels go) read.  Now, Mr. Silva, how about something new?
B000066NW0|5.0|I know that I am only a fan, but fans are what keeps the artists going.  This c.d. has got to be the best item that I have ever purchased.  Avril is so cute and her style is so unbelievably unique, that I couldn't help but fall in love with it.  She sings of topics that teenagers and many other people can relate to.  I really love her sound and they way she makes every song so catchy.  This is a c.d. that I will be listening for years to come.  It is great!
B000002LOE|5.0|Ok. I loved this album. It was easy to listen to and fun to listen to, and it of course, (its an REM album man) wasn't shallow. Some people didnt like it, I loved it. It was reflective, playful, light-hearted, and had some brilliant sounds. And I really loved &quot;Endgame&quot;. But- my favourite tracks? Radio Song, Losing My Religion, Near Wild Heaven, Endgame, Belong, Half a World Away and Texarkana.
B00005QDW1|1.0|The Britney Shadow unfortunatly has Gwen and the gang in its clutches....It has also captured The Vengaboys (suprisingly) and, more tragically, P!nk. As I understand, No Doubt tries to make each of thier albums different, thier first two albums ska, and Return of Saturn rock with a small amount of rap, but now they have stooped to the lowest terms, pop. The lyrics in the songs are just plain stupid, and music videos show Gwen galaventing around like an [crazy person]. I give some credit to the song H*lla Good. When I listen to the music on this C-D I dont even pay much attention to the lyrics, but on thier first albums I listen closely to what they say....
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't just like this CD I love it!  Her exceptional voice makes her an individual in the music industry!  Avril's songs have touched me like no other artist!  Each song can define any mood you are in!  I felt that I got to know her through her songs!  It amazes me how she wrote all the songs instead of singing someone else's lyrics!  What other new artist can do that!  She's also Canadian which is an extra Bonus! Way to go Avril!
0960191038|3.0|I am a bit baffled by the high-ranking reviews and lavish praise given to this book. While it certainly presents a sound approach to clear writing, there is nothing \\"revolutionary\\" about it. I suspect that people who think so never had a good English teacher nor an introductory logic course. In fact, its coverage of logic (despite the impression its title might give) is really quite superficial. If you're thinking about getting this book to learn about \\"logic in thinking,\\" you would be much better served by something like Irving Copi's _Introduction to Logic_. The value of this book is that it succinctly applies a little dose of logic to the problem of how to write clearly. If that's all you're interested in, then this book's for you.<br />A final comment. This book is based on what I believe to be a false premise. In the beginning of Part I, the author asserts that \\"the mind automatically sorts information into...pyramidal groupings\\" and that information \\"is easier to comprehend if it arrives presorted into its pyramid.\\" From this she concludes that \\"every written document should be deliberately structured to form a pyramid of ideas.\\" Well, maybe. The problem, I think, is with her first premise. Does the mind *really* group information into pyramids? In short or straightforward documents, this is probably so. But with longer or much more complicated documents, I doubt it. Take a really serious document like Microsoft's _Analyzing Requirements and Defining Solution Architectures_ -- over 700 pages including the index. The writing in this book uses something akin to Minto's pyramidal groupings part of the time. But these are its weakest moments. What makes the book come to life is its presentation of a running story, told in story form, of a group of people implementing the Microsoft Solution Framework. This, then, is a counter-example to Minto's thesis: *not* every document should be structured like a pyramid of ideas. Why? Because the mind does *not* always group information into pyramids, and to think so is a gross oversimplification. What I'm saying is this: Take Minto's writing advice for what it's worth (which is a lot), but don't follow it blindly when you face a real-world business communications problem. This is not the be-all and end-all communications solution it touts itself to be.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|A claustrophobic, straightforward and mindlessly enjoyable World War II thriller about a U.S. Navy submarine crew's perilous mission to swipe a decoding device from a stranded German sub.  A device that could change the outcome of the war itself.<br />This movie, based on a series of real incidents that in actuality were carried out by the British, is given an oddly fictional American spin by writer-director Jonathan Mostow.  The melodramatic, sometimes too obvious adventure is certainly at times suspenseful and borderline entertaining but never rises above a comic book level -- which is not necessarily a totally bad thing.<br />Matthew McConaughy and Jon Bon Jovi demonstrate the one-dimensional pretty boy school of acting at it's best. A stern (surprise?) Harvey Keitel and a usually terrific Bill Paxton walk through their parts straight to the bank.  Todd McCarthy's review in VARIETY said it best: &quot;The submarine goes deep but the story never does.&quot;<br />The DVD includes a making-of documentary, a feature commentary by director Mostow, plus additional bonus material about the Enigma code machine as well as historical footage of the British capture of a German U-505 and more.
B00005QZWI|1.0|I bought this so I could lift a pristine copy of &quot;May It Be&quot; for my personal Enya collection.  Other than that, the music belongs in the background of the movie - hardly the thing you would play at a party, or even just sit and listen to.  I loved the movie, and I think Howard Shore did a wonderful job on the score, but the soundtrack without the visual action leaves a great deal to be desired.  The audio does not stand well by itself.
B000066NW0|2.0|This Cd is all right..when I first saw Complicated on mtv i thought she was supposed to be punkrock but when i listened to the cd most of it was ssssooo pop. okay some songs are really tight like s8kter boy and complicated is okay and she is a pretty good artist if she just quit trying to be punk(and hogging up the spotlight) So anyway don't buy the cd unless you want ta listen to a pop \\"princess ... punk!
B000063UR2|5.0|Finally it is here - and well worth the wait for a magnificent DVD package.  I was lucky enough to have never seen the US release, we got the &quot;European&quot; release in Australia.  I can see why it flopped in the US!  Still, the best thing about DVDs are the features and this package has it all - commentary, alternative scores, missing scenes, making of documentary and a few other gems.  I can see how the US release was, like Blade Runner, dumbed down for an audience with a limited attention span and a need for everything to be spelt out for them - but I am glad that Ridley Scott never stops fighting to make intelligent films and hope that the audiences who constantly view commercial pap will one day raise their standards and expectations of what this medium can do.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne - her name says it all doesn't it? Her personality, her attitude, and her CD put it all together. I bought her CD a few days after it came out, and boy was I surprised at how good it was. Her first song - Losing Grip just absolutely blew me away! I love it!! probably the best song on the album. I swear, there are no words in the English language to explain how freakin good this CD is! It's the only one I listen to now out of my hundred and some CDs that I have. I recomend this CD to anybody! You'll love it! I promise!!

I've had it for about 2 weeks now and I've made 4 items already...I haven't baked this much in years!!  My first choice was the  Marzipan Fruit Cake - let me just say -this ain't your grandma's fruitcake!!  Buy this book - it is worth every cent!!!!
B00003CXSM|4.0|This movie seems to be shot like one of those romantic comedies from the 40's or 50's. Not very realistic, but with snappy dialog, a classy dance scene, and lots of laughs.<br />Jennifer Lopez did a terrific job in a comedic role, while remaining breathtakingly beautiful throughout the film. <br />Definitely a great movie for those times when you just want to lighten up a little...<br />As other reviews have mentioned, her father's Italian accent was pretty bad - the only flaw in an otherwise completely engaging comedy!
0452282152|5.0|Very easy to read, lovely characterizations.  I don't agree with the psychological insight this tries to give of the painting, but that's ok.  <br />The evocation of Delft, Vermeer, his troubled relationship with his wife--all nicely done.  For someone familiar with the 17th century artist, the details about the paints, process of painting &amp;c, &amp;c felt pleasant and accurate--for someone not so, perhaps a nice education?<br />A short, gentle slice of 17th century life, despite the compromises that get made.
B000056K04|3.0|This would be it.  <br />For the most part, this album fell into the \\"pop trap\\".  This is so unlike anything else I have ever heard by them.  Glen Ballard took the band, stripped it of their finer elements (violin and sax) and added an electric guitar.  Glen stated that this was to allow the band something to jam with later... I have yet to hear any of these songs really flow live, much less jam.<br />Every time I see Dave pick up the electric at a show, I now cringe.  Thank you, Mr. Ballard.<br />I have tried to make myself like this album and I cannot.  The only saving graces on this are \\"Everyday\\" which is based off of an old song, #36, When the World Ends, and the fact that it is DMB.... three stars would be generous if it were any other band.
0671027573|5.0|Oh my God, is Sam Mr Perfect or what!  Read this book just to indulge in him, he is a fantastic character.  Lucky old Jaine.  The scenes in the book between the two of them are so good, you find yourself skim reading the mystery just to get back to them.<br />The murder mystery was less engaging although I did not spot the ending.  <br />This book gets 5 stars purely for the Jaine/Sam love/hate/lust storyline - an enjoyable Sunday afternoon read.
B000002KDZ|5.0|Truly magical stuff this first (I think) album by this little-known but magnificent Latin Rock band. This album was released in 1972, a golden year for music in general and Malo in particular.  There's a natural inclination, which should  probably be resisted, to compare and contrast them with Santana.  The similarity is that they are both Latin Rock and their guitarists are brothers, but Malo very much plough their own furrow.  Having said that, can I be a bit controversial please?  \\"Suavecito\\" does sound a bit like \\"Sitting in the Park\\" by Georgie Fame, a British singer from the 1960s.  It's the none the worse for it; probably just a case of great minds thinking alike.  But my favourite track from \\"Malo One\\" is \\"Cafe\\"  - by a considerable margin.  Music doesn't get much better than this track. Sure, it's available on the excellent and highly recommended \\"Best Of\\", but only in an edited version (from 7 minutes down to 3 minutes). So splash out your Dollars or Pounds or Yen wherever you are and buy both.
B00005ATQD|2.0|Dull finish to what was a checkered career in film.  Kubrick die-hards had to wait 12 years for this movie, his previous film being 1987's effective  *Full Metal Jacket*, and I'm sorry to say  *Eyes Wide Shut*  just wasn't worth the wait.  Speaking of waiting. . . . It appears that Kubrick waited over 30 years to make this movie.  Its origins date from a novel called  *Blue Movie*  by his pal Terry Southern.  Together, they were going to make a film featuring raunchy sex between two established, big-time movie stars.  One wonders whom they had in mind to do this in the early Seventies.  (Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw?)  One also wonders why they'd bother.  At any rate, Kubrick finally got around to it 3 decades later, and  *Eyes Wide Shut*  is the result . . . except that it's now based on an obscure, arty novella from the 1920's by someone named Arthur Schnitzler.  In any case, each source probably demands a  \\"period\\"  treatment, rather than the update to 1999's Manhattan which Kubrick attempts here.  (Better yet, Kubrick should've made this movie in 1971 instead of the twisted interpretation of Burgess'  *A Clockwork Orange*.)  Both the Sexual Revolution-era questing for Free Love  (Southern)  and the stern, Freudian tone  (Schnitzler, presumbly)  are hopelessly past their sell-by date.  In fact, the film is saved from being an unmitigated disaster only by the occasional oddball scene or amusing minor character.  The famed  \\"orgy\\"  scene is not made any less risible by the spooky organ music, the impressive Venetian masks, or the measured pacing.  Speaking of the latter, Kubrick resorts to it the whole movie:  the pacing is eye-droopingly slow, as if the director is hoping to distract us from the basic silliness of many scenes with a lot of portentous pauses, back-and-forth stares, endless walking around, dialogue repitition   (\\"She was there last night?\\"  \\"She was there last night.\\", etc.), even FLASHBACK repitition.  The acting is almost uniformly bad, as is typical with almost all Kubrick films.  Nicole Kidman, in particular, has grounds to sue.  In a key scene, Kubrick has her hopped up on pot, for some stupid reason  (again, an anachronism from 30 years ago.  Today, it'd be Xanax or a pricey California Cab).  As a result, it takes her about 20 minutes to say to her husband, \\"I had a sexual fantasy about someone other YOU.\\"  It shouldn't take this long for the point to get across, and it shouldn't get such an overdetermined response from Cruise's character, who spends the rest of the movie walking around, looking for sex.  Unfortunately, he doesn't get any, not even at the orgy:  Kubrick, ever the clean-minded pornographer  (to use Pauline Kael's immortal phrase), sees to that.
B00000255O|4.0|Herbie continues his exploits into the world of funky fusion with Man-Child.  The tracks are more varied than on &quot;Headhunters,&quot; but don't round out quite as well as a whole.  Still worth buying, however, I assure you.<br />You can almost feel Gershwin seeping out in a couple spots here and there, as the jazz starts to come back into the forefront for Herbie and company's fusion.  You can hear him hinting at the upcoming commercial atrocities of &quot;Feets Don't Fail me Now,&quot; but in a more enjoyable way.<br />If you own &quot;Headhunters&quot; and are looking for similar tracks that get less playing-time, &quot;Man-Child&quot; is for you.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Okay I am a loyal star wars fan and I enjoy all the ..., knockoffs, and/or spinoffs. This however isn't one of those. I remember the \\"original trilogy\\" and when I was 6 or 8 I asked \\" daddy, why is star wars backwards?\\" But I could never get a direct answer.<br />You see the reason that everyone thinks episode 1 is stupid is that Luke Skywalker doesn't prance onscreen. Every one is used to this whiny personality that he had. I appreciate Mr. Lucas for not including his personality in any of these characters.<br />Of course, no movie is perfect. There are flaws. Like why does this movie seem to last 1 hour instead of the Star Wars classic length 2 hours? Why does Maul only have 2-5 lines in the movie?<br />The lightsaber fight is awesome. It would make any Bushido Japenese Katana weilding master jealous. ...

B000006TRV|4.0|... My personal favorite album is Wish you were here, in which the album is a tribute to the bands original front man Syd Barret. Unfortunately Syd went a little crazy with some acid and mental problems; he left the band after 1968. The last album he was with Floyd with was piper at the gates of dawn, which another reviewer missed wrote and said that roger waters was the front man for that album, as a matter of fact he wasn't in the band, as a close personal friend of syd, he took over for him when he refused to show up, and created epics with syd in his head, both dark side and wish you were here are greatly influenced by the bands dismay over syd barret. The wall, is a separate entity from both of those great record, the wall shows the absence of the friends feelings for the destruction of there friends life. The wall is an album, you don't find many of them any where, and I believe this is prog rock at its very best, and the last glimmer at its greatness. I consider Floyd among the very best bands ever, and the three albums i discussed all show something a little different about emotion and feeling, but the wall is what made me fall in love with Pink Floyd in the first place, especially disk two. Try it out!!!
B000062TU1|4.0|With J.K. Rowling becoming the richest author in the world, it seemed almost inevitable that her books should become movies. Though everyone went to the theatres with a healthy dose of trepidation, most came out satisfied, feeling that Rowling's story and vision had been successfully transferred onto the big screen. This is not too surprising as Rowling herself was a major participant in the making of the movie.<br />For those people who have been living under a rock these past few years, here is the general story - orphaned Harry Potter is taken to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin where he grows with no knowledge of his magical past. He lives a rather miserable life under his family's tyranny, till his eleventh birthday when he recieves a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So off he goes, to find his independance and freedom, a host of friends, kindly teachers who become parental figures, and of course an education in the magic arts. But there is a secret plot within the school concerning the Philosopher's Stone - one of the staff is planning to steal for his master - Lord Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed his parents, and only Harry, Ron and Hermione can stop them.<br />The real strength of this movie lies in the transition of Rowling's imagination and her host of characters, places and creatures to 'real life'. The detail of the sets, the merticulous costumes, the superb casting choices, and the special effects make this movie a visual feast for the eyes. A big highlight was seeing the Quidditch match - it was inevitably more exciting visually than any written account of it. Although in some scenes you could tell the actor where obviously CGI or strung up against a blue screen, the pace and action eliminates this minor gripe.<br />Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Ian Hart as Quirrel are great, but standing out even more so is Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid and Alan Rickman as the cold, arrogant Snape, who still comes across as one of the good guys despite his loathing of Harry.<br />I felt that perhaps the friendships between Harry, Ron and Hermione was not properly created as I picked up no real warmth or affection between them. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all fine young actors and presented the personalities of their characters they functioned more as three separate beings than the team linked by friendship that Rowling creates in her books.<br />On the whole, though this is a *very* enjoyable and re-watchable movie, it is presented more as an accomplice to the book, only being able to be fully appreciated to those familiar to the books, who are able to fill in the blanks that the movie leaves out. Therefore, I urge others to read the books before watching the movie, as it cannot even begin to convey the intricate layering that Rowling creates in her book that reflect on future books in the series (for example the plot twist concerning Scabbers in book three). Though purists will hate me, I felt perhaps film-makers should have been given a bit more extra freedom to work with the material instead of being so restricted to the book. To do so would have made the movie feel like it had beginning, middle and end, with character development, plot growth and a climax, instead of a series of events where one can almost see the separate chapters of the book.ape, who still comes across as one of the good guys despite his loathing of Harry.<BR>I felt that perhaps the friendships between Harry, Ron and Hermione was not properly created as I picked up no real warmth or affection between them.

B00006690G|5.0|This cd is perhaps Eminem's best work yet, he combines new school beats with dark controversial lyrics.  This cd is nothing like any of his preceding cds, but he admits that himself.  ... After listening to some of the songs like Soldier, one can relate to him and feel his emotions.  This cd is a must have for any true rap fan.  This cd takes hip hop and shows it to us at an entirely new angle that no other artist has dared try until now.  Expect great things from Eminem and you will not be dissapointed!!!
B000063JDE|5.0|Love it or despise it, director David Lynch's 1986 trip into the dark side \\"Blue Velvet\\" is one of those films that's hard to get out of your system.  Clean-cut Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) returns to his home of small-town Lumberton to visit his hospitalized father.  While traveling to and from the hospital, he discovers a severed ear in a empty field.  From there, he starts looking into the seedy side of a world he thought he knew and discovers many unusual and terrifying characters, such as a mentally destroyed singer (Isabella Rossellini) and a sadistic, drug-sniffing madman (Dennis Hopper).  Unlike Lynch's latter movies (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive), the use of dreamlike imagery doesn't drown out the basic story, but amplifies the drama.  Boasting terrific performances from the main cast, including Laura Dern and Dean Stockwell, this one of Lynch's best movies ever and among his most polarizing.         This release of \\"Blue Velvet\\" includes a terrific 70-minute documentary featuring interviews with the cast, which reveals surprising details about the making of the film (such as Dennis Hopper's \\"non\\"-audition, Isabella Rossellini's actual singing ability) and details about director Lynch (this movie comes from the mind of a Eagle Scout?).  There is also a montage of deleted scenes (in this case, scenes pieced together with photos taken, due to the fact that the actual scenes are currently missing) and a quick clip of the movie being reviewed by \\"Siskel and Ebert\\" (a surprising little bonus), and a photo gallery.                                                   Being one of the great films of the 1980's, and among one of the most shocking of it's time, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is definitely a unforgettable trip into the dark underbelly under the white picket fences covering the house of your dreams.
6305358613|1.0|I wish to begin my review with what I found positive.  \\"Elizabeth\\" did bring the great actress Cate Blanchett to prominence, and that she could deliver such a powerful performance in this dreadful production is proof that we have decades of her fine acting to look forward to.  <br />I found this film nearly unwatchable.  A more minor complaint is that director Shekhar Kapur indulges himself with unusual camera work that is very distracting.  Did we really always want to see an overhead view of condemned prisoners burning at the stake?  <br />Still, strange photography is far less annoying than bad history.  \\"Elizabeth\\" is not even close to being historically accurate, and its fabricated plot is far less interesting than the actual history of Elizabeth I's early reign.  I will cite only a few of the most egregious inaccuracies:  (1) There is no evidence that Elizabeth and Robert Dudley ever consumated their relationship.  The real Elizabeth was far too shrewd to take such a political risk.  (2) The war with Scotland portrayed as a defeat that forced Elizabeth to consider political marriage was in fact English military triumph, one that some historians rate as even greater than the later English victory over the Armada.  (3) No English noble or bishop ever conspired against Elizabeth's throne or life, and the one real plot against her occurred late in her reign and was so feeble that Walsingham allowed it to progress in order to implicate Mary Queen of Scots.  (4) Elizabeth met the Duke of Anjou for the first time in her mid 40s, and their relationship was in reality one of mutual admiration.  (5) Walsingham never killed anyone!  Perhaps this parade of fabricated events could be justified for the purposes of making a film if they constituted a worthy story.  In fact, the real relationships between Elizabeth, Dudley and Anjou were far more interesting than the story that unfolds in this film.  I am forced to conclude that the makers of this film preferred to take the lazy way out and develop a plot with plenty of sex and brutality but little intelligence.  In fact, they produced a terrible bore.<br />Most of the cast seem well aware that they had signed onto a disappointing project.  When actors as fine as Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborourgh deliver boring performances, somethiung has indeed gone wrong.  Only Ms. Blanchett is able to deliver a compelling performance, which underscores her acting brilliance.<br />Both conservatives and liberals who look for political messages in films will find ample material to anger them, from the (historically false) portrayal of the pope as actively conspiring towards Elizabeth's death to a silly and offensive gay stereotype I won't bother to describe.<br />In summation, this film insults both the intelligence and the sensibilities of its audience. ...
B00005O3VC|5.0|Really, what more needs to be said about one of the funniest \\"cult\\" movies of all time?  For those of you who have not seen the movie yet, what the heck are you waiting for, an invitation?  Seriously, anyone who spent any time on a college campus over the past 20+ years probably has the majority of this movie committed to memory.  The quotable lines basically start from the very beginning (\\"you've got two empty halves of a coconut and are bangin' 'em together\\") to the riotous ending (\\"your mother was a hampster and your father smelled of elderberrys\\").  This is planned, organized kaos at the very best.  I highly, highly recommend it....oops, now I've said it, I've said it again....
0440219078|3.0|The idea of this book is really good, but the result of the idea does not really satisfy. The idea of creating a new world without any feelings,colors and no pain at all is very interesting.

6304711875|5.0|for giving us one of the most clever thrill-rides in a long, long time.  It's sharp, funny and stylish.  It's much more than the typical \\"slasher\\" films of the 80's because it's trying to be a typical \\"slasher\\" film of the 80's.  Confused?  Don't be, it's simple really.  While it's not a typical satire/parody of the slasher films, it uses all the metaphors, scenarios and basic character failings (sin = death) that made those 80's films so campy and cultish that one can't help but be entertained, from the opening scene (\\"so, what's your favorite scary movie?\\") to the end (\\"movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative\\")....<BR>\\"It's a scream, baby!\\"
6302994063|5.0|I did not rent this movie; someone I know rented it and did not have time to watch.  She asked me if I wanted to watch it before it was returned.  I am glad that I agreed.<br />There have been a couple of brilliant reviews that analyze why this movie works on several levels.  I am a simple viewer of off-beat films, and I admit to liking dance movies (one early favorite being CARMEN). <br />This particular film was not based on any particular myth or opera;  it was perhaps a slight send-up of the typical mass-market romance published by Harlequin or Mills & Boons some decades back (the ones where the plain Jane always got her man).  It was also a telling commentary on dance competitions, perhaps, conveying to me at least how frenetic the rivalries can be and how crazy the judging can be. [This is probably no surprise to most of us who follow ice-skating either!]<br />The story is a relatively simple one at the very basic level - a young dancer tries to dance the way he wants, and he finds that his partner has abandoned him.  In searching for a new partner, he finds a newcomer who wants to dance with him.  When push comes to shove (i.e. when he is offered a chance to dance with a seasoned competitor), he drops this new partner and then changes his mind again and again.  That's about it.<br />Except that that really doesn't do justice to the sly asides in this film, the sense of mystery about the heroine (and who she really is), and the power of the dances.  One of the highlights was the couple learning to dance together on the roof of the dance studio against a commercial billboard as a backdrop.  Another was the magnificent paso doble routine with the heroine's father where the hero is cut down to size.<br />Ah yes.  I forgot to mention that the hero is not only interested in trying out new steps and challenging the rules of the game, but he is also a rather selfish dancer.  He does not think about his partner.  This is a point made by his former dancer as well as his new partner and her family.  To dance really really well, he must learn to share the dance with his partner, to dance only those moves that enhance the whole experience visually and emotionally for them both.<br />There is the comic aspect that I have mentioned, although I would call it more tragi-comic.  The hero's parents have dedicated their lives to dance, but their shared passion has affected them negatively.  There are plenty of secrets, some sleazy and others simply pathetic.  There is one major villain, of course.   There is the hilarious send up of the dance competition world.<br />Everyone who has watched this movie seems to be charmed by it.  The director went on to bigger (and perhaps better things) but this is a movie worth picking up, rental or purchase.  I understand that the DVD extras are a slight disappointment, but don't let that stop you.
0783229321|5.0|Grab this movie and never let it get away from you!  One of the funniest movies ever made, EVER!!  Although most of the humor/jokes are rather basic and, at times, disgusting (depending on your point of view, of course) they are none the less completely hilarious.  John Belushi was a god when it came to comedy and nowhere is that more evident than in this movie, his Bluto is an icon in American comedy, as well as college campus' everywhere.  Anyone who has spent any time on a college campus over the past 20+ years probably has the majority of this movie committed to memory.  If you're in the mood for a totally outrageous, funny and histerical movie, then this is the one for you.  <BR>What?  Did you say over?  Nothing is over until we decide it is!  Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
0452282152|5.0|GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is simply one of the most stunningly beautiful pieces of writing I've come across in some time.  Chevalier's prose falls onto the page lightly, with a grace that makes it seem effortless.  Like Vermeer's colors, light and shadows, it is lovingly and carefully constructed, built up in layers, each shining through with its own invaluable contribution to the whole.<br />The girl in the painting is possessed of a natural, unassuming beauty -- there are none of the haughty airs affected by the 'high-born' ladies she serves, by the wives of her master's (Vermeer's) patrons, present in her expression.  Her lovely face is a refreshing respite from the ones so often found in the paintings of the day -- her eyes are deep, honest and wide, taking in the world around her quietly and gently, missing very little.<br />These perceived characteristics in Vermeer's subject are brought to life vividly by Chevalier in this novel.  Griet -- brought into service to Vermeer's family as a kindness, after her father, a tile painter, loses his trade after being blinded in a kiln accident -- is instantly likable.  She has a good soul, and loves her family dearly.  She is modest and unpretentious -- when she feels desires welling up within her, whether material or emotional in nature, she is discomforted by them.<br />When Vermeer and his wife come to the home of Griet and her parents to meet her for the first time, she is in the kitchen preparing food for her family.  The eye of the artist is immediately drawn to her work on the counter -- she is cutting vegetables, and she has arranged them, without thinking about the reasons, by colors, arrayed like wedges cut from a wheel.  Vermeer senses an innate artistic sensibility within her -- it is an image that will remain with him.<br />When Griet comes to stay at Vermeer's house, living among his family, she quickly slips into the eddys and currents of 17th century Dutch family politics -- once again, without having to stop for more than a moment and consider, she intuitively knows whom she can count on to be fair, jealous, powerful, scheming, &amp;c.  She sees that the real power of the household rests not with Catharina, Vermeer's wife, but in his mother-in-law, Maria Thins.  At the same time, the older woman sees in Griet something special -- this young woman (only 16 when she arrives) is no ordinary girl.<br />Griet is entrusted with cleaning the master's studio on a daily basis -- with the explicit instructions that, other than leaving the area cleaner, she must never leave a sign that she has been there.  She must be especially careful of the objects arranged in the area that Vermeer is painting -- they must never be moved.  She undertakes this task cleverly, devising a system of her own whereby she can lift the objects and clean under them, replacing them exactly where she found them.  Her work is careful and thorough and sensitive to Vermeer's wishes -- and she finds him more and more appreciative of her efforts.<br />There is one particularly moving scene (among many in this novel) wherein Vermeer takes a moment to explain to Griet how seemingly pure colors contain within them other shades that are more subtle.  He asks her what color the clouds are that she sees out the window -- she replies that they are white.  He asks her to look again -- and she begins to see shades of blues and greys and pinks in them.  She begins to understand how difficult it is for a painting to be born, for the effect to be such that it deeply touches and moves the viewer.<br />One of Vermeer's patrons takes a licentious interest in Griet -- she resists his advances and attempts to avoid him when he comes to the house.  Eventually, he persuades Vermeer to do a portrait of Griet for him -- a task that must be undertaken without the knowledge of Vermeer's wife, and, indeed, most of his family.  Only the artist's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, knows about the portrait.  As he works on it over a periodof several months, it becomes more and more apparent to Griet that the completion of the painting will very likely signal her departure from the household.  Along with other emotional events in her life during this period, it places a very real strain on her.  She must come to terms with her situation, her view of herself, and her future -- within or without the artist's household.<br />The book gives the reader an exceptionally clear of what life must have been like in 17th century Delft -- not only among the more privileged classes, but among the working people as well.  Without coming across as patronizing in any way, Chevalier gives a sensitive rendering of these people and their times -- and in the process gives the reader a moving, entertaining experience that will not soon be forgotten.<br />It's probably a bad habit on my part, but I normally steer clear of 'best sellers', preferring to stick to lesser-known authors and first novels -- I find, as a rule, that they tend to take more chances than someone attempting to write something for mass consumption.  I have to admit that I avoided this novel for a while, knowing how well it has sold -- and I'll admit that that was a mistake.  This is a book that well deserves all of the praise that it has received -- I can well understand how it has moved so many people.  It's a wonderful thing to see something so well-written and uncompromising at the same time to be so widely appreciated.of several months, it becomes more and more apparent to Griet that the completion of the painting will very likely signal her departure from the household.

0679720200|5.0|This is the version of the book I read in high school. I don't know French so I can't vouch for the translation, but when I compared it to another edition I found, I was struck by how much more I liked this one. Seamlessly graceful, dreamlike words, absolutely elegant. I won't even dare to try and come up with eloquent comments on the actual content since needless to say, it is a classic worth of that title.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first Cd came out just a few weeks ago, but already it's opened our eyes to some good tunes. Avril Lavigne is a punk/skater girl from Napanee Ontario with an amazing voice and talent for the guitar. Being only seventeen she's prooved to be much more than just a airheaded celebrity.<br />&quot;Let Go&quot; (the title of her CD) really lets us get in touch with Avril's true self. Her songs range from the wicked punk rawk sounds of &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; to the sad and thought-provoking &quot;I'm With You.&quot; All the songs on her CD give us a sense of what it's like to be yourself against the majorities. <br />Already Avril's debut song &quot;Complicated&quot; has tore up the charts sitting at #1 on Much Music's Countdown and there's a lot more #1's in store for this punk rawk queen in the near future.

B00005YXZH|5.0|What an album! In my opinion, YHF is a masterpiece. I can only think of Pet Sounds when I listen to this music. Like Pet Sounds, it is different from past albums, it is ambitious, experimental, beautiful, and the record company hated it. It is my album of the year, maybe of this decade (so far). Is it me, or is this album a true work of art?
0061040967|3.0|Terry Pratchett was not at his best when he wrote this.  I've enjoyed the other Discworld books I've read.  Pratchett's sense of humor is wonderful and I love the parallels between the Discworld and our world.  However, even though I thought the premise sounded good when I picked this up, this book limps along and manages to be not very funny at all.<br />Pratchett mainly alternates between scenes involving Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde and scenes involving those trying to stop the heroes from reaching the gods.  The transitions between those scenes aren't very good; it's often like he decided to just stop one scene and start another.  Also, it gets easy to lose track of what the point of all of this is.  Rincewind, Captain Carrot, and Leonard are supposed to stop Cohen and the others from destroying the gods, but the book gets so caught up in building the machinery to get to the mountain and then actually using that machinery that it gets easy to forget why they are doing all of that.<br />The best part of this book is the artwork. I love Paul Kidby's illustrations.  His interpretation of Rincewind is excellent - Rincewind's expression of sheer misery is perfect.  I think Kidby is the same person who did the artwork for the Discworld calender, which I also loved.  I would recommend this book only to a die hard Discworld fan - if you're one such person, you'll probably enjoy the artwork (it's really beautiful stuff), and there are some nice Discworld details (all the varieties of swamp dragon, plus a little about each one, an illustration of a few of the Discworld gods, including their names and what they are gods of, as well as some of Leonard's notes about the inventions involved in this whole adventure).  The story, however, will be a disappointment.
B00005JKCF|5.0|First of all I wasn't a huge Spiderman fan before the movie came out in theatres. I was very suprised on how good the special effects were. The only problem with the movie was that the Green Goblin looked like a Power Ranger. If they make a sequal they should make the villian look more realistic. Other than that I thought the movie was great. I thought that Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst made a great team. I would recommend this movie to viewers of all ages. It is pretty graphic it may not be suitable to childeren of younger ages
B00000IQMT|5.0|I don't have much to say because everyone else has said what I would have said. <BR>Duel of the Fates reminds me of the atmosphere that the Dies Irae<BR>(Day of Wrath) from Verdi's Requiem. It has that threatening, menacing, arrogant, but beautiful character that the Dies Irae has. The words sung in Duel of the Fates are Sanskrit words- a language used in Nepal, Royal Authority of Bhutan, and India.<BR>Qui-Gon's funural reminds me of the various masses and requiems I have heard also. Augie's Great Municapal Band is just really awesome, it is new, different, and rythmic. The Brass glissandos add a humurous character to the celebration of new found freedom.<BR>The singing is performed by the New London Children's Choir directed by Ronald Corp. I will be pursuing bassoon studies next year. I have noticed John William's wonderful passages for bassoon. All in all the whole CD is a wonderful music experience not to miss!

B000002BQK|5.0|In 1997, Mariah Carey had just gotten out of a bitter divorce and was now expected to achieve the success she had once had with her ex-husband, by herself. Did she succeed?<br />Well, this is where this album, Butterfly, comes in. And the answer is a stunning yes. This album truly shines in every form and fashion, and why? Because the true emotion put into every single song makes the album worth listening to from beginning to end.<br />She truly put her heart and soul into this project. When people thought she'd crack from the end of her marriage, she did the opposite and bounced back with what? Herself.<br />Songs like \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Close My Eyes\\", and \\"Outside\\" seem to put to rest any negativities Mariah faced in her past, and make these songs great to listen to and try to tackle your own problems with. The cover of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" with Sisqo is beautifully done. You can tell this song is tackling with her divorce. <br />Lead track, \\"Honey\\" is a great song that hit #1 and stayed there for 3 weeks, with Puff Daddy (now P. Diddy) taking the track and making it what it is, it's truly a great collaboration and makes you hope they can get together again. <br />You can see there are some good uptempo songs here, like \\"Honey\\" and \\"Babydoll\\", but this album is loaded with the ballads, and those are truly special on this album. \\"My All\\" is a brilliant new direction for Mariah with a Spanish Guitar and sexy vocals, no wonder it hit #1 as well. <br />\\"Butterfly\\" is a grand piece of excellence on Mariah's level, which shines with personal emotions, great vocals, and the best lyrics she's ever penned. Yes, she did take a chance by diving deeply into Urban music, but she had to do it, because she's always had that soul inside her, but never had the chance to express it. Hopefully, she will continue to put herself into her music, and not become the not-so-real \\"popsters\\" that female artists such as Britney Spears have become to be. <br />So, if you'reasking if this album is worth your money, the answer is a definite YES.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a film that you will either love or hate. I loved it, watched it more times than I will admit to in the cinema, and have since bought the special edition DVD, with a host of extras, such as interviews with the stars and extended dance sequences, as well as deleted scenes from the original film release.<br />The film iteself is different to any musical you will ever have seen before, but obviously the director has a love of musicals, beacuse he had the knack of knowing exactly which pop song would go with each scene. There is even an original song, &quot;Come What May&quot; which really makes the movie for me.<br />It has everything, romance, adventure, a villain that you love to hate, humour, pathos and tragedy. Watch it and you will never look at films in the same way again.<br />No film since has matched up to Moulin Rouge.<br />Reeviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Shadows of the Rose.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's album \\"Ray Of Light\\" was amazing when I first heard it. I listened to every song throughout and saw that this wasn't just a CD, it was pure emotion straight from the artist. The first track, \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" lets Madonna flow her angst and her newfound stability in the spotlight she's attained for almost 2 decades. <br />I loved every song on this album, the best being \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" and \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\". The fact that Madonna truly matured and expressed herself in a completely different variation than anyone ever expected on this album makes it a true gem in the best albums in the 90's, or better yet, the best ever made.
B00005TT77|5.0|For others like myself (probably few and far-in between) who don't even like the Beatles, you may be pleasantly surprised when you hear this album and discover how fabulous these songs really are when sung by someone new!
0553213105|5.0|I started to read this book for AP English expecting another dry, boring, and hopelessly long novel.  However, I was soon pleasantly surprised to find that I was absolutely enthralled in it.  It has a timeless plot involving the survival of love when experienced by two different people, each in a very different social status.  The utilization of wit and sophisticated humor along with an intricate plot kept me fascinated with the subject matter the entire time.  Jane Austen is indeed a wonderful author who's witty and exciting plot will most likely more than keep your interest.
0609610570|1.0|When I first opened this book, I thought, \\"This reminders me of somebody\\". I pondered over it for a moment then I remembered my old companion, Carl K. Karlson. He was a bright lad, very fun and never put a foot wrong in his life. Then he was executed for failiure to return a library book. This book really disappoints me, as I thought you were more sensitve than this.<br />I did enjoy the bit with the giant monkeys though, but the flying whales were over the top.<br />Best wishes,<br />Nick Halle<br />President of the Wrongly Executed Club
B000066NW0|5.0|I am a huge fan of music... not just rock or pop but all music. After a while though bands start to sound so much like each other. You can't tell the difference between Default or Hoobastank, or between Britney and whoever else she is up against. I turned on MTV one day and saw the video for Complicated and I was amazed. There was this girl on tv not flaunting herself and singing better than anyone out in a long time. She put so much soul into her music and I could tell from the very begining that she would go a long way. This is a cd that you can pop in and listen to every song because each song is amazing in it's own special way. All of Avril's songs differ from each other which is hard to do. The songs are so differenct that I can't even classify a genre for her music. That's all it is... music.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Face it, technical effects and historical significance can't make a good movie without a script, actors and a director with vision.The only reason I can think of to watch this awful retelling of the story of Pearl Harbor is to make one realize how far writers/directors/producers can get from being able to bring a good story to the screen. The dialog is more wooden than the acting, the characters are stereotyped, the history is questionable, the emtional situations are contrived. Tora! Tora! Tora! is a far better telling of the history, and From Here to Eternity is a much better love story. I wonder how this would have come out if it was directed by Steven Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks. Oh, yeah. They made that move and called it Saving Private Ryan. Watch that great film if you are in the mood for a war movie. Watch Pearl Harbor if you want to weep for the victory of hype over substance.
B000002WU9|5.0|After \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chamber)\\", Rza took full production duties on solo efforts. The results were some classic albums, including this Raekwon album. The production sounds slightly different from Gza's and GFK's albums as Rza did a nice job tailoring his original production technique to Raekwon's style. <BR>\\"Knuckleheadz\\" starts the album off with an interesting bouncy song as Raekwon's flow keeps pace with this engaging beat. \\"Knowledge God\\" sees a great beat as Rza mixes strings in and out of the track with intelligent storytelling from Raekwon. \\"Criminology\\" has a solid GFK appearance and Rza's beat is amazing. \\"Rainy Dayz\\" makes use of a sample for the intro and sets up a real dark storytelling song. \\"Guillotine\\" is classic Wu-Tang. Great guest appearances from GFK, Gza, and INS, with a classic Rza beat. I feel that \\"Can it be all so Simple (remix)\\" is one of the albums weakest points as it doesn't match the original. \\"Ice Water\\" has a real funky beat and Cappadona's guest verse is one of the most memorable individual Wu-Tang verses from any album. \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" is an underrated song with a great guest appearance from Nas and a real nice beat from Rza. \\"Wisdom Body\\" rocks a real old school beat that mixes nicely with Raekwon's style. \\"Ice Cream\\" is a catchy song with a oringinal hook by Method Man. Another good song featuring Wu artists. \\"Wu Gambinos\\" is one of the best songs on the album, featuring many Wu-Tang members. <BR>Like all early Wu-Tang albums the strength and base of this album is Rza's production. It is his solid beats that allow this album to become what it is. Raekwon and guest star on many songs Ghostface fill the album with their storytelling skills. This has gotten \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" accredited as the best solo Wu-Tang album and is nearly the equal of \\"36 Chambers\\". All Wu-Tang fans should have this in their collection and if you are just becoming a Wu-Tang fan this should be your first or second purchase along with \\"36 Chambers\\".
B00005JL3A|5.0|Sitting in the movie theatre, watching this with my teenage son, I found my stomach quite tense/nervous - something it hasn't felt in awhile (last time, was when \\"Alien\\" first came out / the first time was when they handed me a barf bag for the premiere of \\"night of the living dead\\" in '68). The movie takes off like a rocket and the action doesn't stop 'til the end - and that's when you suddenly realize the ride is almost over and you start wishing for more. After years of hunching over our CRT, killing zombies and other dead maniacs, finally, someone in the last decade has made a decent \\"kill-the-dead-thing\\" flick. Hopefully Director/Writer Paul Anderson will at least equal this in the upcoming sequel! Our only regret - not enough screen time for the mutant dogs.

Songs like &quot;skater boi&quot; are sure to please the punk rock crowd with the fast paced guitars and other songs like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; which have soothing yet intense vocals make her almost like a female version of staind.  she has a voice all her own and a look to follow.

048622709X|3.0|This is a very good book to teach you how the hand works. It demonstrates how the muscles pull and knuckles jut or decline depending on the position of the hand. It also demonstrates bones and ligaments well, how each finger has three hinge joints, except the thumb, which only has two, where the palm is fleshy and where it lies flat. Reading through the book can help you gain a better understanding of the anatomy of the hand.<BR>Unfortunatley this book does fall short in some aspects, some of the images are so sketchy and blurred, it is difficult to tell that they are hands, much less to practice from the drawings and achieve the desired results. Following the examples in the book will not improve the clarity of your drawings of one of the most difficult subjects: the human hand. But the anatomy lesson makes this book worth getting anyway.
B00000DHTF|4.0|This collection of previously unreleased material is the first official release by Springsteen from his legendary collection. <br />Tracks is amazing because it is not just a collection of outtakes or songs that did not meet Bruce's very high standards.<BR>It illustrates the creative and commercial evolution of one of music's great artists. We can hear in Mary Queen of Arkansas and many of the tracks on disc one, a young man with a remarkable gift to tell a story and convey emotion.<br />In the many other tracks Bruce reveals his creative process. I have a great time trying to place lyrics and riffs that show up in many of the songs in which we are more familiar.<br />Most importantly, all four discs are filled with wonderful music that will not disappoint any of Bruce's fans. This is not a collection just for the audiophile. It is an accessible and enjoyable collection of music from a true rock legend.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This is a decent flick, but nothing special. Nothing really sticks out. The acting is good, the filming is good, the plot is thin. Something to watch with popcorn on the off-season for TV. Usually that would get three stars, but it was suspenseful enough to get four stars.
B000002IOW|4.0|To me, this is a great cd. Sure, every album (from and group)has a weak song.  No matter what anyone is gonna hate a song a on an album .Mine are Show Don't Tell and SuperConductor.Since they are too commercial. The rest is great. Maybe it holds a special place for me since it was the first band I saw live. I can't see why some fans see it as a weak album. Every album they make is different. This is a classic cover and a great show!! See you on the 'Trails tour guys!
B000003TAL|5.0|This album is a classic, not only for Sonic Youth, but for all music. The guitars are beautiful and hypnotic. The lyrics are loaded with abstract meaning and add a lot of intellectual volume to the music. They perfect the art of making guitars sound intentionally bad, and do it beautifully. I haven't heard a whole lot of other albums by Sonic Youth yet, but this is the one that got me interested in their music. I would reccomend buying this album before you buy any others. This is one of my favorite albums of all time.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Ok I have to admit, when Pink released her first CD, I thought she was very bad and like all the other Rap/R&B/Pop [stuff] that was coming out at the time.  \\"You Make Me Sick\\" sounded like a white girl was trying very, very hard to be black.  Then she released Missundaztood in Novemeber and Get this Party Started came out a little bit before that.  Again I thought, yeah pink you're cheesy.  THEN Don't Let Me Get Me was released and I thought WOW SHE HAS DEPTH.  Then I bought the album.  It is AMAZING!!!!  \\"Just Like a Pill\\" and \\"18 Wheeler\\" are both great songs which sum up how Pink is.  I am so glad that she is different than the rest of the crumbby pop scene right now.  Pink Kicks ...!  She will go FAR in the music industry!  All the rest of the songs in the album kick...! especially Missunaztood and My Vietnam!!!  GO P!NK!!!
6303998704|3.0|Although over-rated in recent years by some enthusiasts, this unusual horror film certainly deserves more attention than it received in its original release, which was zero.  Director- producer Herk Harvey did a fine job of getting the most out of an ultra-low budget.  The gloomy black &amp; white photography is very effective, and location scenes of a deserted amusement park are put to good use.  The cast of unknowns is mostly good, and the entire film has the effect of a vaguely disturbing bad dream, which is exactly what was intended.

The movie is fun to watch, their are many sexual innuendos, it is not a childrens movie.  Definetly a cult classic.
B000066NW0|5.0|at first i wasn't really sure if i wanted to buy the cd but after my friend let me borrow it my mind completely changed!!! i now listen to this cd non-stop. its my absolute favorite. avril's songs like sk8tr boi and mobile really encouraged me to buy the cd. i absolutely love how the enhanced cd have a hidden track and shows a video of a day in avrils life. that totally rocks!! i give this cd 2 thumbs up. i encourage everyone to buy it!!!
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is an amazing album, it differs so greatly from Michael's previous three, but still ranks up there with them. The thing I enjoy about this album is that has such varied material, and so much of it. Let's get started.<br />Jam- A lyrically powerful song, and also a good one to dance to. I had to read through the lyrics several times while listening because when I was just listening, I couldn't really understand what he was saying. Nonetheless, a good song.<br />Why You Wanna Trip On Me- This song has a fantastic beat and a good message. Michael uses a new vocal technique, and he pulls it off well.<br />In The Closet- This song is so incredibly sexy. It is great to dance to, and is probably one of his best.<br />She Drives Me Wild- You don't hear much about this song, but I really enjoy it. The title is pretty self-explanatory.<br />Remember The Time- I don't think I need to go too in depth with this song. It's one of his best known, and of course it's good.<br />Can't Let Her Get Away- I'm waiting for this one to grow on me. It's my least favorite on the album, but it is still high above all the garbage called music these days.<br />Heal The World- The album begins to slow down here. The previous six tracks were all fast dance numbers, and the sudden change is a treat. This song has sappy lyrics, but with Michael Jackson's voice and intentions, he sells it with grace.<br />Black or White- A complete commercial success, and for good reason. The lyrics and the beat set up an unbelievable hit. I could do without the intro.<br />Who Is It- I'm fascinated by this song. Who is he talking about anyway? He draws me in from the beginning on this one. A terrific song.<br />Give Into Me- Another great song. I absolutely love every second of it. Sexy, a little scary, and a bit depressing.<br />Will You Be There- When I first owned Dangerous, it was a cassette in elementary school. This was my absolute favorite song back in the day. It is a powerful song backed up by the Andrae Crouch Choir.<br />Keep The Faith- An amazingly uplifting song. Again, it's backed by the Andrae Crouch Choir. This is one of my favorite songs of all time.<br />Gone Too Soon- Reading the other reviews of this album, I find many disagree with the decision to put this track on Dangerous. It was written for or dedicated to Ryan White and I find that incredibly touching. Michael's voice is personal on this song and it provides a quiet, simple place on this very carefully engineered album. <br />Dangerous- The title track. A great song with a great beat. Lyrically it is also great. Michael Jackson has written many songs about girls, about girls who did him wrong, and what not, and this is by far the best one. It helps that he did an incredible dance number to this song on a few different programs.<br />All in all, this is a fantastic album teeming with amazing songs. You can't find an album like this nowadays. I highly recommend to any music fan, buy this album, and you will compensated with the first listen.
B00000099Y|5.0|I bought this CD thinking I would like only a few tracks which I had heard previously. I was plesantly suprised to find out that this was not the case with Aenima. Tool keeps up the pace throughout the entire CD without slowing down until the ride is over. This has to be one of the best CD's in my collection thus far. I strongly advise you to buy this CD if you're a mild tool fan or just a rock fan looking for something new to put in your CD collection.
B00005QHPQ|3.0|As super-fine as his daddy ever was, his music makes me sleepy like his dad's music did in the eighties.  In Miami, back when all my friends and family played Julio Iglesias like some of my other friends and family played Al Green a decade before.  Middle aged women freaked, whenever Enrique's Pop came on TV.  I'm a Victor Manuelle, Eddie Santiago, etc.... East Coast & Caribbean sound fan.  I like my ballads with a Caribbean beat.    Personally, his voice is as fragile as Madonna's, It's the \\"total package\\" that works for artists like Enrique, Janet Jackson, Madonna- those that don't possess power voices, but have alot of \\"Umph.\\"    Power voices like Mark Anthony's, I prefer in Spanish-for the full effect. Eric Bonet is very sexy and he has a sweet voice.    Enriques videos seem like a perpetual \\"who to do\\" of the celebrity world.  I'm only a few years older than Enrique, but I guess old enough to start looking for something deeper in music videos.  but all I see is heavy sweating on my screen.  I feel like the bewildered parents in that Apple Jacks commercial, when the kids respond \\"We eat what we like!\\".
B000066NW0|5.0|Independent teenage skater chick, Avril Lavigne, is rocking up the charts today.  Her new CD, &quot;Let Go&quot; is winning the hearts of millions from all age groups.  You may have seen her video for &quot;Complicated&quot; on MTV's Total Request Live or up for Nickelodeon's &quot;Nick Pick&quot; of the day, for example.  She describes her style best as &quot;Avril Lavigne&quot;.  Not only is her personality admirable, but listening to her music is inspriational.  She writes from her heart, and expresses herself through her lyrics.  The blend of pop and rock that Avril and her band play is fun to listen to, and great to blast through your speakers when you're sitting at home with a friend.  Summer is just beginning.  By the time fall comes, everyone should be jammin' to Avril in their car.  Rock on!  I love Avril!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely the best novel I have ever read.  I did a book report on it last year and expected it to be like any other book I had read that year, but I was in for a surprise.  I found every page to have a deeper meaning, than it appeared, that clued the reader in on how one should live life, or what the \\"real world\\" is really like.  This is a book that everyone can benefit from reading.  The values and emotions exposed in this book are too great to tell about.  One must read this book to understand the depth of its greatness.  This is terrific book for book reports, but also an excellent choice for personal enjoyment as well.  If you have not read this book then you are truly missing out.
6304493681|4.0|After finishing ghost in the shell you'll most likely say \\"That was just the introduction right?\\" No, ghost in the shell isn't really short ( 88 minutes ) but there isn't much of a story line beyond the world they live in. It's kind of one of those \\"What does it mean to be human?\\" plots.<br />For an action movie Ghost In The Shell has very little action. But every time there is an action scene it`s excellent beyond all reason.( The Major beats the monkey out of a guy while she's invisible on top of a roof ).<br />Ghost In The Shell is also really REALLY confusing. It's actually kind of like mission impossible. Mostly talk then it blows you away with unbalieveble fight scenes.<br />This movie is kind of for adults. Not because it's inapropriate but because it would bore the cheese out of little kids. It's (like I said earlier) very confusing. Lot's of stuff about section 9 section 3, ghost this, ghost that. Kids really wouldn't enjoy it.<br />Ghost in the shell is an overall high quality movie. It has top-notch animation (better than the manga which is very unusual. Well actually the manga doesn't have animation, it has drawings, but you know what I mean). And really good voice acting. But there isn't a lot of CG like everyone says there is. Not like Metropolis.<br />It would hard to give a rating to Ghost in the shell (By rating I mean like R and PG-13, not like 4 stars and 5 stars) because first of all it's a cartoon which changes things a bit, and it doesn't have a lot of innapropriate stuff but when there IS blood there's a lot of it. Of course there's a lot of nudity too but it's never in a sexual manner or without reason. Like when they make the robots they're obviously going to be \\"without cloths\\". By todays rating system it would most probably be rated from PG-13 to R. But I would say that a reasonably mature 12 years old could handle it.<br />Ghost In The Shell is messed up, but at the same time completely amazing. You should definitely check it out, but it's not for everybody.
0452282152|3.0|The plot has been told. These are my thoughts.<BR> <BR> Chevalier writes a touching story and writes it well. There is hopelessness in Griet's yearning for Vermeer; and yet, a sense of quiet, inner fulfillment, if only partial, is achieved by the simple meeting of their eyes and in his desire to paint her portrait. Though there is some question as to his feelings for her, a long awaited consummation occurs when he, in the end, bequeaths the pearl earrings to her.<br /> Griet's relationship with Pieter is the plight of a woman's married life during the 17th century. Love is secondary. Love may not even exist. Pieter is smitten by Griet, but Griet's acceptance of marriage to him is less of love, more of necessity. Pieter is the economic safety for Griet and her family. A woman must do as she's expected, like it or not. (Griet never expresses like or dislike.)<br /> Van Ruijven's lascivious acts, openly displayed and tolerated by those observing, is more evidence of the subjugation - to the point of humiliation - of women in centuries past.<br /> Chevalier, without personal commentary or injection of political and social bias, has clearly portrayed the social and economic injustices of that era.<br /> Like a painter, Chevalier has created a sensitive love story by skillful weaving of subtleties and nuances; and just as the painter's intentions and meanings of his finished product may be discerned only by careful viewing, Chevalier's intentions must be similarly revealed.
B000065U1N|5.0|Best movie of the Year. Period. Forget what other feeble minded people say about this movie. It is excellent and will really hit home if you have ever served your country in the Military. Other reviewers say it is confusing. DUH. War is confusing and as many of us who have been there know it is also very acelerated and fast.  I bought the book only a few days after it came out and it kept my attention through every last page.<br />Being a new soilder when the events in Somalia where first taking place, I never new that so much happened until I read the book and numerous other accounts of the situation.  War is scary,fast,slow,mean,lovely,brutal,glorious,disgusting, and on and on and on.....<br />This movie shows that not everyone is a hero. Like the character says in the movie, \\"just do your duty\\" politics and everything else be damned. Those who can't understand that are usually the ones who never served their own country.  Get this movie and try to put yourself in that situation. Think about it and know that there are people like this (young sons and daughters) that do that stuff everyday just for you and this great country. <br />I give this movie 5 stars (saw it twice in the theater and now own the DVD). Watch it a few times and you will always see more and understand things better.
B000066NW0|5.0|Awesome voice, amazing personality, great songs, she's hot, and she's Canadian...what more could we ask for in North America's hottest new musical talent?  In a debut CD, Let Go, that is all her own, Avril Lavigne, from small-town, Napanee, Ontario, demonstrates that age and experience don't make the musician, it's talent, personality, and down-right boldness.  Avril has no problem with saying what's on her mind in this--well, there's no better word to describe it than amazing-- first effort.  With  her hot single 'Complicated', including several other sizzling tracks, 'Let Go' displays both sides of Avril's personality, the soft and the rough.  Examples of these contrasting dimensions of personality are 'Things I'll Never Say' and 'Losing Grip'.  'Things...' is about a person Avril wants to be with, with floaty, smooth vocals and music.  'Losing Grip' is about someone Avril was with at one time, and was not emotionally supportive, was not there when she really needed him; the vocals and music are heavier than most of the other songs.  In closing, Avril Lavigne's debut CD is the 'milk and cheerios in my spoon', and it works on several levels.  I've said it before, and I'll say it once more:  An AMAZING first effort!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Get it...listen...turn down the lights...grab your sweetheart...light the fire...cozy up...what a warm wonderful album.  Can't wait to see the future of this star.
B000066NW0|5.0|Wow, lookin for an amzing cd to kick back and listen to while u laze around all summer, well here it s. Let Go by Avril Lavigne is the most amazing cd ive ever heard, not only do i LOVE ALL the songs, but i also LOVE the artist. Her lyrics arent unrelatable to teens today, but instead ronically familiar. They parallel our lives, and offer a lil bit off comfort. this cd is worthy of a listen from everyone, including YOU!
0783226063|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies ever made. Dont waste your time on that horrible TV movie... Take the time to see this movie. It has a great story, excellent characters and is an all around fantastic movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|For start, the movie is really great, is not for just kids as many people say, im 15 and i like it, the special effects are good, when you start to see it, the movie introduce you in a world of magic, i cant wait to see the new one (the chamber of secrets), if you dont wanna buy it, go and rent it, in other hand im a little disappointed of the DVD, yes i admit, it has a lot of stuff, but i think that is not that great as all the people tought, anyway..., just check it.
0671027344|5.0|this guy has really been through a lot. it is really amazing how this one boy tells all that happened in his life by writing letters. Wonderfully done... i think.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have to say that at the first, i was not really interested in see this movie, but in the moment that i rented it, i realized that is one of my favorite movies ever, is so great, the songs in it are just awesome, a great musical, fun, interesting, with an amazing performances, wow, in addition to this, the format in DVD has a lot of stuff, with videos, photo gallery, behind the scenes and many more things that are just waiting for you to come to see them.
0312979479|5.0|Many of the other reviews are correct.  Once I picked up this book and began reading it, I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  In fact, this is one of the best books I've ever read.  Highly, highly, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys great books
B000066NW0|5.0|The first time I ever heard of Avril Lavigne was when I was watching MTV one day, and from just listening to the first verse of her song &quot;Complicated&quot;, I could relate to what she was saying from my own personal experiences. Her album's songs range from lyrics that are from telling to you be true to yourself, going on a new path, and to listen to your own thoughts. Avril is like Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and Alicia Keys with the fact that she plays her own instrument, but she is different because she plays the electric guitar which adds a whole new sound to whatmost people are used to hearing from a girl. Avril sings abut real stuff, unstead of losing boyfriends or anything on that level. This CD has been in my cd player since the day I got it 3 weeks ago, some of her songs sound the same, but I could never get tired of listening to her albumb since she has a mix of everything.

B00005R2M3|5.0|On my first listen, I didn't really appreciate Shakira's sound and voice, but after about 70 more listens, I will just review each song:<br />1)\\"Objection (Tango)\\"- This is a really great dance song which may take a few listens to get used to. I think this is what Shakira said she was releasing as her 3rd single off of the album. It's not the best song on here, but is still really good.<br />2)\\"Underneath Your Clothes\\"- This was the second single off the album, it is a really good ballad that is not about sex like you think it would be. It draws you in from the first note. Really good song!<br />3)\\"Whenever, Wherever\\"- This song is awesome! It was her debut song in English and is great. It has a great beat and awesome lyrics to go with it.<br />4)\\"Rules\\"- This song is good too. This is the song that gets her compared with Alanis Morissette. Some of the vocals in here will remind you of Alanis's song \\"Ironic.\\" When not being compared, this song can stand on it's own feet.<br />5)\\"The One\\"- Okay, this is my second favorite song on the cd. It's a love song, but a very different type of love song. A rock-ballad would be best to describe it. It has a haunting melody and beautiful lyrics that make you see a relationship from a different point of view.<br />6)\\"Ready For The Good Times\\"- This song would be just a normal pop song, but Shakira always manages to put her own spin on things in her lyrics. In this song she compares herself to a cat. But, it's mostly just about forgetting bad stuff and being 'ready for the good times.'<br />7)\\"Fool\\"- This is a rock song all the way. Again, the lyrics are like poetry. Here, Shakira is desperately in love with a man who doesn't want her and she doesn't notice how bad he's treating her. It is awesome.<br />8)\\"Te Dejo Madrid (I'm Leaving Madrid)\\"- Despite the song being completely in Spanish, it is a great rock song. When translated, the lyrics are again great. (You can get translations from shakira.com) <br />9)\\"(Poem To a)Horse\\"- This is another great song where Shakira's voice sounds incredible and the lyrics fantastic. It has a really catchy chorus.<br />10)\\"Que Me Quedes Tu (As Long As I Have You)\\"- This is my favorite song off the cd. It is a ballad done completely in Spanish. I normally would not have listened, but I gave it a chance. What kept me listening was the power in Shakira's vocals that sounds so beautiful. Don't judge based on the 30 second clip, listen to the whole song!<br />11)\\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\"- This is the English version of Shakira's debut Spanish song, 'Ojos Asi.' It is really cool, and once you get used to the weird parts of the song, it is really good.<br />12)\\"Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)\\"- Spanish version of song #3<br />13)\\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Objection)\\"- Spanish version of song #1<br />All in all, awesome cd with beautiful lyrics and powerful vocals. If you want great music, this cd is for you. Don't judge on the little clips, listen to the whole cd twice before judging.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the best cd ever.  I love all the songs on the CD, but I'm mostly interested with Sk8tr Boi... It's the best song..you should really buy this CD EVERY PENNY IS WORTH IT! Avril Lavigne has the best music and will continue to make many more incredible songs!  If you are a true Avril Lavigne fan you shouldnt be reading this! you should have the CD already.  Even though I'm a guy, and I like bands like Blink182, and Sum41..AVRIL IS BETTER..so get this cd...and remember<BR>AVRIL ROCKS!!!
0446310786|5.0|The story is about a girl, Scout, growing up in a very small town. Her father takes a case that will change their family's whole life. It is witty and deep, all at once.It is the absolute best book in the world. The way Harper Lee narrates this book in a growing girl's point of view is fantastic. You'll never be able to put the book down!
B000066NW0|5.0|Nothing I could say to anyone about Avril would even AMOUT to the pure joy of Listening to her voice and words!! She is soooo not fabricated or fake, un like all the other artists out there now trying to makew it with things that they have not even wrote or felt, on top of that to feel your pain going through the guitar strings vibrating your hands!! That is true power!!! She has been scorned with all that a guy could do to a girl...to sing about it to strangers is like....WOW!! You are a brave girl Avril!! Thanks L.A Reid for finding my voice and new best friend!!
0064471837|5.0|Sabirel made me do something with fantasy that I hadn't in a long time -- loose all my cynicism.  On guard against overpowered stock characters, as I read it I found myself relaxing.  There's powerful magic, but it's tricky and has a price on it that makes sense.  The characters engaged my sympathy.  It took me back to a time when I discovered fantasy authors like Jane Yolen or Susan Cooper - young adult fantasy that I could understand when I was in elementary but intelligent enough to be appreciated once I was older as well.<br />And hey, it even has a talking \\"cat\\" that I liked.  I usually HATE talking cats.  The book's highly recommended.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is the quintessence of musical talent.  I can't seem to put her cd down because I always want more.  Avril's songs (which she wrote on her own) have a nice beat without being obnoxiously pounding.  This is definitely a must for anyone's cd collection.  You will find yourself falling in love with Avril's sweet voice and her awesome guitar skills every time you listen to it.  This Canadian artist knows how to rock on and keep the entertainment coming!

B00005J6UP|5.0|Like a lot of Eightie's kids I grew up watching The Goonies. There's so much nostalgia in it for me. One summer I watched this movie every other day, it seems. It was on the Disney Channel, and my parents taped it, and get this: it had the deleted scenes, in their proper placement! When I heard other Goonies fans talk about the deleted octopus scene and convenience store scene, I was confused, because I always saw the movie with them in it. Weird, huh? In fact, who decided to take them out?<br />Anyway, there's no denying that this movie is still funny and adventure-filled without seeming too out-dated. Don't let the 1985 date fool you: it's as good and fun as the Indiana Jones movies. The special effects look great, even without fancy computer animation. Kids will stay entertained with its fast-paced story, and those of us that are older will appreciate lines like: &quot;'1632, is that a date or something?' 'No, it's your top score on Pole Position.'&quot; and the irony of &quot;Mikey, I'm gonna hit you so hard, when you wake up, your clothes will be outta style!&quot; Maybe the clothes really will be back in style someday.<br />The DVD release promises to be perfect for every true Goonies fan. It Includes commentary by the whole cast, those deleted scenes, and Cyndi Lauper's music video. If you're interested in a movie with good character dynamics, a Steven Spielberg story, and something that's appropriate for the whole family, you should already own this movie. If not, I'm telling you, this is first-rate family entertainment. You won't be dissappointed.

B00006690F|4.0|This album contains the usual celebrity bashing, battle rapping, anger filled style songs... but it also contains a different side of Eminem. There are emotional songs, music / political songs, and Em even experiments by using different production methods for songs (more instrument filled tracks)... <br />This could be an Eminem album either loved or hated by Eminem's long-time fans... some fans may be turned off by these songs because they sound less hiphop orientated, but for fans who are not afraid to hear something different this could be the perfect album for you... On an MTV2 interview Eminem stated that guitars are not used alot in hiphop and on this album he takes advantage of the instrument, and a good number of the tracks on this contain some guitar playing.... AND HE DID A GOOD JOB!!! It helped give the instrumentals more life and made them more tolerable to listen to as Em flowed over them...<br />Lyrically Eminem's flow has improved VERY WELL and he still contains that emotion behind the words, but it seems his vocab has gotten simpler... but then again as long as he proves his point, big words don't' matter....<br />Eminem addresses musical / political issues on \\"White America\\" where he talks about how racism in music benefited him. He talks about his downfall relationship with his mother on \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\". In \\"Square Dance\\" Eminem replies to Canibus with a couple jabs, this may become one of hiphop's greatest feuds ever (i got my money on canibus though).  On \\"Sing For The Moment\\" Eminem talks about how musical influence on children may be nightmares for parents because they refuse to accept it. \\"Superman\\" is how Eminem brags he is the super-man that's SINGLE and brags about his lovelife. \\"Hailie's Song\\" is an ode to his daughter where he actually SINGS, which may have mixed reviews for some fans, but I enjoyed it...<br />Along with his 'serious' songs Eminem also has the playful / battle tracks. \\"Without Me\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Drips\\", \\"WhenThe Music Stops\\", and a VERY VERY HOT TRACK \\"Say What You Say\\" where Dre and Em talk about how they handle their opponents...<br />But some songs do fail to capture me such as \\"Soldier\\", \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", and even \\"'Till I Collapse\\" (the drumline is IRRITATING in it and hurt the track alot)... <br />Overall it's definitely a good album by Eminem... It may satisfy some, but it may turn off others... It matters how open people are to different material... There's still plenty shiners on here.... Only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is because it seems that in areas it could've been better, but its above average all over....<br />The bonus DVD is a nice add on to the CD (maybe cuz i got it for free)... there's bonus freestyles in it, interviews of eminem, 8 Mile trailer, and the bonus 'Slim Shady Cartoon' (the cartoon is really the only highlight of the DVD)...  the live freestyles were NICE on the ears but the camera man looked like he had Parkison's disease.  I sat through 2 interviews then after that i skipped through the rest cuz it was too repetitive.  When I first saw the 8 Mile trailer as a preview for \\"How High\\" it looked really well, but after watching eminem interviews i realized his acting is exactly how he sounds 'indifferent and mindless' almost looking like he has no acting skills...  however the Slim Shady cartoon was hysterical which made the DVD all worth it...   but overall the DVD was entirely the price i got it for FREE...  i think i'll just stick to buying Em's albums<br />If u like Eminem, check out Chino XL... Chino, the King of Punchlines, was hiphop's first celebrity basher and he may have influenced Eminem to diss everyone too... give Chino his well deserved props and pick up \\"I Told You So\\" and \\"Here To Save You All\\"...<br />
B000066NW0|5.0|The album \\"Let Go\\" by the beautifully talented awesome teen Avril Lavigne is the best thing since Sum 41 and No Doubt, and they rawk!, which means that \\" Let Go\\" RAWKS even harder. Once you have it playing in your car, its chill throughout the whole day. Especially the nights when you're feeling kinda down and need something to relate to. All the songs on this album is great!!!, I especially like the songs   \\"Naked\\", \\"Things I`ll Never Say\\", \\"Complicated\\",  \\"Sk8ter Boi\\", and  \\"Nobodys Fool\\". Her voice is just soooo sweet! This cd is a seriously must buy 2day.
0812550706|5.0|Common Science Fiction is about space ships and aliens.  REAL science fiction take a scientific principle or theory and develops a plausible story around it.  Orson Scott Card has done a superb job of creating a REAL science fiction work of art.  I put Card in the same category with Arthur C. Clark and Isaac Asimov.<BR>     Only 16 times since 1965 have both the Hugo award and the Nebula award been given to an author for the same novel in the same year.  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (1985) and the sequel &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; (1986), both by Orson Scott Card, are two of the 16.<BR>     Also highly recommended is &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;.  &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; is not a sequel, but a companion novel to &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.  A companion novel is a retelling of the same story, but from another character's perspective.  Easy to say - difficult to do!  Card showed his real genius here.  Although you know how it will end, you are still on the edge of your seat.
0312265859|3.0|I very much enjoy the series and have re-read ever book at least twice.  Its smart, funny and a slice of American culture most of us never get to see (Newark).  Unfortunatly, in attempting to grow and evolve the main character \\"Stephanie\\", Ms. Evanovich seems to have droped what made the character so apealing.  We went from a great character who could get herself in an out of trouble faster then you can wink into a more helpless character that has everyone else (including her mother) constantly having to save her.  All in all the book was a disappointment.  The last couple of books in the series I pre-ordered just to make sure I could read it as soon as it came out.  Next time I think I'll just wait until it's available at the local library.
6302378648|5.0|This movie is yet another powerhouse brought to movie-lovers by none other than director Marty Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro. YAY!!! I love these guys!!<br />The film is about a newly released con named Max Cady(De Niro) who ventures out into the world he's been out of for 14 years with one mission in mind: to make his ex-lawyer, Sam Bowden(Nick Nolte) and his family pay. Ya see, our fearless, law-obiding lawyer here purposely withheld evidence during Cady's trial that would've set him free. Sam broke the law to remove a rapist from society.<br />Cady went in the bighouse just an illiterate man from Atlanta, but came out a sociopathic avenging angel complete with Biblical expressions tattooed on his skin. He also learned to read and read everything from philosophy to law books. He plans his reckoning the day of his release.<br />Sam, unbeknownst to Cady's release, is dealing with dilemmas of his own. He still lives with the guilt of Cady's trial along with suspicions of unfaithful actions from his wife, Leigh.(Jessica Lange)He also must contend with the fact that his teenage, MTV-oriented daughter, Danielle (Juliette Lewis) was recently expelled from school for smoking marijuana. As you can see, the Bowden family is anything BUT functional. So it's that withering stability that provides more fuel to Max's scorching fire.<br />Max deals with each member of the Bowden family individually. He confronts Sam, promising that he's gonna learn about loss. He has a moment with Leigh when she retrieves her mail, and then tries to manipulate Danielle in her school's drama pit. Max even roughs up Sam's \\"mistress,\\" Lori. All of these encounters come together in one last stormy show-down on Cape Fear.<br />De Niro is very show-y in this film with his elaborate tattoos, Southern accent, long hair and muscular body. It's a twist of the old cliche that evil is always grotesque. That's hardly so for De Niro's characterization of Maximillian Cady. His actions ARE grotesque and disturbing, but not his appeal. He's attractive man...who just happens to be evil.He's just fun to watch, from beginning to end. Marty couldn't have found anyone else to do it better.<br />Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, and Juliette Lewis give awesome performances, too. I applauded Juliette Lewis the most though. She really carried her own weight for this film. Gotta give her a lotta kudos for that...especially for the 9-minute drama-pit sequence. Whoa!<br />Martin Scorsese's direction and Thelma Schoonmaker's fantastic editing make this movie even more worthwhile. It's genius!disturbing, but not his appeal.

B000065V1V|2.0|As with the Elvis Costello release earlier this year, I once again fell victim to the hype and rushed out to buy Bowie's new one. What a disappointment. I know it's almost sacreligious to denounce a Bowie effort, but I just don't see what all the excitement over Heathen is about. There's really not one tune on here that hops off like a &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; or &quot;Golden Years.&quot; In fact, the Bowie I hear on the radio these days is not Bowie from Heathen but rather Bowie from the early days. This cd is probably playing well with those grasping to hang on to their &quot;Aren't I cool cuz I listen to Bowie&quot; mentality that may have meant something in the 70s and early 80s, but it's over folks. Move on now. Bowie is washed up and Heathen proves it. Am I going to hell now?
0451524985|4.0|When I first began to read Lady Chatterley's Lover I thought it was going to be quite a chore. I'm used to flowery language and all that, but I just wasn't in the mood for what I anticipated to be a sex-charged love story. Much to my surprise I got MUCH more from this wonderful classic.<br />D.H. Lawrence makes some striking observations about the state of the social classes in post WWI England, as well as providing some good insights into tough individual decisions we make in regard to relationships. I had limited knowledge of the post-war subject beforehand, but I felt that I learned a great deal in the process of reading. At times the book seemed repetitive, as if Lawrence were beating me over the head with his message, sacrificing character and plot in the process, but after all was said and done I couldn't say that it was a bad book. It's a very insightful, multi-layered work and I'm very glad I read it. The fact that the book was widely banned from publication in its early days is just another tempting reason to read it although, by today's standards, what was so risqué then borders on the ridiculous for us now. As long as you remind yourself of the time period in which it was written you'll be just fine...the laughs and raised eyebrows in conjunction with more serious themes are a pleasant mix.
B00005QDW5|1.0|I'm very dissapointed in this. I'm just glad I signed this out of a library and didn't buy it. I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I do like the cover art, but I've got that on a [cheap] poster I bought to admire. I was a little curious to give this a go because I heard new mixing makes this album sound like one continuous song. I soon discovered how wrong an assumption that was. It sounds choppy. Very ameture, I could have done better with the fade in/out knob on my tape deck. Many people have mentioned classics are missing. Where's \\"Interstellar Overdrive?\\" Where's \\"Have a Cigar?\\" If Pink Floyd want to initate new fans who are too [shy] or have too little attention to listen to the original albums, they should have taken an example from Led Zeppelin. There really should have been two double disc sets, both discount priced. One for the early era, 1967 to 1975, and the other 1975 to present. The rabid fanboys or completists could get both and would have a four c.d. boxed set. Also, the songs should either be better crossfaded, or perhaps, the un-written rule could be broken and the songs from concept albums could be remixed, so there would be proper starts and endings. This might mean occasionaly alternate takes would be needed or live versions, thus giving the collector more of reason to buy this, and fans a chance to rebuy Pink Floyds \\"Best\\" or \\"Greatest Hits\\" within the context of concept albums, and would not be wasting their dough, because the songs would be a little different. I will not buy this. I want more Floyd DVD's. Do the Floyd need more of my pocket money? Bring on the DVDs of Pulse and Live at Pompie. Release the documentary I saw on TV shilling the live Wall album. Release a DVD with all the music videos. There's lots of Floyd promo films and music videos and live footage just wasting away, PUT IT ON A ... DVD!!! IT WOULD SHIFT MILLIONS!!! I know I'd buy it. Pink Floyd are ... a visual band, they should be exploiting themeselves with DVDs not K-tel stylehits packages. And I want more rarities!!! David Gilmour lied to you in 1992 when that stupid waste of C.d. \\"Shine On\\" came out, there are lots of Floyd rarites. Tons! This is what I want! Come on, David, want my money, not going to tour? Then do as I say, ...
0553103547|5.0|There are lots of books in the genre, but this one stands out for three reasons:  a) children act like children and adults act like adults; b) bad -- and permanent -- things happen to good people; and c) the writing style is absolutely top notch.<br />In short, a good book for the demanding reader.  I hope the others in the trilogy match up.

B000002UDB|1.0|Wow.  It is very difficult to find strong songs on this album.  Out of 12 tracks there are only four of note:  Magical Mystery Tour, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane.  Songs like Your Mother Should Know and Flying are truly throwaways. <br />These strong tracks from MMT should have been put on the Sgt. Pepper album instead of junk like When I'm 64 and Within You Without You.  That would have been a 5-star album.
B00005NWM3|5.0|this album is incredible!  i saw nickelback in concert without owning any of their cd's.  my friend gave me a free ticket so i went with him. i didnt know any songs, except of course the 2 radio songs (how you remind me and too bad).  the concert was incredible. a few months after the concert i was able to finally get silver side up.  when i put it in i listened to it all the way through and it has not left my car since.  so much powerful rock on this album and the lyrics are terrific.  the highlights are never again, hollywood, and where do i hide.  the 2 radio songs were overplayed but are definitely one of the reasons the album is so great.  i recommend getting this album. you will not be dissapointed!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|There's a lot to say about this amazing newcomer to the music scene.  She's filled with a lot of energy and is good at making her music.  The lyrics of her new CD &quot;Let Go&quot; comes from nowhere but the depths of her own mind and heart. Her songs are amazing and possess great honesty about life.  The hit song &quot;Complicated&quot;, for example, teaches people to be themselves as much as possible.   She has a style all her own and is not afraid to show the world what she's made of.  I guarantee this girl's gonna ROCK THE WORLD!
B00005NWZ2|4.0|Terrific remaster by Tony Visconti of this classic album. I have no idea what the negative reviewers are talking about; there is no \\"drop out\\" on Mambo Sun.  The cover art was never much to begin with, even on the original album - and I have an original US copy of the album, thanks.  The poster shot of Bolan from the album is not here, and yes, the lack of lyrics is slightly disappointing. However, you get priceless notes on the recording of the album from Tony Visconti. There are also extra photos of Marc and the band, and the illustrations from the album's inner paper sleeve (hey, we didn't get that in America!!). To me this makes up for the lack of lyrics. I know them all by heart anyway.<br />Enough of that; what you should be worried about is the sound. The sound is absolutely terrific. I compared this with my Japanese CD and the difference was night and day.  It was as if a layer of fog had been lifted from the music; everything is sharp and clear. I was surprised at how much of Bill Legend's drum parts and Steve Currie's bass I had been missing out on all these years! And the peculiar details of Marc's guitar playing really come into focus. (Make sure you check the liner notes for Visconti's comments on Bolan's musical quirks.)<br />Of course the album itself is a classic. How can you argue with a CD that has both \\"Get it On\\" and \\"Jeepster,\\" both brilliant 70's rock songs?  Not to mention Bolan's mystical eldritch side, encapsulated in \\"Cosmic Dancer,\\" and \\"Monolith.\\" And the wistful \\"Life's A Gas,\\" the charmingly inept \\"Lean Woman Blues,\\" and \\"Rip Off,\\" which is still pretty strange today; all this adds up to a great album, then and now. Bolan both invented and transcended \\"glam rock\\" on Electric Warrior.<br />The bonus tracks sound equally good, but are mostly useful for T. Rex fans like me, who want to hear what the songs were like when Bolan was working out the details in the studio with the band. It sounds like recording this album was a lot of fun. Bolan laughs and kids around a lot, and as a result the bonus tracks convey his innate charm and enthusiasm. The outtakes also show us interesting stripped-down alternate versions of familiar songs, some with alternate lyrics.<br />Overall, this 30th Anniversary reissue is highly recommended. Bolan's albums have not always gotten the best treatment in the past when they were reissued on CD, but Visconti's remix is a must-have, and worthy of Marc Bolan's legacy.lan laughs and kids around a lot, and as a result the bonus tracks convey his innate charm and enthusiasm.

B000002UAO|2.0|The Beatles should have issued one awesome album by combining the best 12 or 13 songs of Rubber Soul and Revolver.<br />Rubber Soul starts off strong with Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, You Won't See Me and Nowhere Man - then it falls off the cliff with the weak Think for Yourself, The Word, Michelle and What Goes On.  Among the final tracks, If I Needed Someone and In My Life are good.  If you can burn CDs, just combine the best of the two albums, then you can listen it straight through without songs like Michelle, Eleanor Rigby and Yellow Submarine.<br />I know everyone rates this highly, but I can only justify 2 stars.
B000000HHE|5.0|This is an awesome album. Why did they leave behind the innovation and start producing dime a dozen hip hop [stuff]? The new stuff is no where near as cool as the stuff on this album.

B00003CY5J|3.0|I picked this movie up at Blockbuster one night, attracted by the name of Edward Norton. Then I glanced at the others - Robet De Niro, Marlon Brando, Angela Bassett - and I was sold. There was no way that a movie with this much sheer acting muscle behind it could be bad. <br />Boy, was I had. The movie wasn't BAD; not by any means. But it was so ...ordinary... I was gaping in disbelief by the end. <br />De Niro plays an aging thief who wants to quit the business to settle down with his long-time girlfriend - played by Angela in a hugely expendable role. (To make it worse, the role was an even more huge squandering of her fine abilities.) Brando, as De Niro's character's boss and old friend, was also almost as unnecessary for the storyline to progress. He hardly appears in any scenes and the ones that he is in, his &quot;humor&quot; is tried, tired, and forced. Norton is the youngster; the newcomer who wants to take part in the heist of a priceless artifact and show off his smarts. Norton performed beautifully, as expected. But the role was so easy and unchallenging for him, you could visibly see him &quot;overacting,&quot; trying to wrig some dimension into his character of Jack. <br />But I could find little fault in the performances of this movie. It was the story itself that was too bogged down in cliche to really fly. As far as crime-caper movies go, this one didn't break any molds, and it even felt like it lacked a climax (but that could just be me). The lack of originality and genuine inspiration ultimately cancelled out any help the superb cast could have lent. All in all, a commendable try, but hardly worth making a fuss about.

B000066NW0|5.0|avril has broken into the music scence with a extrodinary album to make her name known world wide. she uses her amazing vocals to blast you away and give you a peak to her inner self through her personally written songs. ballads such as &quot;i'm with you&quot; and &quot;tomarrow&quot; show her softer side while &quot;losing my grip&quot;  and &quot;unwanted&quot; are rock filled anthems-to-be. her songs have allowed me and i am sure many other teens to finally relate to someone who puts there all into there music. avril shows that you can be yourself and still sell records and make it big! this is one you the best cds i have ever heard!

You'll find yourself staring off into space thinking deeply about a concept you just read about.  I want to keep this book to give when I have a daughter turning 15 one day.  This book is destined to be a classic.

B000002UA5|3.0|This album has to be taken in two parts: so, I'll review it that way.<br />The live stuff: VERY good. I've never heard the studio versions of \\"Axe\\" or \\"Saucerful\\", but hearing them on this disc makes me want to go out and buy the album. The organ on \\"Heart of the Sun\\" has a great solo at about 4:00 - really cheezy organ sound but it sounds perfect. Rick Wright is really given a chance to shine on this album. Check out \\"Saucerful\\"s wonderful, majestic coda. I think Tang. Dream must have been listening to this song when they were putting together \\"Alpha Centauri\\".<br />The studio stuff: this is probably the WEIRDEST floyd you'll ever hear; I don't think they ever got farther out than \\"Several Species\\", or as annoying as in \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\". And on \\"Sisyphus\\" Rick just pounds away on the mellotron and piano, trying to sound like John Cage it seems. But I do have this to say in the disc's favor: \\"Narrow Way\\" is a lovely guitar piece, sounds twice as good when you play it really loudly. And \\"Several Species\\" DOES make sound musical sense in that it has a definable rythym and melody (?), unlike \\"Adam's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" or the Beatle's \\"Revolution 9\\".<br />All in all, I'd say buy this album only if you already have all the classic Floyd albums (AHM-Animals), and even then, only for the live stuff and cool packaging. Early morning deserted country road, the gear arranged to look like an F-14 bomber. Duuude.
6305499365|5.0|This is going to sound like a broken record after reading all the other reviews, but definitely BUY THIS MOVIE! I didn't think I would even like it because I usually prefer more highbrow stuff(rented at the recommendation of a coworker), but I had a 5-night rental and ended up WATCHING IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I now own it, and it is a joy to watch -- I keep noticing something new. There is broad humor here, but the real gems are in the little details that make our offices (and lives) pure hell. If you have ever wanted your cubicle neighbor to turn down their radio; if you have ever been forced to comply with memos that defy common sense; if your office has ever been taken over by arrogant consultants -- you owe it to yourself to check this out. Not high art, but really, really smart.

0060922583|3.0|I'll confess that I have not yet read the book.  I'd like instead to just comment on the reviews.  First of all, the interest in higher dimensions has permeated all of mathematics and physics for about 100 years.  So it's amazing that at this late date someone can come along and say &quot;the universe may have higher dimensions&quot; and still be applauded as a visionary.  The idea may indeed be profound, but it is certainly not novel.  (See &quot;Flatland&quot; for starters.)  Second, the idea of holographic or distributed memory has been chewed-on and digested both in the fields of artificial neural networks and cognitive psychology.  Consult any one of the hundreds of recent textbooks in these fields for the details.  For myself, I'll look forward to reading Talbot's book, but based on the other reviews I can't say that the anticipation is killing me.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ever heard that rockin' song \\"complicated\\" on the radio and wondered who sings it? Well<BR>I'll tell you who, the awesome Avril Lavigne. Her C.D. Is the best thing you can pick up<BR>this year! 13 full length tracks, and unlike many other artists she writes her own music. <BR>From her rockin' tune \\"Sk8er Boi\\" to her slower more calm song \\"I'm with you\\" You get<BR>full absolutely awesome music accompanied by the lyrics written by 17 year old, small<BR>town Canadian girl Avril Lavigne. And if that isn't enough you find all of the lyrics inside<BR>of the little front booklet, as well as pictures.  She isn't fake like those other artists, she<BR>sings about real experiences that have happened to her and I can relate to almost every<BR>song and I'm sure you could as well.

Yep, she's perfect with weddings, except when it comes to her own. <br />No doubt Mary has a successful career, but the audience can't help but wonder about her own love life. Well, at the moment, it's non-existant..unless you count Massimo [Justin Chambers], the simple and lovable Italian man that Mary's father tries to set Mary up with. Unfortunately for Massimo, Mary isn't attracted to Massimo..so he just follows Mary around like a puppy dog. <br />Other than that, things are fine in Mary's routine life, she's even about to nail a big account with Fran Donelly [Brigitte Wilson-Sampras], a successful businesswoman. Her life is quickly changed however, when one day she is rescued by a cute stranger, Steve Eddison [Matthew McConaughey]. She goes out with Steve and has a great time with him, and feels that she's finally found the perfect guy. That is, until Mary finds out that Steve is the fiancee of Fran Donelly. Mary has broken the golden rule of wedding planning: Never fall in love with the groom. <br />Mary can't lose the Fran Donelly wedding account..this is one of the most important accounts she's ever had. Can Mary just do her job and forget about Steve? After all, he's already engaged, right?<br />Watch the movie and find out:)<br />It seems like this would be another typical love story with a predictible ending. It actually does a good job of not being too cheesy or too predictible, at least as far as romantic comedies go. It's probably one of the most original story lines I've seen in a while, it seems like every single type of love story's been done already! The movie had a few choice funny moments, like whenever Mary tries to hide from Massimo..and the elderly friends of Mary's father add comedy with their witty comments and make the movie even more enjoyable, especially Bert:) Like I mentioned earlier, it's not too sappy, not too predictible, and does pretty well in the genre of romantic comedies. My only complaint would have to be the ending..it seemed a little too abrupt to me. Other than that, it's a great movie!<br />Oh, and another thing..sorry if my review [is poorly written], this is my first review, haha.
1559211407|5.0|An engaging work of non-fiction, Hanff relates her 20 year relationship with a London bookseller via the postal service, Starting in 1949, not long after the war when shortages in England were plentiful. Miss Hanff, a writer of TV scripts, writes her first letter to Marks &amp; Company Booksellers in search of rare books. It is the beginning of a long relationship that encompasses not only the man in charge of her account, Frank Doel, but the many workers at the company who come to love her teasing and sometimes biting letters, always followed by packages of powdered eggs and tins of meat during a time when meat is a scarcity. Her sarcastic nature comes across pleasantly as they banter across the ocean, she in New York and he in London.<br />This was a sweet compilation from a period in time that is not to be forgotten, brought to you with the personal whimsical taste of a woman who shared the love of a good book.

B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Scary Movie is a pretty damn funny movie! However, I felt there were many gags in this movie that could be put into any movie.<br />The plot is simple, but it's good to watch this movie when you're tired so you don't have a complicated plot to follow. I almost gave this movie 3 stars, but remembered the bathroom scene with the hole!!! That alone just earned a star. This movie contains some pretty crude/sexual content, but that's what makes it funny.<br />I'm not saying this is one of my favorite movies (because it's not) but it's definitely fun and good to watch at sleepovers, and not parents!
B000065U1N|5.0|If you read the reviews, from the critics and from the customers, you'll soon see the two sides developing. Actually more like four... There are those that thought the movie was an excellent look into the modern chaos of urban warfare, and that the DVD was a worthy purchase. There are those who felt similarly about the movie, but hated the DVD. Then there are those that thought the movie was hollywood or Army propaganda and the presentation was decent, and finally, those that hated both the movie itself and the DVD.<BR>I belong between the first and second groups.<BR>My advice is to pick up the book, of the same name, that was published about three years ago. The author was inspired by comments made by the father of one of the fallen rangers. With an excellent prospective, the book is a must read. If you read and find the book interesting, then you rent the movie. You watch the altered cleaner version. A film can not recreate the true sansation of combat, unless of course someone stood next to the projector in the theater and fired an AK-47 over the audience. The situation leading up to and following the events of October 3 and 4 were complicated, and I expect most people would have been far more displeased if they had been included. Simply, you should not listen to either side, you should think about it for yourself, because this is a serious and necessary topic of discussion. An earlier reviewer said this movie was just about following orders, they're right, that's exactly what it was. A soldier does not involve himself in politics, he just goes out and gets shot at for a living. That's what this film is about. Not the politicians that make mistakes; but the soldiers that must live with them, or perhaps  die.
B00004Z459|1.0|This album was by far one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  I had high hopes, then when I couldn't even listen through the full CD without needing a break, I knew it was poor quality music.  It sounds like Linkin Park tried to blend hip hop, rap, metal, rock, and electronics together in a style similar to that of Limp Bizkit.  The high-pitched male vocals (when they're actually SUNG) grate on my ears, and the clashing music genres drag down the album the whole way through.  This music seems to appeal mostly to angst-ridden teenagers who believe they've been through pain, when it's actually just what everyone goes through in their adolescence.
0767849493|5.0|No, seriously. As soon as I got that those two guys who appear in the movie are fallen angels I started to ejoy the movie and I enjoyed until the very end. I did not fall down on the floor laughing (I'm not a Catholic), but I did the same but on the couch. The actors are great, and the script is beyond compare. I can't really say why and how it is so good, so just watch it. Don't forget to go to imdb.com and read all that funny stuff about the movie after you watched it and then watch it again.
B000002INJ|5.0|I have to confess: I'm not a real heavy metal fan, and even within the heavy metal genre I don't particularly like the \\"fantasy metal\\" gods/swords/battle/death genre that Manowar exemplify.  The only reason I bought this album is that I'm a huge fan of the Dictators, and Manowar's lead guitarist is (was) Ross the Boss, one of the founders of the Dictators.  So nobody was more surprised than me when this album turned out to be a real ... pleasure!  The songs are heavy but are always melodic, unlike so much modern metal.  The musicianship is outstanding; in addition to Ross' killer guitar playing, Joey DeMaio shows off his bass chops in \\"Sting of the Bumblebee\\", a free adaptation of Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" (I'm surprised his fingers didn't fall off!).  The song lyrics are bombastic but (as far as I can tell) sung with tongue firmly in cheek.  The vocals are also great.  As I listened, I kept wanting to turn up the volume, always a good sign.  And as an added treat, there's the song \\"Pleasure Slave\\", which is so sexist I think even rappers would find it offensive ;-)  As for me, I'm definitely going to check out Manowar's other albums.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie does not go into the backgrounds of the characters or the motivation behind their involvement. I highly recommend you read the book by Mark Bowden and get to know the actual events and the people who were there. Someone mentioned the list of names at the end; it's not strange that you don't recognize the majority of the names, because most of those people were not depicticted, probably because introducing them and watching their struglle would be even more difficult. One named listed, Matt Rierson, was not killed during the battle, but during a mortar attack. Many of the others died on the convoys, while several characters died in different situations. For example, Lorenzo Ruiz was shot while manning a gun on a humvee...
B00005A46T|1.0|Once again, we have an album that is the product of excessive angst.  Slipknot takes the approach of yelling and screaming with loud, often overbearing background noise to get out their feelings about society and people.  Iowa is no exception to this pattern.  I have not been, and will continue to not be, an avid fan of Slipknot.  Try doing a little bit of actual singing sometime guys; it pays off.  I'd have to say this was one of my poorest, least educated music purchase decisions.
6304994540|5.0|This is my most favorite film of all times. Even the good all russian movies, most of which I watch and like, can't beat this one. I watched &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; about 15 times in the past year. I know the whole movie, I know what's gonna happen when and who's going to say what, etc, but I still enjoy it! When I first watched it, I was kinda shocked by the language they used (I wasn't used to that), but despite that I was laughing hard throughout the whole movie.<br />Now there are a couple of things you gotta understand about this movie. First of all, the cursing in this movie is on purpose, it's not because the makers of this film just decided that everyone should curse. That's just who they are and how they talk. Second, don't take it very seriously. The whole feeling of the movie dissappears if you take it seriously. Like somebody here said the movie has a paper-thin plot. It doesn't, really, it's just very light. I can't really explain it, but the whole movie holds that sense of &quot;lightness&quot; - probably how the Dude feels most of the time.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I know, a lot of people think this is a really great movie, but I just couldn't buy into it. I liked \\"Twin Peaks\\" a lot, but mostly Lynch's stuff leaves me cold. Too often, he just seems to be doing weirdness for weirdness' sake... leading the audience around by the nose, only to have the nose disappear at the end. The production is nice, in a moody way, and Laura Harring is certainly gorgeous, but that's not enough to salvage the movie. In the end, you don't know what really happened ... and you don't care.<br />Shortly after watching this, I watched \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" which is similar in some ways, but a much better movie in my opinion. I'm giving this one 3 stars for originality and high-grade production, but its structural flaws preculde rating it higher.
0783229526|5.0|I was mystified by the mainstream critical response to this movie...The book likewise consists of a series of drug-addled scenes of mischief and mayhem, though fueled by the furious intellect, precision, and humor of the Good Doctor's prose.<br />I will grant that to the uninitiated this movie is probably intimidating and hard to like.  The themes that Thompson so brilliantly examines are not so readily apparent in the movie.  To which my resonse would be, why the hell didn't you read the book first?  Much like The Fellowship of the Ring, this movie was clearly made by and for fans of the book who wanted to see all that gonzo imagery brought to life on the big screen.  In that, I believe Terry Gilliam succeeded admirably.  And Depp and Del Toro are spectacular--Depp basically BECOMES Dr. Gonzo.<br />If you see this movie and don't get it, read the book!  It should be required reading for anyone who believes in the perfection of the American Dream, the myth of the late 60's as a hippie utopia, or any number of other sacred cows.
B00004XOWM|1.0|All this album does the whole way through is make noise behind obnoxious, high-pitched, swearing Fred Durst vocals.  The only things that I can give this album is that it manages to keep a decent beat throughout, and the production of the MI2 theme song is alright.  The blend of musical styles, not dissimilar to Linkin Park, completely and utterly fails in this album.  I don't understand why artists think they can mix music genres such as metal, hip hop, rap, and electronica and think that they've produced a decent-sounding album.  Such blends are terrible.
B000066NW0|5.0|I recently bought Avril Lavigne's CD let go. I think it is a wonderful mix of all different styles of music, not just one. As for the person that says she claims to be punk...YOU do not know if she is PUNK or not because PUNK is actually a STATE OF MIND and I am assuming you don't know her. You cannot pile her music into a punk category either because there is a varity of different styles which makes the cd enjoyable to listen to. I encourage everyone to buy this cd because she and her band are truely talented. :)
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna's music has varied from her first album to her last.  Her music is probably not evolutionary because there appears to be little in the way of progression from &quot;Material Girl&quot; to the techno tracks of &quot;Music&quot;.  I do think that Madonna has taken the opportunity as a successful artist to experiment with her music, trying something new, sometimes new age, sometimes progressive, always trying to find what works for her.<br />Throughout her career, one thing has been a constant for Madonna:  She has the voice to carry beautiful ballads.  This CD is a collection of some of the most beautiful music Madonna has ever sang.  While not truly a greatest hits, many of the songs were in fact hits.  The goal of this album appears to be similar to that of Elton John's &quot;Love Songs&quot; CD, where Elton's mellow music was similarly collected.  Madonna's CD could also have been titled &quot;Love Songs&quot;, but of course that title was already taken, and the title reflects one of her hits included on this CD.<br />&quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot; from &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, an outstanding song, &quot;You'll See&quot;, perhaps Madonna's best song of all time (my opinion!), &quot;I'll Remember&quot; from &quot;With Honors&quot;, &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, and &quot;Something to Remember&quot; are among the highlights that exercise a voice that can be as absolutely gorgeous as the artist with the voice.  I could include most of the other songs on this CD as well, but these particular songs carry feelings that lesser artists would either have difficult to convey, or be unable to convey at all.  I sometimes feel so melancholy after listening to &quot;You'll See&quot;, that I sometimes get watery eyes.<br />Any downsides to this CD?  I admit I'm not very enthused about &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;.  It's not a bad song, but it hardly seems on par with the other songs on this CD.  Okay, it's a small thing, hardly worth noticing.<br />There are so few singers that have a voice that is an instrument by itself.  Madonna has a voice that belongs in that small group.  This CD gives a sampling of the capability of that instrument.  If you enjoy mellow music, and particularly if you enjoy Madonna's mellow music, this CD is a must have.so few singers that have a voice that is an instrument by itself.

1563896656|5.0|Those who insist that Moore has lost it since the early 90s must read this (and From Hell). Its such a great idea and I can't believe that noone thought of it before. Of course, you need a really literate author to tell this story, one who is familiar with the classics, and Moore appears to fit the bill perfectly. <BR>There is Nemo, Jekyll and Hyde, the Invisible man, Sherlock Holmes and more! Even a cameo by a grown up Dodger from Oliver Twist! Don't worry thought, you don't have to have read all those books to understand the story and most of the characters are famous enough so you'll know who they are anyway. Basically its the Justice League set in the past and using these classic chaeracters. It drenched in science fiction so if you are a purist then this is not for you. It reminds me a little of Wild Wild West, which also features impossibly futuristic (if mechanical) technology set in the past. All the characters, except perhaps Hyde, are excellent, but my favourite character is the female lead Mina from Dracula.
B000066NW0|5.0|The first Avril song I heard was &quot;Complicated&quot; which was on my local radio station. Then I saw the video on MTV (it's really cool, check it out on the enhanced cd version). I thought it was a fabulous song, so I decided to check out her debut. I just bought it today, and there's not one song not worth listening to. The whole album is a pop meets rock meets punk thing. The standouts are &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;My World&quot;, and &quot;I'm With You&quot;. Her first single, &quot;Complicated&quot; has great guiters, vocals, and sincerety. Everyone can relate to this song. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; has more punk; the guiter, vocals, lyrics, everything. It's a really fun song to dance to. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I'm With You&quot; are more pop/rock songs. &quot;My World&quot; is again, more of a rock song. The guiters are great in all of these. Her lyrics in this cd are truthful and personal, yet relatable. The rest of the songs are &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, &quot;Unwanted&quot;, &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;, and &quot;Naked&quot;. Overall, this is an impressive debut and I urge you to buy it - you'll enjoy it greatly.

B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is awesome!!I bought it when I heard a few songs on the radio + internet. This CD is incredibly easy to relate to. Avril is not some popstar who was found because of her looks, taught to lip synch and pretend to play guitar. She is from Napanee Ontario, a true Canadian,, with real talent. At 16 she recieved a record deal, and at 17, in only a year, she is at the top of many charts all over all of North America, as well as Europe and Asia!!This song is from a real person, who writes her own songs, so the songs are from the heart, and real experiences, not written by the record dealership.The songs are inspiring and make you want to sing along, or just listen to each story. This CD is incredibly original, and is a MUST buy!!

B00005UEAR|3.0|Dream Theater is one of those love-it-or-hate-it kind of bands. They are marvelously out of step with the times, playing hard, loud, fast, and heavily technical progressive metal--and they have outlasted 80s hair bands, early 90s grunge and alternative music, techno, and today's teenybopper bubblegum pop, without drastically changing their musical philosophy or their essential sound. Despite their obnoxiously prog tendencies, they are perhaps the world's most popular working progressive rock band, with a very large following especially among their fellow musicians. Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci are drum and guitar heroes in an age where top-level musicianship is hard to find, as older stalwarts like Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson of Rush tone down their virtuosity. Dream Theater still does songs clocking over 10 minutes, concept albums, 40 minute-long suites, and dazzling displays of speed and odd rhythmic meter. For those things along, they deserve commendation--except for one lapse, 1997's Falling Into Infinity, they appear immune to commercial pressure.<br />This album is their followup to what I regard as their masterpiece, 1999's Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. That album successfully fused their musical chops with cohesive songwriting, the latter being the band's longstanding primary weakness. They have always had a tendency to show off their instrumental abilities at the expense of good melody or musical development, which was most apparent in their album Awake and parts of A Change of Seasons. But in Scenes from a Memory, the music was at the forefront more prominently than in any previous work since Images and Words. Here, it seems that in order to fill two discs, the band has split their tendencies on both discs. The first disc is all about chops; the second about songwriting.<br />Drummer Portnoy had said that this album would be heavily experimental, and it shows in the first disc: new sounds such as record-scratching and buzz guitar are introduced to the Dream Theater oeuvre. Of course the double-bass drumming, guitar shredding, and bass runs are still there, but even for Dream Theater the results seem loose and unfocused. All but the final song on the disc clocks at over 10 minutes, and many of those minutes are spent in what seem like little more than free-form jams. Despite their musicianship, Dream Theater is not King Crimson: Crimson's ability to improvise has yet to be matched in the progressive rock world and is more comparable to that of skilled jazz musicians. I've long felt that Petrucci and Portnoy in particular need to show more restraint in their playing, and in the first disc they are all over the place.<br />The second disc, a single song clocking in at 43 minutes, is a considerable improvement; it largely follows and builds upon the musical ideas developed in their last album. As such, there is a welcome return to identifiable melody and motifs that graced Scenes from a Memory, with a fairly impressive melodic \\"Overture\\" that foreshadows the coming themes. The hard rock/death metal parts also actually fit the lyrics about mental illness and are actually parts of the varying mood of the song. In the middle portion, \\"Goodnight Kiss,\\" Petrucci controls his million-notes-a-minute tendency and plays with genuine soul, almost channelling the spirits of Brian May and David Gilmour. Jordan Rudess, whose soaring keyboard skills added much to the last album's greatness, is a little bit more in the background this time overall. Sadly, John Myung and his bass playing seem to fallen by the wayside on recent albums; normally, they even allow him to write one lyric but in this album, he has none. Though he does not seem to mind, this is a shame because, having seen him play in the Scenes from New York concert DVD, Myung is a fantastic bass player and a rare example of a successful Asian-American rock musician. The band is increasingly in the hands of Portnoy, who writes most of the the band's official correspondence, half the lyrics, and is even singing more, perhaps to give lead singer James Labrie some off-time. (Labrie's voice has deterioated considerably over the years.) The suite comes to a crashing close and a long-fade out, which works, as it reasserts the themes used throughout the song--though it does not approach the majesty of the last album's end.<br />Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is thus really two albums in one package, since the first and second discs are so different. It seems that the band might be deciding what direction to head in the future, and have given their fans two options to choose from in a way. I prefer the second disc's tendencies, where overt virtuosity does not have to be compromised much in order for actual musical development to shine; of course, I know no one listens to Dream Theater for the profound lyrics (they rarely are) or for melody: shredding is part of their identity. For these ex-Berkelee Music School school students, proudly waving the prog banner, that is perhaps all we can reasonably expect. This is no masterpiece like their last one, but it is certainly a good album, and may well still rank among the top of 2002's mainstream releases.espondence, half the lyrics, and is even singing more, perhaps to give lead singer James Labrie some off-time.

It is excellent for any women who shops like it's her job, pretends like she can afford it, and lies to her love ones who question them. This book is good because you can follow it up with Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.. lets all keep our fingers crossed that Sophie Kinsella keeps the spirit of Becky alive and continues to bring her adventures to us shopaholics who need something else to do other than shop!
B00003CX95|5.0|The Braveheart must be simply THE best movie I ever saw. It is very touching and heroic and there are no silent scenes. All are packed with action and betrayal, hope, love, passion and fight for freedom.<br />It shows what life was really like for Scots in the 13th century. It was very cruel and hard for Scots to live in! It portrays the Englishmen as the most ruthless people on Earth. Of course, that is not so now in 21st century, but in that time period it really was like that!<br />The music of the movie is very beautiful as well - mix of Scottish pipes and chilling tones. The special effects and the gory bloody scenes are completely effective!!!<br />When I watched that movie for the first time, I felt like I was really among the Scots, in the middle of the battlefield, staring at the brutal fight.<br />For anyone who has not seen Braveheart, there is only one thing to say: GO GET IN ON THE VHS!! You will not find another movie with so much good acting, great music and passion as Braveheart!
B000066NW0|5.0|THis cd wuz so &quot;Anything but ordinary&quot; it made me lose my grip,u can tell Avril ain't &quot;nobodies fool&quot; every time i hear &quot;My World&quot; it makes me want to get &quot;naked&quot;, what can i say its not &quot;too much to ask&quot;, i just wanna break loose and have some fun and say things &quot;i'll never say&quot; ,such as &quot;he's just a boi&quot;, &quot;tomarrow&quot; i'm gonna feel &quot;unwanted&quot; and make every thing so &quot;complicated&quot;,then i'm gonna jump into my &quot;mobile&quot; on my way i'm gonna stop by your house and say &quot;i'm with you&quot;
B000003BZ4|5.0|This is the Mule at its core--pure, hard, and beautiful. A 1995 release, the self-titled \\"Government Mule\\" opens with Warren's homage to Son House (Grinnin' in Your Face) then moves into the deeply felt \\"Mother Earth,\\" before kicking some serious... with the Mule original \\"Rocking Horse.\\" Gregg Allman shares a writing credit on this song and I recently saw the Brothers perform this song two nights in a row at the Fillmore in Denver. They can play it every night as far as I'm concerned. It's that good! As is this master piece from a true power trio, maybe the best since Cream or Hendrix. Yes, Mule is that good. I kid you not.
B000066NW0|5.0|Before Avril's \\"Let Go,\\" I couldn't find a CD where I could listen to every track 80 times and never get tired of them.  But I can honestly say I love every one of her songs and can't wait to hear more from her.  From the angry \\"Losing Grip\\" to the soulful \\"Naked,\\" I can't find very many things wrong with this album.  I've listened to \\"Let Go\\" so many times I can recite each song by heart (which may sound a little pathetic).  From wannabe rappers to Mozart fans, this CD is sure to please.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I just love the sound that Incubus has.  This is a great CD. Of course I loved &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;I Wish You Were Here,&quot; but after buying the CD, I found my favorite song. I just LOVE &quot;Warning.&quot; This CD is not a waste of money.
B000066NW0|5.0|when i first heard &quot;complicated&quot; on the radio, i couldnt get enough of it so i bought the cd.  when i first listened to it, i was blown away.  the beat is great and she isn't afraid to say what is on her mind.  &quot;Let Go&quot; is deffinately one of if not my favorite cd.  there are so many emotions in the different songs. i highly recomend this cd...
B000065U1N|5.0|I don't think I've ever watch such a gripping war movie, with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, that pulls you so deeply into the action that you believe you are truly there.  The rollercoaster of feelings as if war surrounds you is intense.  I have to praise Ridley Scott on an incredible work and I appreciate his resistance to turn it into an American glory story like many other war movies.  Great movie.
B000002TLX|5.0|A true Greatest Hits Album that has everything that a Richard Marx tunes that we love.  Marx has a unique and appealing voice, which is well showcased on the many familiar songs of this album.  I especially enjoy this one to wind down with.
B00005JL3A|5.0|this movie was mad...it was really scary and the action didnt stop...the end left you guessing,and it was a great experience....one of the best...buy it!!
B000002L9Y|4.0|Although it is not the greatest work that Fleetwood Mac ever produced, this CD is very interesting and has some very unique work on it.  Christine McVie's efforts stand out on this album, spotlighting her more on this album than any previous work did.  A very solid, although not flawless effort.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|well.this is a great movie with great scenery and great acting..angelina jolie is stunninly wonderful,a great actress..i didnt really like that american guy,he was ugly and he was the only bad thing...but other than that....it was excellet.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It's Sony, and it works.  I only buy OEM parts.
B000069HK2|5.0|Hailing from utah, these hardcore animal rockers prove that good can come out of a somewhat dud state.  Combining fury and melody they sound close to a cross between the hardcore moments in glassjaw, and the softer moments that finch at times has.If you are thinking about buying this, then follow through because you won't be dissapointed.
0312265859|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read all of the books in the series and this one did not disappoint me.  It lived up to all of my expectations.  It had humor, action, and some romance (I felt the need to smoke a cigarette).  The villian in the book was disturbing.  But, I do not think that hurt the book at all. I think it gave the book some depth that may have been missing from a few of the earlier books.<br />My only complaint is that I have to wait approximately 2 more years for the ninth book!!!
B000002I2I|5.0|The magic may have been gone by this time, but in its place The Doors became one great down and dirty band.  In the last song &quot;Maggie M'Gill&quot; Morrison sings, &quot;I'm an old blues man. I believe he was and is the only white 26 yr man who could have sung that line without being laughed at. After playing Morrison Hotel, you get the feeling that you have just spent the night in some honky tonk listening to the best bar band you have ever heard.
0440133688|5.0|I read *The House of God* the year after I completed my own internship, while running a rural clinic (a la NORTHERN EXPOSURE, but back during the Carter Administration) and contending with the first onslaught of Managed Money (also known as Mangled Care).<br />It was strange. I recognized the unarguable truth of the Laws of the House of God, and knew the Fat Man and Jo (the Journal Club Maniac) and all the slurpers and sleazebags and \\"physician entrepreneurs\\" for whom I'd spent a year of my life doing scut while salvaging their patients. I couldn't stop laughing through the first half of the book, and then a curious thing happened.<br />The second half of the novel left me more and more depressed, remembering the bleakness and pain of that year, and summoning up the hard lessons I had learned -- and was still learning as a young physician in the first years of practice. It reminded me that no matter what I did, the slurpers and the self-righteous stuffed shirts in my profession were going to win. They were going to keep on degrading and destroying patients and their families, gorging on the increasing wealth being poured into \\"the health care industry,\\" and beating the hell out of decent physicians who actually dared give a damn about the humanity of the people who come to us for treatment.<br />And now, nearly three decades later, the laughs are completely gone and the truth is beyond concealment. *The House of God* is a wonderful glimpse of life as a scutpuppy back in the '70s, yes -- but more than that, it's a prophetic anticipation of the destruction of what was once a pretty decent profession, working to achieve something more than a favorable return on investment.<br />The '70s weren't \\"the good old days\\" by any stretch of the imagination, but who could've believed back then that the 21st Century was going to be so godawfully much worse?
0393316041|5.0|I read this book fairly quickly.  Go to britannica.com and look up Feynman.  Then read this book!  There is a sharp contrast between the both of them.  This book gives you a picture of a mischievous man, and with good reason.  He is playing pranks on military personnel at Los Alamos and then playing in a band in Brazil. It is just a collection of stories that I am sure he would have told you if you two had a beer together.
B00005JK1C|2.0|Tripe- what remains when the good stuff is gone. Usual Suspects is Hollywood mannerism at it's worse and naturally most successful. On the heels of the gangster nouveau, it has more twists and turns than Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction put together and characters who are all bad ALL THE TIME -- \\"real\\" tough guys. And the only thing they fear is Kaiser Soze.<br />Yeah right... <br />Why would anyone be afraid of a guy who killed his own family? Every-time his enemies turn up he kills someone he loves?! Who's gonna work for a moron like that!? The only thing to fear is that you might be related to him!...<br />All the rest is talk-talk, bang-bang, and not even a kiss-kiss. Light and witless fare at best.<br />In fact, what we have here is a series of gratuitous plot-twists and contrivances, abunch of Actors that are all pretending to be tough guys, and a writer and director who sold a bill of goods on a trend started by two movies that Hollywood never wanted to make: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Yeah, you can hear the pitch now: \\"it's more Reservoir Dogs than Reservoir Dogs is! More twists and turns than Pulp Fiction!\\"<br />OSCAR TIME!<br />Except that RD and PF weren't about twists and turns, or tough guys, or Kaiser Snoozy (oh wait, wasn't he in Snow White?). \\"The Usual Suspects\\" makes the mistake most Hollywood studio flicks do: they confuse the elements of a successful movie with the movie itself. You might as well say Citizen Kane was about the newspaper business, or 2001 was about spaceships, or The Fountainhead was about architecture, or King Of Kings was about carpentry! Worse, once you get the formulae down it becomes just too ...predictable: here we go, another thrilling plot twist!  HEY, SOME OF THESE MAKE MONEY, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T [LACK CLASS] DOING IT.<br />Really, did anyone NOT see that last \\"twist\\" coming?...<br />OSAR TIME!<br />They loved it! How could they not? This is the same academy that ignored Kubrick and booed Orson Welles. Butin Hollywood there's a little bit of Kaiser Soze in everyone.<br />Oh well. You remember that guy from \\"Seven\\" -- John Doe? Now that was a man to be feared.
B000066NW0|5.0|hey there. avril lavigne's &quot;let go&quot; is one of the best cd's i've heard in a very long time. it's a wicked good mix of hard rock and music that makes you sing along. there's no fighting it .. haha .. its just so awesome. songs like &quot;unwanted&quot; and &quot;losing grip&quot; are really edgy, strong, and powerful. other songs like &quot;i'm with you&quot; and &quot;things i'll never say&quot; show a lighter side of avril's music. all in all its just simply and awesome cd and i recommend it to anyone who likes to just rock out to great music.
B00004SPRN|5.0|John mayel, jack johnson and a host of other &quot;singer song writers with their acoustic guitars&quot; don't even hold a candle to our rusty horse Mr. Young. he doesn't just write songs, he tears life into tiny pieces, then puts words to the memories
0312265859|4.0|Not as good as the first seven novels.  It all wrapped up in the last 2 pages, making you feel rather let down.  The characters didn't seem as \\"real\\" in this book.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is Tool at it's most matured and musically developed state.  It is experimental and new; if someone asks me what Tool sounds like, I'm proud to say that Tool sounds like nothing I've ever heard before.  Seriously - Lateralus is that good.  That original.  That captivating.<br />Tool has always been bass-driven, but this album has obviously been built from the bottom up.  Maynard and the rest have focused on layers and balance, rather than a conjuction of sounds.  Maynard's vocal range is amazing, and often blends into the music like another instrument.  And believe me, that instrument is just as finely played as all of the others.<br />Old Tool fans will find little of the Tool that they used to know, but tracks such as Ticks & Leeches and Parabola should satisfy their hunger.  New Tool fans will be shocked at the level of complexity beyond Schism...<br />Overall? Well, with over seventy minutes of amazing music, every penny is worth the sound in quanity and quality.  Tool is better than ever - every time you listen to this album, it just grows on you more and more.  Fantastic, five stars.<br />My only peeve? Although Lateralus is Tool's most musically mature record, I did not find it as captivating and enjoyable as AEnima.  Maynard's voice enchanted me in that record, whereas in Lateralus it only impressed.  The rest of the band, however, has certainly improved...Maynard has, too, just not in the way that I would have liked.
B000068TPN|5.0|I have watched so many action movies.  I went to the theater to watch this.  The minute it was over, I wanted to turn around and pay for tickets all over again to watch it right then!  It truly touched my heart, and I haven't said that about a lot of movies. If you don't watch this, you are missing out on the greates action movie ever!
0812550757|5.0|After reading Ender's Game, I was intrigued enough to get the sequel.  This book displays a more mature author's voice, and is not just a story of first contact.  It explores the secrets we all keep and the devastating impact of the lies we tell in our families and social groups.  When Ender starts speaking the truth about what is going on under the surface, he opens up a lot of pain for the families in the story, but also allows healing.  And the book clearly and compellingly evokes the pain and cost to the truth-teller in doing so.  I felt enormous empathy for all the characters, and the book caused me to examine where I am not telling the truth in my own life and in my own family.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Since I had not studied up on the life of T.E Lawrence before I saw this movie, I can't tell you if the real Lawrence was like the one in this movie. I can't say how accurate it is to the history (There has been evidence found that Lawrence was never at the massacre of the Turkish Army). I too agree that the straight historical facts can be exciting. But if you go to movies expecting the truth, you will be disappointed. We go to books for facts and to movies for feelings.  \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" should not marked down because it isn't a totally factual account. This is a rarity among epic movies; One that's not only visually stunning and ambitious, but also acted with enthusiasm, written with wit and excitement and directed with skill and passion. <br />\\"Lawrence\\" won a total of seven Academy Awards in 1962 including Best Picture. But sadly, none of its Oscars went to Peter O'Toole for his brilliant, eccentric performance as T.E Lawrence, a British Officer assigned to the Arabian Desert during World War I. There, he finds that the Arabian Tribes are fighting against one another. Lawrence unites these tribes in battle against the Turks, leading to many victories. Over time, he comes closer to discovering whom he is, why he is here and starts questioning as to whether he belongs to Arabia and England. <br />But while O'Toole and the supporting cast (Played by the likes of Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Arthur Kennedy) get the billings in the movie, the real star is the desert. Thought to be a barren, desolate landscape with little life, the movie proves that it is very active. Every shot seems choreographed to show the beauty and danger of Arabia. We see sandstorms, twisters and miles of beautiful sand dunes. There are some beautiful shots of sunrises or sunsets (One of them part of a memorable edit). The movie is full of many great images, one of the most memorable being the long entrance of Sharif's character, coming out of the mirage. It looks like his camel is riding on nothing. Another memorable image is when Lawrence and his companions reach the Suez Canal. Their first glimpse is of a ship sailing in the canal. But with the way the scene is filmed, it looks as though the ship is sailing on desert. <br />The script, as I already stated, is surprisingly strong for an epic. The plot is focused and free of sideplots. The conversations between people are interesting and sometimes even exciting to listen to (Though this can also be attributed to direction, acting and/or editing). Here are some examples:<br />General Allenby: I thought I was a hard man, sir.<BR>Prince Feisal: You are merely a general. I must be a king.<br />Auda Abu Tayi: Thy mother mated with a scorpion.<br />General Murray: I can't make out whether you're bloody bad-mannered or just half-witted.<BR>T.E Lawrence: I have the same problem, sir.<br />Ali: Have you no fear, English?<BR>T.E Lawrence: My fear is my concern.<br />General Allenby: I'm promoting you Major.<BR>T.E Lawrence: I don't think that's a very good idea.<br />Finally, I must not ignore Maurice Jarre's music score. Like the movie, it is difficult to put in words the effect it has on a viewer. But I just dare you to forget it, any part of it. I had the main theme stuck in my head after I saw it. All I can say is that you have to watch the movie for yourself (Or rent the CD soundtrack) to understand. <br />I wonder what it would be like if this movie were remade today. It would for certain be much different. To cut costs, there would be CGI sets and extras. There would have to be big name stars (Arnold Schwarzenegger as T.E Lawrence?). The movie would have more stylized and graphic violence than it original did and the pace would be fast and furious, with constant F-words. Finally, to appeal to a wider audience, there would have to be a romantic subplot involving Lawrence with a young British or Arabian woman who can't keep her clothes on (Though it's been said that Lawrence never had a girlfriend because he was sensitive to touching). Also, the movie would be shot not in the Arabian Desert but on some blue screen or studio backlot. <br />Lawrence lived to see himself become a legend. Those white robes he wears give him the image of a saint (Other hidden clues: Lawrence mentions Moses when he crossed the Nefud and the word god is used often throughout). He believed that he was different from others and even invincible. After being shot in the arm and asked if he needs a doctor, Lawrence remarks \\"It would take a golden bullet to kill me\\". But after being beaten and (implied) raped, he realizes that he isn't above other men, that any man \\"Is what I am\\". He soon loses hope in the campaign he's leading and by movie's end is not wanted by either the Arabs or the British. Thus, it seems fitting that, like Patton and MacArthur, Lawrence's death came not on a battlefield, but in a common motor accident.
B000066NW0|5.0|Never Let Go....of Avril Lavigne<br />Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot; is a refreshing first attempt by a young lady, who will, hopefully, usher in a new age of music. One of the most refreshing things about the album is that Avril herself is only seventeen years old. Being the fact that Avril actually writes and plays her own music, you get the sense of greater feeling and depth than occurs in most of the music made by those in her age bracket. Miss Lavigne seems to be quite proud of who she is and unwilling to let the business change her and it is quite evident in her music.<br />Avril span the emotional gamut on this album, from playfulness to angst, to coy ... and she does quite well handling each and every one of them. Her voice is another treat. It's strong, as well as full of youth; hard as well as breathtaking. <br />Each of the 13 tracks are beautiful and introspective in their own right, but as with any album, there are standouts. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; is a solid kick off and &quot;Complicated&quot; was the perfect choice for a first single, with it's sometimes tongue-in-cheek humor. Two of my personal favorites, &quot;Mobile&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; are thought provoking, in different ways. &quot;Mobile&quot; is lighter and deeply touches the confused and lost place inside every human. &quot;Unwanted&quot; is angsty and driven and you find yourself nodding along with Avril's words, feeling the unfairness of it all. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is another gem, with a hard rock edge, that makes you think about choices you have made or are going to make and whether or not they were truly for yourself. &quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; as well as &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; are two that ought not to be missed. <br />&quot;Let Go&quot; comes off as a landmark album and a great achievement as a debut. Rarely does an artist have such a sure sound their first time out, as well as seem in control of their career and where they are going. If &quot;Let Go&quot; is any indication, Avril Lavigne will be around for quite sometime and we'll still be here listening.
B00005QIPH|4.0|not bad. the songs are easy to dismiss on first listen but after a while you'll want to listen to them again and again. and killer basslines are definitely underrated in general.<br />but I'm completely bewildered by the velvet underground comparison. julian casablancas is unfit to sniff lou reed's jockstrap, imho.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I am a huge No Doubt fan - I can't live with out Tragic Kingdom - and I purchased Rock Steady the day it was released. Out of every album they have released - the self titled, Beacon Street, Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn and Rock Steady, Rock Steady is defiantly my least favorite and the one I listen to the least. I've only listned to it 3 times in all the time I've owned it. They seem to have departed totally from their ska roots, which hooked me - and many others - in the first place. Let's not chalk it up to them &quot;maturing as artists&quot;. Artist can mature with out totally abandoning their roots - Bush and Madonna are star examples. Both have gotten better lyrically and musically, while staying with their roots, rock and pop respectviely. No Doubt, they seem to have taken a different path, one of which I am not sure is the best. Most of Rock Steady sounds clanky and unrefined, as if they all were a bit confused on how excatly they wanted to do this. It's alot different from anything else they've ever done and I don't care for it much. <br />I think that it has disappointed many old No Doubt fans, those who have heard everything from the self titled album up to Tragic Kingdom. Those who are realtively new ( people who joined the band wagon after Return of Saturn) are happy with the album...and it has excited bunches of new listeners. Sadly it does appeal to many who count Britney Spears as a wonderful musician. I'll be just waiting, and wondering if they'll ever get back to  the No Doubt I love so ever much - circa 1995, Tragic Kingdom time.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I thought this kind of junk could be found only on progressive opera houses.  Forget about the plot.  If you have seen La Traviata or Camille you've got it (including the spitting blood and the throwing of money to the courtesan in public, not to forget the recriminating old father). The formal originality consists on mixing a Ken Russell inflated musical with unrestrained bits from a  Franco Zefirelli production. In the added material Nicole Kidman enlightens us about the moving force of this enterprise: love can be expressed in music better than in any other genre.  The only advantage over La Traviata is that we are spared listening to 'Di Provenza il mare il sol', an aria I hate more than any other. Thanks to that I can honestly say that yes, I liked the music.
0440219078|4.0|You can compare this book with an (interesting) school lesson, it is interesting and you learn that our world is better than their community.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious!! It was the type of movie that is so stupid it's funny. I personally love those type of movies! Ben Stiller was REALLY good in this movie! He was so belivable it was almost scary. My dad thought this movie was really stupid and I have noticed that, for the most part, only people who like stupid movies like Zoolander. <br />Zoolander is awsome because it's not perverted (unlike most stupid movies). I thought that the stupidity of the characters was really funny!<br />Zoolander is about really stupid male models and the whole modeling world. The movie just makes fun of models in general. <br />(note: In this case the word \\"stupid\\" is a good thing.)
B000066NW0|5.0|I totally look up to Avril.  I have to say I've never seen an artist that I enjoy as much as her.  I could listen to her songs forever.  She has a unique style and amazing voice.  She's incredibly talented and I'm thinking of taking up guitar and after hearing this CD.  Some of the songs are really inspirational, she just has a fun spirit in her voice and you want to sing along whenever you hear it.  Her songs are very easy to relate to, especially for teenagers, since she contributes and writes a lot of them.  You need to go out and hear this CD, you'll become instantly hooked on this wild child chick.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I thought that &quot;Leagally Blonde&quot; was really funny! Reese Witherspoon was great! <br />&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is about a Beverly Hills blonde who chases after her boyfriend all the way to Harvard Law School...<br />Okay, so the plot sounds kind of cheesy but it's actually really funny. I thought that the whole &quot;strong blonde&quot; thing was kinda cool. <br />The special features on the video were great! A lot went into this movie!!
0618001905|4.0|I find it strange with all of the books now coming out based upon the presumption that history has been \\"forgotten.\\" Maybe I am a product of a good Canadian Education System which taught us all about King Leopold's lark when we were 12, but I thought this was all well known.     Also no one ever listen to Australia's rock band Midnight Oil before?    \\"...conquistador of Mexico... ...the Zulu and the Navajo... ...the Belgians in the Congo, Hey, Short Memory! Short Memory, Must have a, Short Memory\\"    And I think that is what is going on here. It comes as a \\"shock\\" to people that such attrocities were perpetrated in the backwaters of the Congo at the turn of the last century. The author does us a favour by reminding all of us in a good, ripping read about the inanity of King Leopold and his lackeys, from the higher-ups like H.M. Stanley, to those lesser govt. officials of \\"Heart of Darkness\\" fame.     It is not a attack on colonialism in general and to see it as such is projecting our values backward in time, though Hothschild needs to remind the modern reader of this more often than he does. It does show us rather that King Leopold and his morality was so out of step with the times that the other colonial powers, whose colonial systems were based upon less harsh (though perhaps equally) exploitive aims, had to take the colony away from him. In brief Leopold was so horrid that even the other colonial powers held their noses when they visited him in Laeken, Belgium.     Colonialism existed on a continuum and anyone familiar with the times will know that idealism and good intentions played as much in foreign policy implementation as the clearly manifest evil intentions of Leopold in the Congo.     The real builders of empire like Britian ruled, as an ideal, indirectly, integrated locals into the security and administation structure of the colony, and invested in their colonies while all the time taking profits from it. Rule of law was also developed and, although it might not have done locals a lot of good at the time, it was there as a nascent institution which sometimes served the newly independent countries well.    The Belgiums were on the other end of the scale: direct rule from the home country, no attempt to build up independent adminstrative and education branches, and therefore no attempt to integrate locals into the security forces of the time. It was simple and direct, rule at the point of a whip with no recourse to law. Strip the place bare and move on. Cut and run colonialism where the master never took the time to learn the language.     Therefore one would get a rather slanted view of colonialism if one thought that all colonies operated like the Congo. The Congo is noteworthy for one point alone, that it was viewed even then as a dysfunctional colony.
B00004XQ83|5.0|THis is one of the coolest CDs I own! My grandma loved the movie and bought the soundtrack from the closest music store to the theater. I heared the music in her car and thought some of the songs were really funny!<br />I didn't think the movie was all amazingly good but I love the soundtrack! I thought the songs are really unusual, but in a good way. This is one of the best soundtracks I've come accross in a long time!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't see what the problem most people see in this record is. I think that John Mayer is a truly excellent songwriter. I'm not easily impressed by artists and usually when i buy a new cd it doesnt stay in the player for more than two weeks. i've been listening to this cd everyday for the past 3 months. I love each and every song on this album and his live stuff is even better. i recomend this record to everyone.
0679412719|4.0|This book is more of a bullet list of ideas.  Some of these are more profound than others.  It appears to be written toward the end of his life and the meditations are more reflections of how he is coming to terms with his existence.  It provides an excellent perspective on one individual's relationship to a larger violent world.<br />There is no doubt that this is a fascinating book.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, not your average female vocalist. Not your average girl. Plainly: Anything But Ordinary.<br />Avril's sound is simply \\"anything but ordinary\\" of any rock/pop girl out there, blending real-life, slightly-caustic lyrics with... backround drums and guitar, the rhythum either invigerating or sedating (but in a good way!) her back-up bands made up of 3 guys (Hey, Gwen Stefani, anybody?) Her wicked, outspoken attitude does simmer down on at least one track of her debut CD Let Go, her ballot \\"I'm With You\\" represents her raw loneliness and uncertaincy of finding that \\"special someone, someone to take her home.\\" Then there's \\"My World,\\" the auto-biographical account of her boring life back in Napanee, Ontario, where make-up was like a foreign language to Avril, where the boys were always game to toss a football with Avril,... where the most fun thing to do was braid your hair. But her current single, \\"Complicated\\", which is crawling closer and closer to the hot spot, the top spot on MTV's TRL, states what all real girls want, boys who don't front with their Abercrombie threads and charming smiles, boys who we like for who they are. Talent flows through this girl's fingertips like blood, almost every song scribbled together with themes teens (and I mean all teens, the preps, the popular, the punks, the skaters, the intellects, the depressed) deal with every day, from loneliness to self-control to self-consciousness. I believe a girl who can express her self-doubts is a true and fearless writer and performer. Avril Lavigne is, in my opinion, the next Alanis Morsiette, her and her guitar just beginning to surf the intergalatic waves of stardom, her next single, \\"Sk8r Bio,\\" slated out this summer.
B00003CXA2|3.0|During the 1995 Academy Awards, the critically acclaimed \\"Pulp Fiction\\" lost to a movie called \\"Forrest Gump\\" starring the then red-hot Tom Hanks.  I never saw \\"Gump\\" in the theatres and assumed that it had to be a VERY good movie to rob the envelope-pushing \\"Pulp Fiction\\" of the Best Picture Oscar.  Because I am such a fair person, I bought the DVD and decided to give the movie a shot before passing judgement.  After the first half-hour I was checking my watch every fifteen minutes.  Aside from the handsome production and Hanks's performance, this was an overall safe, fairly predictable little movie that pushed no boundaries and played by Hollywood's rules of filmmaking.  It was fun to see Hanks evolve in his character, but there was little dramatic thrust and it was even a little sappy.  Don't think I'm totally bashig this film; I just think that it's a tad overrated and didn't deserve Best Picture.  Although parts of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" were hard to digest, I give it props because it at least dodged the conventions of filmmaking \\"Gump\\" so readily embraces.  If you're looking for a little crowd-pleaser, then by all means, \\"Gump\\" will be your cup of tea.  For me, I don't think I'll see this film again or recommend it to anyone else.
B00005M91K|5.0|I agree very much with the reviewer who wrote that it is hard to review this movie without sounding cliche or naive.  Baraka is truly a unique movie and you should go out and see it.
B00001U0E1|4.0|If you know &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; only as the film that upset &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; at the Oscars, then you owe it to yourself to give this picture a chance.  It's a compelling (and fictional) story that tells how Shakespeare might have been inspired to write &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  There's this theatre that's on the verge of bankruptcy when its last two shows flop.  Desperate for a hit, they turn to (a young) William Shakespeare (Joe Finnes) who is tapped to write a play.  He suffers from writer's block before he crosses paths with this beautiful woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, in her umpteenth British role) who is already engaged to some other bloke (Colin Firth).  They begin a romance, and suddenly he is inspired to complete the play, which becomes a hit.  The film soared on the strength of its performances.  Dame Judi Dench was deliciously good in her semi-controversial 8-minute performance as the Queen; Paltrow holds her own throughout the film, as does Finnes.  Heck, even Ben Affleck, in a minor role, isn't half bad.  But as much as there is to admire in &quot;Shakespere in Love,&quot; I wasn't wetting my pants over this film as most critics were when this came out.  It's good but not mind-blowingly great.  Still, movie buffs should check out this solid flick and add it to their collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this album is yet another example of why incubus is making it big these days. Their sound is original, comparible only to themselves. While this album is slightly more of a 'downer' than Make Yourself, it only shows the bands' ability to gro witht their music, each album differing from the last, yet each making a lasting immpression. A perfect blend of great vocals, profound lyrics, original licks and an unbridled sprituality.
B000001DV2|5.0|it  hard  to   belive  its  been   10  years    since      adrenalize  was   release.   adrenalize    is  a   great   cd  it  rocks. it   sold  7  million   copes  six  or   7  songs   was   release   from   adrenalize.  but     after   adrenalize   the    band   has     falling   on   hard   time.   with   their   last   2  or    3 cds   were   not good.   now   10  years   later   def   leppard  will    make     their   come  back   with   their   new   cd   x.
B00006690F|5.0|I love this new album from Em. He has matured alot since his first CD and this one has got really good beats to it! I have been an Eminem fanatic since the beginning and he never dissapoints me!
B000066NW0|5.0|As a major music junkie, I buy a lot of CDs and listen to a lot of music.  I don't buy into trends such as boy bands or pretty blond singers like Britney Spears.  The kind of music I thrive on is REAL.  You may or may not know what I'm talking about.  REAL music is the stuff that brings you to tears the first time you listen to it.  You blast this REAL music so loud it's all around you, and you just drown in it.  You know the feeling.  You want to play that music for everyone in the world.  Rarely do you find a full album of this REAL stuff.  After hearing Avril's single \\"Complicated\\", and reading a little sidebar about her in some teen magazine in which she said \\"I don't write ooh baby songs\\", I was compelled to check this chick out.  I bought \\"Let Go\\" the day it came out and listened to the whole thing.  I was absolutely stunned.  Today it's quite popular for a teenaged girl to play guitar and write her own songs, so that's kind of what I expected.  When I got through the first thirty seconds of the first track, \\"Losing Grip\\", I was literally fighting back tears.  The lyrics spoke to me, and touched me.  The music hooks and bends and flows so well.  It's unlike anything I've ever heard.  The rest of the album is equally enveloping.  Every single other song is so awesome, I can't describe it in words.  I've never heard a girl rock this hard.  As a fellow singer-songwriter-guitarist, she inspires me to write what I feel, and not what I think would sound good to other people.  This is why I feel that I need to tell the largest amount of people I can about this absolutely amazing album.  I would give it 1,000 stars if the rating system permitted.  You NEED to get it.  It's worth every penny it costs, and I've already made five copies of it in case one gets lost.  Ok, I'm paranoid.  But you need this CD.  I'm now officially addicted to Avril.  And unlike petty trends and stupid fads, the kind of music that is Avril Lavigne won't ever go away.  Because, she's Anything But Ordinary.  And that, in my opinion, is the best thing you can possibly be.  You'll never tire of this album.  Buy it now, my friends.  While you still can.  But don't just take my word for it... listen to some of the clips, I guarantee that this will become one of you favorite discs. Avril is in a leauge of her own.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I first heard \\"feuer frei!\\" on digital cable and went mad (the happy side of psychosis). This was my introduction to Rammstein. I bought \\"mutter\\" and I haven't stopped playing it since it arrived. Not that I think I really do need help (though my neighbors might beg to differ). Time elapses, the album does NOT grow old, and I remain happily afflicted. Sadly though, I don't speak fluent German. So, beyond my limited appreciation for the rich language, and the core soul that Rammstein's powerful vocals will entice you with, I haven't a clue what they're telling me. The wasted paper in the case booklet could serve a means of translation. But it doesn't. Where's McGyver when you need 'im. But dispite the language barrier, every track on this album is un-mistakably a hit. Tight, precise, well-rounded and beautifully executed from begining to end. Rammstein's sound is original, mature, they play from the soul, sing from the heart, and \\"mutter\\" just Rocks! This album is most definately a Must-Have.
B000005HN6|5.0|This was the second album by Opeth I heard (my introduction was via morningrise). Although I agree that morningrise is the better album, in some ways I prefer the sound of orchid. Orchid is a little less dark and has a little more jazz influences than their other albums.<br />Those of you who don't like growled vocals, still give Opeth a try, the vocals form an integral part of the music.<br />If you are not a fan of the progressive rock genre, then try My Arms Your Hearse instead.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hey people you need to buy Avril Lavigne's cd now! It's not expensive or anything. When your bored, you go to her cd, its so awesome.. all her words can leave an affect on you and you can have a rocking out time! the beats are out of this world! Avril and her guitar will rock the world! I suggest you go get it know! You'll have a blast!
B000060MY6|1.0|Even the professional critics scratch their heads over this one, so my perplexity is in good company. Visually it's attractive, with a haunting, bizarre mood to the whole presentation. However, there are just too many disjointed subplots. They flare with colorful and enticing potential, then prematurely fizzle into charred embers of disappointment. This is a lazy and self-indulgent movie. A collection of characters and scenes with no thread and no apparent effort made to link them into some sort of reasonable cohesiveness. It's as if the director randomly spilled the contents of his own bizarre dreams onto celluloid, then sat back to enjoy the critics confusion with a chuckle. At least I hope that's what happened because if it was made with any pretention of being taken seriously, then I'm really worried. There are many gem-like scenes which with a better director could have been strung into a dazzling necklace. But ultimately this director's approach fails. The talent and vision is wasted and it becomes high school stuff on a big budget.
B000065U1N|1.0|This movie is just another typical, Hollywood, special effects blockbuster with no substance to back it up. You see a bunch of soldiers running around shooting, but the movie gives almost no story about who they're shooting at, where they're running to or why things went so terribly wrong on this ill fated mission.<br />Mark Bowden's book is a gripping tale of American heroism in the face of overwhelming odds and an honest documentary of a battle most of us barely noticed on the six o'clock news. It's a shame so much of this was lost in its translation to the big screen.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. Incredibly moving with an outstanding performance by Anthony Hopkins. In a completely reverse role from Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, his role as the doctor is so convincing, you don't for one moment question its authenticity. His role along with that of the Elephant Man is sure to make you cry. You feel so much emotion throughout the movie, that at some points your physical reactions are very intense. This is a must see for movie lovers.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This cd is very good. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. I love Shakira. She is very pretty and she can sing like no other in English better than most singers who only know English as their language.The songs:<br />1.Objection- Shaki's new single that's coming out in July by being premiered on MTV's Making The video.The lyrics are very good. In this, Ms. Mebarak is talking about how she is in love with a man who is in love with a \\"fake\\" girl and that like in court, \\"Objection!\\" is said when you don't agree with the verdict. Shaki doesn't agreee with the way this is going, so she wishes to get away. \\"Objection I don't wanna be the exception to get a bit of your attention I love you for free and I'm not your mother but you don't even bother\\"5/5<br />2 . Underneath your clothes- the joint! This is a beautiful ballad that when turned acoustic is even better. If you saw VH1 Divas Las Vegas Live, the performance of this single is the acoustic version I believe that is found on the enhanced Underneath your clothes single found here at amazon.5/5<BR>3. Whenever, Wherever- If you listen to this when traveling, it makes the song more exiting, especially when you're in a car. The infamous quote has caught the attention of men everywhere, thus increases sales records \\"Lucky that my breasts are small and humble so you don't confuse them with mountains\\"5/5<br />4. Rules- a good song for girls who have fear of their boyfriends cheating on them, a.k.a \\"But these are rules for us<BR>Use your mouth, only to kiss my lips\\"4/5<br />5. The one- The ending is the good climax. It's a ballad with a bit of high energy, nothing serious or special though. \\"I feel my real life has just begun\\" 5/5<br />6. ready for the good times- I love this song. It really has that latin beat to it, and the instrumentaal is absolutely danceable. \\"Cause everyday there's a war to fight and if I win or lose, never mind as long as your my shelter every night\\"<br />7. Te Dejo Madrid- the 3rd single for This album, I thought it was a pretty good song. Knowing the style Shakira uses, I fell in love with this song. I just like the title. \\"Teh- deh- hoh- mah-drid\\" is the pronunciation. \\"Ahi te dejo madrid!\\"<br />8. Fool- lyrically, excellent, but this I believe is too much like \\"Rules\\", these two are probably the only weak points on the album, but it depends on your opinion. \\"do something really clever that'll make me hate your name forever\\"<br />9. Poem to a horse- another excellent lyrical song (the whole album has the best lyrics I've read since Ayumi Hamasaki(Jpop artist from Japan). A metaphor used int his goes \\"If I say my heart is sore, sounds like a cheap metaphor so I won't repeat no more.\\"<br />10. Que Me Quedes Tu- A beatiful ballad, and singable if you know Spanish pronunciation. THe lyrics even in Spanish are beautiful. Sounds alittle bit like \\"A Love Before Time\\" from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Shoot! This should be on it's Soundtrack. A great movie. Anyhow, back to Shaki. 5/5<br />11. Eyes Like Yours- the English version to \\"Ojos Asi\\" on \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\", the lyrics and beats are jammin. It should be a single. Actually, 'Ojos Asi\\" has a video but no single or video or single for the english version. Also one of Shakira's only Arabic songs (her only song with Arabic in it) 5/5<br />12. Suerte- I like this version. Her voice seems strong and devoted.If you own the bootleg copy, you will like this version better than the english version.<br />13. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio- see #12.<br />Overall, this album clearly states the powerful and immortal, \\"Horse-like\\" voice of Shakira.Her voice is able to tremble and change ranges very quickly without sounding funny (this is what I mean by horse-like, no offense). <br />I love Shakira. She is short, but beautiful. She is new at English, but an excellent writer and vocalist.
B00002ND77|2.0|I first saw this movie on one of those cable movie channels and decided to pick up the book it was based on (The Autobiography of Malcolm X as Told to Alex Haley).  After I got done reading the book, I decided to watch the movie again, seeing as I had come into the middle of the movie on the TV.  What I saw and what I read were, at times, 2 completely different things.  I recommend reading the book, so you get a real portrait of who Malcolm X was.
6304025831|5.0|Yes, the comparison with \\"Goodfellas\\" is unavoidable. Both are brilliant depictions of a corner of American life, where family values and work ethic are genuine but the path to success is misguided. Robert DeNiro - \\"Ace\\" - is the gambling genius who takes a new career direction with the odds in his favor. However, the odds are against his marriage to Sharon Stone - \\"Ginger\\" - the highly sophisticated call girl who still can't break her bond with a creep from her childhood. The two negatives do not make a positive for Sam, who figures that the law of averages will concede to Love. The numbers don't work, though. His second wrongheaded move is in not comprehending his figurehead role in the new \\"Gold Rush\\" out West.<BR>Ace's old pal, Joe Pesci - \\"Nicky\\" - arrives on the scene from Chicago to humbly ask permission to insinuate himself in his world - the still-untapped Las Vegas. The message is: I'm joining you out here and I'm going to do what I have to do and I what I want to and I'm only \\"asking\\" because we go back a long ways...<BR>The performances of the three are the reason for the films' success even without the excellent performances by Alan King and many others, the grandiose setting and the impressive documentary style film-making. DeNiro and Pesci deliver wisened, deepened portrayals, which in several spots, make their work in \\"Goodfellas\\" look almost offhand. DeNiro is able to create a certain, unexpected sympathy for his character. His gamble with Love yields no win, so he gets more and more obsessive about his \\"work\\", in which he has already made his mark. His misunderstanding of his role at the Casino only compounds his crisis at home. This confusion is expertly played by DeNiro; in his situation he is able to evoke sympathy in the viewer, something out of the picture in \\"Goodfellas\\". Where DeNiro is implosive, Mr. Pesci's *explosive* acting is superb and Scorcese gives him alot of room to work. There are many unnecessary plot scenes which are still successful as platforms for Pesci: He knocks down Casino assistant Don Rickles; he tries to knock down a guy in a parking lot during his later dissipation. In fact, despite the nice pacing, there is about twenty minutes of extraneous stuff for all involved.<BR>Sharon Stone's performance is astonishing as the bad girl who suddenly finds herself fairly successful as Wife, Mother, Socialite - until James Woods decides to work his Svengali act on her. I think Scorcese could have given her more close-ups, etc., but the performance should be appreciated by actors and casual movie-goers alike.<BR>Other actors also should be recognized here, particularly Frank Vincent, recently of \\"West New York\\"; he is a master of understatement and his character is interesting. At one point he has to lie to the powers-that-be to keep his friends alive; later he is the first one to apply a baseball bat to his cohort, in one of the most violent scenes ever shot for a major motion picture. Here the Director does *not* underscore with MTV-video effects. The silent, remote setting makes the brutality seem even more horrific. The characters seem capable of anything at anytime.<BR>Against the 24/7 high energy atmosphere of the '70s Vegas we sit forward to speculate on when will the over-inflated, massive balloon finally burst and come plummeting down to earth. Yes it does, and we may question our own three-hour fascination with it. Then we realize we have experienced great cinema.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is incredible. His live shows are amazing!! And his unreleased stuff is the best I have ever heard from an up and coming artist. He's going to be big, I'm telling you that much. I particularly love this cd, I've worn it out I've listened to it so many times! 3 x 5 and Back to You rock! <br />To all those who think he's just like Dave Matthews, or what have you, is insane. John is more original than 99% of the musical acts out there!<BR>&quot;You want me to play a Dave Matthews song? You know, that's just like getting someone else's mail. It's like if I go to the mailbox and pull out a letter addressed to Dave Matthews and think 'No, that's not for me', and put it back in. Next time you go to a Dave Matthews show why don't you request some John Mayer?&quot; - John Mayer<BR>Yes, thats what he has to say about that.
B000066NW0|5.0|if you have not already go and get this cd right away it is one of the best cd's I own there is not one good reason why not to buy this cd. Every song is good most of the cd's I own have some songs that i skip over but there are no songs on this cd that i would consider skiping over.
B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Let Go\\" is a great buy!.  Avril busts out with a her own style & lyrics!  She has a great voice and her songs show that off.  Definately 5 starts!!  ...
B00005B6C9|4.0|At last the Bee Gees have discarded the synthesizer-laden sound that had been their trademark since the early 80's. Disco is gone, too. Instead, they have gone full circle and are making the kind of music one would expect from them in the 21st Century had they remained the guitar-oriented group they were in 1967. This is a revamped version of the group that recorded \\"I Want Home\\", \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\", \\"Idea\\", \\"I.O.I.O.\\", \\"Back Home\\" and \\"Marley Purt Drive\\", to name a few. On this new album, songs like \\"This Is Where I Came In\\", \\"She Keeps On Coming\\", \\"Deja Vu\\" and the fast-paced \\"Voice in The Wilderness\\" are proof that, contradictory as it may seem, the Gibbs are looking far into their own past for new sounds. No wonder the title track is called \\"This is Where I Came In\\" and another song is called \\"Deja Vu\\". This album is a welcome return to their 60's roots, new millennium style!
0312265859|3.0|I have to admit I didn't like this book as well as earlier ones.  Frankly, I'm getting tired of the cars blowing up.  Let it die already.  And I'm also getting tired of Stephanie being such a klutz.  I never cared for the old horror movies where everybody says, don't go down the basement, there's a monster there, and immediately the stupid heroine wanders off to the bassement.  Stephanie wanders off to the basement by herself over, and over, and over....   Yawn.  <br />And it seems to me that anyone with an IQ over 32 would put some bullets in her gun and keep it where she could get at it if she was receiving this level of threat.  <br />But the biggest disappointment to me was the handling of the whole Ranger romance thing.  I realize that Morelli is to be Stephanie's destiny.  But I thought Ranger might get a book or two.  But no.  It's wishy-wash, wishy-wash, fireworks (for less than a page) and then run back to Morelli.  Phooey!<br />To sum it all up, the jokes are wearing thin.  Stephanie needs to start being slightly more competent.
B00004XONN|4.0|...that &quot;Optimistic&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; by Pink Floyd (and later covered by Camper Van Beethoven)?  I have a hard time enjoying a song when it's main musical idea is taken from somewhere else, no matter how well done the song is--but there are plenty of other strong and original songs on this record--&quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; is especially hard to get out of your head.  Definitely less extroverted and more of an acquired taste than &quot;OK Computer&quot;, but OKC was the best record of the 90s so it's no shame for &quot;Kid A&quot; to leave me feeling a bit, shall we say, &quot;Let Down&quot;...
0380002930|5.0|Very simply: my favorite work of fiction ever written. _Watership Down_ is the story of a group of English rabbits who leave their doomed warren in search of a better home. The company contains all the ingredients of an Arthurian court: the great, but humble king; the warrior; the bard; the seer. They have their inventor and their soldiers and their noble dream. These rabbits are armed only with their wits, their simple religion, and the mythological inspiration of an ancient hero. They play out their battles on the humble, legend-steeped downs of England.<br />_Watership Down_ has been described as a political novel based on the authors observations during WWII, but from all I've read, the book was mainly the result of Adam's stories to his two young daughters. While driving them to see Shakespeare's plays, Adams invented animal tales which he believed embodied the spirit, if not he setting, of the classics. He later worked the stories into the book that became _Watership Down_. It is a mark of the novel's scope that, although I read and loved it at 12, I was sitting in a 400-level university Ancient Classics class before I discovered the meaning of one of the chapter titles.  <br />_Watership Down_ is one of those books that defies categorization. To call it a \\"children's book\\" would be a gross misnomer, although the book was written for children. To call it an \\"animal story,\\" would be as technically correct as categorically wrong. To call it fantasy would be odd, for it lacks the most prominent ingredient of modern fantasy-magic.  <br />That said, the book was magic for me. It deals with ethics, with leadership, with friendship, with biology, with war. The characters have remained with me long after the details of the plot have faded. Now, more than ten years after I first opened it, _Watership Down_ retains an honored place on my bookshelf.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I just read some of the other reviews who critisize this album for having too many songs. HOW CAN AN ALBUM HAVE &quot;TOO MANY SONGS&quot;???!! I'll admit, a few songs like &quot;Enemy Fire&quot; and &quot;Wildflowers&quot; and a few other slow acoustic ballads could have been left off but you can't critisize someone for taking chances with songs because someone's bound to like them. Rescue Blues, NY, NY, Somehow Someday, Firecracker, Answering Bell, Gonna Make You Love Me, and Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues are all GREAT SONGS. I'm even considering buying the double CD just for the 5 extra songs because I trust this guy so much. I think he's a love-him-or-hate-him guy but I love him.
0312265859|3.0|As with many fans of Ms. Evanovich, I could not wait for the next book to be released.  I raced to the bookstore to buy it. I did not take a break for food or water or bio break as I wanted to read the book straight through.   The humour and Laugh Out Loud lines or retorts are ever present and sprinkled in the story right when you need them.  I was a bit disappointed that with book \\"eight\\" Stephanie has not gone beyond the predictable disasters and chases.  What makes Ms. Evanovich work's so much fun and appealing is the obsurdity of the event, the unusual, the unpredictable, regardless of the degree or severity of it.  I think it is time for Stephanie to make a commitment and let the adventures move to the next level.  I still can't wait for the next book.  Hope we don't have to wait until next summer.
B000002OX5|5.0|First I would like to say that the Pirate Radio parodies of jingles are really great and make this a really edgey album. The songs are pretty psychedelic which is unusual for The Who. I love the songs &quot;I Can't Reach You&quot;, &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Girl's Eyes&quot;, &quot;Someone's Coming&quot;, &quot;Rael 1&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Cold Taxi&quot;, &quot;Glow Girl&quot;, and my favorite Who song of all time: &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; This is a great and funny album with well crafted Pete Townshend songs.
B000066NW0|5.0|The is the first time that i have ever seen a young female that can play and write her own song with such emotion and knowledge of the world.  This cd is the best cd i have boughten  in years.  Hopefully it is the future of rock music.  By combining punk and melodic rock, Avril lavigne has made an awesome record.  &quot;Let Go&quot; can be listened to by almost anyone with its diversity and amazing lyrics.
0060934913|2.0|Bourdain is funny, bitter, and smart on his television show. That's what makes this book such a huge disappointment. The chef comes across as a hopelessly arrested blowhard; only his visit to the Veritas kitchen, and his grudging recognition that you don't have to be wholly dissolute to be a great chef, mutes the constant \\"sex, drugs, rock and foie gras\\" chest pounding. There are two references to Watergate and at least three to the New York Dolls. Mr. Bourdain's stuck in the Seventies hipness comes off as a little sad: Does he really think the twenty-something vatos locos working his kitchen think he's cool 'cause he cooks while cranking The Cramps on his boombox? <br />Another thing that rankles is the utter disorganization of the book. There's no coherence, no discernible chronology. It reads like a first draft. Also, the text is rife with grammatical and spelling errors, as if it were edited underneath a restaurant table (which, judging from the author's self-described lifestyle, it may have been). The message is, sloppiness in the kitchen is anathema, sloppiness in print is a sign of brilliance.<br />It's hard to not like a guy who once said the most painful thing on TV was Bobby Flay, pretending to enjoy the downhome cuisine of America, but this book is to good writing what the McDonald's #3 value meal is to fine dining: greasy, empty calories.
B000066F6H|5.0|Five dopey looking dudes from the land of Abba out to save rock and roll? You bet...The Hives have a chainsaw guitar cross-attack that will make your hairs stand on end. Forget about the Strokes and White Stipes, these are the real saviors of rock and roll. Music that makes you want to drink 15 expressos and do something really weird in front of an authority figure. If you buy just one CD for the rest of your life, this is it...your new favorite band!
B00000064G|5.0|I bought this album without knowing quite what to expect.  Nick Drake has a very large underground following and this album will explain exactly why.  I picked up this album on a lark when researching the lyrics to a song by Dunan Sheik.  Pink Moon is just another example of buried genius.  How artists like this never gain a presence in the mainstream American music scene baffles me.<br />Pink Moon is a very simple construction, with only vocals and acoustic guitar.  However, Nick Drake is able to take what would appear to be a limited palette and create a range of melodies that go from lighthearted and sweet to dark and forboding.  The title track, Pink Moon, is particularly tragic in light of Drake's eventual fate.  <br />Nick Drake is one of those rare artists that makes me love an album from a genre that I don't typically enjoy (folk acoustic).  Absolutely brilliant.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's C.D. is AWESOME!! It's her own style, not another Brittany Spears<BR>wannabe (thank goodness)! She's very talented and when you listen to her C.D., you can<BR>see that. With alot of C.D.'s you only like a few songs, but with ''Let Go'' all the songs<BR>ROCK, and she wrote/cowrote all of them.  When I first heard her song ''Complicated'', I<BR>loved it and I knew I had to buy ''Let Go''. I'm so glad I did! I listen to it every single day,<BR>and I already wore my batteries out once. It's hard to explain how good it is. It's honestly<BR>the best C.D. I've heard in a long time. I'm really glad I bought it, because it's awesome!!<BR>Most of the songs are true, by that I mean it really happened to her. An example of this is<BR>the song ''Losing Grip'', and I think the title ''Let Go'' fits the C.D. well. The song<BR>''Complicated'' isn't really something that happened to her but what happens to everyone.<BR>In the chorus it says... Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated see the way<BR>you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated, lifes like this you fall and you<BR>crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it into honesty promise me<BR>I'm never gonna find ya fake it... and that happens to alot of people, they act different<BR>around different people. I like how she gave an example to what happens in everyday life.<BR>Which I think is a good thing!
B000001EIA|5.0|I don't understand why this Unplugged album is not put in the ranks with Eric Clapton's and Paul McCartney's. It is clearly as good (or, dare I say, better) than these. Every song is great. Who knew Kiss could sound so great on acoustic guitars? The most important thing to notice is that they stay away, for the most part, from songs that have acoustic guitars in the studio versions. If they would have done that, it still would have been a good album but this is even better because you can see that they are talented. One more thing, only Kiss would have the balls to do disco on acoustic guitars (Sure Know Something).
B000000OQF|5.0|Starting from the timeless hit,Welcome To The Jungle to Rocket Queen,I enjoyed this album very much.Only song that I don't like is You're Crazy,but as I said,the rest are great.Favorites are Welcome To The Jungle,Nighttrain,Out Ta Get Me,Sweet Child O Mine,Think About You,and Rocket Queen.Other great ones are My Michelle,It's So Easy,Mr.Brownstone,Paradise City,and Anything Goes.I rate the album around a 4.5-4.7,so I rounded up.Just put it in the CD player and enjoy some awesome hard rock!!!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I didn't purchase this film and I really don't plan to since I really didn't like it that much when I rented it. I got confused for a second and thought I'd rented a Will Smith[movie]...I thought that this movie was at least watchable especially during the fight scenes. The choregraphy was on the money. Smith even talked trash like the original and the greatest Ali...He would've been Ali had he been a boxer and had a big mouth but Ali was more than that, he refused to go to Vietnam, he stood against what society during his hayday thought he should've been complacent with like racism and to some degree class discrimination...  I think if you don't like Smith, you won't really like this movie. You ought to check out some of the movies staring the real Ali! You get to see the Man in action albeit black exploitation but still a lot better than Smith's Ali!
B000000OTU|5.0|Has all of Aerosmith's late 80's/early 90's best hits Rag Doll,Dude(Looks Like A Lady),Janie's Got A Gun,Angel,and What It Takes just to name a few.Definetely well worth the money.As Steve Tyler would say,\\"It's Amazing!!!\\"
B000002MQ9|5.0|This album has to be THE most dramatic, romantic, gothic(not goth) piece of work i have ever heard. It's so beautifully over-the-top and strong in composition. &quot;Anywhere Out Of The World&quot; is a gloomy and decadant starter with eerie melodic belltones, dark and forboding strings, a pulsing synth bass and, best of all, Brendan's woeful croon. I think Lisa's best moment is during &quot;Summoning The Muse&quot;, an engulfing piece with a chorus of angels mourning the loss of everything young and beautiful, causing the sky to just rain down in perfect misery. The whole album is solid, each song keeping a perfect place with in the album, nothing too dull or underworked. This record is a MUST for the passionate, brooding sort.
B00005A46T|1.0|Yet another metal band who has a contest to see who can play and scream the loudest.This album ain't worth a damn or even the 1 star I had to give it.
0767020308|2.0|I thought that this adaptation showed much better the stories of the supporting characters -- most especially the Jane/Frank storyline which was quite engaging. (To a certain degree, I wish they had been the lead characters in this adaptation.) I also thought Mr. Woodhouse was a lot of fun and his characterization right on the money with the book. Also very good was the portrayal of Miss Bates.<br />That being said, my problem with this adaptation (and it's a big one) is that I didn't particularly care for the way Emma and Mr. Knightley were played/characterized in this one. Perhaps it's the writing and perhaps its the actors (but really, Beckinsale was so good in Cold Comfort Farm, so why couldn't she have pulled this one off?), however, I just didn't very much care for the way the lead characters were portrayed. First of all, as annoying as Emma can be in the book, I always liked her (even if I didn't approve of what she was doing). In this adaptation, I just didn't LIKE Emma. She was too snooty, too spoiled and seemed much too selfish. As for Mr. Knightley, he was always the embodiment of a perfect gentleman to me. Even though he was the only who would find fault with Emma and tell her so, he was graciousness and politeness itself to everybody else. Here, his scolding of Emma was just too heated and beyond anything I would call gentlemanly and to the extent he did it in front of everyone else (as in one scene), would definitely not be gracious nor polite. <br />Anyway, I own practically all the recent Jane Austen adaptations (A&E's -Pride and Prejudice (the best IMO), Sense & Sensibility, Emma and Mansfield Park, and this adaptation may be the only one I will not buy because I just can't see myself deciding to see it again and again like the others. Don't get me wrong, it has some good points (especially the supporting characters), but I don't really come away from it with the feeling that I want to know more about what happens to the main characters after the movie is finished.
B000002H6C|1.0|Could this music be summed up any better.One of the most overrated bands out there,Metallica.Some of their songs like Justice For All is boring while others are just noise.These guys are great?That's too funny.
B00005BL2A|5.0|It's almost a shame that Depeche are so successful, because it means that people think they know who they are.  Legions of listeners will miss out on this gem completely, on the strength of their opinions of \\"people are people\\", \\"everything counts\\", \\"just can't get enough\\" \\"new life\\" or any other track which only demonstrates what depeche were doing then, not now.  This newest release is a highly melodic, deeply true and somehow universal, journey through the soul and the self-doubt of a human being.  The expressions of despair go hand in hand with the desire to find hope and positivity, poignant portaits of the ugliness of human nature twinned with the grace, elegance and inherent beauty of the individual stiving for acceptance.
B00002R0MC|5.0|When I purchased this box set originally in 1992 I could not believe how phenomenal of a collection of his works it is.  It even introduced me to his earlier works, which I now like even more than his more popular songs.  I have listened to these albums so much in the past 10 years that I have worn them out!  Now I have to purchase another set.  Too bad it no longer comes in the long form with the autobiography in it, the book is fantastic!  I highly recommend this set for any Marley fans or newcomers curious about his works.  These are definitely my favorite albums.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is the ultamite hard rock band. The best thing since Limp Bizkit, but of corse you already know that. :)<BR>Many singles all over the radio proove it is a great CD. Now for ratting indevidual songs.<br />Papercut: 9/10 A great song about parinoia. Reminds me of Garbages' I think I'm Parinoid! <br />One Step Closer: 10/10 The Most memorable trek on the CD. A great instaint hit. Everybody can relate to this song<br />With You: 6/10 my least favorite song on the CD. I don't know why, it just doesn't catch my attention.<br />Points of Authority: 7/10 A song I could live without but still good music<br />Crawling: 10/10 The song that drew me to Linkin Park. Pretty good. Don't listen to it to much or it gets abnoctious.<br />Runaway: 10/10 My favorite song on the Disk. Great music, great vocals, great lyrics, what more coould you want?<br />By Myself: 10/10 great guitaring is the main reasaon I like this song.<br />In the End: 10/10 Even though it doesn't have as much HARD rock as some of the others, it still a great song.<br />A Place for my head: 9/10 A great song for some reason. Interesting lyrics, or interesting music?<br />Forgotten: 9/10 Lots of hard rock with less screaming, just how I like it<br />Cure for the Itch: 8/10 Neat non-rock DJ song, if you can call iut a real song.<br />Pushing me Away: 7/10 Too generic some how.<br />All in all, this Album is great and I'm looking forward to their next!!!!
B000002U9L|5.0|There's no denying that 'Labyrinth' is a cult movie. and what a gr8 one too. i have been a jim henson fan for a long time and when i heard about the movie 'labyrinth' (im a young fan) i rented it immediately. once you watch it, you'll fall in love it no matter who you are or what your age. i also got the soundtrack and my favorite songs are 'as the world falls down' and 'chilly down'. a score by trevor jones called 'home at last' brings me near to tears. i got the soundtrack and fell it love with it as well, even though i don't normally like 80s music. and in response to an earlier review, a reviewer said 'the backup singers are bad in the song \\"magic dance\\"' don't take offense, but the backup singers are bad because in the movie 'magic dance' is the song where jareth sings accompanied by goblins, and you wouldn't think that goblins had voices of angels, wouldja?<BR>i recommend this soundtrack to everyone, but i just suggest watching the movie before getting the CD.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Most of this CD is great hard rock music. Hot Dog, My Generation, My Way, Full Nelson, Rollin' (Air Raid vehicle) and a few others really show what Limp Bizkit is cappable of. But a few of their songs on this CD just plain [are bad]. The other version of rollin, (Urban Assault Vehicle), is an extended/rap/remix of the original and is terrible. It looses all the high pace hard rock and distorts it while adding pointless lyrics and sound effects. A few other songs are also too rappy. Rap is okay sometimes, but Getcha Groove on is the only Okay rap song on this Album. But for the most part, good job Limp Bizkit!
B00000IQW0|5.0|Battlestar Galactica was the coolest thing when it aired on ABC back in 1978. Universal Studios and Glen Larson put together, very quickly, a fantastic premise for a good character driven series.<br />They developed their own language, letters and even swearing. The stars at the time were unknown (Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict) with a few surprises  like Lorne Green leading the Bonanza in space and John Colicos (from General Hospital fame) leading the enemies  the Cylons!<br />For the time, the special effects were matched only to that of Star Wars (which came out the year before) and the costumes and props where cleverly done. There is even talk of a revival movie for television or even a feature have been around for a while  but nothing yet. Richard Hatch himself wants to be involved.<br />The series failed in its later episodesit started playing with the characters and obviously losing its budget. They tried to revive it with Barry Van Dyke in a  series called Galactica 1980  with flying motorcycles  but that didnt work either.<br />I loved this pilot episode and the DVD is one certainly to own. I wish it had commentary by cast and crew. I liked it.
0380729407|5.0|Great.<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes is a little gothic masterpiece by Ray Bradbury. The story concerns Will Holloway, his best friend Jim Nightshade, and his father Charles Holloway. One October a carnival comes to town. The carnival is run by a group of freaks who are intent on evil. The entire town, and particularly the two boys, and put in terrible danger. That all leads to a tremendous climax as Will, Jim, and Charles have to try to learn the true nature of good and evil to save themselves and the town.<br />I can't believe that some people have written that this book is dated. I don't think that anyone will be saying that after the events of September 11. As long as fathers and sons still love one another and as long as there is evil to strive againgst, this novel will still be extremely valid. Something Wicked This Way Comes is fairly symbolic, and comments greatly on the nature of good and of evil. The story is fascinating and enlightening. Absolutely any reader can read this wonderful novel, be moved by it, and come away with a better understanding of human nature. I don't think that Ray Bradbury gets the credit he deserves, but any read of one of his novels will prove to the reader that he is a GREAT novelist.
B0000640VM|4.0|Oliver &amp; Company is a new twist on an Old story. This one has a little flare and music with a lot of personality. The story is around the street of New York City. And to let you know the emotional impact, it opens with an animated aerial view of the Manhattan Skyline - which includes the World Trade Center buildings. (This movie was made in 1988)<br />My favorite character - besides Oliver's innocence, is Bette Midler and Cheech Marin. They steel the scenes with their wit and humor. Very sharp and emotional are their deliveries of the lines.<br />The kids will relate to the young girl finding her new kitten and the adults can relate to those every threatening debts we all seem to have. The music is fun, but not consistent. (By this I mean all the songs are from different writers - there is no common thread in the music and songs.)<br />I enjoyed this movie a lot. My favorite Disney of all time is still The Little Mermaid. The DVD Extras are great for the kids and the behinds the scenes the adults will find interesting.
6304415346|5.0|Absolutely wonderful-- Great sequel to the Next Gen episodes: The best of Both Worlds Parts I-II!! Jamie Cromwell, Alice Krige, and Alfre Woodard send out their best as the Co-Stars in this film. The borg come back to Earth for another round of play against the Federation starship with Captain Jean-Luc Picard in command (Patrick Stewart). Brent Spiner as Lt. Cmdr. Data and Stewart are the main roles in this film. Stewart battles the Borg Queen (Krige) in his mind and Spiner battles Krige in the physical state as she tempts him with flesh and blood-- his dream of endeavoring to become more human. This film proves that the even-numbered Star Trek films are the best. (Star Trek II, IV, VI, First Contact, and hopefully upcoming X- Nemesis)
B00000JPH6|3.0|The Dark Crystal is one of those movies you really need to see more than once to understand. It is slow in pace and often convoluted with dialogue that isn't quite clear.<br />Bur beyond that, the simple story of friendship and teamwork is strong throughout. Trust and doubt play a big part in these characters. Jim Henson and his creature shop really put a lot of work into the making of this movie. I don't think it paid off as well.<br />There is an old witch who sounds a lot like Fozzie Bear and Master Yoda - but that's because it is the voice and actions of Frank Oz. Visually it is an interesting film too. The imagery is very dark and filled with character in the sets and costumes.<br />The DVD contains no real great extras but a simple featurette that explains the making and design of the movie. A lot of work went into it but it wasn't a commercial success either. I don't think really younger kids will get it.<br />I saw this in the theatre and had mixed feelings about it but on the TV it works much much better!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|OK I'm only 13 but I guess I have good taste. I got this CD because \\"London Calling\\" was on the sountrack to Billy Elliot and I really liked it so I decided to get this CD. Now I have 4 Clash CD's. I can't believe the new world of punk not being influenced by them. Also, I was really pleased to see that Saves the Day did a cover on \\"Clash City Rockers\\" and Rage Against the Machine did a cover on \\"Clampdown\\" I love all the songs on this album some are kind of 'discoie' but that's okay because they all totally rock! So as I like to say, \\"Stop listening to that pop [junk] and get yourself a real band like THE CLASH: The only band that matters!\\"  :-)
6305342776|4.0|The Black Hole was Disney's attempt in 1979 to get on the space band wagon after the release of Star Wars in 1977. The movie overall has a slow pace. But because of the interesting visuals - its not a hard thing to watch.<br />Technically it is a fantastic film. Peter Ellenshaw's graphics, illustrations and designs are wonderful. The ships are very detailed and the costumes - fit, but clever.<br />The characters that stand out are Ernest Borgnine's troublesome personality as well as Yvette Mimoux. My favorite is by far, was the vocalizations of Roddy McDowell as V.I.N.CENT (Vital Information Necessary Centralized).<br />The main bridge set was incredible and the robot Maximillian was very scary. The story is simple and not very detailed, but the movie overall was fun. The music is the best. A great score by John Barry. I loved the soundtrack.<br />The DVD extra's are cool too. The behind the scenes with cast and crew are fun and detailed. This one is a must for the Sci-Fi fan.
B000007NYS|5.0|This is not a perfect album. In 1988 Lucinda Williams still had not learned to stay within her musical range -- I'm talking about her voice. But this comment only pertains to two songs (out of 18) on the CD. In fact, one has to admire Lucinda for trying to do these numbers. As Emmy Lou Herris said (something to the effect), &quot;Lucinda works in dangerous territory...&quot;<br />She's not content to let well enough alone. She's out there on the edge, checking it out, finding out what's possible. This is one of the reasons she's so amazing.<br />For someone so creative, constantly experimenting and trying to do more, such a criticism about her voice is minor. Indeed, it's more of a commentary on a great talent gaining maturity with every album. <br />After Car Wheels on a Gravel Road -- an album without a mis step -- I don't know what I expected. Enough to say that this CD grows on you -- how mant artists can you say that about? Damn few -- and it rates five stars. <br />I counted seven TERRIFIC songs out of twelve. PLUS, four out of the six additional cuts are also fabulous, especially two of the blues numbers -- that were recorded live during a radio gig in LA. <br />I am simply amazed by the authenticity of Lucinda's music -- raw as it sometimes is. Blues. Country. Folk. She covers it all...<br />I haven't been so excited by a performer in 15 years. I'm sure I'll eventually get all of her albums/CDs. My only regret is that I didn't discover Lucinda Williams years sooner.
0451191153|5.0|its not a matter of style, or how rand writes her stories through and through again, its just the emotion. when you read this book you feel like you are a part of it.<br />rand is definately a timeless artist, a writer with untouchable skill.
B000069HK2|4.0|Brilliantly combining elements of emo, punk & traces of hardcore with pop & commercial rock, The Used has forged a powerfully emotional, highly dynamic, and melodically appealing brand of music that conjures up images of Thursday, Finch, Taking Back Sunday, and Open Hand, yet also possesses its own unique flair. Sonically, The Used composes striking soundscapes that are a blend of sharp, inventive riffs, memorable hooks, & sweeping melodies inlaid with compelling rhythms and versatile drumwork, all of which is executed through tight musicianship and with excellent precision. Composition wise, songs are diverse and well arranged, featuring defined progressions, varying tempo shifts, and effective breakdowns, not to mention superb use of contrasting elements. Vocally, Bert McCraken leads the way with his meaningful lyrics and The Juliana Theory/Thursday-like vocals that range from beautiful harmonies & pop hooks to hardcore-influenced screams & cathartic Glassjaw-like expressionism, while strong backing vocals provide an additional characteristic. Overall, The Used have come a long way in a very short period of time, showcasing greater maturity & confidence compared to past efforts, while honing their sound into a more distinctive state. Truth be told, The Used have taken a more melodically driven, commercially accessible direction with their music, and are utilizing ideas that are not exactly original or groundbreaking, but in the end, those are just moot points when dealing with the pure emotion & integrity that emanates from the band.<br />In a time where such emo-inspired bands as Thursday, Jimmy Eat World, Dashboard Confessional, Glassjaw and Taking Back Sunday are flourishing, The Used have emerged with their S/T debut, which contains elements of the aforementioned bands, yet takes the entire \\"emo\\" scene to a whole new level of accessibility. With songs ranging from pop-like anthems & acoustic ballads to soaring rock numbers and hardcore-tinged designs, The Used's 12-track debut is a diverse, yet appealing album that captures the heartfelt emotion of the band in all of its raw anger, beauty & pain. Leading off the album in explosive fashion is Maybe Memories, which, along with Box Full Of Sharp Objects, are dynamic, aggressive/melodic-contrasting songs, with the former dealing with Bert McCraken's drug-related past. From there, the album introduces the more accessible side of the band, led by the ultra-catchy, pop-punk anthem The Taste Of Ink - a revised song that appears on the 2001 3-song demo, along with Maybe Memories and Box Full Of Sharp Objects - and is a track that represents the story of the band. Other highly infectious songs includes Blue And Yellow and Buried Myself Alive, both of which are melodically driven, emo-rock/pop-punk inspired tracks with the latter featuring powerfully emotional choruses. Showcasing yet another side to the band is the beautiful & heartrending acoustic ballad On My Own, while Poetic Tragedy is an emotional, melodic ballad that also contains traces of pop and hardcore screaming. Rounding out the album are such vigorous, yet catchy melodic contrasting songs as Bulimic & Say Days Ago, the emo/indie-like Greener With Scenery that shows traces of Sunny Day Real Estate, the groove-driven Noise And Kisses with its hardcore-like breakdown, and the semi-upbeat, emotional ending track Pieces Mended. In the end, The Used have recorded a very impressive debut that, while it may be criticized for its lack of overall originality & commercialized nature, should easily appeal to listeners of all genres, with its genre-spanning diversity, sincere emotion, and sense of timelessness...
B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Is she wearing a #$%!in' bra?\\" That's what Avril said about Britney. Literally. But this 17-year-old Canadian skater punk is much more than what she wears (Ties and tanks, who else could pull that off?), and much more than what she says. It's easily found on her debut album, Let Go.<br /> From beginning to end, you'll listen. Here's my thoughts on each track:<br />Losing Grip - Very angst ridden about rejection or betrayal. Very Incubus-like. (Another one of my favorites; hers too.)<br />Complicated - Posers, fakers, preps. It's about being who you are, not someone else. A good song for people my age. Perfect premiere release.<br />Sk8er Boi - It's just as cute as the title. A girl changes her mind about a skater boy, because her friends disapprove of him. As soon as he becomes a famous rock star, the girl and her friends regret disliking him. And since Avril understands him, he becomes her skater boy. It's adorable. Just listen to it.<br />I'm With You - Avril has also stated that she was a romantic at heart. I see it's true here.<br />Mobile - Dealing with change. Something I can relate to.<br />Unwanted - Another song with music that somehow reminds me of Incubus. Again she seems upset.<br />Tomorrow - It's hard to choose a favorite, but I really like the tune of this song. And the message about being insecure about certain people is good, too.<br />Anything But Ordinary - Also relates to me! Great song.<br />Things I'll Never Say - Goodness. Another song that completely relates to me, too. I think this can relate to lots of people. Boys and Girls. Very cute singing here. I like her La-da-da's.<br />My World - She's just so damn cute and refreshing once again.<br />Nobody's Fool - Great lyrics. She raps a little, too.<br />Too Much To Ask - This is where I can see that she sounds like Alanis Morissette. Another great song.<br />Naked - Also very Alanis. Excellent song to end an excellent album.<br /> As for ratings, the entire album is five stars and more. I just love how even though she's all tough and sometimes angry, she's also very insightful and positive. We know she'll get better and better by each album. (She plans on doing this for the rest of her life. I hope it turns out that way.) And she may change and mature even more (Like she sings, \\"It's amazing what a couple of years could be.\\"), but you can tell already that despite her crazy, fun, tomboy ways, she's very mature. In today's world of music, Avril will definitely rock the world. And I'm definitely looking forward to it.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I must admit that I am biased toward material specifically geared toward children. Very seldomly does a childrens movie contain material that is enjoyable for adults as well. When Harry Potter began to get popular I just ignored it, something I had learned to do when I got sick of the Pokemon mania that was ending just around that time. I had no desire to get involved with the Harry Potter franchise.<br /> I was suprised that this movie seemed to begin planning and wrap shooting in six months. Two months later the movie was in theaters. When a movie is done in that short of time I tend to really doubt its ability to be a good movie. My parents begged and pleaded with me to visit them one night, and they had planned a trip to see this movie for a family activity. I didn't really want to go but I'm glad I did.<br /> The movie was far from unenjoyable, and while the CGI effects were not spectacular the story was innovative, and fun despite being childish. The movie manages to be childish, but not immature, which makes it one of the most enjoyable kiddie flicks to date. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel.<br /> The acting in this movie is spectacular. I have not seen such talent in youth since Haley Joel Osment. The actors were also well cast as far as appearances because the actors resemble the characters they are portraying more so than any other movie of its kind. I am very pleased with the way this movie was done. If the special effects were better it would have otten five stars from me.<br /> I have not had time to check out the DVD extras yet, however just reading the back of the box has me itching for the time to do just that. I also must stress the importance of getting this movie in Widescreen I have seen both the Widescreen and Pan & [Scan] (Full screen) editions of this movie. You loose a lot of picture on the Pan & [Scan] version as the movie was presented in a 2:35:1 ratio, more than half of the picture is lost in the transition to \\"Full Screen\\".
0784011796|5.0|This guy Cohen wants to find out bad! Anyone that likes hard-core (pure) mathematics will find this film a real treat...Hey! It has a great plot and story line too! If you are one of those nerds that takes a pad and pencil into a movie and tries in vain to scribble equations off the blackboard when they arise, you will probably do Okay in this one. But if you ever get tired of number theory or math in general, I don't recommend Cohen's method for forgetting about the subject! I personally believe that a lot of our pitfalls in advancing the study of applied math are a lack enthusiasm directed to youth...perhaps this film and it followings may lend some inspiration to what is \\"considered by the general populace\\" a dry and abstract subject.
0792844890|4.0|There are few comedies that can come close to touching the insanity of Mel Brooks. The man is a genius; there is not another way to describe it. He has done a parody film for just about every genre out there. In this film his target is Sci-Fi space operas. Star Wars, Star trek, Aliens and many other classics become the target of one massive farce on space adventures.<br />Spaceballs is without a doubt one of Brook's finest, and even has a few quotable scenes of its own. \\"Evil will always triumph because good is dumb.\\"<br />The movie tells the story of a Druish princess who does not want to marry the royal pain Prince Valume. Rather than marry for her father's sake she runs away and is then attacked by Spaceballs who want to use her to blackmail her father into giving them the code to the air shield which guards 10,000 years of fresh air. The Spaceballs have nearly destroyed their planet and need to steal the air from Planet Druidia in order to save their own world.<br />Space cowboy Lonestar and his furry companion Barf are in debt to the notorious gangster Pizza the Hut. Thankfully the Druid King Rolland hires them to rescue his daughter from Spaceballs. The set up is clich&eacute; sci-fi, and in that way its perfect for what Brooks set out to do.<br />The problem with this movie is that the jokes do get tiresome. Unlike History of the World, Spaceballs has a limited view value. It is not a movie you could watch repeatedly and have it still be funny. If you take a \\"break\\" from it some of the laughs can be revived, but most of the gags do get old and stale after a while. It is still a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection. Especially for the Mel Brooks commentary on the movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a skater/punk, but you'd never guess that from her music.  It's nice to see someone not trying to fit into a prefabricated mold or genre based on their appearance.  Avril shows the many kinks in her personality that everyone can relate to in songs like 'Anything But Ordinary,' and bursts with pure emotion in others such as 'Unwanted' and 'I'm With You.'  While it might not be for everyone, 'Let Go' has definitely become a favorite of mine!

Read it by the pool after a new novel that our book club picked up, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Janet Evanovich makes me laugh, Kirk Martin makes me cry. Perfect complements. Can't wait for NINE!!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This film is a beautiful piece of work. It truly captures the feeling of being in a dream--the animation is lovely &amp; the score sets the mood perfectly. Even the sound is slightly muffled at times, to evoke a dream-like quality: like when you are half-awake &amp; the sounds around you in the outside world are incorporated into your dream.<BR> It is a very thought provoking and profound movie. It's not really a movie that one would watch for a bit of light entertainment, as at times it can get fairly complex. But it is a very entertaining movie that stays in your memory &amp; is fun to mull over and analyze--no interpretations are wrong.<BR> I wish that I had dreams that were as cool and intellectually stimulating as the dreamer in this movie is having. Even the use of color throughout the movie is captivating!<BR> The DVD is great, because it has some animation that ended up on the scrap-heap and live footage of the actors, before the animation was layered over them so fantastically.<BR> It is a favorite movie of both my husband &amp; I.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie is a must for all those who think they live a decent life. A life without fun, without fights, without love, without breaking rules, a life that consists of going to the church, hidding the frustations from others... Living without life at all. Surviving, not living.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I must say that this DVD is the best I have ever seen. The only thing Director Ridley Scott should not have added was the love tale. I kind of died. The fight scenes in this movie compare to any war movie including Black Hawk Down and U-571. The only down part of this movie is that you will be sad in the end. BUt thats the way all great movies finish.
0553260111|4.0|I too started this book when I heard about the movie being made. It took me a while to get past page 20 (it is kind of overwhelming). Overall I liked the book, but I agree with the reviewer who said that there are fast-paced parts that keep you reading followed by dull action sequences and reiterations of things you've already learned. I liked the twists, but they got a little buried under unnecessary parts. But the good does outweigh the bad, so you should definitely try this book!
B0000640VN|3.0|The movie is very enjoyable brain-candy. It contains tasteful humour, lively repartee and lovely cinematography. It is fast paced and the plot is fresh and evocative. However, the chemistry between Leopold and Kate (Meg Ryan) just didn't work and it was difficult to imagine how a lovely, sophisticated man could fall for a sad-sack ragamuffin of a woman with an unlovable personality and who seems to be caught in a bad hair time warp. Meg Ryan topped her all time street-urchin looks in unattractively boyish, sack-like clothing which enhanced her bony angles and awkward mien. She sported a somewhat longer version of her usual wayward-looking hairdo and had dirty fingernails and feet. Then she infused the character with a bad personality and attitude. In her other movies she is universally charming, but as Kate, she is only grating and altogether un-endearing. Hugh Jackman, conversely, hit just the right stride with Leopold. He is chivalrous without being corny, intelligent without being dweebish. He makes the character interesting and looks so ruggedly handsome and plays the part so charmingly, he is irresistible. SO. 5-stars to Leopold, 1-star to Kate, averaging 3-stars overall.

B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are the best thing to hit the scene since Nirvana.  I bought their CD on a whim and it ended being my favorite.  Each song meshes together so well and everyone in the band plays off of each other. They are intivative and original and each musician is talented, and their talents are well exhibited.  I would reccommend the CD to anyone who likes the Velvet Underground.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I forget the atomic number for Nitrogen and I'd like to give my brother Keynote an atomic wedgie, but nevermind about all that.  This album by Norah is goody good.  She sings a little like she's been supping helium balloons, but the music is pleasing to my little ears and soothing to my saved soul.  This is a good 'un.
B000002UA5|1.0|The live cd is ok, BUT the studio album is so god-awful that I can't even describe it.  THIS IS NOT MUSIC. Where are the \\"vocals\\" in this cd anyway?

If i could rate it 0 stars i would.
1590710037|5.0|Steven Pressfield's Book the &quot;War of Art&quot; is hands down, absolutely the best book of its kind in the self-improvement genre.<br />This first class book should be required reading for everyone in Hollywood and any body who has to follow there own path.<br />Mr. Pressfield has the uncanny and brilliant ability to simplify and comprehend a complex subject and distill it down to its finer points.<br />The Subject?  Combating the resistance of others and continuing on your own journey successfully, regardless of the obstacle.  In other words he explains how to stay on your own heroes journey and live the life we need to live.  Mr. Pressfield asks the reader what would you do if you knew you could not fail.<br />From the mirrors on the cover to its last page you will find the book funny, insightful, deep, griping, forthright, and kind; just fantastic and outstanding in every way.<br />This is an important book and you will not be disappointed.
B000066NW0|5.0|For being seventeen years old, Avril speaks her mind, and blows Britney out of the water. Songs like 'I'm With you' and 'Thing's I'll Never Say,' reallt strike you.

B0000640VO|5.0|I can write for hours about french filming, but there are not to many french films that uplift you. This is a beautiful, funny and warm comedy, with a great message for you. Don't miss it, and keep it on your DVD collection.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|There's no way on earth you could not submit to the charm of this album. Fans of Aphex's later work should find out where his mastery of perfection all began, and newcomers should give it a listen on the basis of this album's amorphous beauty and charisma. This album contains, in its purest form, the common link between all electronic forms of music. While Richard's more recent singles have been poured through a thick film of sarcasm, the songs of Selected Ambient Works 85-92 truly represent the subliminal moodiness that has followed him through I Care Because You Do and the Richard D James LP. As detailed and undulating as his new work is, sometimes I feel as though he has lost some of the pensive and brooding airiness that makes his work so unique.<br />Beautiful melodies that get caught in your mind form an addiction that is only appeased by another listen. Like the dude said, timeless is the best word to use to describe this album, for although the instruments used in this creation have been surpassed by ten years of updated models, the compositions are perfectly executed, thus exposing the raw beauty, devoid of distraction or clutter. The fact that this is still widely regarded as Richard D. James' finest album to date shows what perfection has been achieved here.<br />Songs that still need a listen years after buying this album: Tha, Pulsewidth, i, Ageispolis [which I am only just beginning to really get into], Heliosphan, Hedphelym and Actium. The first track is a really nice introduction, too. I reccommend listening to Heliosphan or We Are The Music Makers if you want to make a decision online. The other tracks require many, many listens to reveal their true beauty, plus RealAudio can kill some of the joy of those subliminal basslines.<br />Another thing. If you're into this album and you haven't already got a copy of Incunabula by Autechre, then you've got some saving to do. These early nineties songs will gradually change the way you look at any form of electronic music written today. Yes, there is a whole new world to discover, starting right here.

B00005NWM3|4.0|i donno about other reviewers but l love nickelback, it's true that in most cases the song that broke it out for the band was the best and it's sad but true however i disagree that this band sounds the same in all their songs they all have a diffrent message in them such as 'too bad' i doubt wheather you can say that it sounds similar to 'how you remind me', i realize that everybody has their personal opinion, but i love this CD, and that's why i give it four stars.
6305508550|5.0|Every few minutes, I kept saying, \\"I have LIVED this movie. I have WORKED with those people. I have SUFFERED in that cube farm.\\" And I laughed. I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years. I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).<br />Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence. He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes. He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal. A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures. But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.<br />Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is. They say you know your job stinks when you think of Dilbert as more autobiographical than funny; your job is really terrible when you can spot your office in OFFICE SPACE. See it soon!
B000008COG|5.0|I think this album was very underated. In my opinion it is one of the best CD's I own. All the songs are solid ecept for &quot;Nick of Time&quot; and &quot;Ruff Stuff&quot;. I think this album is, and always will be overshadowed by albums like &quot;Back in Black&quot; which blunts the success of this excellent album. Unfortunately I basically had to go to Germany to find it.<BR>My recommendation is : SEEK IT OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM!!

Listening to many styles of music, having kids of my own, and smiling to see the Pepsi Generation =), putting us baby boomers where they should have been a long time ago, aside. <br />She has an awsome voice and has the potential to go quite far. In closing, if you think you can do better....go for it!! If not at least offer some constructive critism on why you dont like it and what she can do to make it better.<br />Everybody wants to be a critic, and yet no one wants to offer support to those that have already made it where you haven't gone.
B000002B35|4.0|I enjoyed this album but I must agree with the other reviewers that if you already have &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder,&quot; you don't need &quot;Pulse&quot; and vise versa.  Both live albums are pretty much about the same so buy one.  &quot;Pulse,&quot; however, does contain the complete live version of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; which is why I own it.  I have already mentioned that I hated the change in &quot;Money&quot; (&quot;Woo woo!&quot; horrors!  Was that done to irritate Rogers Waters?) so I won't talk about that.  I do wish, however, that someday Pink Floyd would put out a CD without all of the additional musicians.  Seems like everything has become such a big production.  I would love to listen to a recording where the only musicians involved are Gilmour, Wright, and Mason.  Granted, I don't expect the same kind of energy that the group had when they were young. What we are now listening to is an older, more mature Pink Floyd with a sound that is far slicker than the days before &quot;Dark Side of The Moon.&quot;  But though the music is still good, doesn't it seem devoide of an actual pulse?  Perhaps the music is too refined, too teaked, too perfect?  Is that possible?  Anyhow, this is a pretty good CD although a lifeless comparrison to what was, and I seriously don't think it has to do with the departure of Waters.  It isn't the same but nothing stays the same forever.
B00006690G|1.0|I really enjoyed the last two Eminem CDs.  I found them to be well-produced, great rhyme and beats and overall well written and very tounge-in-cheek. As a woman and a gay one at that, I could still appreciate the musicianship and talent Eminem put forth on his prior material, forget about the need for PC-values if the material is good enough to be incendiary. <br />In this case it isn't worth not being offended - it's just creepy, insulting and frankly not  clever at all. I received this disk on release day and was horrified at how bad it is - this album blows and I can't wait to ditch it.  Gone is the musicianship in lieu of hate-rap - and the thing is that I don't see anything but a millionaire trying to shock with this \\"effort\\". Let him play with Elton John, etc. Eminem is the true ... and I think, given his current lyrics, that he knows it.  \\"Without Me\\" is the only song on this album worth listening to.  Save your money.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is the best cd I have heard in the last ten years ...  Forget the criticisms and the deconstruction of the music just listen as pay attention to the lyrics because there are a lot of younger people in the world who believe he understands them and it helps to have someone to believe in after the year we have had in this country. So if you don't love this cd then you really didn't listen to it with your heart.

B00004X0ER|4.0|While I don't mainly listen to punk, I still thought album was fun and very enjoyable. The singer isn't some ..., distorted [person], the guitarists actually play differnet chords, the bass is alive and well, and the drumming fits the music perfectly. I believe The Hives are out there just to have fun and enjoy the music they play, unlike 'The Vines' and 'The Strokes' ('The' must be the new trend in bands these days), who are obviously trying to bring back the full on punk assault of the 70's/early 80's and take all the credit for it. Definately a must listen for fans of REAL punk and rock & roll, and even for fans of metal. Hail to the Hives!
B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black, director David Twohy's visually stimulating film, is a solid science fiction adventure, with an interesting cast, nasty aliens, and a pretty intelligent plot that holds together well for the most part.<br />A crisis in space, as a meteor shower damages the hull of the merchant vessel \\"Hunter Gratzner\\".  Awakening from a sleep state, the occupants of the spacecraft find themselves sliding down into the atmosphere of a planet.  Quick actions by the Docking Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), saves the ship from burning up, but much of the ship's hull is torn away in a thrilling and violent crash landing on the planet's sandy surface.<br />A handful of survivors are left on the desertlike planet, which bathed by the light of three suns, shows few signs of active life.  Among the group are Johns (Cole Hauser), a bounty hunter, and his prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).  The group explores the planet, which shows traces of past habitation, but no human life is found.  Finding an abandoned camp, the survivors encounter a hoard of strange flying creatures hiding in one of the buildings.  After the creatures kill a young boy, a further search reveals a cavern full of old human bones.<br />The survivors discover that an eclipse will soon plunge the planet into \\"pitch black\\" darkness.  The darkness will trigger the appearance of the flying aliens, who repelled by the light of the planetary system's three suns, remain hidden underground.  Thus begins a race for survival, as the group must salvage supplies, repair an existing ship, and escape from the planet.<br />The special effects are very good.  The scene where a multitude of flying creatures fill the sky is impressive, as is the scene where one of the survivors is dismembered and ripped to pieces.  The aliens themselves are unusual looking and quite fierce.  Unlike \\"Aliens\\", Pitch Black is not a straightforward shoot em up battle between the creatures and man.  Instead other subplots are explored.  The basic conflict between Riddick and Johns finally reaches a head during the desert trek.  There are issues of blame and responsibility, concerning Fry.  And also with Riddick, who balks at helping his fellow man.<br />Pitch Black is recommended to science fiction and action film audiences.  Riddick is a mysterious anti-hero, and Vin Diesel is absolutely riveting on screen.  His voice slow and errie.  A sequel based on the character Riddick, is in pre-production phase.  Radha Mitchell is outstanding as Fry, a woman attempting to rise to the situation, seeking redemption.  A talented and busy actress, who will hopefully be seen more in mainstream films.  Pitch Black's two commentary tracks with director David Twohy are interesting and informative.  Shot in Australia, the creative techniques used to simulate a desert planet with three suns is just one of the topics discussed.conflict between Riddick and Johns finally reaches a head during the desert trek.

B0000648WZ|5.0|Don't believe any negative remarks about this film.  Make no mistake about it - this is one of the best sci-fi films in recent years.  Paul Verhoeven creates his best film since Robocop, with similar excesses in gratuitous violence permeated with a unique sense of humorous satire.  The effects shots are absolutely incredible, from the wonderful ships hurtling through space to the brilliant CGI array of giant, killer insects on Bug Planet.  The reviewers who commented that the acting was terrible apparently haven't seen &quot;The Fast And The Furious&quot;.
630528069X|4.0|\\"Die Hard\\", the film that made Bruce Willis a worldwide star, holds up rather well as it approaches the fifteenth anniversary of its release.  Hot off the success of \\"Predator\\", director John McTiernan delivered a tight, action packed number that seems shorter than its 2:12 runtime.  Boasting no big stars, Die Hard's success is largely attributable a focused, well paced plot, and the talents of Bruce Willis.<br />As most are aware, the story takes place on Christmas Eve.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis) arrives in LA to meet with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who works downtown in the Nakatomi Plaza.  While the company Christmas party is in progress, a criminal band led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) takes over the building in an elaborate attempt to steal some valuables locked in the company's vault.  McClane evades capture, and proceeds to do whatever he can to thwart the criminal's plans.<br />It's guerilla warfare between McClane and the baddies.  With the barefoot cop slowly improving the odds, picking off a crook or two at a time, during the various encounters.  Gruber the group's leader, played with a mixture of class and menace by Rickman, slowly goes from being in complete control, to struggling to hold things together.  A ruthless and worthy opponent to the very end.  For the isolated McClane, radio communication is used both to establish the confrontational relationship with Gruber, and a bond with sympathetic LA beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson).  With a reduced emphasis on dialog, the film's focus turns to the action sequences.  And since the efforts of the law enforcement authorities prove ineffectual, indecisive, and plain stupid, McClane is the only hope.<br />Die Hard's finish is still OK by today's standards, but just barely, as movie finishes continue to rise to more spectacular levels.  The success of this film would result in two sequels (so far) and spawn numerous imitations attempting to replicate its appeal and box office take.  Die Hard is still enjoyable, but not quite cutting edge.e.  Die Hard is still enjoyable, but not quite cutting edge.
B000066NW0|5.0|If you like pop, rock, rap, r&b, or all of the above then you should check out Avril Lavigne's new cd \\"Let Go\\". There is something on there for everyone and if you haven't heard \\"Complicated\\" yet (which is not possible!) you will love it as much as the rest of us. And Avril writes all her own music, unlike some stars out there today. She is also #1 on Canada's Much Music Chart and has been #2 on TRL on Mtv. I bought this cd the first day it came out as I could not get the number 2 track out of my head. It has such a catchy beat and great lyrics. So if you like the song \\"Complicated\\" or if you just want to try something different, pick this cd up!!! Its a must have!!!!
0767836286|4.0|Arlington Road is a film that takes some of the elements from the Oklahoma City bombing and the Ruby Ridge incident, and cleverly weaves them into a story of domestic terrorism and paranoia.  Delivering a message, the film explores the subject of manipulation.  Manipulation of one man, the historical record, and the audience.  The final result is an example of master planning, and anticipation of action, that is incredible.  In the end, we see that isolated &quot;facts&quot; when combined do not always add up to the &quot;truth&quot;.<br />The story centers on Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), a professor of American history at George Washington University.  Two years ago, his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a botched agency operation at a farmhouse.  Disillusioned with the Government, and left alone to raise a son, Faraday struggles to move on in his life with his new girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis).  After coming to the aid of a neighbor's son, Faraday and the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), become friends.<br />Soon however, Faraday becomes suspicious that Oliver Lang, a structural engineer, is not what he appears.  Faraday begins to check into his background.  His girlfriend doesn't understand his suspicions, but he can't keep himself from probing into Lang's mysterious past.  Against his better judgment, he permits his son to go on a camping trip with Lang's boy.  Events begin to snowball, and Faraday finds his life spiraling out of control.  Desperation drives him to acts of near madness, attempting to prevent a disaster, and save the life of his son.  The results are atypical, to say the least.<br />Jeff Bridges gives a powerful performance as an obsessed man driven over the edge.  Tim Robbins, and Hope Davis are also very good, although Robbins starts to go a bit too far near the end.  Joan Cusack, was a bit harder to accept in her role.<br />This movie succeeds in being provocative.  For these events to be credible however, we would need to believe that human action can be predicted down to the nth degree, and with near perfect timing.  Even if you can't quite swallow this pill, the film should make you think about how, through the media, we perceive events.  Beware of the PC police.redible however, we would need to believe that human action can be predicted down to the nth degree, and with near perfect timing.

B000066NW0|5.0|I think that this cd is without a doubt one of the best cd's that have debuted in a long time. Here we have 17 year old new talent that can sing, perform and start trends. In her music she explains what every teen at her age goes through. Especially the girls. The girls that like to skateboard can sometimes go through heat and just think Avril could have to. In her song &quot;Complicated&quot; the lyric says, &quot;Your Somebody else round everyone else.&quot; That lyric is just explaining how you could be one person at one time and then change just because another person thats supposely cool comes around. See how easy that was to understand. Anyone can relate to it. It's just all around a great cd. If you listen to the words, it's like a poem. But a very talented one. I know that Im probably making no sense to whom ever this concerns, but if you think about it, Im right. Well this cd just rocks.
B000000OQF|5.0|It was the record that kick started the re-birth of hard rock in the late eighties. The orginial Guns N Roses line up of Axl Rose, Slash, Izzy Stradlin, Duff McKagan and Steven Adler only managed one actual full studio album before things started to fall apart and the personnell began to change. But what an album it was, and well over a decade since its release, it is still a bona fide classic.<br />Rose is not the greatest vocalist in the world, but it is clear that as a song-writer he pulls no punches. The almost-metal assualt of 'Welcome to the Jungle' and 'It's So Easy' are perfect showcases for what GnR are all about. Slash demonstrates why he was to become one of the most respected gutarists of his age while the Adler/McKagan/Stradlin combination give the lead guitarist a powerful rhythm to hang his memorable hooks on.<br />Even though they are raucous, there is a definite Stones/Aerosmith groove about GnR's music. 'Nightrain' is bluesy, 'Mr Brownstone' could almost makes you dance and 'Think About You' is a crooning rock classic.<br />When they do slow it down a little, the results are equally as memorable. 'Sweet Child O' Mine' with it's acoustic melody and seering lead licks is an all time classic, while 'Rocket Queen' successfully mixes a hybrid of styles before roaring off to a rocking conclusion.<br />'Out Ta Get Me' and 'You're Crazy' are fast and furious, 'My Michelle' and 'Anything Goes' fall into the more whimsical category of hard rock but are just as enjoyable as the rest of the album.<br />No turkeys, just twelve magical slices of rock music.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is an excellent piece of music. Iron Maiden keeps making great music.The guitars sound great and Nickos drumming is excellent. This proofs Maiden can still rock for at least 12 more years. A must have for real fans.
B0000029AL|3.0|Since this is where the Aerosmith story begins, a brief history shall be relayed. Aerosmith were formed in 1970 with original guitarist, Ray Tabano, replaced by Brad Whitford soon after. In 1972 they clinched a remarkable five year/five album recording contract with Columbia.<br />This is the first of them and there is a lot of quality on show here and is certainly a good sign of things to come from the Boston Bad Boys. The top tracks on here are probably 'Dream On', 'One Way Street' and 'Mama Kin'.<br />'Dream On' is a classic cut - a ballad with a haunting melody and message. 'Everytime I look in the mirror; all these lines on my face getting clearer; the past is gone; it went by like dusk to dawn'. A rather strange state of mind for an energetic 25 year old but Tyler continued 'dream on, dream until your dreams come true'. He clearly knows that life is short and that you got to keep aiming for the top; 'you gotta lose to know how to win'.<br />'One Way Street' is a 7-minute epic complete with foot-tapping rhythm, funky harmonica, stunning cymbals and sombre piano that demonstrates the blues connection that Aerosmith have and 'Mama Kin' simplistically hones into view, struts its funky thang and hot-tails out of there like a naughty schoolchild.<br />'Write Me' has an irrepresible guitar/drum backbone all coated nicely with an attractive vocal performance from Steven Tyler and a stropping Tom Hamilton bassline while 'Make It' and 'Somebody' are decent slices of Aerosmith-style rock n roll.<br />'Walkin' the Dog' is a cover version of the 1963 Rufus Thomas hit which apparently is about doing some yo yo trick. I wonder. 'Movin' Out' is arguably the closest to rickety that we get here - a moody rocker where Tyler bemoans getting caught up in the urban sprawl. It is raw and reasonably inventive and is the only (original) track here that Tyler co-wrote; guitarist Joe Perry penning the notes with him.<br />All in all it is a pretty solid debut from the Bostonians who clearly are heavily influenced by bands like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. It is a little thin in spots but overall the star quality appears to be there.early are heavily influenced by bands like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.

B000002NG7|4.0|Faith No More are a band that normally define the word consistency. Following the relative splendour of \\"The Real Thing\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\", there were many disappointed faces when \\"King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime\\" was deemed to have somewhat missed the mark. What a relief then to welcome the offbeat rockers back to the fold with their current release, \\"Album of the year\\". Cheeky buggers, eh?<br />Lead guitarist Jim Martin has moved to pastures new with Jon Hudson filling the rather sizeable gap. Not that it has seemed to make any difference as \\"Album of the Year\\" is probably the most inventive record they have ever released. Credit for the flexibility of Faith No More's style must go to lead singer Mike Patton who is capable of screaming out trash metal-esque lyrics with relative ease before instantly manoeuvring into a calm and reasoned lyric with no problem at all.<br />The high points on this album are very high indeed. \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is a classic power-ballad which benefits from wonderful guiitar from Hudson and an eerie keyboard track from Roddy Bottum. 'Helpless' is an acoustic triumph`which should warrant a single release and 'Last Cup of Sorrow' is a brilliant tune which perfectly encapsulates the stengths of the band from vocals, to lyrics, their use of keyboards to enhance their sound, to their expertise in composition.<br />They sure know a good tune and there are other fine examples; the melodic 'She Loves me Not', the dreamy 'Stripsearch', the guitar-ridden and surreally-titled 'Naked in Front of the Computer' and 'Paths of Glory' which sounds like it was pulled straight from \\"Angel Dust\\".<br />The weaker moments are not even all that weak; 'Home Sick Home', 'Got That Feeling' and 'Collision' pale in comparison to the aforementioned but you probably won't reach for the 'next track' button.<br />Overall it is an excellent album and shows a real return to form for Mike and the boys.  It later proved to be their final release as they called it a day circa 1997.circa 1997.
B000000WA2|5.0|Before \\"Song 2\\" shot Blur to a short-lived state of stardom in the U.S. (and eventually lowered them to obscurity in the states, after the band set themselves a precedent they had no desire to live up to), Blur was a jolly and cynical Britpop band.<br />While \\"Parklife\\" is often praised as Blur's best album, \\"The Great Escape\\" is often overlooked by critics and fans alike. Of course, any album that isn't drastically different from the band's predecessors is often considered second rate. However, \\"The Great Escape\\" expands on the greatness of \\"Parklife\\" instead of trying to imitate it. With pop masterpieces like \\"The Universal\\", \\"Country House\\", and \\"Charmless Man\\", the boys from Colchester simply exemplified why, at the time of the albums release, they were the kings of Britpop.<br />\\"The Great Escape\\" has all the happy pop overtones of \\"Parklife\\", but filters out the un-listener friendly filler tracks (see: \\"Far Out, \\"Lot 105\\", \\"The Debt Collector\\"). All of \\"TGE\\"'s tracks, from the slow and lyrical \\"Best Days\\" to the up-beat punk-esque \\"Globe Alone\\" to the sarcastic pop masterpiece \\"Top Man\\", keep the listener enthralled and leave him or her desiring more. Unfortunately, this is the last of Blur's pop escapades as the following two albums (\\"Blur\\" & \\"13) have more of an indie rock feel.
B000008H1W|5.0|Tull is always about soliciting your thoughts first to the poetry that has been set to music.  Andersons's finest  accomplishment to setting poetry to music.<br />My opinion of course.
630463949X|5.0|Even after all these years, there is still a spark between them. You can see it and even feel it when they sing with each other. When Stevie sings Silver Springs, which she wrote about their breakup, you can almost touch the electricity. The songs are fresh, many with a new twist, including John McVie on vocals for one song. Lindsey Buckingham is incredible on guitar, Christine McVie really lights up the piano, Stevie Nicks keeps the rhythm with her tamborine and Mick Fleetwood is at his best on percussion. Mick even clowns around a bit, just to keep the mood upbeat. This is one of their best. There is no down side, no slow sections. It moves from beginning to end and is a must have for any Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks or Lindsey Buckingham fan. Be prepared to watch this concert over and over again.
B000001EYO|4.0|As far as soundtracks go, this is second only to the Rushmore soundtrack.
0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood was a great read. I could hardly put the book down. The author paints a wonderful storey which allows the reader to picutre each moment of the book. I still think about the characters even though I finished this book over 6 months ago. I would compare the writing to that of Women of the Silk and Memoirs of a Geisha (both great books).
B000060P79|5.0|ok ok...it's because my daughter swears she's their #1 fan. I'm a little old to be reviewing 'punk' music, but they are WAY better than any punk I've ever heard. (I'm not that crazy about punk to begin with.) What THIS is, is the best, most creative and talented band to come around in decades. They don't make noise...they make music. And UPBEAT music at that! A day without Simple Plan is a day without sunshine. Every song on the CD is great...not a bad one on it! I've had the privilege of seeing them twice in concert...both times, they blew me away. And the way they mix with the crowd and are so nice...what a special group! Don't miss out on this CD, and tell EVERYONE you know about it. No Pads, No Helmets...just Balls == No noise, no vulgarity...just pure PLEASURE!
B000001Y5J|5.0|I cannot believe this album only comes three years after Pretty Hate Machine.  Though I love Pretty Hate Machine, it sounds very dated now being 2002. However, I put in Broken and it sounds more recent than The Fragile.  This is an excellent album! Sonically it's brilliant.  It's amazing after 10 years no one has even been able to come close to accomplish what Trent Reznor has.  Pro Tools also showed it's face around '92, and it's clearly used unlike Pretty Hate Machine.  Pretty Hate Machine is all about 80s sounds and Broken doesn't sound like any decade! Very fresh, very original, still, 10 years later. I can't say enough good things about this album.
B000065U1N|5.0|The real WAR drama so don't ever think to see any Love Scene and lots of Songs (It's not &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; bru;p) story line bit confusing 'coz surely it's impossible to put all story in the book in 2 hrs movie ... so yup, must see this one if you have a brain to think ;p
B000002J23|5.0|Trevor may not sing Jon's songs as well, but he sings these original songs better than Jon did Tormato, A lot better.  I remember hearing about this album on the Yes Years video and thought Tempus Fugit was very good, a lot of futuristic music with Chris's distorting bass sounds and Steve Howe's sharp angular guitar work. It seemed like a stark and metalic space opra of 1979 future technology.  Trevor's voice was fitting for this albumn with his high-pitched, yet not strained notes, that were nothing like Jon's.  Trevor's voice was sharp and cutting and he hit those high notes with better range than Jon did in Tormato(And that Ascension B. S.).  Chris and Trevor make a good combonation.  Tempus Fugit on the Yes Years albumn persuaded me to purchase the Drama albumn and I found that all of the songs are very good.  \\"Into the Lens\\", and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are the best, but \\"Run through the light\\" with Chris's voice showing through more than usunal and  \\"Does it Really Happen\\" were also very well done.  \\"Machine Messaih\\" was good at certain points, with Trevor's chanting and the Base work but I found you had to turn up the volumn on that one, it didn't seem to come in as clear as the other songs.<br />This is a great albumn and Trevor is a powerful singer, if he sings his own songs.  It ain't Close to the Edge, but it is very well done.  Buy this, if you haven't!

B00001U0DP|5.0|I can't believe that it took me almost three years to see this movie since it first came out. But MAN was this thing good. I cannot believe how Roberto Benigni could of come up with a wonderful piece of film. It has all the things an enjoyable movie should have. It has comedy, drama, and the saddest thing a human being can come up with...tragedy. It is definetly one of the best film ever made. BUY IT you will not regret it. It is a treasure.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Jennifer Connelly plays a charming performance as Sarah, a teenage girl lost in a world of her own.<br />She is noticed however by the King of the Goblins, Jareth , played by David Bowie, who is quite besotted with her.<br />Then her parents, who enrage her by not understanding her, leave her in charge of her baby brother, Toby, for the evening.<br />She childishly wishes that the Goblins would come to take him away , not expecting it when the next second , they actually do.<br />Appalled by what she has brought to pass, Sarah must embark on a quest to rescue her brother from Jareth and his zany  Goblins .

B00005JKJA|4.0|My main problem with the DVD is the fact that it has NO CHAPTER SELECTIONS. I don't just mean that there are no thumbnails in the menu that let you pick specific scenes visually - I mean that the whole movie is just one long track, so if you hit \\"Previous\\" you'll go all the way back to the start of the film, and if you hit \\"Next\\" you'll go all the way to the end. This actually makes it worse than a VHS tape because in order to see a prior scene without starting the entire film over, you just have to sit there holding down \\"rewind.\\" (On my DVD player anyway.) This really [stinks]. But maybe it was just some purposeful arty decision, to force people to watch it continuously and not be able to instantly refer back. <br />This film would frustrate enough people regardless. Personally I'll wait for the \\"Collector's Edition\\" with tracks and a nice weird director commentary.
B00005A1PR|5.0|It's been quite a while since songs of this calibre has been released.  Written, produced, arranged by the woman herself, India Arie's debut has certainly achieved what most artists hope to achieve a fraction of; a thoughtful, touching, gentle, spiritual and inspiring collection of songs.  Delving into themes such as love, life and humanity, her prose is mature, composed of just the right selection of words to convey each message in each song.  To complement the lyrics is her flexible, sensual and intoxicating voice, pouring from her soul and over the words of her poetry.  <BR>As the aptly titled album indicates, the musical accompaniment to Arie's arresting vocals are layers of acoustic sounds, from the notes emanating from Arie's guitar to the tinkling of a grand piano.  Together, these sounds merge to form a pure musical journey from the beginning to the end of the album.<BR>Unlike most albums, the songs in Acoustic Soul incorporates a broad range of musical elements to create a different mood as the cd player progresses from one song to the next.  Arie exhibits her playful side in the upbeat &quot;Part of My Life&quot;, &quot;Video&quot; and &quot;I See God in You&quot; but in contrast, sings poignantly with guitar, piano and cello in &quot;Ready For Love&quot;.  She then gears up and showcases her quiet yet immensely soulful vocal prowess in &quot;Back To The Middle&quot;, &quot;Strength Courage and Wisdom&quot;.  Then, she surprises again by delivering-in her soft, slightly husky voice-sensual delights in &quot;Brown Skin&quot;, &quot;Always in My Head&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Simple&quot;.  To fully analyse the extent of her versatility will take forever.  <BR>Not only born with impressive vocal ability, her writing, producing and her good ear for harmonious sound combinations has given Arie the talent to produce a gem of an album.
B00005LQ6S|5.0|Well, to all you people who say that Endgame wasn't that good, you're all wrong!!! I've seen all the Highlander movies, including the series, and I have to say, Endgame was the best. I think that's because I have the biggest crush on Adrian Paul. He was great in this movie, and he worked well with Lambert. The chemistry was good. And the scenes on Duncan and Kate were good, too(I was extremely jealous of Lisa Babrucia!!!) If you like Adrian Paul, good fight scenes and good storyline, this is the movie for you!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I have been looking for an album like this for a long time.  It is so perfect for everyone.  The songs have incredible lyrics and rockin' beats.  When you hear &quot;Complicated,&quot; you don't think that Avril is the girl singing it.  When I got the album and actually saw what Avril looked like, I was hooked.  Not only is this girl's voice amazing, but she is such the sk8er punk!  I think that we need more singers like her to be role models for the different crowd.  Some of my favorite songs on her album are Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi, Tomorrow, and Nobody's Fool.  Losing Grip is such an ex-boyfriend song.  I love it cause it's everything that I think about too.  Sk8er Boi is a great story and it's very addicting.  You have to listen to it yourself to get the whole point.  Tomorrow is more of a ballad in which Avril's voice and the lyrics of the song will just make all your problems go away.  Lastly, Nobody's Fool.  What can you say about this song??  It's like her anthem.  This girl knows exactly what she wants.  That's what makes her so great!  Listen to this album and be ready to be inspired.  Check out this girl and fall in love with the amazing new talent, Avril Lavigne!
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, I know some of you have read my reviews for AFI, Anti-Flag, and Dashboard Confessional, and you are suprised I have done a review for Avril. For some reason I love her music, it has the message I have been trying to give just out in the open. To show that descriminating, and problems with school with, stupid things like what clothes you wear could be a problem. But I like the music. I don't care if it's not punk or whatever. So I gave this CD a 5 because her voice is awesome and it's cool with me.<BR>So buy the CD if you want, but first preview the tracks to see if you really like it. So who cares if doesn't fit your needs of being a punk or acting like one.

0385720920|2.0|but it's the first one that comes to mind.<br />  Having read through most of the customer reviews of this book, I conclude that I may not be giving the author enough of a chance. It appears that those who have read more of his novels cite this as his weakest effort. This book is just so poorly constructed and devoid of originality that I am going to have a difficult time devoting any reading time to Palahniuk's other attempts. I'd also have a difficult time remembering how to spell his name if it weren't emblazoned on the Amazon page as I write.<br />  The novel recalls A Confederacy of Dunces in many respects. Both novels have unlikable protagonists with difficult, suffocating mothers. The humor in both works is on about the same sophomoric level as well. Those for whom Toole drew \\"guffaws\\" will likely find Palahniuk's lines equally refreshing.<br />  This writer tries way too hard at being clever. From its contrived, overworked opening to its \\"startling\\" denouement, the novel spins on erratically, never finding any clear direction or viewpoint. Nothing rings true. This is evident in his description of his friend's being placed in the stocks at the Historical theme-park where the narrator works. He relates that the ground in front of the stocks is riddled with animal feces and urine. In reality, why would this be the case? What kind of Jamestown are we talking about here? Certainly not the one that I have experienced. The same sort of fictional license is at work when the narrator describes his co-workers as so-many sexual deviants. In fact all the characters in the novel are sexual deviants. Again, in reality, this would hardly be the case. Of course, all this could be in the narrator's mind, but then what's the point?<br />  There is so much interesting and constructive fiction, history and biography on the market today that one would do well to avoid mucking about in this fruitless void.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|\\"Shrek\\" has been hailed as the greatest thing in animation since sliced bread, if sliced bread had ever been animated. \\"Shrek\\" has been hyped to death and won the first ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. <br />Make no mistake, this movie is great fun. Mike Myers is great fun as Shrek, the ogre with the Greta Garbo complex, whose quiet existence in his swamp is disrupted by Lord Farquaad, voiced in hissably evil style by John Lithgow, who has evicted all the local fairy-tale creatures and dumped them in Shrek's swamp. Shrek and his unwelcome new side-kick a talking donkey, voiced hysterically Eddie Murphy), reach a deal with Farquaad to fetch the short prince a bride in the form of Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, who they must rescue from a dragon's lair, complete with fire-breathing dragon.<br />All well and good, and lot's of fun is to be had by all. Parents should be warned that this film has a harder edge than Disney's typical animation, and the \\"PG\\" rating is well-deserved. <br />But there are problems with this film. First, there's the troubling Hollywood hypocrisy. This film's laudable message is not to judge other's on their appearance. Great. Swell. So what do we have? A villian with a Napoleon Complex, and a slew of short jokes. <br />Also, a great deal of the humor in this film comes from the skewering of Mouse, Inc., not that there's anything wrong with lampooning Mickey & Co. The jokes are great, the problem is that there are so many Disney gags that the film gets sidetracked at times, disrupting the pacing of the film. One get's the feeling that a lot of the praise this film has received has been because there has finally been a legitimate animated film produced by someone other than Disney.<br />Despite these flaws and cautions, \\"Shrek\\" is a whole lot of fun. Eddie Murphy steals the show as Donkey. Mike Myers gives Shreck a Scottish accent, and Cameron Diaz has fun with her role of Princess Fiona. While the Disney bashing detracts fromthe flow of the film, the jokes are hysterical and the satire is dead-on, and well deserved.<br />This DVD contains a number of nice goodies, such as the kaoroke number and some storyboards presentations of deleted scenes, and it has a fun and enjoyable soundtrack.<br />I reccomend this film despite the flaws, as the fun factor for \\"Shrek\\" is as big as an ogre.
0316666343|5.0|Teenager Susie Salmon looks down from her heaven to observe her family suffering from grief over her disappearance.  She also sees her killer trying to cover his odious deed. As the next few weeks pass, Susie continues to watch as her parents' marriage seems to disintegrate as neither can cope with not knowing whether she lived; her sister turns into an unfeeling rock to be strong; and her little brother cannot understand what happened to Susie.<br /><br />Her heaven is a playground, but the swings are perfect. Counselors help Susie and other newcomers cope and she makes new friends.  However, heaven cannot give her what she most desires.  She wants to be back with her loving family as they seek closure in different ways.<br /><br />Any reader lucky enough to peruse THE LOVELY BONES will know how fortunate they are to be in on the early stages of what appears to be a super talent.  The creative story line is deftly handled so that the audience can follow how various key players, especially the Salmon family insuring Susie, cope or not with their loss.  Alice Sebold provides a tremendous character driven tale that though melancholy yet optimist makes reading a heaven on earth.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00005JKQZ|1.0|How can I describe this picture? It would be like watching a Schwarzenneger movie with Arnold hanging off a building, shooting bad guys with machine guns, next thing you know he's being committed, with his wife mopping his forehead saying earnestly, \\"Honey, you need HELP!\\" And then you realize the guy was not hanging off of buildings, not shooting bad guys with a machine gun, he was just as nutty as hell. Then the guy recovers, but you don't. You don't recover the cash they took off you when you rented the movie, and you don't recover the self-respect you once had. No. You just emerge from the theater slightly old, slightly shaken with the vague memory of being rolled.<br />To put it mathematically, let T represent the time spent watching the movie.  Let W represent time wasted.  T = W.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I try to find movies that are unusual and sometimes complicated. This is a good reason I tend to rent movies away from the Hollywood formula, going for foreign films. With writer / director Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, I found a treat close to home. With cameos from Drew Barrymore, Noel Wyle and Patrick Swayze this movie carries you into the past, pre school shootings and unexplainable violence from today's youth. Set in 1988 (a year after I graduated high school), Donnie Darko uses the music of the times and the down-home settings to drive the point home. Quoted by Drew Barrymore (unfortunately deleted from the film), \\"Kids today are lost because the parents don't know how to reach them,\\" Or close to that. Our hero, Donnie, descends into madness when he comes full circle in the month of October to learn of the future events through his imaginary friend, a dark twisted rendition of Harvey with Jimmy Stuart, called Frank \\"the rabbit\\". Frank explains, through visuals with excellent special FX that the path we lead in this life is predetermined by a source that is expelled from your body. Confusing? Good! To appreciate the subtle use of language and visuals Donnie Darko isn't a \\"horror\\" movie, you could border it with Sci-Fi, you have to see the film! I recommend this to anyone that wants a taste of nostalgia from the late 80's without the trite clichs always seen in movies. This was a more real look into the times, as close as \\"The Virgin Suicides.\\" If you like dark, subtle plotted tales, this is your movie! I will be on the look out for more of Richard Kelly's work.
6305265488|4.0|This is probably Drew Barrymore's best movie since ET.  It is a light hearted twist on the classic fairy tale Cinderella.  The movie starts of with the life of Cinderella before the death of her father and developes all the characters in more depth.  The movie is great for kids of all ages, especially those who are older.  Its humerous and realistic at the same time.  Much better than the Disney Cartoon.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I was really surprised by this gem because I usually don't like Chris Columbus's work. After my wife read every one of the books, I was forced to purchase the DVD, not entirely against my will. I love the film and the fact that the actors are REALLY English, for the most part and not just Americans pretending to be English. I believe they've captured the magical sense of the novels. I believe the author's forcefulness was a great piece to the film. As a writer myself I often play with the idea of the \\"what if\\" my novels are picked up for a movie release. I don't know how much control I'd want on the film. I'm more prone to keep strong about the soundtrack, rather than the film, which is mostly someone else's interpretation to the book. As with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone parallel the novel very closely. Let's see what happens with the upcoming, Harry Potter, due this X-mass!
0880389052|5.0|I rarely read books twice, but a just finished this one a second time.  R.A. Salvatore has a gift for ensnaring his audience with his style.  Homeland starts the life of Drizzt Do'Urden.  Raised in the evil society of the drow elves deep in Menzoberranzan, Drizzt struggles to come to grips with his own convictions and the world that battles to warp them.  The life of the Drow is a viscous life, oddly mimicing our own at times, where deciet and ambition reign.  But not so for Drizzt.  His is a life of compassion in which he struggles to find the answer to why he exists.  <br />This book covers the birth and childhood of Drizzt.  The reader gets to walk with him as he learns the evils of drow society and the magnificent use of his weapons: the twin scumitars.  The book culminates with Drizzt decission to leave Menzoberranzan after killing his advasaries Masoh Hun'ett and Alton DeVir and the lose of his father and mentor Zaknafien.  <br />If you love action, adventure and science fiction this book is perfect for you.  Salvatore brings Ed Greenwoods fantasy world to life and you will not put this book down until you have to.
B000002J0G|4.0|Some old fans just can't get past the growls, but I think the mixture of Chuck Billy's \\"traditional\\" thrash vocals with some growls is a real winner.  Songs like \\"Low\\" and \\"Dog Faced Gods\\" are as good as any they've done.  Plus, it has some great heavy production.  The production conveys some of the heaviness you find in Nu-Metal, but this is *NOT* Nu-Metal (which I really don't like at all).<br />Testament has taken the occasional wrong turn in their evolution, but they have never resorted to \\"phoning it in\\" or compromising their metal roots.  Wish I could say the same for some other classic metal bands.<br />Good stuff.  Recommended.
B00000F2GH|5.0|I first saw this many years ago...a truly excellent and thought-provoking film.    When Billy Budd accidentally kills a sadistic officer on-board ship, the captain is forced to lay charges under wartime Naval law. In the process he unleashes larger issues about good and evil, and condemning a good man using \\"just the facts\\". If you liked the courtroom scene in The Caine Mutiny, you will find this fascinating.     March 9, 2007: Wouldn't you know it! I had this DVD pre-ordered and tracked its progress hourly by the USPS website to my front door. But when I arrived home it was nowhere to be found...someone made off with it(!) I have never had any mail stolen before...luckily a replacement is on the way (perhaps the thief will watch it, see themselves in Claggart and amend their ways....)
B000056VJ7|4.0|This is better than Bat Out Of Hell 2 and more enjoyable. Its one of my favorite albums which is sort of odd because I dont even listen to this style of music very often. Like movies, the first Bat Out Of Hell will make the second one make more sense. So if youre looking for a good way to spend 20 dollars buy this album and a bacon cheeseburger plus a large frosty at Wendy's.
0446677450|5.0|I can really relate to this book; my parents were very much like RTK's &quot;Poor Dad&quot; in every way and I wasted a 1/3 of my life believing what success was in education and a job.This book came just in time. I also listen to the tapes in my care.I also strongly recommend the other Rich Dad, Poor Dad books especially Real Estate Riches, CASH Flow Quadrant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing...Charles Schwab knew something a lot of other people didn't (read his biography)<br />The most annoying thing about the book, for me, was the storytelling in the first two chapters.  The same theme is repeated about 6 times, when once would have been enough for someone who is reasonably intelligent and doesn't have lots of time to spare.  Eventually I started to skim.  I'm sure Kiyosaki's second book could have been condensed into these two chapters instead, but his publisher saw an opportunity for extra profit.<br />All of that having been said, everyone who's serious about making some money needs to start somewhere, and this is where I began.  The book reviews the basics, points you toward more tools for learning (not all good - read the reviews on &quot;Inc and Grow Rich&quot;), and for me, started me thinking about real estate investing.  But again, if you're serious, you'll need a lot more ammunition before you're ready to begin pulling the trigger.  Happy hunting.
B000002OMN|3.0|I dont think Meat Loaf's voice is all that good but I do think that Steinman's lyrics for this album are very well done and Meat does a good job of delivering the vocals. Life Is A Lemon is a dark song that only a dark,brooding person like me can relate to,Rock and Roll Dreams Come true is a cheesy yet entertaining song,I Would Do Anything For Love kind of reminds me of Pearl Jam's Better Man because they both make you wonder if the love their singing about is real or artificial,It Just Wont Quit is one of my favorite songs and it makes me thinkabout the unrequited love I have for this one lady at work...,Out Of The Frying Pan is a fun song but I cant really relate to it,Objects In The Mirror is an amazing story put into music,Wasted Youth is a song that I can really relate to from my parents saying&quot;Are you going to waste your whole life listening to music all the time&quot;,Everything Louder Than Everything else is a good rock song,Good girls go to heaven has a lot of truth in it,Bat Out Of Hell is just a filler track so I dont know what to say about it other than I dont care about it,Lost Boys And Golden Girls is the perfect ending song. This is a great album while its on but the songs seem to get stuck in your head all day which isnt always a good thing. Decent album by a decent artist.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Let's face it - Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings are two completely different stories, so why is everyone always trying to compare them and choose between the two? Personally, I love BOTH series! I also love Star Wars and Spider-Man, so enough with the comparing and choosing, already! Seeing the trailer for both Harry Potter's next sequel, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\", and The Lord of the Rings's next sequel, \\"The Two Towers\\", I'd say both films will be excellent! I can't wait for both films to be out, since I saw the last two films for each series and loved them, as well as the books of course. Though I really cannot write a review until I've actually SEEN \\"The Two Towers\\", I can easily tell you that if you liked \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" then you should definitely catch this one in theaters. And basically I'm just writing this to speak up about fans of The Lord of the Rings hating Harry Potter and the fans of Harry Potter hating The Lord of the Rings. You are not a \\"true fan\\" of one of the series if you hate the other. So go see \\"The Two Towers\\" December 18th, and while you're waiting for that, you should definitely check out \\"Chamber of Secrets\\", opening November 15th.
0140277447|4.0|If there is one thing that history teaches us, it is that people like to ignore the distasteful truth, or if they can't do that, to bury or to distort it.  As astounding as it may be, there are history deniers or revisionists who insist that the genocide that occurred in Europe in the early 1940s or in Nanking in 1937 simply did not happen or at most, only a few isolated instances of eminently justified killing took place.  Iris Chang in THE RAPE OF NANKING effectively refutes the arguments of the revisionists who claim that the Rape either (a) did not happen or (b) were grossly exaggerated.  In court, direct testimony from eye-witnesses is usually good enough to convince a fair-minded jury that some crime has occurrerd.  When that eye-witness testimony is linked to authentic documents, the results are usually taken as valid.  Iris Chang explains a story not unlike a similar tale that could be told of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.  In both Germany and Japan, these countries' respective leaders blamed a world of hurt and national pain on an outside group.  The Jews and the Chinese were handy punching bags for a large and well-equipped army that had for years been taught hate as a means to redirect the brutality that also had been dumped on them by sadistic leaders.  No one knows the full extent of the genocide in Nanking, but estimates of 100,000 dead and tortured are accepted as reasonable.  It is difficult to read Chang's book and then listen complacently to a Japanese premier who defends his country's right not to include mention of the Rape of Nanking in his nation's history books.  The result of deliberately turning a blind eye and deaf ear to your own country's mass killing of others is simply to invite a repeat.  It is not enough to call Chang a liar. If one wishes to refute her book, then do so in the realm of the scholarly journal or reasoned text, and not on the Tokyo 6 PM nightly news, crying once again how the Chinese are trying to stir up old feelings of animosity.
0312265859|2.0|I eagerly waited for the eighth installment of my favorite character, Stephanie Plum, but wished I'd passed on this one. How many cars need to blow up before Stephanie realizes she stinks at her job and should look into something else? Like at least trying to get better at it. While the mystery was intriguing, where was the personal story that most of us love to read about? It's time for Stephanie to grow, get out of the burg and live a little with a real romance with Ranger. Does Ranger strike you as the kind of guy who would show up to collect on his debt after a regular day at the office when Stephanie looks like a bum? Ho hum over in two paragraphs and that's the end of that. What a dissappointment. I thought he was more intriguing than that. He would kill someone to save her but wants no emotional committment and tells her to repair her relationship with Morelli? I didn't buy it. There needed to be more conflict for her. He made the decision too easy to go back to Morelli. I read the book but now wished I'd waited until it came out in paperback. And Steph lay off the doughnuts and get dressed up once in a while. You looked like a bum the entire book! Why would either one of them want to be involved with you?
0345451325|3.0|Eric Nylund's \\"The Fall of Reach\\" was well-written novel with great characters. Although the plot was good, i think this novel failed to address the emotional side of the Spartans and other key characters. This could be due to the fact that the Spartans aren't capable of having too much emotion. Some of the terminology used was also a little confusing (partly due to the fact that it was my first true sci-fic novel.)Yet overall i enjoyed the change.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I like this CD, but I don't know, it just gets kinda boring sometimes.  I'll listen to it once in a while, but it's not something I'm always willing to come back to.  Brandon's a good singer, and the musicians are good, but I don't know, some of the songs aren't so great.  I don't really like the turntable noise either. Best songs are &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase&quot;, but not every song is as good as those.  I don't think I'll buy anymore CD's from this band.  Get the new Papa Roach, it's kinda like this, only better, and there's no turntables.
0446677450|4.0|I wouldn't give Kiyosaki 5 stars for his writing skills...he's extremely repetitive and is not a strong writer.  He beats the same concept into your head to a point where you can pretty much skip some paragraphs.  He may make claims that aren't *totally* true, but what counted for me was that his book definitely motivated me, and also gave me good tips on how to be smarter with my money.  It actually changed my path in life to some extent, I came up with several business ideas and plan to pursue them.  I would say that for the [amount]I paid for this book, plus the 3 hours it took to read it, it was worth the investment.
B00005QDW1|1.0|ive been a huge fan of no doubt since there self titled no doubt came out back in like 93 and although i didnt much care for return of saturn i thought it was a ok transistion from tragic kingdom but rock steady is a falure to anything that no doubt has ever try to market i dunno the whole album (i use the word album lightly)sounded like britney spears on acid the whole &quot;ska&quot; concept was thrown out the window for this one it sorta sounded like devo w/ a girl gwens naturally raspy yet clear original voice is no more for this lp yet i am happy that gwen finally relised she was in a band if they keep there motivation but go back to how tragic kingdom sounds no doubt would be better then ever but i doubt that unless gavin breaks up w/ gwen  and another thing to all you mtv ppl saying stop &quot;hating on&quot; no doubt u really need to invest in a dictonary and pay better attention in lit. class and to think your sappost to be our future a little advise to everyone i think we should all just conform and dye of hair blond and wear nsync t shirts
B000065V1V|3.0|Even as Bowie's uncanny connection to the zeitgeist started to falter and turn into designer mimicry, there were cuts on his patchiest albums that made you smile in guilty pleasure: Criminal World on Let's Dance,  Loving the Alien on Tonight, I Can't Read on Tin Machine, the title track to Black Tie White Noise, Seven Years in Tibet off Earthling...OK, nothing on Never Let Me Down or Tin Machine 2 or Outside, but you get the idea.  These moments tended to be minor key gems that momentarily transcended the artifice for some old fashioned pathos and romance.  This album is like a collection of lots of those moments.  Nothing quite rises to challenge anything pre-1980 despite the enlistment of Tony Visconti, yet most of the tracks exhibit what we haven't hear from the Dame in a long while: passion,  baroque and desolation.  And a  welcome resistance to aping the latest musical trend.  If we dispense with the covers of songs by Neil Young (servicable), the Pixies (why mess with perfection?) and The Legendary Stardust Cowboy (now, really, why at all?), we're left with a batch of  searing hymns, sung like Bowie has not sung in years/decades.  Sunday takes his infatuation with Scott Walker and blends it with a queasy choir-preset on his synthesizer and voila, you have near classic in the mold of Drive-In Saturday or Time.  Really.  The best track on the album -- Slip Away -- starts as a distant  forlorn croon and builds into a magnificent interstellar Big Ballad.  Everyone Says Hi and  Slow Burn show that he still has the chops -- pure pop on the one hand, and molten rock on the other (even if the echoes of &quot;Heroes&quot; reverberate a bit too loud), and 5:15 The Angels Have Gone is classic Bowie-the-zeitgest: nervous, spare, traveling, dreading.  The rest is less compelling, but there are no outright duds and plenty to listen for in the dense production, and his voice is a marvel throughout.
0671004611|4.0|I have long believed that something happened in Roswell, NM on the night of July 4, 1947 that was much different from the official story of a weather balloon crash released by the army.  In this book, Col. Corso describes how alien technology recovered from Roswell was integrated into the development of new, advanced products in America, such as lasers, circuits, and much more.  He focuses only briefly on the actual crash of the alien ship and the EBEs (extraterristral biological entities) which were found at the site, as he was not present for this and did not become inimately involved in Roswell until 14 years later.  His detailed story of the many people who were aware of the Roswell incident yet participated in the massive coverup is incredible.  Although his version of events is difficult to believe, Col. Corso is convincing enough that you are forced to conclude he is either telling the truth, is a magnificent liar, or is downright crazy.  Whichever conclusion you come to for yourself, this is a fascinating and engaging story.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is a cd jam packed with inspiring, jaw dropping & love it when you hear it music by the incredible individual, none other than Avril Lavigne. With her original character & stunning voice Avril's music just draws people in. When I hear the music, everything drops & I'm in a feeling of solitary confinement. It makes me smile with content & gentleness but at the same time giving me the feeling of just wanting to crank up the music so it will be implanted in my head till the day I die. When I listen & really think why I like this particular cd more than any of my other one's & why I don't get bored listening to it over & over & it's because Avril wrote about what was on her mind & things that were in her heart. I feel closer to her music knowing that. I can relate better to this music than any other. Being a teenager it can be hard but then you hear this talented, pretty, amazing SuPeRsTaR singing about the same stuff you go through everyday & Avril is just so unique compared to all the other singers so that just makes me want to crank up the music even more. The ironic thing is, is that the reason Avril is so different is basically because she didn't change herself since when she was just a small town kid. <br />Catherine
0375413405|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Julia Child for her wit and humor. Her shows are still so entertaining to watch. But don't be fooled by her fun demeanor. She is a serious student and teacher of French cooking. I respect her and trust this book for recipes that are authentic and work flawlessly. I recently made crepes for the first time and tried her recipe for the batter. I was delighted to find them delicious with just the right flavor and consistency. That was no surprise to me at all. This book is great because gives the reader the knowledge to master the fundamental sauces and building blocks of classic French cuisine. Kudos to Julia Child for her anniversary edition of this cook's essential! If you're serious about cooking like I am, please do yourself a favor by rewarding yourself with this wonderful cooking tutorial.
0553103547|5.0|I have never read Fantasy Genre before, I read mostly Mystery,<br />and Thrillers, but I'll explain how I happened to buy and read<br />this fabulous epic fantasy book A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I play CCG's (card games) and saw an advertisement for Fantasy<br />Flight Games new CCG called A GAME OF THRONES based on George<br />R.R. Martin's Series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". So being how I<br />am, I decided to buy and read the book so I could better understand<br />the characters persona, and events, before I started playing the game. (Which is due out in August 2002)<br />So, having said all that, I wont reiterate what the book is about so<br />much, you can see the Editorial Review at the top, but make some<br />personal comments.<br />The book is broken down into approx 10 page chapters, titled the<br />characters name, and written from that characters perspecitive.<br />It really made an impact on me with that style, I really felt<br />I was there with the characters, and found myself laughing out<br />loud, at other times feeling angry, and sad. I can see the plot<br />unfold in a way that no other character sees yet. We the readers<br />are the \\"all seeing big eye in the sky\\", but Mr. Martin doesnt<br />let it all be exposed too soon, as we the reader still get the<br />enjoyment of getting there.<br />Now, just some personal helpful hints to other readers.<br />*) The Appendix in the back of the book of the \\"Houses\\" is very helpful.<br />I found myself referencing it alot.<br />*) Being it's a 800+ page book, you are at a big advantage if you can<br />read 100+ pages in a day, and read it every day. Probably at a disadvantage if you cant,<br />because you so many characters, and so<br />much going on.<br />I've recently purchased Book 2 - A Clash of Kings, and soon to buy Book 3.<br />I'm sure I didnt follow the rules of being a \\"good\\" reviewer,<br />but REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK and wanted to let others know.
B00006879E|5.0|Phenomenal album!  Every song rocks!  Octone Records has done a spectacular job with this band and it should be a great success.
6304806442|5.0|For all the non edinburgers, this film must seem slightly esoteric. There is so many things in it which belong to the East of Scotland and the related culture (even some Glaswegians i know fail to recognise many of its quirks). This film crosses those barriers however because it is so well made, such good characters and so HILARIOUS!. <BR>I hope this dispells any rumours by Americans, that we run around chasing sheep, and looking like Mel Gibson!! (ps we invented your loved possesion- the television!)
B00005QIPH|1.0|Great PR. That's it. Buy one single and you will have heard everything the Strokes have ever done. <br />If you want to hear someone play the same song dozens of different ways, you're better off checking out the garbage the Stones put out in the eighties.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD rocks! Its perfect for cruisin down the streets during the summer. Its the ultimate jam. But it. Love it.
B000068R1X|5.0|This is the third edition of his third non-Sab studio album, but the first without Randy Rhoads, replaced by Badlands' Jake E. Lee.  The first was released 1983 on CBS Associated, then in 1995 on Epic with &quot;Spiders in the Night&quot;, now this one has new artwork and &quot;One Up the B-Side&quot;.  I have the original CD, and the bonus tracks on a bootleg tape.  Sharon must have had these reissues out to tie in with the show.  If you ask me, Kelly's Madonna cover mirrors former next-door neighbour Pat Boone's daughter Debby with &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;.
B000065U1N|5.0|When I first saw this movie it almost brought me to tears.  It is the most realisitic war movie I have ever seen in my life.  A lot of people say that it lacked a storyline, but for a movie that's based on real life events, the lack of a storyline reminds the viewer that all this really happened.
B000066NW0|5.0|Finally a girl takes the scene as herself. Not some carbon copy clone of Britney Spears. Avril does what she wants. She's a punk, skater, plays the guitar, and writes her own music. It can't get any more real than that.<br />The CD? The absolute best. I haven't heard better from a girl since Michelle Branch's &quot;The Spirit Room&quot;. Her songs speak the truth, how you feel around somebody, about yourself, life. There is not one track that you need to skip on this whole album. From &quot;Losing Grip&quot; to &quot;Naked&quot; every song is perfect in it's own way.<br />A must have CD for ANY punk/rock fan.
0380789035|5.0|This is most certainly Neil Gaiman's best work yet, transcending the fantasy/SF categorization.<br />Shadow has spent the last three years in prison and is on the verge of parole when he learns that his wife has died in a car accident.  A mystery man named Wednesday follows Shadow from airplane to restaurant, offering a job he can't refuse.<br />When Shadow accepts, he finds himself pulled into a war for survival between ancient and modern gods.<br />A lesser writer easily could have gotten bogged down by arcane mythology or overdone battle scenes; Gaiman doesn't.  He keeps the story moving--it's amusing and horrifying by turns.  Characterizations of the gods as modern beings are wonderful; I particularly enjoyed Anansi as the ribald Mr. Nancy.  Guessing which god is which is just part of the enjoyment in this book.  Highly recommended!
B00006690G|5.0|This album is the best yet from Eminem. The album is just as hilarious as the marshall mather LP and is still a very good representation of Eminems skills as a true rapper. And people that say Eminem is just a fad look at his last albums sales and then go look at the charts for The Eminem Show and you will se that he is going to be around for a long long time probably until rap falls out of the mainstream music scene which will not be happening anytime soon. Eminem is 100% right about Moby and people that say Moby has more achievemets go look at the charts there is no comparision. NOBODY LISTENS TO TECHNO!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I admit I'm not a big fan of groups like KoRn or Limp Bizkit but I originally got this just by chance because I couldn't find any other disc at the time that peaked my attention, but it was mainly for 'Crawling' and 'In the End' which I found breath taking in its own type of music.<br />Here's what I think about the tracks on the album:<br />01   Papercut - I love this song and it feels like a real good beat song and I love the words and well the entire song<br />02   One Step Closer - not my favorite on the track but it's alright<br />03   With You - ooh I love this track! It'd be perfect for some film that has an person that didn't know who they were :Jason Bourne: lol<br />04   Points of Authority - This song I love, the rapping and the vocal techniques that were used in the film... very nice!<br />05   Crawling - the first song that caught my attention... good<br />06   Runaway - not my favorite ... probably cause I don't listen to it that much ;-)<br />07   By Myself - I love this song - for its lyrics, music and vocals... excellent<br />08   In The End - I found that the vocal sounds kinda different than it does on the radio or video with computer enchanced vocals.<br />09   A Place for My Head - another angry song but I love it!<br />10   Forgotten - haven't listened to the song that much so I won't pass judgement to this track<br />11   Cure for the Itch - I love this song and it doesn't have hardly any words except in the beginning when the song is introduced. I love the beat and that Oriental sample near the end ... I always listen to this track the most<br />12   Pushing Me Away - another favorite that I love...<br />All the lyrics have something to say that is ... I dunno ... important or has a way of touching, that's good song writing. Instead of all the Britney stuff about love and boys (something tells me that Linkin Park might be writing about women if that was the case ;-) but their lyrics are more advanced than the usual main stream. I always lovesingers and bands that stray away from the main stream theme of songs, even though some of them are about love... they don't say the same thing and that's what is important.
B00005QIPH|2.0|i consider myself open minded and patient when it comes to new music.  these guys have a great, catchy pop single in &quot;Last Night&quot;, but that's it for this album.  the rest of it is awfully boring and forgetable.  i hope they make another go of it and come up with some better stuff.
B000065U1N|1.0|quite frankly, this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life.  i'm not a big fan of war-movies, but i don't usually mind them that much either.  in this case, the film was horrendous.  the re-telling of a war story is understandable, but the lengths that this movie went in trying to do that were too far.<br />if this was supposed to be some kind of tribute to the soldiers who died, it wasn't much of one.  i'd rank this movie as another \\"shoot-'em kill-'em\\" flick that hollywood seems to love producing.  really, it got pretty old after the 300th person got shot, beaten to death, or blown up.  the amount of blood, gore, severed body parts and operations using bare hands was completely disgusting.<br />sure, the actors and directing were fine, but the amount of violence wasn't.  i'm all for portraying reality, but i think this went to unnecessary extremes.  why would anyone want to see this movie? do they like seeing people die? or just war itself? i've yet to figure it out.
B000002KHH|5.0|One of the best heavy metal albums of all time. Ozzy and the guys really did it with paranoid its full of great riffs and dark lyrics. I think that this album is the blue print for all the metal bands that have come out over the years. To who ever doesn't have this cd get it you won't be dissapointed. Great songs from the title track to Iron man, Electric funural, and Hand of Doom this album rocks. This review came from a dominican metal fan.
0671646788|5.0|As with many books that I am writing reviews for, I first read this book more than 6 years ago, and have reread it many times thereafter.<br />And I am so happy to see, from the notes in my margins where I have learned to read people. This has given me a level of power that before reading this book was not even imaginable.<br />Thanks to reading this book, I have learned to be fully in the present moment, in 99% of my interactions with others.<br />And while fully in this moment, during excitement, I can seem to be too calm, but I am really mastering listening to the point that I am absorbing details, while I separate who my interlocutor is, from who I am, so that I make decisions, during our interactions that represent my highest self.  I savor each moment, as I listen to my subconscious voice.<br />Dr. David Schwartz, advises the readers to be a scientist in the lab of human behavior.  I am definitely that.<br />From this latest reread, I have created a new habit that has made me feel really great - and my customers feel really great.  That habit is to answer the phone with, \\"Good morning.  It's a awesome day.  May I sell you some publicity/coaching lessons/seminars (whichever is appropriate)?\\"<br />Another habit which I acquired during the first read of this book is to write a commercial, to sell myself to myself.<br />My commercial is a one-page sales pitch, that repeats the product/service, which is \\"Carmen.\\"  It describes many things about me.  And it reminds me to focus upon being big enough for what I want.<br />This book contains, literally hundreds of suggestions for  readers to improve their ability to get the best out of life.<br />Read this book, because you deserve the best of yourself.  And as you read this book, practice listening to your subconscious self, while you jot down a few notes in the margins.<br />This will condition you to listen to others, while you count upon yourself.
0312265859|5.0|I love this series and it seems to just keep getting better.  Like all the books in this series, it is filled with humor and controlled grit.  Stephanie's attempt at exercise in the park and subsequent altercation with a flock of geese is a classic hoot. Any book that makes me laugh out loud gets my 5 stars. Keep them coming Janet Evanovich!
B000065U1N|4.0|I've read some of the reviews by people who think this movie is meaningless.  I'm not sure what they expected.  Maybe an underlying love plot???  This is a very accurate film about actual events, not some Hollywood drama dreamed up by someone in their Beverley Hills Mansion.  If it seems bloody, violent, repedetive, well... that's because that's how combat is.  No this film is not for the faint of heart and I have to agree with the writer that said that the book was better.  But the book always is.  In this case, the book is able to provide a little more history as well as providing depth.  Read the book and you will also better understand the soldiers involved.  All in all, a very outstanding job at showing a mission that went horribly awry and the men who used their training and sheer guts to overcome the situation.
0671027344|5.0|I was told to read this book by a few friends. And I'm not one to read books. But I was given this book for graduation and finished it in less than a week. This could quite possibly be the best book I've never read. The way the author shows you Charlie's life just makes you miserable and wonderful at the same time. I wanted so badly for my life to make sense like his. To have friends like him. To have everything be so simple like him.<br />\\"Charlie, you're a freak.\\" \\"I know, but I'm trying.\\"<br />I only wish I could be that strong.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down is one of the most creative and original bands currently on the music scene.  They combine nearly death metal like songs, to slow-moving ballads.  Serj Tankian, who is probably the best rock singer I've ever heard, with his beautiful voice ringing out, sends chills down my back.  Another great thing about his voice is that it is obvious that the band doesn't use pitch correction.  Do you ever hear that computer like sound in many singers these days(a la Scott Stapp of Creed)?  Serj Tankian's voice is not computerized and that is his real voice.  Daron Malakian's voice is completely opposite of Serj's, not as intense and more high-pitched, but on the numerous times the band uses harmony, they're voices interlock. Add great bass playing, and probably the best drummer out there.  Here's a breakdown of the songs:<BR>Prison Song- This song is pretty bizarre, with Serj doing what I think is his version of rapping near the end.  Good message about the way the American prison system is screwed up. <BR>Needles- Verrrry bizarre. With a chorus of: Pull the tapeworm out of your a** hey!!  Still a great song with a singing solo by Daron Malakian.  It almost sounds like a mockery of traditional Russian music.<BR>Deer Dance- Very heavy chorus, song about riots and police...Tankian shows his great range in this crazy song.<BR>Jet Pilot-Probably the only \\"bad\\" song on the CD.  The chorus of: \\"Wired were the eyes of a horse on a Jet Pilot\\" first of all doesn't make any sense, but it repeats way too much.  The song just about redeems itself with good verses and a neat riff by Malakian.<BR>X- Very bizzare, but the melody guitar is really good, and Tankian again shows his range.  Good song.<BR>Chop Suey- The first single, this song combines stops, starts, and beautiful harmony.  The second singing chorus brought chills down my back when Tankian comes in out of nowhere.  The last chorus is also amazing, with Malakian singing incredible high.  Fantastic song.<br />Bounce-Just really really weird, with a pogo stick used as a metaphor for a certain body part.  Pretty fun, very short song.<BR>Forest- Probably the best song on the CD.  Great singing part, and the chorus is indescribable.  FOr the first time, when they sing in harmony, Tankian gets the high notes, and Malakian goes low.<BR>ATWA- I love the beginning of the song, and I was expecting it to be a break from the heavy and they would go with a ballad.  But I was disappointed, when the distortion came in and Tankian goes and yells a pointless chorus.  I still really like the song, but it was half ruined by the chorus.<BR>Science- A little repetitive but the middle eastern flourish is really great, and the constantly changing guitar is great for the choruses.<BR>Shimmy-Shows diversity in songwriting.  Very good song, highlighted by drummer John Dolmayan going into a jazz beat halfway through the song.  This made me crack up...its great.<BR>Toxicity-Great song, not as powerful as chop suey, but still very good. <BR>Psycho- weird, but very good verses, and the guitar solo is great at the end.<BR>Aerials- 3rd single, really good song, and near the end, Tankian and Malakian sound like they are doing a hebrew prayer, its really awesome.  The hidden track is also a very very good cultural flourish.  <BR>All in all, a fantastic CD, and I can't wait for the next one.
B00005RHGK|4.0|The movie starts off great, but in my opinion goes downhill<BR>after the first 40 minutes. As for the bodies looking fake and all that.. they're supposed to be preserved!, they're not gonna look too alive and recent if the bodies have been dried out and preserved for 20~ years (a couple were 20 years old, who knows the age of the others!). When Trish ran out of the police station after her brother at the end, the doors at the bottom of some stairs in a back room were locked, and they say that they'll have to use the front door to get out, and Trish did use the front door, so that wasnt a mishap. There were many , MANY parts they could have gone for classic cliche's but they didnt. Even though some parts they did. The only thing I dont like, is the quality that goes downhill, and the monster part, if they made him a man and ended it differently, it would have been great!
B0000636UN|4.0|When she was first breaking into the mainstream with her 1st CD, I got the chance to see Sheryl perform here on Maui twice in one year in a very intimate setting. I knew then that she was on her way to a superstar ascension.  Her stage presence, voice and musicianship were down to earth, real and unpretentious.  <BR>With C'mon, C'mon, Sheryl delivers more of what her fans have come to expect.  Great melodies abound on this CD. The very first listen to &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; made me feel like I've heard the song all my life.  Instant familiarity- which some artists cannot pull off.  Yet Sheryl does with ease! &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is a &quot;feel good&quot; hit with a great hook reminiscent of &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;.  &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is a more haunting version than the live turn she did on &quot;Tribute To Heroes.&quot; In my opinion, it's one of the best songs on the CD.  &quot;Weather Channel&quot; is a hidden gem.  Great guest vocalists and musicians, beautiful photos of Sheryl in the liner notes, not a weak track on the CD. This one's near perfect.  Do yourself a favor and pick up one of the best rock releases of 2002.
B000002J03|5.0|Excuse me, Led Zeppelin has been disbanded since 1980, so I don't think they will be recording any new albums as a follow up to this one, especially since they recorded 6 more after this..... Also your taste in music says it all....<br />Face it people, this is the original riff rock album, everything else that follows in the path of this trailblazing LP.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|I think so!  A Beautiful Mind is \\"Movie Of The Week\\" material that at times seems to parody mental illness.  It misses it's mark from start to finish. Russell Crowe's job wasn't Oscar worthy in my opinion. And this is quite possibly one of Ed Harris' worst on screen performances. He's such a great actor. How did he get talked into this role?  Since I wasted my $...at the theater, I don't intend on wasting double that to own this disappointment. A big blemish on Ron Howard's otherwise notable directing career.  Use the $$ for a pizza and a movie rental from your local video store.
B000066NW0|5.0|The first time I put Avril Lavigne's debut album into my CD player, I can remember thinking, I hope &quot;Complicated&quot; isn't the only good song on this album. This thought was so far from being true. I was amazed at the variety of different music genres Avril has encoporated into her album. From ballads like &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;,  and &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; with powerful lyrics like &quot;is it enough to love/is it enough to breath/somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed&quot;. To songs like &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, and &quot;Unwanted&quot; which reveal that edgy &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; sound. Whatever your music prefernce may be, I'm sure you can make an acception and go pick it up. Avril Lavigne~Let Go<BR>ROCK ON AVRIL!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's CD \\"Let Go\\", has touched my life like nothing else ever has.  It takes a lot for a CD to have every single song on there at least good.  The songs on there are not only good, they are incredible, her own written lyrics mixed with her punky/sensitive spirit and guitar playing makes the CD what it is.  \\"Losing Grip\\" is the song that reminds me of me and my friends and how they never listen or appreciate what I do.  \\"Tomorrow\\" helps me through those days when you feel like the whole world is falling down.  It makes me realize that tomorrow is a brand new day and a fresh start to life.  \\"Too much to ask\\" is like a story written on me and my ex.  He chose weed over me, he is lame, and he doesn't listen to anyone else except himself.  After hearing her song, she made me realize that he just needs to be forgotten about.  and \\"Complicated\\" is the song that opens my eyes up to the real world and tells me that people aren't always what they appear to be.  The rest of the songs have heart warming lyrics and a dose of what Avril Lavignes personality is about.  Not to mention every song has an amazing beat!  Thanks to Avril, me and my friends and family have become closer.  Thank You.  She is the greatest artist alive!
B000066NW0|5.0|I LOVE THE CD. ITS THE BEST IVE EVER HEARD SHE ROCKS . IF YOU HAVENT HEARD IT YOU WILL LOVE IT WHEN YOU DO.

B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie so AMAZING that not only did I go for a second spin, but also a third and a fourth! If I had any super powers, it would be to make everyone go see it!! I admit, that the only reason why I saw it in the first place was because I am such a HUGE fan of Tobey's. But I came out of the theater amazed. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! ...I swear to god it was worth every penny!!!!
0887307280|4.0|After acquainting myself with the liberal employment of conversational formatting and forcing myself through sections that almost completely overwhelmed me with the &quot;touchy feelies,&quot; I've completed this book with a sense it represents a terrific vehicle for delivering clarity and value for many small business owners.<br />I enjoyed the easy-to-grasp discussions around three hypothetical personality types required in a successful business: the &quot;manager,&quot; the &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; and the &quot;technician.&quot;  While simplistic, these are certainly easier to remember than Myers/Briggs and other like profiling systems.<br />I value the fact I was able to describe these profiles to those who had never read the book and it triggered an energetic discussion on corporate balance and team orchestration.  Anyone who has tried in vain to verbally impress upon their co-workers the value and learned facts of a Myers/Briggs profiling will appreciate this.  Am I an INTJ, ESFP, or an INTP?  I can't remember.<br />Enlightening actionable is the author's recommendation one begins with an org chart of their company at some point in the visualized future and works to formalize and document each job's responsibilities.  Additionally, discussions about the &quot;franchise prototype&quot; resonates to many who would be most benefited by this book.  In short, showing parallels between small, disorganized companies and large successful franchises such as McDonalds is compelling.<br />One final comment: Gerber assumes that many in small business hate it and want to do something else with their lives, such as flying kites or something.  He believes that unless you sell your company for a profit you've wasted your time.<br />I disagree.  He ignores the fact some start businesses as a lifestyle, and enjoy it at its current state, not seeking to create the next McDonalds and become millionaires.  I suspect his position reflects the fact he pays his bills by consulting small businesses, and his statements coercively impress upon the reader his position is the most correct one.lting small businesses, and his statements coercively impress upon the reader his position is the most correct one.
B000065U1N|5.0|I was afraid Bruckheimer might screw up the story of our heroic soldiers efforts like he did with Pearl Harbor and this whole movie would be nothing more than Hollywood pandering, but I was thankfully wrong.  It is my sincere hope that this movie will serve to remind my generation that the military is not a means to a political end, but real people that serve their country out of respect and honor for it, and that they should be allowed to do their jobs as best they can.  The fact that our troops were pulled from Somalia after this embarrasment instead of being allowed to stay and remove Aidid (who's own people welcomed our troops and the aid they brought to the people of Somalia, and then turned against us after United Nations meddling caused havoc in the region) only promotes the agenda of tinhorn dictators around the world.  This film should serve as a testament to the lives that were lost in Somalia, and are continuing to be lost in service of their country around the world in our present war on terrorism.
B00005Y228|5.0|No lie, this morning I heard \\"Love at First Sight\\" on TRL, LOVED that song with the first listen, came to amazon.com, listened to the audio clips of the rest of the CD, and went out and bought it!  I honestly love every song on this album, even though I was never really into dance/club songs.  FEVER is mostly upbeat music, which can make you feel better about something, or just enhance your good mood. Its going to be in my cd player for a long time!<BR>I really hope Kylie gets some recognition in the US.  All the singles so far I think have lots of radio potential, \\"Cant Get you Outta My HeaD\\", \\"In your eyes\\", and \\"love at first sight\\". Also \\"more more more\\", \\"fever\\", and \\"love affair\\" are all great... but for real, the whole thing is just great club music that I think lots of people will like to listen and dance to.

B000066NW0|5.0|I have never bought a C.D. where I can listen to every single song and absoloutely love each one! Avril Lavigne's first C.D, &quot;Let's Go&quot;  featuring 13 tracks, has been the best  money I have spent in the last year, no joke. There is a song for every mood! With some of her lyrics being funny and goofy, they will make you smile and belt them out in the shower! While others are on a more serious note... they will have your complete attention and you can feel her emotions though the way she sings them. I have played this C.D. more than 100 times in my computer, portable personal player and in my CD player in my room, I don't think I will ever get sick of it! Avril's sound is very unique and no other artist right now has this kind of sound. It's not pop, not hardcore punk or folk... maybe a mixture between all 3 making it it's very own category. <BR>I suggest you RUN out and pick it up before there aren't any left!
0875428940|5.0|I knew I had to have this deck when I saw it... the colors are gorgeous, the drawings are beautiful!  This deck has a voice of its own and speaks as soon as it is released from its packaging.  A great deck for anyone, it opens the eyes and the mind.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Ok, I don't expect many people to rate this review as \\"helpful\\".  All I want to say is this thing put me to sleep pretty fast, and the dialogue is so muffled, I had to crank the volume all the way up and still couldn't make it all out.<br />As for the movie itself, it reminded me of a boring British television drama.  It was unappealing from the start, and never got my attention afterwards.  This seemed to be a movie for your stodgy Aunt Millie.  As for why it got Oscar nominations:  Two words:  Altman and BORING.<br />You may want to keep this in mind when considering my opinion:  I didn't pick this movie up--a friend brought it over, as it is not something I would bother with on my own to begin with.  I generally don't care for high-brow period pieces (i.e., Dangerous Liasons).
B00005YUNY|1.0|Steve can't even do Steve anymore!!!!  His \\"Mood for a Day\\" and the \\"Concerto in D\\"  solo are horrible.  THEY DON'T EVEN COMPARE TO THE ORIGINALS.  He has a hard time hitting all of the notes in MOOD and has a hard time with the tempo.  <br />OK...enough bashing.  But come on...put another song on the DVD and not this.  The rest of the DVD is OK...incredibly boring though.  The sound is excellent and the choice of material is fine except for the Steve Howe solo section and \\"Owner of A Lonely Heart\\".  Why this was put on I will never know.  Steve acts like he is so above this piece of pop songcraft.  He would obviously rather be anywhere else on the planet during this song.  <br />I hope someone else can actually be objective about this video.  I purchased this based on the reviews I read.  What a mistake!  <br />BTW Chris and Alan are the saving graces of this DVD.  Both are still great musicians.  Jon sounds good but is so \\"OUT THERE\\" now he is hard to relate to.
B00007ELF2|5.0|By the time he made Traffic, Steven Soderbergh was at the zenith of his popularity having just come off the crowd pleaser, yet socially conscious Erin Brockovich, with an even more powerful critique on a problem that plagues the United States - the war on drugs. He depicts it on a macro and micro level with a masterful command of craft. Soderbergh does it in a way that isn't preachy, making a movie that simultaneously entertains and has something to say.<br /><br />Each story illustrates the futility of trying to win this so-called war on drugs. The Mexico story shows how an honest lawman like Javier walks a dangerous line where he tries to make a difference while avoiding angering his corrupt superiors who would kill him if he doesn't do what he's told. The D.C. story shows how deeply drugs have infiltrated our society when an affluent politician's daughter becomes a drug addict, going to the poor slums to get high. How can he win the war on drugs when he can't even keep his own daughter away from it? The San Diego storyline shows how those at the top of the drug food chain are untouchable because they have the money to maintain a respectable façade and can afford the best lawyers money can buy to make any charges brought against them go away.<br /><br />While it's true that Traffic doesn't really say anything new about the war on drugs, it does reinforce how prevalent drugs are in our society and show how clueless our government is in their attempts to stop it. The problem is that the infrastructure that is in place is dysfunctional so that even when honest men like Javier or Wakefield come along with the best of intentions, they become ensnarled in bureaucratic red tape. Traffic seems to suggest that the best that these men can do is make a difference in their own small pocket of the world, whether it is Javier brokering a deal so that his town gets baseball field and the ability to play games at night, or Wakefield finally making a personal connection with his daughter in a meaningful way. The drug problem will never go away no matter how much money and manpower our government throws at it.<br /><br />On the first disc are three audio commentaries, the first being with director Steven Soderbergh and the film's screenwriter Stephen Gaghan. Soderbergh, with his trademark dry, sardonic wit, touches upon how he achieved the various looks of the movie. Not surprisingly, Soderbergh dominates the track with some amusing anecdotes about filming in this commentary jam-packed with smart observations.<br /><br />The second commentary track features producers Edward Zwick, Marshall Horskovitz and Laura Bickford and consultants Tim Golden and Craig Chretien. Golden talks about how the film's opening drug bust in Mexico was based on an actual event told to him by a Mexican police officer. Bickford and the other producers tend to speak about the film's production history. Chretien was a high-ranking federal agent for the DEA and talks about the authenticity of the bungled San Diego bust scene. This is a very informative track with the consultants providing the most fascinating material.<br /><br />The last commentary track is by the film's composer Cliff Martinez who talks about his score in between the isolated tracks of music.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with 25 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Soderbergh and Gaghan. The two men do an excellent job putting this footage in the context of the movie and explain why it was cut. Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones' characters suffered the most in the editing but a lot of this stuff was cut for reasons of time.<br /><br />\\"Film Processing Demonstration\\" takes us through, step-by-step, how the filmmakers achieved the distinctive look of the Mexico sequences. Not surprisingly, digital technology was used to help achieve this look.<br /><br />\\"Editing Demonstration\\" has the film's editor Stephen Mirrione take us through four scenes and show how they were put together withediting. This is fascinating insight into the process.<br /><br />\\"Dialogue Editing Demonstration\\" features the film's sound editor Larry Blake giving us a crash course in this craft. For example, in one scene a radio could be heard in the background and so Blake had to edit it out and yet keep the dialogue that was recorded at the time - not as easy as one might think.<br /><br />\\"Additional Footage\\" includes four scenes in their unedited form. You can watch these scenes from multiple angles. Most interesting of them all is the cocktail party scene in which Michael Douglas interacted with actual politicians, keeping in character while they were allowed to adlib.<br /><br />Also included are two trailers and five T.V. spots.<br /><br />Finally, there is a collection of rare, drug-detecting dogs trading cards.

B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD is the hottest one out there right now! The True pop star is pink!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I have to say I expected more, and the hype surrounding these guys is really rather ridiculous.  When Rolling Stone proclaimed that &quot;this is the stuff of which legends are made&quot;, I was really excited to hear their talent.  After my first listen I was despondent.  I was unprepared for how mellow they were, and how polished their sound was.  True that their hit single Hard To Explain is really cool, but beyond that, this album is lacking in alot of elements.  First of all, like said in other reviews, Casablancas voice sounds resonant at first listen, but then quickly fades once you hear the entire disc as it's muffled over an intercom.  It becomes not only redundant, but also unsatisfying, and I won't resist passionate, but it just isn't enough.  The guitar is quite fine though, and I will never mind hearing riffs like the ones in When It Started, Trying Your Luck or Last Nite.  The drum was different, and I didn't mind it.  I think that if it wasn't overhyped the way it was, it would sit on the sidelines and wait for mild appreciation by rock/indie fans, like And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead.  There's nothing spectacular here, but it's definitely worth hearing.
B00006879E|5.0|Good stuff- buy the CD...Maroon 5 is very original!
B00003CXCT|4.0|All right, he gilded the lily.  This classic movie always looked great, and didn't need millions of dollars of new special effects added.  It certainly didn't need to have its very best moment completly emasculated.  But don't think I don't love the glorious new spiffiness of it, or that I wouldn't buy a copy the very first day it came out on dvd.
B00005RFAI|3.0|After only one album as a pop/R&amp;B singer,Pink has reinvented herself as a rock chick for her sophomore effort  MISSUNDAZTOOD.Those looking for a'There You Go'redux--or even a reprise of the catchy 'Get The Party Started'--are in for a slightly rude awakening. The album starts off strong, with the first six tracks all first-rate, particularly the Dallas Austin-produced 'Just Like A Pill' and '18 Wheeler'. The remainder of the set is a little uneven, and sorry everyone, but the Steven Tyler duet 'Misery' couldn't be more apropos of its' title--it's simply miserable and not in a good way.  Vocally, the singer is in fine form throughout, making even the more uninteresting material at least listenable. All in all,an ambitious,though slightly disjointed, second effort.
B000066AXC|3.0|This movie reminded me of When a Man Loves a Woman, in which alcoholism never looked prettier (Meg Ryan, Andy Garcia and several perfect children, all shot in beautiful muted earth tones).  I wish directors shooting for Oscar \\"triumph-of-the-human-spirit\\" consideration would stick to topics other than mental illnesses and addictions, because then they inevitably have to compromise the integrity right out of the project.  (My Left Foot was one of the few to get it absolutely right, although that character's limitation was physical.)<br />I don't care what the facts about Nash are or how skewed the film gets them.  It's not a documentary.  We go through this almost every year with one film or another.  It's a tired argument.  The movie has to work on its own dramatic merits.  Does this one?  Yeah, sure.  It held and moved me.<br />However, I keep seeing \\"Best picture of last year\\" and \\"Oscar got it right\\" in these Amazon reviews.  Since it's all opinion anyway, let me opine that Mulholland Falls was the best picture last year, and if it wasn't, then it must have been either Moulin Rouge or Memento.  I've never directed a movie or written one, either, and I couldn't begin to have known what to do with those three at the storyboarding stage.  But A Beautiful Mind is just a degree or two above commercial TV's Disease of the Week Theater, and even I could have come up with something possibly resembling this movie.<br />The one single outstanding thing about A Beautiful Mind, as has also been mentioned, is what Oscar got wrong -- Russell Crowe gave an astonishing performance.  When will the Academy reward merit and not likeability?  Denzel Washington in Training Day was excellent.  But Crowe was better.  Unfortunately, Crowe threatened someone in Australia and the Academy decided he didn't deserve two awards in a row.  Well, tough.  The public can see through that sort of politics.  Crowe won, no matter who holds the statue.
B00006690G|4.0|Like so many, I think that Eminem's formula for success; blasting his critics and shocking his listeners has become trite; however, one cannot deny the creativity displayed in his lyrics.  Today's rap needs a shot in the arm (the talent pool is awfully shallow); enter Eminem a welcome source of new blood, and coincidently, one of the best lyricists in the business.  Who cares about the offense given by his message, his delivery has (in today's market) no equal.  In most rap, you know what the next word will be, the rapper will slur or mispronounce a word to make it rhyme, not here.  Kudos to Eminem for taking no such shortcuts and using intelligence and creativity to keep his lyrics fresh.  The Eminem Show is a must have!
B00005UQ9F|1.0|This is a movie that attempts to be a horror flick, but is actually lacking in a plot. There is a setting, and a basis for what the characters are doing, but the storyline is impossible to follow about halfway into the movie. Scenes jump from one to another, and there is no indication of how the scenes are connected so you are left more frustrated than frightened out of the fact that you don't know what is going on in the movie. The movie doesn't have good acting performances and the story did not have any charactor development.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This DVD is loaded with Special Features that make it worth the [price]. There are a ton of deleted scenes with or without director comments. The Movie itself is excellent; it made me wish so much that he actually wasn't crazy when his wife was walking to the shed. I've never actually gotten into a movie so much that I wanted something to happen like it was real life. Buy this DVD you won't be disappointed!

B0000029DD|5.0|this album is an exception...What is there to say that hasn't been said about this album? It's got it all. I haven't said this about many male voices, but Jeff's voice is beautiful.<br />This is guitar based rock music. Whether it is only Jeff and his wonderful guitar playing (\\"Hallelujah\\"), or a wall of distortion and noise (the middle of the excellent \\"So Real\\"), the guitar on this album is top notch.<br />Those who are deciding to pick this album up or not... just do it. I was afraid to buy it at first, fearing that it was soft music that I was never going to listen to. Those were dumb thoughts.
B000002IZ4|5.0|a really good follow up to core, this is stp before they went creatively insane...purple is still loud and brooding and blatant and all that jazz...with some softer, acoustic-y songs to even out the load... very good if you wanna mellow out on the couch with a glass of milk.  good to sing along to.  put your kids to bed with it.  not the louder stuff though, thats clean  your room, im rather angry,  lets go driving music...does that make sense.  get it, its worth the coinage.
0451169514|5.0|I've read a lot of King's stuff, and this is his best book...it's the only one that feels completely, totally whole and complete.  It's mammoth in size and scope--granted, the book is over 1,000 pages (even longer than Mailer's Executioner's Song) but the story is so huge that it really requires that many pages to tell.  The result is an enormous, enormously entertaining reading experience.  In fact, I believe that this book is powerful in a way that many others are not; I read it a few years ago, and completely forgot about it.  Now that I'm reading it again, though, everything has come flooding back and it feels incredibly frightening, most of all incredibly sad in that lost-innocence sort of way.  It may be one of the most poignant, beautiful, and terrifyingly depressing growing-up stories ever written.  Don't let that dissuade you from reading IT, though; it's a truly powerful, indescribable, very strange experience that, in ways that I can't explain, is affecting on some sort of subliminal level.  While IT is not an intellectual or really &quot;important&quot; book by any means--it's well-written pulp--it still had an effect on me like no other book that I've read.

6305546789|4.0|John Carpenter's classic horror/slasher film comes to DVD, like you've never seen Halloween before. It was a cold night in Haddonfield, Illinois, on October 31st, 1963, when young six-year old Michael Myers murdered his older sister Judith in the upstairs bedroom of the house on Lampkin Lane. He was committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, and fifteen years later on October 30, 1978, he escaped the grounds, and returned to Haddonfield in hunt of his other sister, 17-year old Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is the obsessed psychiatrist of Michael, hunting him down during the movie. Michael stalks Laurie for most of the day, stalking the little boy Laurie babysits later in the night, stalks Laurie during her schooling hours at the local high school, stalks Laurie and her friends while they walkhome, and just about appears everywhere Laurie goes. That image of Michael, the blue suit, and that faceless, pale white mask that he wears sets up a classic horror film about Michael's rampage on Haddonfield, and Laurie's friends living nearby her, the kids Laurie babysits and Dr. Loomis's search for Michael during the night. Digitally remastered in THX, with better sound and picture quality (Dolby Digital 5.1 for sound, and also Dolby Digital 2.0 + Dolby Digital Mono, the original way it was presented in theaters) as well as the superior picture quality (widescreen 2.35.1) this is Halloween as you've never seen it before. It loses a point for not having the cut TV-version scenes, now only available in the Halloween: Extended Edition DVD. Buy this one instead of that, 2 or 4 scenes don't really make a difference. Plus this has better sound quality and more special features. It also loses a point because it doesn't have a very good Chapter Selection, and no subtitles.
B00002Z88D|4.0|ok so this was better than &quot;november rain&quot;... i only give it four stars because i didnt need to hear so much symphony at the beginning, but otherwise, it works....very creative stuff, the symphony doesnt sound misplaced or lost, the two sounds mingle and intertwine beautifully, and really add some much needed melodic qualities, while still being quite powerful.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|In his younger days John Nash struggled to define himself from others through his mathematical brilliance. He did so often at the expense of the human relationships that grounded him to this world. As he himself has later stated, madness can be viewed as a type of conformity. John Nash's fear of conformity -- of being ordinary -- perhaps fueled the onset of schizophrenia that jeopardized his career, his relationships, and everything he held dear.<br />I read \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" long before the book became a movie. While the film skews some of the facts surrounding Nash's illness, Akiva Goldman's brilliant screenplay does so only in attempt to help the moviegoer visualize the nature of one man's delusions -- his internal demons. Purists who would deny the filmmaker a certain license with facts would have to settle for a book which was in many ways, unfilmable.<br />Thank you, Ron Howard, for taking what was (for me) the most compelling biography of the last decade and bringing it to film. Your movie never shies from the failings of its subject, nor does it allow Nash's shortcomings to obscure his intellectual and human promise. We live in a world in which we are taught to distrust what is good in others. In which a single human flaw in our public figures is somehow allowed to negate the weight of their achievements. (Their failures keep them \\"like us,\\" and we don't like what we have become.) This movie is not afraid to offer us a flawed hero. The film reaches for a level of pathos and empathy for Nash that surpasses even that achieved by the book and which left me in tears. Not an easy task.<br />This is a story about the ascendance of genius, its descent into madness, and the redeeming quality of love. It is not a perfect movie. There are moments of awkwardness early in the film as it struggles to communicate the nature of Nash's genius. That's okay. Most of these scenes are well handled and some are quite amusing. Genius is not an easy thing to illustrate without leaving most of us in the dust. There are many movies I rent once and move on to the next. Others I watch over and over through the years, always finding something new or at least a reminder of something I should not forget. This one's a keeper.
B000002HMH|4.0|load was a delightful trudge through the snow.  it can tend to be pretty boring and then &quot;king nothing&quot; will come along and everythings spinning and there are bright lights, you get the point...some songs rock and do metallica true justice...and some songs, i could live without. if you want a better showcase of new metallica, think about reload.
B000002UAU|5.0|My God, the rubbish I've read here about this album is truly shocking; how can anyone call this crap or trash? That hasn't got anything to do with everyone being entitled to their own opinion; people who say such things are really being silly.<br />I'm quite picky in what I like in music, and I must admit that most of the Beatles catalogue doesn't do much for me (I've always HATED 'Yesterday') but when I heard this one everything just changed. I don't support people referring to Sgt. Pepper's as 'a work of art'. Sgt. Pepper's is just filled with amazing songs. Their strength is the right balance of melody, experiment and time: all songs have a perfect length. Some of the stuff doesn't sound as boldly experimental now as it used to sound to people in 1967, but it certainly doesn't make Sgt. Pepper's oldfashioned and outdated; if it was re-recorded in 2002 people would still consider it to be a masterpiece. A song like 'Mr. Kite' is still ground-breaking, with the strange carnival-like sounds being mixed into the music, and so is 'A Day In The Life'; a beautiful song transforming into a major cacaphony still sounds adventurous (and I do have Sonic Youth and Aphex Twin in my CD-collection).<br />This album is addictive. I can listen to it over and over; it's covered in one certain mood. That's what makes the album the cohesive masterpiece it is. Pre-Pepper's Beatles aren't my thing, but get this one together with the almost-as-impressive follow-up 'Magical Mystery Tour' (ALMOST; it does have the awful 'All You Need Is Love' as the final track... WHY!?) and you'll have something really special.
B000002HRE|5.0|yeah everyone likes to moan about old metallica vs. new metallica but if you're just looking for good music, you've came to the right place.  give metallica a break, who wants to hear speed metal anymore?  they obviously didnt, so they matured, which was obvious way back when the black album was released.  this is just pure rock, awesome writing, guitars, percussion, showcasing the magic these four veterans can make.  as a fan of old metallica, i am proud to say i like reload.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Sometimes there are periods in life you feel alienated from everyone else on this world. 1997, and especially the weeks after OK Computer came out, was such a period. Reading reviews, I've never been smacked in the face with so many stars and superlatives ever in my life. I couldn't wait to hear it. OK Computer sounded like it was a dream of an album; something so special you couldn't believe your ears. Then why... WHY does this album fail to touch me in every way? I don't love it, I don't hate it either. It doesn't annoy me, it doesn't touch me. I mean; I can hear OK Computer being loaded with diversity, melody, emotional vocals and craft, but in a strange way it sounds so incredibly bland. I've talked about it with a friend, and he has the same thing. Are we so different than all the others? I know there are quite a few people who hate it, but are there others who don't feel a single, teeny-tiny emotion listening to this album. 'Karma Police' is a great song right? Or isn't it? Oooh, I must be crazy.
B00005M989|2.0|Nothing from 'Dirty Mind' or 'Controversy'?  That's supposed to be a selling point?
B00004XOWM|2.0|When Limp Bizkit first came out, i was hooked on them. &quot;3 dollar bill y'all&quot; has some amazing rythms, good sounds, and an original approach to old skool rap/rock. I still listen to that CD often.<BR>   Then &quot;Significant Other&quot;. it still bore resemblance to the original limp bizkit stuff, even though a few songs, such as en2gether now, seemed to deviate from their typical style. it was still a good cd. <BR>   As i heard rumors about their third CD coming out, i eagerly awaited its arrival, hoping to see an album to top 3 dollar bill y'all, but unfortunatly, i was sadly dissapointed. it seems since limp bizkit &quot;joined forces&quot; with MTV, Fred Durst has just been trying to please the pop audience, which i think is really why Wes left to make &quot;Big Dumb Face&quot; (a funny band, worth checking out.) <BR>   The first song on the album, &quot;Hot Dog&quot; was funny the first time i heard it, but then when i thought about it, how creative is it to simply repeat the f-word over and over again? Limp Bizkit was a good band, which can produce great sounding music, but with other tracks like &quot;Rollin'&quot;, and especially &quot;Getcha' Groove On&quot; the titles are a dead givaway to how pop they have become. dont belive me? listen to &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, then listen to &quot;Rollin'&quot;. tell me which one you think is better. <BR>   The album does have some saving graces though. songs like &quot;Boiler&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot; have great melodies, and creative lyrics. <BR>   I think that if Limp Bizkit could come back to their old skool stuff, they would get more popularity from their original fans.
0618001905|5.0|Every so often, a book comes along that opens your eyes.  This is such a book.  Before reading King Leopold's Ghost, I was ignorant of the genocide of colonial Congo, but after reading a few hundred pages, not only did I learn of the key players involved, the crimes committed and actions taken to combat the situation, but I also wanted to know more about imperialism in general.  <br />Writing a book on a little researched topic such as this, Hochschild rises to the occassion and writes an easily read yet amazingly complete rendition of the situation.  He introduces us to numerous charcters: Stanley,the egocentric mentally unbalanced explorer; Williams,the American missionary who brings back tales of the horror; Conrad, the author whose voyage to \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" prompted his novel, Morel and Casement, the men who made righting the wrongs of the Congo their crusade; and King Leopold, who..... well, you'll see.   Tracing the story of the Congo from exploration through the selling of the Congo by King Leopold to Belgium and then on to an investigation of the world-wide forgetting of the entire episode, Hochschild has created an amazingly complete history.  This story of the struggles between good and evil is so packed with incredible characters, adventure and murder that you'll never want to turn on the television again!
B000001Y42|5.0|Thank god for this cd, otherwise, i would have to say that Limp Bizkit was a faliure. unlike their new CD, &quot;chocolate starfish and the blah blah blah blah...&quot;, &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; is a straight up incredible CD. every track has just the right mix of guitar, bass, drums, scratching and even the angered yelling of Fred durst. <BR>     the CD is one that you can listen to while doing homework, hanging with friends, or cranking up and moshing to at parties. the last track on the cd, entitled &quot;everything&quot;, which is a 17 minute long mix of rock, and almost techno, that lets your Heart rate slow down a bit from the relentless head banging you've been doing to the rest of the cd. <BR>     Do yourself a favor and, if you don't already have this CD, go buy it. you'll thank yourself for it.
0802136834|4.0|Alison Weir does a fantastic job of bringing each of Henry VIII's wives back to life. By tracing the lives of these women through childhoods to their deaths, this story truly centers on them, rather than the fact that they married a king.  Weir also does a nice job in remaining fair to each, although at times her biases come in to play, the information given in each case is balanced, or at least attempts to be. Furthermore, Wier is complete.  In one easily read volume, a wonderful framework is given which one not familiar with the content can be comfortable with.  But then she goes further, giving detail upon detail, making this book not simply an overview, but a complete study. While Weir often repeats herself from one chapter to the next, the overall product is still excellent.  For anyone interested in knowing about Henry VIII and his unfortunate wives, I suggest you read this book.
B000009EAD|4.0|The cover art really says it all.  The emotion and fantastic imagery captures the mood and expression for the album extremely well.  All of the old metal cliche'd expressions apply--the sound is definitely bone crunching (especially the opening to the third song, the energy of the guitars literally speed grinds out of the speakers).<BR>The songs remind me occasionally of Piece Of Mind era Maiden, but the style is harder, louder, mostly faster, and the singer is not your 2-step-vibrato .<BR>The only real problem I had with this CD in general was that there are 4 songs (count 'em) where the tune starts out slow, mellow and mournful, with the singer really being a bit melodramatic, for the first minute--and then the band EXPLODES INTO SOUND....just a little cheesily distracting.  But if you can suspend good taste for just that little bit of time, there are plenty of great riffs, catchy choruses, and great production to wrap your ears around.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is a good band,but they have great music,catchy lyrics,and awesome vocals. \\"In The End\\" is the best song that i've ever heard on the radio.also \\"Papercut\\" has nice vocals,great lyrics,and awesome music.\\"Pushing Me Away\\" is just good,but they are great vocals and great lyrics.I like \\"One Step Closer\\",\\"Points Of Authority\\",and \\"Crawling\\".I don't like the others,too. ...
B000065DWH|5.0|This is a very good album. A very strong and very intelligent one at that too. Many Newman fans revere this as his best work and with good reason. It's one of the most ambitious, controversial and incisive albums ever made due to it dealing directly with the issues of racism and intolerance (it was well before its time, released in 1974). It's an album that cuts deep into the heart of America and humanity as well, and proves why Newman is considered one of the nation's greatest songwriters.<br />'Good Old Boys' started as a concept album originally titled 'Johnny Cutler's Birthday'. Cutler was to be the embodiment of the southern American 'redneck', complete with self-hate, a violent temperament and a bigoted ideology. Newman however changed his approach to make 'Johnny Cutler's Birthday' into 'Good Old Boys', a more general album that still keeps the Cutler character as a representation of redneck males, but never identifies him as a single person.<br />Since 'Good Old Boys' isn't localised to one character, Newman moves from person to person and place to place. He never shifts his glare, however, from the southern states. The opener 'Rednecks' captures the spirit of the entire album in its controversial catch-cry, \\"we are keeping the [black race] down.\\" Fill in the blank. After 'Rednecks' comes such songs as 'Marie', a song about an abusive husband who can only admit he loves his wife whilst drunk; 'Kingfish', an examination southern politics at its most corrupt; and 'Rollin', a quietly threatening song about how drinking just makes you forget. Ultimately, the themes of bigotry, love, hate, self-hate and morality pervade 'Good Old Boys', making it a fairly powerful listening experience.<br />For anyone who's never heard Randy Newman before, this album will show you why many consider him to be the best alternative-pop songwriter alive today.
B000001F3C|5.0|The first two U2 albums(&quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;October&quot;) were all great, but in 1983 &quot;War&quot; appeared on the musical scene like a confirmation of true musical masters:U2!<BR> It opens with the major hit &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, one of the greatest classics in U2's history. <BR> &quot;Seconds&quot; is a fantastic song, almost Pop... <BR> &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, another classic, is one of U2's best ever. <BR> &quot;Like A Song...&quot; is a true masterpiece of Rock artists with the greatest attitude. Raw guitars and a superb and strong Bono interpretation. Brilliant!<BR> &quot;Drowning Man&quot; is a soft tune with acoustic guitars. It talks about a lost love...<BR> &quot;The Refugee&quot; is almost a tribal song. Different from the rest of the album, but still great.<BR> &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; continues the real good Alternative Rock sound of &quot;War&quot;. Strong guitars and rhythm section!<BR> &quot;Red Light&quot; shows why Bono is one of the greatest voices in Rock History. With a great trumpet presence, this is one of the highlights of the album.<BR> &quot;Surrender&quot; is my favourite song of the whole album. Just listen to this sound. Absolutly genial!<BR> &quot;40&quot; is the obvious final track. A calm and soft &quot;goodbye&quot; song... <BR> If you're thinking to buy &quot;All that You Can't Leave Behind&quot;(the WORST U2 album...) instead of this true masterpiece of Alternative Rock, you're going to do a very wrong thing. Take a listen at &quot;War&quot; and I assure you: if you don't like it at a first listen, you will after a few other ones. Essential!
0312265859|5.0|Every year I get the newest Plum book, read it, laughing out loud--which I almost never get to with any other books. Then I start at One for the Money and read my way through the series again. If anyone knows any author in any genre that gives as many genuine belly laughs as Evanovich, please let me know their name!
B00005JG6Q|3.0|For some reason I didn't really like akira... I thought that the ending was WAY too strange, and that near the middle I wanted tetsu to die and go on so I could move on and do other stuff.  I guess that I probably didn't get it -_-... Other than that the animation was great and the general layout was good, but I'm glad I rented it...  Yet again, as someone else mentioned, if you didn't follow momento you probably won't get it...
0316666343|4.0|What a fabulous journey.  I loved reading this book.  I felt like I was sitting next to Susie while she was telling it to me.  This story was so well written, you felt like you were there experiencing all the pain along with the characters.   Susie really did seem like a 14 year old.  Everyone seemed so real.  It was heart-breaking and sentimental.  I would recommend it to anyone who wasn't afraid of a little &quot;ghostly&quot; interference.
0385505833|3.0|Its nice that John Grisham takes a lighter tone for Skipping Christmas. No lawyers are involved in this tale. However, there are some interesting accounts  on how some people indulge in the holidays. Its funny that when Luther and Nora don't decorate their home for Christmas, the first thing a neighbor questions, \\"Are They Jewish?\\" This makes me wonder, How well would a Jew or even a non-Christian fit in on the Hemlock block?<br />It's pretty comical how Luther side-steps all the neighbors, police officers, co-workers, charity causes regarding Christmas since Blair, his daughter, is supposedly out of the country for a year. However, when Blair suprisingly makes her return with a newly found fiancee, all of a sudden Luther and Nora revive their holiday cheer.  This part of the story is pretty annoying and unlikely though not impossible.<br />Maybe Skipping Christmas is a bit silly in spots. However, Grisham gives a fine account on how the holiday maddness is a bit exaggerated. I could definitely see a made for Television movie for this farce-like novel.
014028009X|5.0|...I'd just like to say a few things.  First of all, I'm an over-achieving, teetotal, drug-free, boyfriend-free, slightly plump jobless teenager.  See - some similarities and some differences with Bridget.  I'm also Christian, and I find it very tiresome in chick lit books when the heroine sleeps her way through for no reason other than drunkeness/boredom/mild lust.  <BR>So - I don't know whether I'm \\"meant\\" to like this book, but...you know what?  I do!  I like it because it makes me laugh.  A lot.  Humour, as we all know, is in the eye of the beholder (or something like that) and so whether you like this book depends a lot on whether you find Helen Fielding's humour funny.  <BR>But I do NOT agree that this book is demeaning to women OR that it provides a role model for them.  Okay, no one should choose to try and emulate Bridget (well, I don't think so) - but on the other hand, as a female I didn't feel degraded or stereotyped by this book.  <BR>Other people have criticised this book for saying that you're nothing without a man.  A lot of chick lit books DO do this, but Bridget Jones's Diary isn't one of them.  Trust me, I get very frustrated with books that say this, and this book isn't saying it.  It may be saying, however, that it's nice to have a boyfriend - and where's the problem with that?  Why can't women be allowed to say that they really want to go out with someone?  Why do we have to act like admitting that is degrading?<BR>I recommend this book highly.  If you watched the film and are interested in the book, you may be disappointed as the two versions are somewhat different, but read it anyway!
B000002U8G|5.0|This is the album that shows the Pink Floyd sonority as we know in these days. The beginning of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", I might say...<BR> \\"One Of These Days\\" is an instrumental Pink Floyd classic. The bass lines are strong with the correct background guitar improvisation. Then we have \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\", one of the greatest soft songs in Pink Floyd's career. Superb acoustic guitar work... In \\"Fearless\\" the quality of \\"Meddle\\" continues without a scratch. Strong message... \\"San Tropez\\" is half Jazz, half Pop. A different song, but also brilliant. I really enjoy it! \\"Seamus\\" is a Blues about a dog. Groovy... Finaly we've got the peak of this record, the fantastic \\"Echoes\\", the first Epic by Pink Floyd. 23 minutes of pure inspiration. Turn off the lights and enjoy this masterpiece. The name of the song says it all...<BR> Globaly \\"Meddle\\" is a more \\"easy to listen\\" record than the first ones. It's also the first carefuly produced Pink Floyd album. <BR> Essential for any true Pink Floyd fan. If you're not a special fan of the band, but still want to hear good music, you'll need \\"Meddle\\" in your collection. That's for sure!
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron made much more than just a action Picture The Terminator is a brillent film with a very good story. I liked this movie and its one of my favorite's there is not much more I can say except that its a good movie and I loved it. This film just came out not to long ago on a great DVD totaly remasterd and lots of other goodies including delated scenes. This is a great sci-fi and a brillent movie thanks to James Cameron. You can also get the 2 disk DVD of T2 witch is another great DVD with a version never seen witch adds more than 20 min to the picture.

0790731452|4.0|MARS ATTACKS baffled audiences and critics alike not realising it was a spoof on classic science fiction movies of the 1950's and even of the recent INDEPENDENCE DAY released a few months earlier.  Also, it was probably a backlash to movies like E.T. and STARMAN in which these movies have humans trying to establish friendships with the aliens. Lastly, the film's director is Tim Burton, and that should have been a major clue to what kind a film this was going to be. The martians are based on the TOPPS trading cards of the past and are given the CGI treatment.  Their screen personality is what makes the movie either funny or unwatchable depending on one's point of view.  In either case, these martians just want to kill, kill and kill again.  Basically, that is the main theme of the film. Also, if a person is not killed, they are kidnapped and used for outrageous experiments (i.e. the Sarah Jessica Parker character who's head is tranplanted on her pet dog's body and the dog's head on her body...it is a very bizarre piece of special effects!).  In any case named actors are there only to be oft by the martians throughout the movie and the martians are fun to watch in their mannerisms and speech habits of honks of various tones and how they just laugh when they are killing  and destroying everything is sight. However, it starts to wear on the filmgoer wondering how and when its going to end. When the humans do finally find a way, its too late to laugh. An impressive cast from Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan,Micheal J. Fox,Danny Devito, Jack Black,Martin Short,Rod Stieger, Jim Brown,Pam Grier, and...Tom Jones? The film calls for repeat viewings to get the joke, and the viewer must be  reminded that one is entering another one of Tim Burton's dark worlds.
B00003CY0V|3.0|You'd think for all the money Hollywood puts into these films, they'd do a bit more research before filming. The assassinated hacker was NOT speaking Finnish. It sounded more like Dutch or German, but definitely not Finnish. Okay, its one of the most obscure languages, but there are surely a good number of Finns seeking fame and fortune in LA who could have provided a bit more credibility to those scenes. A laughable display of ignorance!
014100018X|2.0|I'll say  the good points of this book first.  The bare bones of the story are original, and you probably won't be able to predict the end.  The description is also pretty good, and Harris switches from Vianne's to Renaud's viewpoints neatly and creates realistic voices for the two characters.<BR>BUT...<BR>This book is prejudiced and shallow.  All the people on Vianne's side are wonderful, kind, sensible and interesting.  All the people on Renaud's side are evil, cruel, vicious, pretentious and/or violent.  Why couldn't we have had some Christians who wanted to worship yet liked chocolate?  Or some chocolate-lovers who were mean?  <BR>I totally lost sympathy for Vianne after she slept with Roux.  This seems a completely unnecessary plot twist.  She had no intention of forming a relationship with him - her only excuse is that now she has another child who will grow up loving \\"life on the road.\\"  Considering she herself, as well as Anouk, has felt lost and rootless sometimes I wonder that she's so confident about bringing another child into such a situation.  <BR>The final conflict with Renaud was also poorly handled.  His motivations and background were set up throughout the book and then at the end he just left, his story unresolved and his beliefs held in contempt.  There was no proper resolution.  Also I felt sorry for him and actually liked him a lot more than Vianne!<BR>I find this book offensive to Christians, prejudiced and one-sided in its views and characters, and overall tiresome.  I don't recommend it unless you are (a) anti-Christian (b) very, very into chocolate or (c) bored.
0064407667|4.0|Very good. Not as good as the books that follow it, but still a good read. I definitely recommend this to any young adult who doesn't mind a truly depressing and devastating storyline. However, the depression and devastation is entirely overshadowed by the humorous and resourceful characters (Namely the Baudelaire orphans), the obvious talent Snicket has in writing, the wonderful surprises and the timely plot. Once you read this, you won't stop with the series until you're finished!
B0000029DD|5.0|I first heard of Jeff Buckley years back on 120 minutes I believe. Chris Cornell had made a comment about the SONG \\"Grace.\\" I purchased the album soon after. This was years ago and to this day the album Grace still remains my all time favorite. Not only does this album include soft and touching lyrics, but it also includes some of the best music and range of vocals I have ever heard in my life. Jeff Buckley can easily go from a soft inspiring melody to a hard rock scream without batting an eyelash. I feel that if you have not already purchased this album, you should not only do so, but also instruct everyone you know to do so as well. I have bought this album as gifts for many people and recommend it to everyone I come in contact with :) As far as his double disk goes, I would say it is good as well, but it was not solely done by the master himself due to the fact it was put out posthumously. Music has lost one of the best voices ever to live, but this album makes it live on. BUY IT!
B00005JL3A|4.0|People who say this movie could have been tons better and that it is trash need to have their butts kicked.  That guy who rated it from Amazon.com Jeff Shannon i think, what an ass i bet he couldn't produce a better movie if his life depended on it.  By the way, i thought that \\"EH\\" was a exciting movie that had a great story and was told in a amazingly fast paced, intelligent and insightful way.  Just because you don't get it does not give you the right to call it a bad movie.  I thought Resident Evil was way better then i had expected and i had held high expectations for it.  I feel that there was an excellant mix of technology and good ol' fashioned acting added in that kept the movie pace very fast and ingageing.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie and at no time did i feel that the movie was boring.  It is easy to be critical, but try going out and doing something worth doing.  You all need to watch this movie agian because i think you went and saw it, you only gave it a rating by how the commercials were.

B00006690G|4.0|Personally, I loved this cd.  My favorite tracks were business, square dance, drips, sing for the moment, and his hit single without me.  Cleanin out my closet was also pretty good though. The reason I subtracted a star was for the number of skits on the album, even though I find them quite hilarious.  So before you get down to business hurry up ang snatch this masterpiece.

1587990717|5.0|Anyone associated with trading should read this pamphlet, as it points to many of the flaws and lies of modern finance. The lessons gathered by this very seasoned and contrarian trader are worth the price.<BR>The main flaw is not in the book, but in the strategy of the author, which completely contradicts his thesis. Namely, if very few hedge funds follow this strategy, there must be a reason. The reason is that the author/hedge fund operator forgot that the success of his trading strategy is very &quot;random&quot;, to use his favorite word. Because that strategy only works if a severe financial crisis happens sooner than later (in the next few years), otherwise all his investors will have pull out after bleeding money month after month. The author will absolutely agree that the occurence of the next financial crisis is &quot;random&quot;, and could very well happen ten years from now. To use another of his favorite terms, this is a path dependent strategy.<BR>As the author wrote with total deference to the master, George Soros, successful traders are the ones who can change their opinion very fast. This is the exact opposite of what the author does, as he ALWAYS buy volatility, thus NEVER changing his opinion. The idea of selling is taboo to him, so let's see if the law of the survival of the less fit will apply to him. <BR>If it does, he will look like a hero, otherwise this book will be the testimony of his self avowed incompetency.

0609610570|4.0|The two authors have obviously worked together before writing this book and have now collaborated on practical lessons learned that leaders should want to stay sharp on.  I have met Ram Charan at numerous meetings and found that his greatest strength is challenging people to think.  I do not always agree with his insights, but I do like how he makes me and the reader think about how they act as a leader.<br />Now I will tell you that I learned from Larry Bossidy's comments in the book.  I actually sought out his comments as the book went on.  Why?   Well, each and every section that he contributed was no nonsense, practical advice.  It appeared to me that his comments were straight from his thoughts, as if he were speaking.  Spontaneous and candid.  I made a list of take-away actions that I wanted to check myself on or apply in the future.<br />The basic principles of the book are simple:  identify the best people, give them clear objectives, challenge them to improve and check up on them frequently.  It sounds too simple...but the simple things that Bossidy mentions are the important aspects of the book.  Listening.  Writing follow-up letters outlining the expectations of the leaders previous day interactions with the boss.  Talking with people to find out for yourself what is going on, how people are being managed, what management is doing right and what they are doing wrong.<br />I found the advice from Bossidy the real key to the book.  I especially recommend this for all leaders that think execution is something that is delegated for others to do.  I also recommend this for any leader, no matter what size company, to validate the basics in their personal toolkit...are you \\"executing\\" the basics?
B00005QGAX|5.0|Bad is a true masterpiece in music making. I can't say it's my favorite Michael Jackson album, because they are all so amazing, but one listen to this one will have you begging for more.<br />Bad- The title track. Of course, I don't need to say much about this one, it's great, it's a total hit, and it's Bad.<br />The Way You Make Me Feel- This song has such a great vibe and tune. I love it totally. I'm sure you're all familiar with it.<br />Speed Demon- My least favorite track on the album. It's still a good one though, about a fast car. Pretty surprising right?<br />Liberian Girl- A creative, original song. It's got an interesting rhythm and makes you want to sing along with it.<br />Just Good Friends- A duet between Michael and Stevie Wonder. It's fantastic. It also has a good beat, (funny how Michael Jackson's songs have good beats) and it's a cute song.<br />Another Part of Me- A feel good song, one of the shortest on the album. It's not one of my favorites, but it's still very good.<br />Man In The Mirror- One of the first anthem-like songs with a strong message. We're all now accustomed to Michael singing songs to &quot;heal the world&quot;and this song is a terrific start. Sadly, it wasn't written by him, but his voice is incredible on it.<br />I Just Can't Stop Loving You- Michael sings this with one of the writers of Man In The Mirror (Siedah Garrett). A lot of people criticize the pairing, saying their voices sound too much alike, but I can distinguish the two, and this is one of my favorite love songs of all time.<br />Dirty Diana- This is an amazingly crafted song. I love every bit of it, it's bad, dangerous, provocative, and compelling. It shows a new side of Jackson, a side I like to see.<br />Smooth Criminal- This song is also a creative and original song. I don't know how he comes up with ideas for these hits. By the way, this version is much better than the recent cover by Alien Ant Farm.<br />Leave Me Alone- Aside from Wanna' Be Startin' Somethin'on Thriller, this is his first song about the media. I think it was cleverly placed at the end of the album. It's a good song with a very true message.<br />Next we have commentary from Quincy Jones about the meeting between Michael and Prince. It's interesting to have insight about what went on during the making of this incredible album.<br />Streetwalker- This song is a lot like The Way You Make Me Feel in my opinion. I like it a lot, and I don't think it would've hurt to have been on the original album.<br />Quincy tells us about his favorite tracks on number 14.<br />Next we have the Spanish version of I Just Can't Stop Loving You. When I've overplayed the song, I can turn to this one, and it's like a totally different one. I like it, and he pronounces everything correctly which is essential in a song sung in a foreign language.<br />Quincy Jones goes on to speak about Speed Demon, Liberian Girl, and Dirty Diana.<br />The last track is Fly Away, and I think it could've replaced Speed Demon with ease. It's a good song again with a good beat. It's sweet and his voice is soft and beautiful.<br />That ends Bad with it's extra tracks. I really am pleased that we get all of these interviews and peeks into the cut tracks. Buy this album even if you have the original. It's a good deal, and an album you can listen to for a lifetime.
B000002NJS|5.0|As a Madonna fan I think that this is one of her best recordings ever.  Ray of Light really is a ray of light.  The album is a mature production and experimentaion of Madonna into a different music style.  The songs are nice and music is well done.<BR>Madonna has really put a lot of herself into this album in terms of her life and struggles that she has endured to get to where she is today. The highlight of the album comes in with Candy Perfume Girl all the way down to the beautiful track of Power of Goodbye. Nothing really matters is probably my favorite track of the entire album, but be sure that all the songs are excellent.<BR>Buy this album discard Madonna's most recent album Music.
B000051S44|3.0|I first saw Lemans on the big screen back in 1971 - actually at a drive-in - and recently saw a 30-minute documentary on its making, co-hosted by Steve McQueen's son. The film is timeless and the racing sequences are as exciting today as they were then, considering the technology of the time. The cars, too, speak volumes of that particular era of racing, when the sport was still a sport and not the technology it is today, where he with the most money usually wins.<br />Over a million feet of film were shot during the actual race (a 24-hour endurance marathon that familiar names such as Foyt and Andretti have won), but Hollywood was concerned that, despite Steve McQueen's desire to film the consummate racing movie, there was no script. Indeed, the semblance of a romance thrown in is thin, but again, at least for the purists, the racing sequences make up for the lack of a solid, well-defined plot.<br />Four stars for the cinematography, two stars for the storyline.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Once I saw The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew immediately that I had to purchase the soundtrack. Just listening to it makes all of your emotions shine through. While listening I find myself replaying all of the scenes in my head, it is simply amazing. Even if you are not a &quot;classical&quot; music type person such as myself, this soundtrack is a must for any CD collection. Once you put it on, it is hard to turn it off!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|In fact, this is my second.<br />I just finished watching Donnie Darko for the first time. Once I finish this very short review, I will be watching it a second time.<br />Without a doubt, Donnie Darko is one of the best Generation X films (not that this film should be categorized in any way shape or form. Perhaps I should delete this line. Bah! I'll keep it.) ever made.<br />The film is poignant, witty, and absurd. Unlike other phantasmagoric/surreal films, the absurdity actually comes together quite nicely at the conclusion. At the end of the film I wasn't left scratching my head wondering if maybe the director was just shooting way over my head (which sometimes [not always] happens to me with Lynch films).<br />To me, Donnie Darko represents everything that American Beauty should have been. And I think American Beauty was a great film. It's just that Donnie Darko enters uncharted territory in the examination of the dysfunctional family territory. \\"Because if the world ends, it'll just be you and him.\\"<br />Or something to that effect.<br />The other reviews here are much better written and more detailed. Read them.<br />And. At least rent Donnie Darko. I do not think you will be disappointed.
B000002UAR|5.0|In view of the tragedy of 1980, it's unfortunate that this album title has some unwanted implications.  Revolver is (as everyone on the face of the Earth knows) a totally fab album without a single weak spot. But, again, you already knew that.<br />Taxman, She Said She Said, I'm Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, Doctor Robert, & I Want To Tell You are so undated that if those songs would have come out this year, they would be the biggest things since....well, the Beatles.<br />Unusually, all of McCartney's tunes have aged well, too. Eleanor Rigby still touches a nerve or twelve, while Here, There and Everywhere is immaculate pop. Good Day Sunshine is playful without being cloying. For No One is perhaps the best song that McCartney has ever written. Got To Get You Into My Life is such an effective parody of R&B as to be virtually authentic.<br />Lennon is at his brilliant best with acid-drenched compositions like I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, And Your Bird Can Sing, & Dr. Robert. \\"Acid-drenched\\" is an understatement for Tomorrow Never Knows, which is truly a weirdly wonderful experience.<br />My favorite Beatle also gets a surprising amount of space on Revolver. Taxman is furious, while the discordant I Want To Tell You predicts modern music more accurately than any of its sister compositions on Revolver. Love You To shows the possibilities of wedding world music & rock before people had even heard the name \\"Peter Gabriel\\".<br />And to top it all off, Ringo has a jolly song to sing!
B00004X01U|3.0|I am a Madonna fan and have always been fond of most of her music, but this album leaves me with somewhat mixed feelings.  At the same time I like it and dislike it.  It's an average album with ok music.  I personally think that Madonna accomplished more as a recording artist with her previous Ray of Light Album in which was much better.  Even though I am very much into techno-electronic music, I hate the title track Music.  I think that is one of Madonna's worst recordings ever.  It is a stupid track that gives electronic music a bad name.  The rest of the album is above mediocre.  The only tracks worth listening to are Impressive Instant, Runaway Lover, and Amazing.  Those are the only nice songs on the album that I enjoy listening to.  The rest of the songs drag a little and not worth all the commotion that was put out by Madonna in terms of her growth as a musican and artist.  I do not know what inspired Madonna to adopt that hideous cowgirl image for this album, but I hope she does away with it soon.  I think she looks awful as a cowgirl, ewwwwww!   Music is just ok Music.
0790729628|1.0|When this was released it instantly became one of my favorite movies, a lot had to do with the voice over bringing back the feel of an old noir movie. The other was the bright ending after a dark night of terror. Since some like the director's cut and the theatrical release why not put both versions on one DVD? Real movie conasuers don't care about the falsely called \\"Full\\" version. Why waste the space on the DVD when both versions (in wide screen) would satisfy a wider consumer base? Won't buy this until the original is released.
0671042858|3.0|The overall plot (a young girl lost in the woods being trailed by a mysterious creature) is interesting yet the book never quite delivers creepiness that readers expect.  King shines in this book with his fully-fleshed and believable characters as he does in all of his work.  However, when measured against other King titles, this one falls behind.
0060245867|5.0|This is a great children's book!!!!<BR>I loved it when I was a kid and I still do. I have shared this book with lots of children I know also! I have 4 different copies, I highly recommend this for any child!
0930289455|5.0|Forget all the hype and just pick up the book. It's entertaining, concise, and definately worth your time. It's the only work of graphic fiction I've read twice in a one night. Trust me you won't be dissapointed. Three cheers for Moore and Bolland or was that three Eisner's...?
0385505833|4.0|Forget trying to analyze this novel-- enjoy it.  This book is entertaining and takes just a short time to read.  My stomach hurt because I was laughing so hard.  Perhaps this book created so much enjoyment for me because my husband is an accountant.  That, or I was ready for a light book that would make me laugh.  Regardless, avoid analyzing the materialistic/traditionalistic/religous messages that could be discerned from this book, and just read it!
0140277447|5.0|This book details the intense, savage bloodletting that occurred after the Japanese army occupied the city of Nanking in China.  Mass rapes, mass torture, and mass executions in every imaginable way (beheading, burial alive, burning, etc.) was common during the occupation.  While exact numbers will likley never be known, it is believed that well over 100,000 Chinese lost their lives.  <br />Readers of this unrelenting book will grimace at photos of victims of the Japanese army including a man in the process of being beheaded, recoil at the glib reporting of a \\"beheading contest\\" in a Japanese newspaper in which two Japanese officers see who can decapitate the most Chinese, and finally have some of their faith in humanity restored by heroes in the foreign section of Nanking that refused to leave and saved countless Chinese lives in the process.  Especially interesting is that one of the heroes was an ardent Nazi by the name of John Robe.  He saved countless lives and risked death numerous times at the hands of the Japanese army.<br />This book is not for the weak of heart.  It is relentless and pulls no punches in the telling of the horrors inflicted on the populace of Nanking.  However, it is essential reading for those interested in the Chinese-Japanese War and the period before World War II.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I must admit, I never read any of the Harry Potter books and spent most of the movie quite confused.<BR>Nice special efx, but the story was quite muddly
0316666343|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best books I've read in a long time. In fact, I couldn't put it down! The story is told by a murdered teenage girl, and her observations of what happens with her family on earth after her murder. It's incredibly moving, and I found myself crying often throughout the book. This is one of those books that stays with you long after you have finished reading it, but in a good way, not in a sad one. It also made me laugh, strange as that may sound. All the characters are very real, and you begin to love them as Susie does. I'm highly impressed by Alice Sebold's storytelling, and I look forward to reading anything else she may write. Don't wait for this book to be released in paperback, it's worth every penny for the hardcover.
B000002JR8|5.0|This CD is simply the best from the Kings of Metal. Philip Anselmo truly deserves to be called one of the best singers in heavy music. His singing and screaming will satisfy any metal head hungry for angry vocals. Dimebag Darrell is truly a living legend and the best guitar player in metal. Although FBD lacks guitar solos that were heard on Vulgar and CFH, most of his best riffs can be heard here. Vinnie Paul adds in crushing drum techniques while Rex plays killer bass tunes. Far Beyond Driven made history by being the first ever metal album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Charts. If you want to hear the best from the Cowboys From Hell, pick up FBD and you will not be disappointed.<br />HAIL KINGS, THE NEW KINGS... STRONGER THAN ALL!!!!
0767830520|5.0|\\"Taxi Driver\\" is another one of my all-time favorite movies. True, it's a haunting and disturbing film in some cases but it's also a work of art. Scorsese and Paul Schrader(he wrote the screenplay) bring to life an unforgetable picture that should be recognized because to its universal themes and not because of the controversy surrounding it.<br />Robert De Niro gives a performance of the highest calibur. He plays the main character, Travis Bickle. Travis is a lonely and alienated man who's both fascinated and repelled by life in New York City. When he tries to fit in the norm, he finds himself posing as a threat to the 'normal' people. When he's rejected by a beautiful socialite, Betsy (Cybil Sheperd)as well as a twelve year old prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), he begins to go over the edge. Travis begins to become more earnest in making his presence known to everyone. He does so by taking extreme measures.<br />Travis Bickle is someone we can all relate to. We've all felt loneliness and detachment from our surroundings at one point or another. So it's easy to sympathize with him, but you can't forget what all he goes through in order to get that recognition he desperately wants. It's an intriguing and disturbing look at a man's tortured soul.<br />Scorsese has always done a wonderful job of getting into the minds and hearts of his central characters. His interest in learning what makes people tick is always evident.<br />I don't recommend this movie for the faint-hearted. It's not a movie for everyone. There are many things in this film that would prove to be too much for some viewers to take. However, it is a wonderful film despite that and it's important to be open-minded.
B000002KNI|5.0|Although I was born in the early 80's, I often wish that I was in my twenties during the time that Simon &amp; Garfunkel were popular.  I grew up listening to this album from my parents' collection but now that I am older have a different appreciation for it.  Even if you are not a baby boomer you can still love this album!!<br />This album spurred me on to buy six of their other albums, and none of them has compared to this one.  Not only is it a 19-song set of most of the greatest hits, but the live songs are so much better than the studio ones.  Simon and Garfunkel play beautifully and much more relaxed in the live setting.  With the gentle noise of the crowd in the background, you definetely get the feeling of being there in Central Park.  Being a NY native, &quot;Heart in NY&quot; (not on their other CD's) just really gets me.  &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Kodachrome&quot; and &quot;59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)&quot; are a few of my other favorites.<br />The lyrics show the songwriter's struggles with the direction of their lives, set to a great beat that will have you listening to this album over and over again.  Paul Simon has a beautiful soothing voice just about anyone can recognize.  An awesome album to chill out to, definetely my favorite of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's, and an essential for any collection.
0385121679|5.0|this book reveals the terrible history of the Overlook Hotel.The Torrance family,jack, his wife, wendy, and their son, danny had been asked to be the caretaker while it's still on snow season. They would mind the whole hotel, which included the heater in the basement.

The ghosts have successfully convinced jack that the hotel is a good place to stayed in. wendy and danny could no longer do anything about him, there's no place to run or hide, to the fact that it's the middle of a snow season. af friend has helped them to escape, but jack wouldnt allow it. he's gone mad, and he could kill his family for it. finally, jack has become a very different person, he tried to kill his family, hit his wife w/ a roquet, but she still survived. danny and their friend was able to escape and waited for wendy to come out. w/ all the chasing around the hotel, jack forgot about the heater in the basement, and it was too late to turn it off. after a few minutes, the heater blew up which caused a one big explosion, and the hotel was eaten by a big blaze of inferno. the hotel was burned up, together w/ its bad history. wendy was able to escape just before the blow up. she, danny and their friend grieved so much for the death of jack, but they were so much relieved that the hotel had finally laid to rest. this book will make ur stay in hotel a very different experience, coz we wont know, every hotel has its own little secrets, and it's up to us, wether we want to find it out or not.
0743455967|5.0|Ok, I gotta be honest.  Normally, I'm not in any way shape or form into non fiction, but this book kicks [rear].  Stephen King talks about his experiences in the publishing world, his writing hints and tips, and plus his ability and complete truthfullness that he expresses in telling the hard core truth that there's a good chance that as a writer you won't make any money, unless you do, then you're very lucky.  I'm a fiction writer myself, and this book had definately changed the way that I write.  For instance, he had said that you have to \\"Show\\" The reader your story, you can't just \\"Tell\\" The reader your story.  For instance, you can't just say \\"The princess was locked up in the castle and was kept there for an eternity\\" You have to show, show, show, the reader that.  That wasn't an example, the whole princess thing, I just made that up to make an example. And I believe it is true.<BR>     Also, he tells us about some of his past memories as a child.  Some of the stuff that he tells us about his life are often sad, but the way he gives hints on writing is amazing.  If you're a writer, this is undoubtedly a book for you.  I'm not into Kings horror novels too much, (well, I kinda am, but then again not, since sometimes his books can be good and bad at the same time) but this book totally rocks.  Pick it up, that's all that I can say.
0767903862|3.0|I have to admit at the outset, i am not a Bill Bryson fan (which i believe puts me in a minority). There is something about his writing that rubs me up the wrong way. And i put off reading this book for a long time, as i had heard many Australians say it was just not very good.<br />I am therefore happily surprised to say it is not that bad. It is always interesting to see what an outsider thinks of your home country, and i would say that this is a good insight into others' opinions of Australia if not Australia itself. I have recently embarked on travelling through the UK and Europe, and have been trying to find a book to recommend to others that gives a non-cliched view of Australia, and Bryson's is one of the few i would recommend, with caveats (it is full of cliches, but less than many).<br />For those who have read the book - Bryson obviously is not very good at exploring cities though - i would say that Canberra has some excellent bars and some bloody good restaurants. It's not Sydney, but it is not nearly as dire as he makes out.There are lots of little mistakes too, that on their own are not much, but added up make you wonder at times. The most annoying thing is that he never seems to ask anybody - again Canberra is a good example. The city that probably has the largest population of journalists, military members, politicians and civil servants in the country - and he can't find a decent bar?? Maybe he should have asked a local. There are other times in the book when i wish he had asked someone for advice or something.<br />For those that are considering reading the book - go ahead. Just remember, travel writers are all biased. They all have their own interests, they all have their own angle. That is just how it is. Bryson's Australia is a humourous one, but perhaps not the only one. My suggestion would be to get to Australia and see it for yourself!
B000002LIR|5.0|This is a great collection of songs, gassoline alley, cut across shorty, maggie may, tonight's the night, the first cut is the deepest, (the country remake, what's made milwaukee famous,) etc,etc,etc. It really only has one fault.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Whenever I play this disk and close my eyes I see a dark jazz club with a piano, drumset, bass and guitar on stage.  The musical arrangements are clean and sparce, just the thing to set off her wonderfull voice.  The voice is soft and smooth, clear and a bit husky.  Listening to this disk takes me places I very much like to be.  What else can I say, I am just blown away by her voice and the music.  I am REALLY glad I bought this disk.
038533558X|4.0|I loved this book and simply could not put it down.  This is the first Coben book that I've ever read and it keeps you guessing just when you think you know the story it changes again. Good work, Coben, I'm going to read your other books.
B000065V3H|1.0|...unless they add decent DVD extras.  If we consumers stick together and avoid buying *bad* DVDs of great movies, maybe distributers will do the work that that is worthy of the movie, the medium, and the price.  I would give the movie itself five stars for story, script, humor, message, and acting.<br />Enjoyable features: original aspect ratio, audio commentaries (by director, writers, actors), \\"making of\\"/other featurettes, interviews, deleted/extended/blooper scenes, cast & crew info, etc. Also, since DVD \\"Region 1\\" includes USA and Canada, each DVD should have both English and French audio and subtitle support. DVDs are expensive, but a versatile medium for movie lovers, so should not be just the bare-bones movie. (Otherwise, a Special Edition should come out at the same time the bare-bones version is released.)<br />A minor beef I have with Disney and Buena Vista is their excluding the original movie release year from the packaging, forcing movie lovers to have to look it up elsewhere. Every movie (DVD/VHS) should have the movie runtime and original release year on the packaging. (Similarly, music CDs should have track numbers, names, and durations on the back of the case, unless a multi-disk set where space doesn't permit -- but many apathetic producers leave off some or all of this information.)

0446677450|1.0|O.K., where to start?  First of all this book doesn't provide any useful information on how to accumulate wealth that you probably didn't already know.  Did you know that to become rich you need to invest your money into assets such as businesses, stocks, or real estate versus expenses such as cars  and watches?  Oh really?  But I thought for sure that I was on the fast track after buying that new 35 foot sailboat.<br />He basically tells us the economic lessons he learned in his life from his father and friend's father.  He refers to his real father, an educated man who held prominent positions in the Hawaian school system and government as his &quot;Poor Dad&quot;.  He refers to his friend's father, who never finished high school but owned several businesses and real estate, as his &quot;Rich Dad&quot;.  His &quot;Rich Dad&quot; taught him to buy assets that made him money.  His &quot;Poor Dad&quot; taught him to work hard in school so that he could get a good job.  <br />There were a couple of things that didn't seem consistent with his stories though.  For instance, throughout the book he refers to stories of his youth where his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; would teach hime some kind of economic lesson.  His economic training supposedly began at the age of 9.  However, later he admits in the book that he didn't set out to be financially independent until he was bankrupt at the age of 37.  If his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; gave him all of this great financial advice since the age of 9, why did he put off using it until he was bankrupt as an adult?<br />Also, there was a line in the cover that said that some of his stories had been fictionalized to make a point.  What do you mean fictionalized?  It kind of reminds me of Mr. Peterson on Seinfeld paying Kramer for his stories to add to his own autobiography?<br />Getting back to how the rich become rich.  He repeatedly makes the point that to become rich you have to acquire assets such as paper securities, real estate, and businesses.  He seems particularly fond of real estate himself.  The way he presents real estate investment is that it is really simple and that it can be done for virtually nothing.  His presentation is very reminiscent of some of these real estate informercials. Then sure enough after reading his book I caught his own informercial one day where (surprise) he had guests on who had made their fortune in real estate.<br />He mentions other things that are borderline legal and most certainly unethical in most cases.  Like if you are able to incorporate into a business, vacations to Hawaii become offsite business meetings.  Also the lifestyle that he presents is in stark constrast to the lifestyles that have been documented in books such as The Millionare Next Door.<br />I suppose a novice to the world of personal finance might obtain some information out of this book.  But I think that would be a sad commentary on our collective knowledge of personal finances rather than Kiyosaki providing any real information.
B00005QIPH|3.0|i think this record is a good effort but there are alot of songs on this record that sound as if the band's influences are actually playing them,  to the point where the strokes lose a distinctive sound that they can call their own.  out of all of these garage revival bands like the white stripes, the strokes and clinic, i think metropolitan is the only band that actually took all their influences and created a new sound that's thier own.  i think all of these major label band's could learn something from these true indie rock guys from washington d.c. i would definately pick up metropolitan's second album &quot;down for you is up&quot;  with or without &quot;is this it&quot;  if i were you.  who knows maybe the hype around the strokes might get redirected soon on to metropolitan who truly deserve it, but don't have it since they're daddy isn't the owner of -the- modeling agency in new york.
B000002LFL|3.0|Once you realize this 1988 CD was quickly released by a record company facing passionate demand for a band that no longer existed, the release of this so-so CD becomes clear.<br />Live records are, as John Lydon put it, &quot;record company stuff.&quot; You get the hits, just sloppier. I can remember only a handful of live CDs that offered something more. (PiL's &quot;Paris in Spring&quot;, Throbbing Gristle's total reworkings, Ani DiFranco's &quot;Living in Clip&quot;, John Cale's &quot;Fragments of a Rainy Season&quot; stand out.) I file this Smiths CD in the just-ok/humdrum bin. I play it sometimes, but in the space of years, not days.<br />Most of this Kilburn UK 10/23/'86 show consists of songs from &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot; or recent singles of that period. Performances here don't touch the studio mastery of that truly wonderful record. The tempo of most songs is sped up, not always a good thing. And then there's Morrissey, who sounds crankier than usual. This works well for &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; which sounds like a thrilling riot, not so well for other tracks.<br />Legalities prevent me from recommending bootlegs that are far stronger, but I can safely say the great live Smiths were recorded - the material is out there - and this CD falls short. &quot;Rank&quot; is a live Smiths document, little more. It might have made a better video, however. Morrissey's fade-in/fade-out vocals suggest this was a rambunctious physical show, where he was swamped by fans. Reissue/Repackage anyone?

B000022TSW|5.0|I recently saw South Park the movie and despite the fact that it was downloaded on a 10 inch screen, i loved it. i have had this movie for 3 days now and already saw it three times.  I am not the musical type but the songs in this movie are a big exception, especially the brian boytano song.  It is just like a really long south park episode.  <BR>The plot basically is the kids go see an R rated movie made in Canada that teaches them to swear. The parents find out and start a war against Canada which leads to a chain of events ending with the devil and saddam trying to take over the world.  It is an awesome movie even if you are not a south park fan.
0694003611|5.0|This is absolutely, bar none, the best book for toddlers.  My two year old finally started to speak, in imitation of it, once we started reading this.  I warn you against the sequel/companion book, however, which is confusing and just plain WEIRD...skip it!
B00005T30L|5.0|This has got to be one of the most thought provoking films ever. Thora Birch, Steve Buschemi, and Brad Renfro all give memorable performances. It was so funny in it's own little sarcastic way! Any teen who watches this movie, or any adult for that matter, knows that they have been through the same situations before in life, or atleast have felt that way before..all alienated, like the world just hates you. The writer of this film new how to find humor in these situations, and pulled it off! <br />All together, a very moving and funny film that all should see! Highly recommended!
B00005ASOI|5.0|Dario Argento clearly originates from the Hitchcockian school of suspense. In typical Argento fashion the characters and plot are all but ignored in his effort but it seems difficult to imagine why his films seem of such high quality. There is not a better director with regards to camera angles and lighting that I have ever seen, it is no wonder he writes all of his own screenplays. His films do not need dialogue or deep character development because it simply isn't what he sets out to do. Argento intrigues you and allows you to trust a film and then is willing to completely shift it's direction just to scare you. The plush colors and impossible camera angles that consistently make you wonder how the hell he got up there to get that incredible shot are what make Argento's films great and clearly his own.<br />Susperia is Argento's masterwork. Albeit, Tenabrae and Inferno are also both done very well, this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and not enough people have seen it. Argento's style is accentuated in this film and he is free to do whatever he wants visually because of the broad script he works with here. The film is like any nightmare you have had that sticks with you for most of the day. I have no question that may be where Argento gets some of his bizarre ideas. The beginning of the film simply shows a girl walking through a thunder shower and the way the scene is filmed and the music is placed makes you realize just how good Argento is at creating suspense in a scene that would normally be filmed with far less attention. Another thing that makes Susperia a great horror movie is the soundtrack, a soundtrack in which I would argue is more frightening than both Halloween and The Omen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great horror (there are few great films in that genre), although Argento's style is often difficult to appreciate at first to those accustomed to conventional film work.

0790729644|5.0|This is great filmmaking. The acting of Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Clint Eastwood is as good as these four greats can get and they are supported by a highly dedicated cast. The screenplay is perfectly written with as much memorable dialogue as some of the greatest films ever made. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest films ever made.<br />The entire film draws a clear definition of William Munney as perhaps the evilest man to ever live and what we the audience sees is a person we can relate to on many levels. In Eastwood's character we see our own darkest sides, our own mistakes and the unintended consequences that unknowingly follow our decisions.<br />At the beginning we see a struggling man looking to avoid the ways of his past, something which he may have seen as the easy road at the time but now is or has been in his self administered rehabilitation with his farm and his children. Here the struggle may be too much to handle and he justifies his decision in returning to his old ways to make it through the impoverished times that have followed his wife's death. The psychology is not obvious in this film but runs far deeper than most films by a mile. We set the stage to see an efficient assassin that has turned around return to the world he did everything to avoid, and return he does.<br />The most incredible dynamic here is that Munney is the clear villain in perspective, but that Hollywood cliche is more blurred here than any other movie I have ever seen (even the Godfather). The man we essentially find ourselves rooting against (Hackman) is a man of the law but ironically we find ourselves caring for the killer played by Eastwood. He is an anti-hero in which we must question our justification in liking him. The idea of revenge seems as natural as breathing in this setting, so we cheer as this killer steps onto his stage one last time to show his would be contenders who is the baddest cowboy of them all. It is what Westerns are all about.<br />In addition, the film appreciates the beautiful North American landscapes like very few films do and does so with brilliant artistic photography and the soundtrack's emotional one string notes add to the raw style of the film. Eastwood's direction suggests a man who truly loves the Western and he is the king of that genre...sorry Duke.ut.<br />In addition, the film appreciates the beautiful North American landscapes like very few films do and does so with brilliant artistic photography and the soundtrack's emotional one string notes add to the raw style of the film.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is an amazing artist. I hope to see more Cd's come from her. Buy it!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Maybe I need to see this a few more times but in no way does this film add up to a logical plot that we can comprehend and draw concrete conclusions with by it's end in my humble opinion, perhaps I need to see it again or perhaps some other critics are too pretentious to admit they have been stumped. The films seems to me, to be a collection of dreams and/or aspirations and/or fantasies about a want to be or would be actress played well by the beautiful English born actress Naomi Watts. It may be traveling deep into \\"Diane's\\" mind and she pictures herself as \\"Betty\\", a quirky and innocent aspiring actress. If this synopsis is what director David Lynch intended (I will not make believe I know this enigmatic man's intentions) then we are seeing a brutally honest depiction of a women's mind; her pride, her shame, her sexuality, her fears and her insecurities. Even if that were true, Lynch would still give us many questions to ask ourselves, such as what is with the behind the scenes midget in the wheelchair, the Cowboy, the Gangsters who force Adam the Director to choose a certain actress, the cheerfully frightening elderly couple that shrinks, the scary dumpster hobo guy, that sad lady on stage singing Orbinson's \\"Crying\\" in Spanish, that strange blue box and the two various blue keys? My answer would be elaborate oddities and specific bizarre details in this women's (Diane) subconscious that seems to freely float about as if in a dreamlike state during a crucial time in her life, the time where she must decide to establish the path she will choose to take for the rest of her life. The anxiety of this stage is something I think we can all relate to. I don't want to rant on and on like I did with Lynch's Blue Velvet but there is even more to analyze here than in any other film I have ever seen. Lynch's intention may not be to compel us of any reasonable statements, but to tickle our subconscious and provoke us to read as far into his riddles as we possibly can. As always it is a welcome challenge to me and David Lynch is truly as brilliant a Director as there is in Hollywood today.<br />Technically, the film is very well done. The DVD resolution compliments the plush colors and amazing soundtrack and the cast adheres well with Lynch's love for extreme characters, particularly Watts. I have not yet completely given up chasing any concrete holistic messages that Lynch may be trying to offer us after viewing the film several times. My conclusion to this point is that it doesn't matter, this is a film that collects scenes that make us feel our way to indescribable logic that is beyond words rather than pinpoint a clear definition of what is really going on...but I will be watching it again to try to find out.

0783228007|3.0|\\"Joe Kidd\\" is not your standard Clint Eastwood western.  The follow up to the very successful \\"Dirty Harry\\", is listless and disappointing.  Slowly paced, the muddled plot takes a while to finally get going, then turns around to crash land where it began.  The film has a familiar cast, which includes Robert Duvall, John Saxon, James Wainwright, Don Stroud, Paul Koslo and Gregory Walcott.<br />Joe Kidd is a farmer, drawn into a land squabble involving wealthy businessman Frank Harlan (Duvall) and Louis Chama (Saxon), the leader of a disgruntled group of settlers.  Chama's efforts at land reform could upset Harlan's plans, and so he wants him dead.  Harlan's hired guns include Simms (Stroud), Mingo (Wainwright), and Gannon (Koslo).  Kidd is hired as a guide, to help track down Chama, but the job doesn't last long, and he finds himself imprisoned in a church in Chama's home village.  Escaping into the hills, with Chama's woman (Stella Garcia), he meets up with the outlaw, and convinces him to return to face justice in the same court system he detests.<br />Elmore Leonard's story is just weak, and neither Eastwood nor Oscar winner Duvall can save it.  Eastwood seems to be uninspired, and Duvall really isn't given much to work with.  Saxon is an odd choice, as a Latino who abandons his principles without much of a fight.  Only Don Stroud puts some punch into the movie, playing an antagonistic killer, provoking Kidd to fight.  His attitude and language do not match the time period, but who cares since not much else is happening?  His untimely end is so quick that we feel denied of satisfaction, which could be said for the whole movie.<br />Lalo Schifrin's score featuring modern electronic instruments, while cool, seems inappropriate in a western.  John Sturges, who has directed some fine action films in the past, like \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", has material of much different quality to work with here.  Overall, not one of Clint's better efforts.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This band sounds like nothing else on the radio. It is a refreshing new sound to our derivative Rock and Alternative radio stations. With bands like this as well as White Stripes, they are touring together right now, The Hives, and Vines might finally end the horrid era of Nu Metal and Candy Pop. <br />This is the best album I have hard since the debute of Le Tigre and the last Queens of Stone Age album.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Being an aspiring Diana, I would like to remind people that she is not a &quot;singer.&quot;  Her piano skills are far better than her vocal skills, and they are often overlooked.  This is probably due to the fact that as she has become more and more well-known, her solos become less and less improvised.  Check out her earlier albums if you want to hear an amazing jazz pianist.  <br />As for this particular CD, I was not so impressed.  It's good, but not great.  If what you desire is a pleasant voice and mellow orchestral part, this is a good album for you.  I don't consider it to be that wonderful of a musical feat though.  At least not nearly as much as her earlier work.  Still, it's obvious Diana is beyond talented.  I look foward to what she has in store.
0553260111|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Ludlum is the best spy thriller author since Ian Flemming. This book will keep you guessing with every chapter. READ THE BOOK, THEN SEE THE MOVIE!!!! The book is much better although the movie is very good. I recommend this book to everyone. One last suggestion, Read more of Ludlum's books!!! I've read many of them and each is as action packed and full of suspense, I'd also reccomend \\"The Prometheus Deception\\". BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
B00003CXTG|3.0|I know, this movie is no Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers or Apocalypse Now, but did everyone really get what they came to the movies for? Most people (including some of my friends) would still say no because of the cheesy first half and the cheesy ending. But the movie actually balanced itself out. This movie doesnt have Academy Award Winning acting, but what do you expect from Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnet, and Kate Beckinsale? Their not the top of the notch, but the bigger actors knew with Bruckheimer (who doesnt look for a storyline, but would rather give some special effects in place of the story) and Bay (who has done some of the worst movies in recent memory) they wouldnt get a balanced out movie...but for once they were all suprised, like me. The ironic thing is the two \\"twists\\" (if you can call them that) where Affleck dies, comes back, then Hartnet dies, end of movie. This team cannot keep a secret about the main basis from the public. Three days before Pearl Harbor was released, I read on Amazon about the ending, totally spoiling the whole movie...I thought. Then I watched it and realized that anyone who sees this movie, figures the ending midways through the film. Not really much special features, unless you buy the Vista Series Directors Cut (which isnt worth $[money]). But for an okay movie to watch, thats historically accurate (atlead the first half), then check it out. If you havent seen it, dont be in no rush, the 2-disc should be down to $[money] by the time they release fifty diffrent versions of the film and DVD.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Maybe it just hit me at the right moment but this movie kinda changed my life. Besides it's cinematic beauty (it fairly glows), the memorable images, the great characters, biblical allegories and all that, it's got the great, simple, universal message that the greatest fortune, for which we sometimes must undergo terrible travails to discover, is the love of family.<br />Folks that just don't get it, well, they're dumber than a bag of hammers...(just kidding)
B00003CXAA|5.0|In films of recent memory, none has such chewable dialogue as The Godfather. Everyone of my friends (including me) have quoted these films until we are blue in the face...And guess what? Were still breathing! This eagerly anticipated DVD Set delievers all the goods. This &quot;Bonus&quot; disc has absolutely everything you ever wondered about the series of movies. The deleted scenes were just as good as the movie, so that proves that Francis Ford Coppola is a pure genius. The DVD has deleted scenes from part one, two, and three. They have the theatrical trailers (which are absolutely dreadful in quality as well as the deleted scenes) which is kind of weird to watch seeing I was born in 1979. The timeline is also good, along with the interviews with Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Robert DeNiro. But they don't have one thing to play back for all Fredo (John Cazale) fans. The DVD transfers on the DVD are not of the best quality, but you got to keep in mind the first and second were made in the early 1970's. The DVD widescreen was the most annoying thing. I love the &quot;2:35:1&quot; widescreen, but this has the &quot;1:85:1&quot; which is basically a full screen version on DVD! This triology is about the rise, fall, rise, fall, ect. of the Corleone mob family. It has blistering performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert DeNiro. The third is the one most disappointing, but hey for the 1st &amp; 2nd plus the bonus disc you get, the deal evens out. Also another bad thing is that the 2nd film is on 2-discs just like Pearl Harbor. But who does'nt have time to change the disc to see The Godfather Part II? For all loyal fans, the rumors on the market is that Coppola is remaking the box set. Which might add a better transfer, a better widescreen, and maybe more Godfather goodies? Lets Hope. If you have'nt seen The Godfather Triology, then what are you waiting on? If you love mob movies like Casino (Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci), Goodfellas (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci), Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, Al Pacino) and Once Upon A Time In America (Robert De Niro, James Woods). Then you better see these. Compare those to these and you can see the difference.
0553278223|5.0|Ray Bradbury clearly carried the Western Frontier of Walt Whitman and Horace Greely to the Martian Frontier in this classic novel. If 1950's America would have had the rocket ships, and an inhabitable destination, planetary colonization would probably have gone very much like this. As the text says:\\" They were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger pointed from four-color posters in many towns:THERE'S WORK FOR YOU IN THE SKY: SEE MARS!\\" Heck, I'd go right now if I could.<br /><br /> His Mars is the essense of the wild frontier: the path finders, the pioneers, the pilgrims, the homesteaders, the townsfolk, the eccentrics- and then the bureaucrats.... Bradbury's Martians are haunting and tragic- and fare about as well as the Plains Indians in the face of \\"progress.\\"<br /><br /> Actually, this story parallels the story of American West a little too closely- especially when it talks of the \\"silent towns.\\" If you've ever seen the dead and dieing farm towns of the plains you know what I mean.
B00005OWEG|4.0|This film is the darker side to Francis Ford Coppola and it won him a armload of Oscars for this winning Masterpiece about the Vietnam war. Now with the redux, I think it shows more of a light side than the original. Some of the deleted footage is okay, but for the most part its a bunch of propaganda for Coppola. However I give ***** for the original which is just eerie as hell. The story follows a platoon of men to go to Cambodia to asassignate a renegade Coronel, (Marlon Brando). The story was basically just said, but as for the picture, words cannot give Francis Ford Coppola the credit he is due for this dark eerie tale. The special effects were more than 'superb' for its time and still today. From the mentally scarring images to the Oscar worthy performances, Coppola does a superb job in making this, (even though he almost went insane to try to make everything perfect) and out of insanity comes Apocalypse Now. The cast includes: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Harrison Ford, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper. If you're addicted to war films like me, then you should love this. (But dont get the Redux, its a waste of money). One of the best Vietnam war movies out and its almost 30 years old! The DVD transfer is superb as well as the art on the disc and DVD. Im not much on films with Martin Sheen, but he will blow your mind away! His performance is that good. One last thing to remember after watching this, \\"The Horrors...The Horrors\\".
B00002MZ12|5.0|I recently bought this album and I think it's great! In a way you can say it's taking Alanis' songs and changing every single one (even the ones with aggressive lyrics) to sweet songs you would want to listen to when you're in a peaceful mood. It's like an Enya-Celine Dion version of Alanis Morissette singles! The album includes three never before heard tracks \\"Over cappuccino\\", \\"Princess familiar\\", and \\"these R the thoughts\\". They're quite good and from the three I personally prefer \\"Over cappuccino\\" to the other two singles cause I like the Vanessa Carlton type piano music that is featured in the background.    The unplugged album's \\"You learn\\" is alright unlike the fantastic \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" version. In the middle of the song you feel like doxing off.     \\"Head over feet\\" is just as good as the original version-a sweet joyful melody (the harmonica makes it even better).     \\"You outta know\\" although slower is still really good and is the song from  the album that is very different and slightly faster than the other songs (great guitar music included).     As for my favourite song from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", \\"Ironic\\" is not as good as the original version but after listening to it a couple of times you learn to like it.     \\"That I would be good\\" is just as sweet as the original version. In fact it's exactly like the original version starting out as a mundane melody but quickly turing into a peaceful sing-a-long song due to Alanis' sudden vocal changes.     Overall this album is great-very soothing to listen to. Those of you who prefer Alanis' simple sweet melodies- this is for you! It's also for all (most) Celine Dion and Enya fans. Alanis has some great vocal performances featured in these tracks. If you like this album you should check out Alanis past two albums, her latest album (under rug swept) or \\"Alanis Maximum\\". Also check out \\"precious illusions\\" from her \\"Under rug swept\\" album!
B000001F9E|5.0|If you're gonna start listening to Thin Lizzy, well then this is the one to begin with! I think &quot;Jailbreak&quot; is one of the best rock albums of the whole 1970's. Thin Lizzy is sadly the world's most under-rated band...
B000069HK2|5.0|When i first herd these guys i was shocked on how good this band was they were amazing the song&quot;a box full of sharp objects&quot; was just one of the best songs i ever herd they hit you hard with a little softcore to them.There one of the greatest bands next to SNOT the best band in the world.but get this album support these guys, if you like glassjaw then you'll prob like these guys check them out on the warped tour and ozzfest.<BR>Now click on &quot;add to shopping cart&quot; and buy the mutha foka!
B00006879E|5.0|I first saw this amazing band open in San Francisco...I couldn't get enough of their music after that night...As the album title suggests, all of the songs sound like they are to or about a girl. Jane is a real person, I believe, but the songs aren't necessarily about this person, but moreso about what a guy feels about each and everything involving romance with a girl. These aren't all love songs, mind you, but they touch upon sex, love, regret, rejection, anger, friendship, jealousy, longing, hardship, as well as just having a good time. It's hard to describe music in words, but these guys are filled to the brim with talent, and it shows in these perfectly pieced together funky rock songs. You'll find yourself wishing you could pick up a guitar and play these songs yourself, singing along and memorizing all of the lyrics. I have two minor complaints. One, I actually like their demo version of Sunday Morning better. That's not to say that I don't like the album version, but they just did a really good job on the demo version. Two, I've had to wait four months for this to come out. Worth the wait, but I'm half-insane by now. This album, as amazing as it is, isn't half as fun as seeing them live in a nice little intimate club. Whenever I listen to Not Coming Home, I recall see them playing in great detail. What parts Adam strums and stops, when Ryan turns his head to the side to sing while drumming, Mickey bopping around and grooving, Jesse making faces to the crowd and pointing around clapping between notes, and James shaking his head and bouncing his knees to the beat. Despite the great album, they are a live band, and they will always be a live band. And a spectacular one at that.
B00004U30D|5.0|Kevin Spacey gives a wonderfully sympathetic performance as struggling loser, Lester Burnham. The movie opens interestingly at the end, looking back on how things came to be. This is in a similar 20/20 hindsight fashion, to the way Al Pacino narrates from the future in Brian DePalmas \\"Carlito's Way\\". Also similarly, the plot is not ruined by this odd chronology.<br /><br /> Lester is an everyday average, albeit underachieving husband, scorned and rediculed by wife Carolyn, played by a disatisfied, shrill and \\"joyless\\" Annette Bening. Carolyn sells real estate, and wonders why her husband isn't more successful. The unhappy couple has one unhappy daughter named Jane, played by a beautifully sullen and distant Thora Birch. From the outset, we can see the gap between parent and child, that cannot be bridged.<br /><br />Poor Lester, nobody has an ounce of respect for him. The best part about it is, Spacey's Lester couldn't care less, and pulls no punches in making his attitude clear.  He takes great pride in humiliating wife Carolyn at a real estate party where she is trying to impress a town real estate king, played by the eyebrow king  himself, the tweezer challenged Peter Gallagher.  Carolyn becomes smitten with the mogul and begins a clandestine and tawdry affair where she has to scream \\"You're The King\\", during each of their encounters.  Truly a comic highpoint in the film.  Also humorous is the spaced-out Spacey, smoking pot with his newly aquainted neighbor Ricky, oustide the party.  Lester can't stop giggling, as Carolyn drags him from the back alley.<br /><br /> Speaking of which, newcomer Wes Bentley is eerily sedate as Ricky, the drug dealing neighbor, who is fascinated with Birch's Jane, and secretly video-tapes her. Jane thinks he's a weirdo, especially when disapproving Angela (Mena Suvari) deems him so.<br /><br />There is Ricky's homophobe father, who is obsessive, abusive and dangerous. He forces his son to submit to urine drug tests, and beats Ricky nearly to death after finding his Nazi paraphenalia disturbed in the family china cabinet. Ricky's seemingly catatonic schizophrenic mom, is by contrast, completely oblivious to everything. We are left to wonder if her husband is the cause of her quiet derangement.<br /><br />This is a strange, comic tragedy that is difficult to summarize. While many of the elements are familiar, they must be absorbed and pieced together by you as you watch, and watch it you SHOULD. \\"American Beauty\\" is a fascinating look at the collapse of a seemingly average family, with a theme that all of us can understand, and sometimes relate to, with a message that many of us could benefit from.r finding his Nazi paraphenalia disturbed in the family china cabinet.

630575067X|4.0|Let's get one thing straight. I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen - far from it, but I did feel it was a great film, remaining loyal to the Star Wars ethos, and leading old fans and new alike deep into a story, which (espeically after seeing Episode II), is deep and compelling. <br />One thing the die-hard fans of the original are forgetting is that George Lucas's main objective was to lure a new generation of fans with his breathtaking battles, gobsmacking visals and incomphrehensively impressive lightsabre duels (I don't care who you are, you have to admit the final battle was SPECTACULAR). <br />The plot was involving enough, and the acting was of a reasonably good quality. OK, it could have (and, in some people's opinions, should have) been better, but it's good in itself. And maybe that's what people should remember.
B00001OH7N|5.0|OK.<br />You can \\"hear\\" so many influences woven together:<br />1) late 60's experimentalism and chord changes;<BR>2) early 70's rock-trio-live Hendrix-esque jams; <BR>3) direct & raw sound, early early metal;<BR>4) All filtered through early Progressive grandiousity, and<BR>5) \\"Brellian\\" Cabaret.<br />But, the exact same music played 5 years later would have stripped out the 60's innocence & experimentalism, and used a more chunky sound with less space that would have pre-viewed  Spinal Tap.<br />So, why is this record so good?  It's so raw!!  If The Who have \\"Live at Leeds,\\" Bowie has \\"The Man Who Sold The World.\\"  Both show off very direct sounding rock bands.  They are both executed by people just flowing and very \\"uncouscious\\" of themselves, just following their instincts.<br />That's such a rare thing now, where money, media-outlets and market-research have refined out any \\"questionable\\" quirks that puts a unique \\"personality\\" into music.  <br />People today, Bowie included, can play much better and sound much better and even have better songs, but arrangement & production choices are now getting so homogeneous from artist to artist as labels try to fit them into marketing niches.<br />And I wonder what would be revealed if the original reels/tracks to these songs were mixed again in 2002?  Adding not a single note, would a remix applying a 2002 sence of sound production create something equally interesting but in a whole different way?<br />You bet it would!
B0000024SI|5.0|Yeah, like the title say's I'm a new dylan fan. This album is really, really good. It goes from pretty mellow folk song's to hard rocking blues songs. For new fan's bob's voice is a little annoying but I'm sure I'll get used to it, plus his lyrics make up for his voice. Tombstone Blues's is my favorite track because it's really upbeat and catchy and my next favorite is desolation row for the great lyrics.
B00005221M|3.0|I wish so much, that i had read Eric Batesons review before i bought this film. I too am a great fan of the film, the VHS edition that is, but after having watched the directors cut I am a bit disapointed in Michael Mann. He has cut out two of the coolest lines in the film, and removed &quot;Clannad - I Will Find you&quot; from the soundtrack. The image and sound quality is of course topnotch, but that just doesn't justify destroying such a good film, by doing the lousyest directors cut I have ever seen.
B000002JKA|5.0|Finally, a heavy DT album! I loved Images and Words, but this one blows it out of the water. James's vocals are way better than I&W, and John plays some great riffs. The album starts out with 6:00, and you can tell that this is gonna be a diffrent sounding album. Brilliant keyboard riff. Caught In A web is monstrously heavy, with a great chorus. Innocence Faded is the only thing that sounds like old DT on this album. Erotomania, the start of A Mind Behind Itself, is an amazing instrumental with great skill. John's solos just kill. Then there's Voices. A dark, heavy, slow tune with painful lyrics. I love the solo in this one. Then there's the Silent Man. Real pretty tune with great vocals by Labrie. The Mirror is one of their best tunes. It is godlike! This followd into Lie, one of DT's best singles. I saw the video for this tune also. The song rules. Espeically the drumming. Lifting Shadows Off A Dream sounds a little like U2. One of my favorites, Scarred, has some excellent tempo changes. At times it's pretty, then it's amazingly heavy. It sounds like something off the 1st album. Space-Dye Vest is the best ballad they've done. Very dark and haunting. Nice use of the riff from The Mirror in this one. Very dark album, not something for 1st time DT listeners. Try something like Images and Words, and then this.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow was an unbeliveble movie in which George Lucas and Ron Howaard team up to make one of the best fantasy movies of probably the last 20 years; probably because it had a budget but whatever.  If you ever played D&amp;D or even know what it is, have children, or love a good movie at the very least rent it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This one of the most beautiful albums i have ever heard...it's jazz with a pop twist...Miss Norah Jones has on eof the most amzing voices i have ever heard...she sounds so mature an her 22 years of age...Plus i must say that this is one of the most amazing cd covers i have ever seen...she's radiant in the cd cover. but th emusic speaks for it's else get this album..you won't regret it...
0394800184|4.0|This is a super cute picture book for anyone of any age to enjoy. This makes an excellent gift book.. I gave it to my mother (I'm adopted) and she liked it very much... It's the story of a little bird that falls out of his nest and goes from one thing to another asking \\"are you my mother??\\" til he finds his rightful mother.  Very touching and cute!
B000003N7G|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already about this powerful album. Listening to this album as a teenager was enlightening, truly so. Trane's music transcends categories and transports you to another plane of consciousness. Not only inspiring to me as a musician, but as a spiritual seeker.
0671027344|5.0|I think this book was the best I have ever read. I'm really not a big reader, but I found myself always wanting to read this book. I think it digs very deep into a boy, that I think is much like other teenage boys, but are too afraid to admit it. I thought this character was brilliant, and I loved his relationships with everyone in the book. It was funny at times, but very serious at others, and I think it gives a closer view of sometimes how teenagers honestly feel. I was very happy that Stephen Chbosky wrote about the boys experiences, much like ones we all delt with. I absolutely loved this book, and I recommend it to any reader, especially young teens.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I don't have the energy to review this album.  It's too massive, it's too epic, it's too good.  <br />Don't get me wrong, I'd love to write a five page paper about how great Sandinista is, about how many different musical genres are explored, and about how political and relevant these songs are.  I could go on for hours about how the Clash actually had the musical ability to pull off an album this ambitious.  I could even go on to recall my awe at the fact that Joe Strummer has the vocal abilities to pull off some of these tracks.  Of course, if I did that, I'd have to mention how ahead of the time this album was.<br />I'd of course have to mention how this album holds together so well.  Perhaps some other time I'll chew your ear off about how the final sixth of the album repeats the album's early musical motifs while the short musical interludes at the end of the songs become more and more urgent, and how this holds the album together.<br />No, I just don't have the energy to explain how complicated, challenging and rewarding Sandinista is. It's something worth experiencing on your own, anyway.  I can tell you this though, it's excellent music.
B00000AFHM|5.0|I don't understand the comparisons of Belle &amp; Sebastian to the Smiths. The Smiths bore me out of my mind, but I love Belle &amp; Sebastian. I'd much rather compare them to the Kinks. Belle &amp; Sebastian are not as funny lyrically, but the music has much more depth and variety. Still, I like them for the same reasons: their songs are pretty and make me smile, no matter what they're singing about.<br />The strings and horns add so much beauty that I've found myself mostly ignoring the lyrics, which are not as strong as in If You're Feeling Sinister, and not caring in the slightest.<br />This is not a perfect album. The low spots are &quot;Seymour Stein,&quot; &quot;Chickfactor,&quot; and &quot;Rollercoaster Ride.&quot; Sappy and, worst of all, dull. The most wonderful ones are when the horn breaks out in the middle of &quot;Sleep the Clock Around&quot;, the joy of &quot;A Summer Wasting,&quot; and everything about &quot;Dirty Dream #2&quot; and &quot;A Space Boy Dream.&quot; It is absolutely worth your money.
0312265859|5.0|This book again just answers the questions, why is Evanovich one of my favorite authors? She's funny and yet still realistic in many ways. She keeps the motion moving in her books and the tension tight when it needs to be. Superb as always. She does an excellent job of keeping all the characters straight in the book which makes it an easy read despite having a lot of characters.<br />I think there a tendency in people who read one author to begin to say, 'wait, she's not as funny as she used to be....' 'this isn't as good as the first one'. I think many times we are comparing our excitement at finding a new author who is excellent to now when we are again on the never ending quest for a new author and this one isn't new anymore. It's unfortunate for authors that this happens.<br />I can honestly say that Janet Evanovich novels have not grown old and Number 8 is as good as all the others before it. I have no reason to expect number 9, 10, and so on won't be just as great.<br />I thought this was just right in line with her other novels. It is not often you can laugh at lawyers, hot sex, blown up cars, and clothes dryers in one book.<br />I thought Ranger was as sexy as ever and the tension between them was oh so good. I thought the relationship between her and Morrelli was very interesting. I would have like more of Grandma. I just laugh and laugh at the Grandma. But Lula is a hoot as always, even in times of stress. I particularly like how she refers to other events in other novels and brings the reader up to speed at times about who a character is or how they came into her life. All of this and more keeps me anxious for book 9, 10 and so on.<br />The main story line this time, I think, held more of a realistic story to it- a woman trying to make ends meet, a yucky husband (ex now) and stretched a bit with the really scary bad guy. The whole story line is good.<br />Enjoy.
B00005YU1O|3.0|There is so much to love about this movie. First off, and foremost is the animation. It reminded me of the first time watching 'Akira', the way I would go &quot;ooohhh, ahhhh!...damn that's cool&quot; whenever I saw the tail-lights on cars trace and fade, or the layered sky lines of neo Tokyo moving along and shifting perfectly as if it was filmed in real life. The animators of Waking Life surpassed that. Watching Waking Life is like going to an art musuem and watching the paintings start to move. This is not a cartoon, boys and girls, this is art, and anything less would make me mark this movie down to zero stars because without the superb work of the animators, the way they captured and at times exagerated facial expressions and all the subtle body language involved in conversasion...this movie would not get across (with intrest) the idea's held there-in.<BR>This is not your Friday night flick, the kind that you relax and vegatate in front of after a hard week. Bring your pen and notebook, and replace that popcorn with a cup of coffee...you're going to need it. <BR>Now, I love this movie, but there's one reason why I can't give it five stars, that being the set up of this film. It is a long collection of short vignettes, mostly of a philosophical nature. While this may sound boring to most people, the strange thing is, while discussing this movie with others I have found out, nearly everyone has taken part in a similar conversation, whether it be about free will, the opression of Corporations, or maybe wondering about reincarnation, we have all wondered and talked about at least one subject in Waking Life. Maybe the creators of Waking Life are hoping that by identifing with one conversation, that you'll catch on to another idea. This truly is the movie for the thinking voyeur.
B00003CXCS|3.0|Although &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a cute movie, it isn't one of the best musicals. I enjoyed the story line and I love the songs(and Julie Andrews), but &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; just doesn't seem as great as some of the other musicals out their(which seems odd since it's based on a true story). I own the movie and every once in a while I'll watch it with the kids I babysit, but I still don't think it's an amazing movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|This girl is only 16? Amazing. I think it is a fantastic cd. This is the year for the young beautiful female singers and it's about time!
0767802470|5.0|A German U-boat crew sets sail with a journalist on board to disrupt Allied shipping lanes in the North Atlantic during WWII.  With the exception of a few brief sequences, the entire film is set on board the submarine.  This is an amazing technical achievement; the crew built an exact replica of a U-boat, without any removable walls, and developed a special camera that could be used in the cramped space.  As a result, the film takes on a clautrophobic feel that is exactly right for the subject.  Along with the sound design and, of course, the exemplary performances, director Wolfgang Petersen has constructed a film that does as much as any film can to make the viewers feel that they were in that place at that time.  The Director's Cut is much preferable to any version released previously./
0393317552|5.0|Diamond makes an argument that could turn biological arguments for racism and racial superiority on their respective heads. He explores proven causes of societal advancement, things as basic as the availability of nutrient rich foods and domesticable animals, and shows the impact they have on the development of any society.<br />Despite the moans of earlier reviewers who are still clinging desperately to the notion that less advanced societies are the result of less advanced minds, Diamond explains that there is another, more plausible argument - one that can not only explain differences between populations that are genetically identical, but which can explain the very rise of civilization itself from the humblest beginnings. <br />For example, even among different (closely related) Pacific islands there are marked differences in their advancement. Some developed kingdoms and others were still hunter-gatherers. Diamond shows effectively that their advancements correlate DIRECTLY to their access to resources, ie on islands with poorer food sources you see far smaller populations, and therefore simpler social structure and fewer innovations so people may live the same way for generations. Islands  with better food sources can support bigger populations with the same initial technologies as the other islands, then more stratified social classes emerge since everyone doesn't have to hunt or farm to eat.  Bigger populations need more social laws which need more complex governments to enforce them, and much more competition between individuals to stay on top which leads to more and better changes in all aspects of society.<br />All types of societies are descended from lowly hunter-gatherers at some point. If it were true that those less advanced societies bred low intellect, no society would ever have advanced in the first place. Those who still insist upon (and benefit from) the old ideas of racial superiority can never understand the weight of this book without challenging the very premise on which they stand. If you are open to an honest, thorough explanation of cause and effect in human diversification, this is your book.
B000002BQK|3.0|It's no accident that Mariah named this album \\"Butterfly.\\" On the heels of her separation from her boss and husband Tommy Mottola, Mariah chose the title as a metaphor for her \\"freedom\\" from a strained marriage and an allegedly controlling business relationship. But does the music live up to that premise? Sometimes. It's easily got some of her most relaxed, soulful material. \\"Honey,\\" produced by P.Diddy, is a solid hip hop number oozing with sexual energy. \\"Breakdown\\" makes good use of a sample from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, even if the title of this song would hint Mariah's fate years later. And \\"The Roof\\" passes along nicely as well. But while Carey seems willing to evolve to material with more muscle, she's apparently not quite ready to give up the thing that made her popular to begin with: ballads. And not simply ballads, but mushy, sweeping ballads. The title track weighs the album down considerably, though \\"My All\\" works well to a degree. Plus her cover of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" is questionable, at best. In short, \\"Butterfly\\" is only an intermittently good album. Carey needs to really spread her wings and cut loose if she wants to live up to the promise of her album's title.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is by far the best movie I have ever seen - so good in fact that I saw it 5 times at the theater. It is light-hearted and funny. The love story is sweet and inspirational. I highly recommend it.
B000002L9B|5.0|\\"Parade\\" is the soundtrack to Prince's catastrophic film \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" and is the follow-up to the criminally underappreciated \\"Around the World in a Day.\\" As with all of his albums of the 1980s, \\"Parade\\" is an amazing display of Prince's ample talents.  Unlike \\"Purple Rain,\\" which often dabbled in rock, \\"Parade\\" is a funk album all the way.  \\"New Position\\" and the irresistible \\"Girls and Boys\\" are just as infectious as they were in 1986, and the near-classic single \\"Kiss\\" is minimalism at its best, stripped down to just a synth, drum machine, and a dash of guitar.  Folks who were put off by the way-out-there \\"Around the World in a Day\\" gave this album a so-so reception, as mainstream audiences were looking for a repeat of \\"Purple Rain.\\"  But Prince was always two steps ahead of everyone else, resisting trends and refusing to ever repeat himself.  Although it may disappoint some after the highly energetic \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Parade,\\" as a stand-alone album, flirts with perfection and is one of Prince's very best records.
1577311523|3.0|As the adept of gentle art of detaching from the brain process normally labelled `the ego', you should probably be on the watch against is what appears to be a slightly narcissistic thread in this book.<br />The author obviously attempts to appear `transcendental' and self-forgetful. But as somebody who allegedly mastered `thinking without thinker,' or `being without thinking,' Eckhart Tolle enjoys surprisingly enthusiastically his role as the `spiritual teacher.' <br />Unfortunately the text does not offer anything especially new. The collage of `teachings' assembled in the book is easily found elsewhere, author's reliance on his own experience as the ultimate support system and frame of reference is almost religious.<br />Philosophical reflection on the text: it seems that merely transcending the time dimension does not turn out to be sufficiently strong move to help the author transcend the pattern of thinking in objects. <br />It seems that author's pattern exploits the following old thread: the mind is set as the `illusory' object disturbing the `unmanifested being,' at the price of forgetfulness that the game is played by god who forgot about his own identity and essence.  Hence the need for enlightenment.  <br />But as Arthur Deikman would say, the \\"I\\" is identical to awareness, which means that it should be differentiated from the various aspects of the physical person and its mental contents, which form the `self.' The dualistic experience given as primary in our consciousness is not a dualism of mind and matter, but that of the \\"I\\" and that which is observed. The identity of awareness and the \\"I\\" means that we know awareness by being it, thus solving the infinite regress of observers.  Once you have this experience, the NOW is also realised, but not only as related to the timeline, also to the other dimensions.<br />Maybe an intersting read for the beginner to break the inertia of the Western mind-set thinking.
0312265859|5.0|This story starts when sassy Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is asked by a neighbor to find her missing granddaughter, Evelyn, and her small daughter.  Missing persons is not strictly Stephanie's forte, but she figures what the heck, she'll give it a go.  And the usual Evanovich tour de force of mayhem, shadowy miscreants, binge-eating, attacking critters, and dead cars takes off from there.  The action is great, the plot is strong, and the laughs are divine.  Oh, and the romance!  The love triangle with Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger becomes even more tangled.  Without giving anything away, let me just say that those of you with Ranger fantasies, get ready to kick 'em up a notch.<br />Anyone who hasn't yet discovered the pleasure of the Stephanie Plum series, I highly recommend that you get thee to the bookseller and buy them all.  They are absolutely delightful.
B00005NW02|3.0|Now this band got mainstream because of this album. However, if you are the type of person that is still thinking about buying this album because you heard Chop Suey &amp; Toxicity and think that this album has more songs like that, then i suggest you dont buy it. Chop Suey &amp; Toxicity are the gems of this album, but from my point of view those are the only two that are worth listening to
0790734850|5.0|It has long been debated - \\"Can a film noir be made in color?\\" Many have tried and failed. This film does not. It has all of the classic elements that one looks for in a good ole gangster flick, as well as in a noir flick. This film is shocking in its talent and its craftsmanship. No complaints from me, from the score to the cinematography, from the direction to the casting, everything hits its mark, and brings you along for the ride.<br />One of the best DVDs yet released; this slick Warner Bros. disc has it all. There are three behind-the-scenes documentaries, including \\"The L.A. of L.A. Confidential\\" (an interactive map tour) and \\"Off the Record,\\" which offers cast and crew interviews. In addition, the disc has a mood-setting, music-only soundtrack; three TV spots; production notes; theatrical trailers; a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture; and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks in English and French. They really packed it in there. <br />This is the best film of the nineties. Titanic was just an overblown soap compared to this complex mystery/crime drama. The plot twists are jaw-dropping and require the film to be seen several times. The acting and direction are superb! Enjoy.
0441003257|4.0|This book was hilarious! I'm not going to go over the plot, because everyone else has already, but I will say I absolutely love the ending. I think that that alone is worth reading the book for.<br />If you like Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy, then you'll love this.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Deserving of the Oscar nods and rave reviews it received, \\"Almost Famous\\" not only reflects on a generation searching for itself through the excesses of sex, drugs and rock and roll, but expresses the human side of us that keeps us honest no matter our role in life. At times exciting, nostalgic, captivating and moving, Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of becoming a rock & roll journalist in a time when rock & roll was spreading its wings on new horizons finds itself appealing to many people on many levels. Its well-cast assembly of actors tell a wonderful story that hits the human side of \\"Behind the Music\\". A must see for any one who's ever been the number one fan of any band. <br />You would probably be better off with the other version... but none the less, this is a great movie!
B000066F6H|5.0|Those are the words of Howlin' Pelle Almqvist and, if all were right with the world, those words will someday be true.  After years of living in a music scene full of disposable pop, tired nu-metal and ridiculously sexist rap, the Hives are poised to destroy all that stand in their way to take their place as the world's best band.  The time seems right, The Strokes and The White Stripes have broken into the mainstream and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Vines are the buzz bands of the moment.  But what makes the Hives better than their contemporaries lies in their music and style.  They dress stylish without seeming too cool for the room (like the Strokes), they keep their music simple and true to form without reveling in purposely cheap production (The White Stripes), and are all too willing to become superstars without an ounce of staying true to \\"indie-cred\\" (like countless other bands that could be huge).  Rather than go crazy over this album, I'd rather say that Veni Vidi Vicious is a one-track, easy to figure album of infectious garage-punk that anyone could enjoy.  Even the \\"spoiler\\" track in the album \\"Find Another Girl\\" begins to make more sense as you repeat the album again and again.  And since this album is only 27 minutes long, you'll have plenty of time for that.  So to sum up:  BUY THIS ALBUM!  The Hives are the best band in the world and are frantically preparing to become your new favorite band - you have been warned.
B000066F6H|3.0|I think this is a Dont get me wrong this is a awesome cd. Buty there is one large problem. Most of the songs sound the same. Well thats not such a bad thing if you liek the songs but after you listen to them for awhile you kind of start to get bored with it. I really like some of the songs on this cd such as Die, Alright and Hate To Say I Told You So. Plus some of the others. Really thoguh you liek want a good punk album pick it up!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This a wonderful first album by a clearly talented new artist. There's some jazz, some country, some blues... all of it, high quality stuff.<BR>Most of the songs were written by either guitar player Jesse Harris or bassist Lee Alexander. There are also a couple of classics like Hoagy Carmichael and Ned Washington's &quot;The Nearness Of You&quot;. There are no bad songs, even though Norah's own have been underestimated by critics.<BR>Her piano playing is also very good. You can notice that especially (but not at all exclusively) on the last track.<BR>Norah Jones is great. In case you're wondering, she is also what Jane Monheit has been pretending to be: a young woman who is ready to deliver good music with indispensible maturity.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The long-awaited stereo version of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; sounds great. There are those who may wonder why this album is so respected. I will try to list some of the reasons, besides the obvious: can you think of any other album that sounds quite like it? (Exactly what style of music is this? It doesn't fit comfortably into any one category.) Anyway, let's think about what we're hearing here. The album's production is very rich, expertly combining a wide vartiety of instruments, and sometimes using some unorthodox ones such as bicycle bells and a theramin. Among the most striking of these instruments is the Beach Boys themselves, whose harmonies are as sweet as ever. The active bass lines on this album are also very creative in their melodic avoidance of the root note; there is nothing mundane about them. Brian Wilson has put together an incredibly rich sonic experience, and it is obvious to most listeners that he has done so with great conviction and deep emotion. And it works! When you reach the canon at the end of &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; the listener may feel some kind of physical lightening - lord knows I feel like I'm about to lift off the ground. In the end, that is the overall effect of this beautiful, often poignant, album.
0312265859|3.0|i hate to give this only 3 stars, but it was a big disappointment.  It seems that some series get better as the author delves deeper into personalities and plots, and some become shallower and more formulaic.  Hard Eight shows Evanovich starting down the latter path.  First of all, the book is very short and has big print -- to me always a clue that the author is taking it easy, riding on success.  I disagree with those who say it is \\"dark\\" or that the child element is at all explored.  The children seem incidental, and no one is really threatening them.  This doesn't seem very different to me.  Stephanie isn't growing and her character, and that of the other recurring characters, are not becoming more defined.  But who is Stephanie, really?  At this stage she should be more than sex and junk food.  If she doesn't get any better at her job, why is she doing it?  She is in danger of remaining a caricature rather than becoming a real person.
0679731725|5.0|Control n  1: power to direct or regulate  2: RESERVE, RESTRAINT  3: a device for regulating a mechanism. Exemplified in the narrative of K. Ishiguro's  lyrical novel \\"The Remains of the Day.\\"<br />Ishiguro achieves narrative restraint to a most remarkable degree in this lovely underrated novel. An excellent study of what can be done with 1st Person narrative, as well as what cannot, it is the retrospective tale told by head butler Stevens of Darlington Hall, who against all public opinion remains faithful to his employer, Lord Darlington. Stevens revisits the halcyon years before the start of WWII when his Lord Darlington organized English sympathy for Nazi Germany, secretly entertaining the likes of ambassador Ribbentrop at his estate. The title, from the realization its sangfroid narrator arrives at by the end of his career, proves apt as a controlling metaphor for the novel. It becomes for him a kind of epiphany that he should enjoy the remains of his own \\"day,\\" satisfied that he has done all he could.        <br />The character of Stevens isn't really all that unreliable as much as it is unsympathetic. Less unreliable than merely ingenuous. His reserve is expected of a great English majordomo and not to be mistaken for deliberate equivocation. Things are not always what they seem and our butler is never clearly complicit in the errors of his employer, nor does Stevens, who is no stranger to introspection and self-mediation, ever wish to entertain the question directly. His definition of dignity, a theme of some development late in the novel, encompasses a certain right of individual privacy, and based on one's post, limited public responsibility for matters well out of one's own hands. And we may well come to accept him by the story's end and are not really sure we see the need for the catharsis of a public confession from his character. We are more interested in how he makes amends for his private mistake, the way in which he tries to understand how utterly hefailed to see Miss Kenton's true feelings for him.<br />In Remains of the day, in Jamesian fashion, Ishiguro excels at taking an ordinary person and making him seem important, extraordinary, with a deliberate, yet readliy accessible prose style. Lovely too is his work for the way it operates so near history yet retains the salient marks of great fiction. A beautifully rendered contrast of public and private life.

B000002VMH|5.0|I didn't expect to like this CD as much as I do - I was never a fan of the Eurythmics, with the exception of a few songs. But the first time I heard Why? I was hooked.<br />This CD is a total departure from the sound of the Eurythmics. It has a stunning mix of ballads, pop, soul and jazz. The orchestration is second to none, and Lennox's vocals always meet or surpass the challenges presented in the songs. Her vocal range is incredible - it's as though she knows that her best instrument is that sultry, powerful, soulful, beautiful voice. I don't think there's a better, purer singer around today. The depth of emotion she expresses through her lyrics are such that every time you listen to the CD you get a different interpretation. I know that every time I hear it I find something I've missed the last time. This CD is definitely one I'd put on my &quot;Desert Island List&quot; and I consider it a necessity for any complete music collection.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is no regular comercial anime. This is a movie to enjoy, with animation to enjoy, with music to enjoy, with a story to enjoy. This is a tale about a quest for the truth, about facing our destiny, a story to find out that hate that cames from humans, animals and gods, could destroy life... and death.<BR>It could be enough to say that this movie got more money than Episode I in Japan. Is a long and slow story, filled with real truths, where you can feel the sights of the landscapes, where no one is completely evil or good. A journey through the Japanese mythology, with a great english track that captures the real sense of the traditions, keeping the story intact. This dvd features the literal translation, for those who would like to enjoy the original japanese wording. Great sound.<BR>There are just two additional features: a featurette that only shows some comments from the english dubbers, and a trailer. Anyway, just to watch the movie is worth the price.<BR>If you are looking for fast paced figths, or short skirted girls, don't buy it.
6305095566|5.0|To all of you out there that are critisizing this movie mabye you should think of one thing. the money that was put in this movie was incrediably small. for what this picture cost it was great. mixing comedy with horror. now i have not seen evil dead 2 yet but i have seen army of darkness and all in all i think this was a better film. AOD was to slapstick for me, some parts were quite funny(the three stooges skeleton hands) but other parts were just silly. here you didn't know wether to laugh or be scarred. this is what made this film great.
0312265859|5.0|I've been reading some of the other reviews of this book and was pretty put off-  seems to me there is a rumour going round that this new Stephanie Plum is 'dark' or something. I almost didn't pick it up as a result - lucky I did. It is just as bright and funny as ever and Stephanie is as sassy as always.<br />I can't understand where the 'dark' bit came in. Doesn't anyone remember Ramirez (twice?) that was an awful lot darker than this - not to mention Hannibal, Mitchel and Habib and co from Hot Six. Then there was Kenny Mancuso in Two for the Dough and of course the serial killer and friends in Three to Get Deadly. I'm not saying that this book is any more or less violent than the others - but Stephanie deals with it in the same inimitable Jersey Girl style - all big hair and loads of mascara.<br />In her latest adventure she has lost of a few of the characters I really enjoyed - Big Blue takes a bit of a break - only a couple of knocks to the fender despite Steph losing at least one vehicle (and her insurance) along the way. The question is why does anyone insure her anymore anyway. Then Joyce Barnhard is a no-show as is Terry Grizzoli. But then Morelli doesn't feature as strongly in this one either. Even Stiva's is only mentioned in passing (What are you doing to us Janet!)<br />On the plus side Ranger makes a pretty good fist of his increased profile in here. I know he is a man of few words and I don't generally support his side of things but I really did get to like him quite a bit in this book - he becomes more than just a man of mystery. Stephanies sister Valerie is also a big show in this book and proves to be quite a good foil for Steph as well as playing a critical role. Funnily enough it is Steph's mother who saves the day.<br />OK - so enough for die hard fans - the plot - (which has probably been picked apart in enough reviews already - but here for posterity) Stephanie is asked by her mother and grandmother to look into the disappearance of their neighbours grand-daughter (Evelyn Soder ) and great-grand-daughter (Annie). This is no take-down for bail bonds - this is private and personal. She is warned off by the ex husband and also one of Evanovich's less than likeable gangster figures Eddie Abruzzi. He was, apparently, the boss of that psycopath boxer (from One and Three) Ramirez and they share the same sense of fun over sadism. Stephanie has to try to figure out what the heck made Annie and Evelyn flee if she is going to find them - and at the same time it seems they may need protection.<br />Meantime Stephanie is trying to make some money from picking up bail-jumpers and as usual not having much luck. Just count the number of cuffs she loses in this one. Also there are the requisite number of exploding cars and people making themselves at home in her apartment.<br />I don't think the ending was sudden - it really did twist around into a satisfying tale to try to untangle - its just it was a bit unsatisfying when it got there. As was the resolution of her relationship with Ranger in here. It was just not quite right (well for me). Also I got the sense that there was supposed to be more but it was cut out. For instance the stripper in Seven Up turns up again here opening a book shop next to Vinnie - but that is as far as it goes - shouldn't there have been more?<br />Also the social life which generally plays so much of a part in Stephanies life just didn't come about. Where were the weddings? - the viewings at Stiva's? Maybe Evanovich feels like they have been overdone. I just loved them.<br />Finally, I don't know about the rest of you but I am definitely starting a movement for 'Bring Back Big Blue\\" - Stephanie had a Ducati last time and snuck around in cute black cars mostly this time - but Big Blue is her spiritual home - its time Valerie got her own car and gave Blue back to Stephanie.
6305433909|5.0|I've seen it so many times I could almost play each part.  In fact, it comes on this afternoon on Showtime.  It's a continuing story of Delores Van Cartier aka Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) who uses her gifts of music and determination to keep a school open as well as change the lives of all those her life touches.  Great music, great humor and drama.  Lauren Hill (pre-Fugees) is in this as well as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Monica Calhoun if you look really, really carefully.  Buy it, enjoy it.<BR>Hey, maybe you'll catch it on Showtime during one of it's airings.  I'm positive when it's over, when you can finally stop yourself from humming one of the great tunes, and possibly put down your tissue (I cry EVERY TIME I see it)( and baby, I've seen seen it so many times that I've got ot turn it off when my husband comes home because he says  \\"Are you watching that again?) You will say \\"I wish I had that movie!\\"  So get it so you'll have no regrets!
B00005UW7V|5.0|I thought this movie was brilliant. Haley Joel Osment just amazed me with his performance. He's got to be the best child actor of all time. There's no doubt he'll be winning Oscar after Oscar when he's older. I think the story of A.I. is the best I've seen in a long time. This movie is completely unpredictable. One sad note is their portrayal of New York City over 2000 years from now. The World Trade Center is still standing. Sadly that wont be the case 2000 years from now.
0671578855|5.0|This review contains a minor spoiler for the previous book in the Miles series, \\"Komarr.\\"<br />\\"Dear me.  I think I'm beginning to like this Ekaterin.  And I haven't even finished being properly introduced to her yet.  `I'd like you to meet...she's getting away!' seemed a little...truncated.\\"  Cordelia Vorkosigan<br />This book has everything you could want.  It has romantic tangles, political intrigue, a little bit of action, and some of the most wonderful characters that I've ever read about.  Anybody who's been following my reviews knows that I think Miles is one of the best characters in science fiction today.  He approaches most things in a military point of view, including his love life.  He hatches tactical plans, strategic withdrawals and schemes in order to win Ekaterin.  Unfortunately for him, these tend to blow up in your face when they're applied to the dating game.  The plan culminates in a dinner party of huge comedic proportions.  First, Mark's business plan ends up interfering in it, then a misplaced word here and there creates chaos.  I was literally laughing out loud for four straight pages.<br />The other plots are winners too.  Bujold effortlessly weaves her tale among five narrators.  This is the first time she's done that, as she usually just uses one.  It's nice to get other people's viewpoints finally, especially the outsider's view of Miles.  This is the first book where we've seen Ivan's point of view, and it's a classic.  In previous books, we've only seen Miles and his exasperation at Ivan's antics.  This time, we see it from the inside, and his view of Miles is just great.  Ivan's always getting trapped in Miles' schemes, and it's great fun watching him try to avoid it, only to get trapped in his own.<br />The best character in the book, though, is Cordelia.  Miles' mother has always been wonderful (so wonderful that Bujold went back and told the story of how she and Aral Vorkosigan met and fell in love).  She is smart, sarcastic, always able to hit the problem on the head.  She looks on knowingly, but she never butts in until she's either asked, or she realizes she has to. Personally, I think she's the best character Bujold has created, and I always want to see more of her.<br />Don't worry if you're turned off by mushy romance dialogue and situations.  Bujold handles them all so they don't become sickeningly sweet or cloying.  Believe me, I don't really care for romances that much, but I would read anything on the subject by Bujold.  She has a way of making it palatable.  Instead, you get to revel in the fun of watching these events unfold, watching all of the mistakes get made, and wondering if the situations are going to turn out for the best.  She's not afraid to take her characters in different directions, unlike most series writers.  I won't say whether or not things turn out all right in the end, but the good thing about Bujold is that you don't know.<br />This is definitely not a book you want to start with in the Vorkosigan series, though.  While it is perfectly understandable without reading anything else, you will miss out on a lot.  At the very least, read the previous book, Komarr.  That book is where Miles first meets Ekaterin.  If you do read this book first and get entranced with the characters, read the rest of the series and then read this one again.  But, that being said, this is definitely a book you want to read if you like to be entertained.able to hit the problem on the head.

B00005JKQZ|3.0|This is probably going to be the strangest write up I've done. I wasn't sure what to rate the movie because I didn't care for it. While I can acknowledge the talent of the director and the actors involved (all of which deserved the awards they have recieved for this film) that doesn't make it something I would ever want to watch again and I was never once moved emotionally by this film the way I was Titanic or Forrest Gump. <br />I still must give A Beautiful Mind high marks for being an original movie, with excellent acting and directing, but at the same time I wonder why the movie was made. The script content is average at best, focusing on a portion of John Nash's life and his single contribution to Science and Economics. Nash is an awkward person, often rude and unfriendly (I could never connect with his character), though the film his condition never changes, he just learns how to deal with it.<br />The film fails to go into any great detail about what makes John Nash's publication signifigant enough to recieve a Nobel prize. I'm really left not knowing much of anything about Nash's contribution at the end, and that's a shame.
6304539258|4.0|Well, low and behold I found a mistake that ILM and Lucas Arts made that didn't have to be made in the first place. When Han confronts Greedo in the Catina, everything is going fine up until the part where Han says &quot;Yes, I'll bet you have.&quot; In the original, you can hear Han saying the whole sentence. In the special edition, for reasons I can't understand they somehow cut out Han say &quot;Yes&quot; at the beginning of the sentence which I thought wasn't neccessary to do so. Now, it may not annoy you but it does annoy me. Also, when Han confronts Jabba after that, Han tells Jabba he's a wonderful human being. Now we all know Jabba is not a human being. I think they could've changed that somehow and those are the reasons why I give it four stars instead of five.
B000002PB2|4.0|Recorded and released without all the hype and expectations of their later albums allowed Night Ranger to do on Dawn Patrol what it did best--record rocking anthems that shredded while staying true to its melodic roots.  On Dawn Patrol, the Night Ranger formula of dueling guitars, in-your-face keyboards, thundering drums, and good songwriting melded into a rocking album from start to finish (notably, with no ballads).  Though some of their most classic songs would came later, Dawn Patrol is Night Ranger's best album overall.
0312265859|5.0|A great read. All the wonderful story elements we have come to enjoy--quirky, lovable characters; crazy antics; and snappy, funny dialog. A little darker than recent books, but it provides for the major characters to show more depth. Loved Joe's maturity in this book. How and who dispatches the nasty villain at book's end is a bit of a shocker, as is how the other characters react. Wonder where Steph, Joe, and Ranger go next? Janet really puts the pressure on herself for \\"Nine.\\"
B00005YTFG|5.0|I reluctantly agreed to see this movie with a friend last summer when it came out in theatres. I didn't think I'd really like this kind of film; but much to my surprise, I really enjoyed it! Set in the rough side of Paris around the turn of the century, Moulin Rouge! is about a penniless yet charming writer portrayed by Ewan McGregor who falls for the beautiful courtisan, played by Nicole Kidman, of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. <br />Kidman and McGregor sparkle on screen; there is definite chemistry between them. Their romance is threatened by a rich Duke who desires but does not love Kidman's character, Setine. When the Duke learns that Setine loves McGregor's character, he becomes insanely jealous. What follows is a wildy colorful and entertaining story that leaves you laughing. What really makes it funny are the songs in this film: they're from the 70's and 80's. Kidman and McGregor have pretty good voices and pull it off well. <br />The supporting cast is marvelous and their characters come alive. The singing, the dancing, and the acting electrically explode on screen. The costumes, make-up, props, and the artwork and design make a spectacular film worth seeing. I highly recommend it!
0312265859|5.0|I just finished Hard Eight.  I loved it.  Not much of a mystery here, but it was very exciting.  I laughed out loud through the entire book.  The ending of the three main plot lines were all kind of quick and almost a let down, but getting there is more than half the fun with Evanovich.  If you are looking for an enjoyable read then look no further.  I agree with other reviewers that you shouldn't start the series here.  Start with book one.  If you are a returning fan, I think you will enjoy yourself with this one.  It is really great to see Steph's family getting involved a little.  Mom was great.  Maybe we'll see some more.  >Mike
B00005OAIE|5.0|I think Mr.Wright was a tad bit harsh when it comes to John Mayer and his talented music and lyrics.  Mayer's music could be played at anytime of the day, whenever the mood takes you.  Be it at a coffee shop (I heard it at Starbucks ... it was great!), at your home when you are mellowing out or tidying up or even a subway ride to and from work, his music reflects life, love and memories of childhood days.  The playing of the accoustic guitar were in great harmony with Mayer's voice, which is by the way exceptional and very romantic.  My favorite song is \\"City Love\\" then \\"St. Patrick's day\\", \\"No such thing\\" , \\"My stupid mouth\\" It's great to hear music that does not illustrate rampant sexual acts, booty calls, and other tiring stuff I am starting to hear from some other artists like that. His music does not have the \\"usual\\" music themes and beat as most of the artists do now (copied/borrowed syles I am thinking.) <br />Mayer's music is one of originality.  I can't wait until his next album is out....
B00006690G|5.0|I bought this album being a big fan of Eminem and especially his last record, the Marshall Mathers LP.  I loved that and figured no other Eminem CD could top it. Man am I glad I was worng.  The Eminem Show is a fantastic album.  The words just totally fit together.  Lots of new sounds from Em on this one too.  I find myself listening to a new song each day saying,\\"Oh, now that's the best one.\\"  It's great and if you are offended by the things that you've heard him say in the past... don't worry because this one isn't that offensive.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Okay, first of all, this movie is a movie based on a video game. These types of movies tend to not do well, as exampled by Mario Brothers and Final Fantasy. The director usually tries to follow the game too closely, which makes for a scattered plot and a lot of fighting(Mortal Kombat:Annihilation), a movie where no one has any idea what the story is about(Final Fantasy), or a movie that's cheesy in every reguard(Mario Brothers).<BR>Paul Anderson does an exellent job making this movie appeal to the general public while still keeping it tied to some of the plot of the video game. He starts the movie off fast paced and keeps it going throught the entire movie, all the while managing to tell us the plot before killing off that character as needed. For the premise he was given, Anderson did a good job at making the idea able to be mass marketed while still keeping some elements that would appeal to the fans. It is a great movie for what it is.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. I swear, it is better than the musical. Despite the fact that it was shot in a studio, it looks so realistic. Rick Moranis is (surprisingly) a great singer. The Audrey II is amazing. Even though it's a puppet, I think that it would look the same way as a computer generated character. My only anger about this DVD is the fact that there's no deleted scenes. For some dumb reason, there's no alternate ending. What was up with that dream sequence that they shot and never used. There's only a shot of that moment in the Gag Reel. The closest we'll get to the alternate ending is a shot of the \\"Audrey's Death\\" scene, a shot of the plant eating Seymour as Seymour yells, \\"The sequel. What about the sequel?\\", a shot of two Audrey II's destroying very phony looking models of buildings, and a shot of the girls standing in front of a glittering American flag. All these shots are on the gag reel. Despite the lack of the complete alternate ending, this ending is better. I thought that the Audrey II's last words were not exactly dramatic. Ellen Greene is the ultimate Audrey. I was relieved to know that the voice she uses in the movie isn't real. They could have kept Mushnik and Son but dubbed Mushnik's voice. Steve Martin is a great singer. Jim Belushi was in great shape back in the 80s. If you watch According to Jim, look at him now. Buy this DVD and you will thank me. You'll be in for a lot of laughs.
B00005RIZP|4.0|Before there was Friday the 13th, before there was Halloween, there was Black Christmas. This movie kind of layed out the groundwork or blueprint so to speak of those future horror movies.<br />The movie takes place in a sorority house, A killer has secretly entered the house and stays in the attick. The girls begin getting obscene phonecalls, these phonecalls are the freakiest part of the movie if you ask me, these calls are especially eerie and frightening. The girls then begin disappearing one by one. They go to the police about the missing girls and the obscene phonecalls. When the police are able to trace the calls they find out that the calls are coming from inside the house. Even though we never get to see the killer (except for his eyes) it's very obvious who the killer is. Or is it???????? <br />This movie was very entertaining and suspensful. I liked the affect of the howling wind and the slamming of the piano keys in the backround. It greatly adds to the eerieness of the film. Also you can definitely see the difference between this movie (made in 1974) and a typical 80's slasher film. No T & A and not much gore but it takes nothing away from the movie at all. Make sure you see Black Christmas, it's well worth a look.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Yesterday, for no particular reason, I decided to listen to Make Yourself.  I hadn't listened to it in a while and I felt amazed when I heard it again.  Most \\"nu-metal\\" culls together the worst aspects of rap and rock: the rap image and rock aggression.  Incubus, on the other hand, assembled a distinctly rock sound together with an often rap drum beat but these beats maintain a rock dynamic.  The lyrics are often \\"rapped\\" but they are rock lyrics, often well written rock lyrics too.  The one snag, the lyrics were sometimes angry, which along with being incredibly cliche right now, obfuscates the point of rock music: fun.  However, there were some glimmers of hope, \\"Drive\\" was an optimistic ballad and \\"Stellar\\" is perhaps a nebulous love song.  So there Incubus left us, on the cusp of greatness.  All they needed to do was maintain this attitude and introduce some Zeppelinesque sexuality into their music to make it fun and they'd be the next rock legends.  This new album, however, failed to do this.  Instead of doing what the greats would have done, going against the grain and attempt an album nobody else was doing, they added sugar to their previous album and produced Morning View.  Songs often seemed to vague, like they were trying to grasp something but they didn't know what that was.  It sounded like they were trying to duplicate Make Yourself hits without sounding like those songs.  The album sounds fractured and with only two solid pop songs, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Warning\\", and numerous experimentals that fail to produce anything unique.  We are left to wonder if they will realize that music is missing sexuality and fun and that they are one of the few bands talented enough to break through and produce this type of music and become the next group of legends.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is the best I've ever seen. Russell Crowe did the most amazing job playing John Nash, I believe he should have gotten an Academy Award for his performance. This movie makes you feel one way in the beginning and then throws you for a complete loop mid-way through it. After I watched it I just had to talk to somebody about it, you will have to because it effects you so much. I don't think this is a movie for really young viewers because they wouldn't understand a lot of what is going on. After I watched the movie I knew that was going to win Best Picture, how could it not? Russell Crowe should have gotten an Academy Award for his breathtaking performance, (Plus he looked really good in this movie for all the ladies out there) Everytime I see a movie Russell's in I leave the movie feeling totally in awe of this man's incredible acting ability. Unfortunetly some people think he's a jerk and a Hollywood playboy, but who cares? THE MAN CAN ACT!!!!! Jennifer Connelly did a wonderful job as well and she totally deserved all the hype she got for her performance. And whoever didn't like this movie, they obviously didn't see the same movie I did.
B00005JKG7|5.0|What can I say about \\"The Fog\\" that hasn't already been said except that it's about time one of my favorite Carpenter films (besides The Thing) is coming out on DVD with a load of extras as well.  I love the way that Carpenter throughout the film (except for a brief second almost at the end of the film)never shows you the faces of the \\"ghost Creatures\\" but insteads lets the music, atmosphere and foggy effects leave it to your imagination.  If you love horror films, then rush out and buy this DVD.  Now if only a company will bring out the original \\"King Kong\\" on DVD with a load of extras will make my horror DVD library complete.  Woo Hoo
B00000ILDE|5.0|i've seen many \\"alien\\" moviez but these four are best. absolutely wonderful creature design and visual effects still can embarass any modern movie. Weaver played her best in this movie. Paxton takes 2nd place with his character. unbelievable story. This movie combines horror and action. <br />some good news: <BR>ALIENS-5 (not soon but coming) are under Cameron's dirrection.<BR>Hope those alien dudes wont be replaced by fake computer graphics
0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones has several key elements of a great novel, but the inherent design of the series keeps it from becoming a classic.  The series as a whole seems to be designed like a single book, and so A Game of Thrones merely introduces the characters and begins to move them into their roles.  I've read the first three books and I must say that they do get better as the series progresses into the meat of the story.<br />Several notable aspects of this book raise it above the majority of epic fantasy out there.  The book is genuinely unpredictable in major events, leading to real exitement later in the story (as many other stories either shy away from bad things or consistantly do bad things to their characters, leaving the reader with a good idea of what the outcome of the tense instances will be).  Besides that, the main characters are varied and interesting.  Some characters aren't clear cut good or evil, and sometimes enemies aren't necessarily bad and friends not necessarily good.<br />However, the novel is very long, especially viewed as the introduction to the series, and may bore readers who do not have exceptional patience or who do not read exceptionally fast.  Although, this is a promblem common in epic fantasy.  But, I suggest readers bear through any low points in the story because the later books are worth the wait.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I am a GP doctor &amp; i rememer when i studied psychiatry reading alot info about schizophrenic patients &amp; how they suffer from delusions &amp; hallucinations that cannot be imagined by normal people &amp; even doctors who treat these poor people ... this movie showed me for the first time in my life what kind of suffering such patients have ... the extraordinary performance by Russel Crow showed me exactly the delusions &amp; how they resemble the truth which is exactly written in medical books. <br />This movie is a shock &amp; it's a pity that Russel Crow lost the oscar for his genius performance ... i highly recommend this movie for anyone who want to see for real how the poor sick patients with schizophrenia suffer the psychotic symptoms ... I did't know about Professor Nash before ... but i know now ... I know the story of a great man who struggled aganist his sickness to reach the highest prize that any man can imagine ... The Nobel prize.<br />This movie is a MUST see ... usually i buy only DVD movies that i think from my point of view they are classics ... this movie is part of my collection now ... &amp; as a collector i say :&quot; This movie should be in the library of any movie collector, with movies like The Godfather, Indiana Jones Trilogy ... ect &quot;
B00003CXAT|5.0|What more can be said about Jurassic Park than has already hasn't been said? The movie was phenomenal. When I saw it in the theatre, I was amazed at how real the dinosaurs were. They were real looking and life-like and right in front of me on the screen.<br />The energy of the film was adventurous and who can forget Jeff Goldblums best line \\"at least when the ride breaks down the Prates don't eat the guests...\\". Sam Neil and Laura Dern were superbly cast in this film. The kids were charming and right on the money with their reactions.<br />Visually the film is eye candy. The mechanical effects of the creatures and the digital effects of some of the long shots made my mouth drop. The story is again simple but the plot is very obvious. Even Sir Richard Attenburough gives a stellar performance.<br />The DVD is filled with behind the scenes footage of the film and its production. The interviews with Spielberg, the cast and crew are very interesting. The mechanical items and the CGI (Computer Generated Images) and their renderings are incredible.<br />The DVD is a great package to get - the movie alone is worth watched and all the extras are just icing on the cake. Gotta love it!
B000066NW0|5.0|avril lavigne is the best thing to hit punk music in a long time. As soon as the cd came out all my friends were running to the store and i had never heard of her. So i ran to the store bought a copy and listened. i havent put it down since. Its catchy songs(such as &quot;losing my grip&quot; and &quot;sk8ter boi&quot;) topped of with a sweet ballad(&quot;im with you&quot;)makes this cd a must have for everyone. even if punks not your think. you love it. avril lavign deffinately put a new spin on punk and deffinately has the new title as the princess of punk! rawk on!
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters is one of those films you walk out of the theatre catching your breadth. When I saw this in the theatre I was amazed at how funny this movie was and how creative it was.<br />Imagine a team of intelligent troublemakers trying to make a living. Parapsychology. Wow. They want to chase ghosts and catch them. The subplot is that New York City is the host of all the ghost (ghouls and goblins too) in the afterlife that are merging to conquer the world.<br />The performances are standout. Sigorney Weaver and Rick Moranis both steel scenes in their own way. Harold Ramus (also co wrote with Dan Akryod) gave a very down-to-earth performance as the goodie-two-shoes.<br />Technically the film is wonderful and the effects extremely creepy and gooey! The DVD has a lot of extras, but my favorite is the commentary. They talk about how hard and how much fun it was to make.<br />This is a great comedy in anyone's DVD collection.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I don't understand all the backlash against &quot;Gosford Park&quot;.  A frequently hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, always insightful dramedy, it features a superb ensemble cast and the steady direction of Robert Altman.  This solid film deserved every one of its Academy Award nominations, and maybe even a few more acting ones.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good acting and the work of one of the best directors of our time.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Independence Day was a film made by the same filmmakers of the films Godzilla and Stargate and stands on its own as a science fiction modern day classic. Dean Devlin and Roland Emerich have made a few Sci-Fi adventures but this one is my favorite.<br />With a star studded cast and some great character roles, Will Smith, Bill Pulman, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Firestein, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsh, Harry Connick Jr., Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, Vivica A. Fox and Brent Spinner, all shinned.<br />The effects were really outstanding and the destruction of the White House became the signature add campaign for the movie. The aliens were creepy and cool. The space ships were strange but believable. The score was even memorable.<br />Overall it is a fun film to watch and enjoy. The DVD extras include a very clever menu system and many behind the scenes looks at aliens, make-up, special effects and production. You should find the extras just as interesting as the feature itself.
6305971935|3.0|This movie was ok.  I don't know what else to say.  It was entertaining, but not fantastic.  It didn't leave me wanting to see it again, but it wasn't boring or poorly done.  It was just ok.
B000062TU1|5.0|A lot of the gripes I heard about this DVD was about the extra features,in a word who cares about the extra features.I buy DVD format for the durability and the movie within...And what a movie it is.Harry Potter finally comes home.AS a huge fan of the books I enjoyed seeing it brought to life.I think it was very faithful to the books(kudos to Ms Rowling).The young actors fell into their roles and the adults pulled off seamless performances(especially Robbie Coltraine as Hagrid)I cant say enough about this movie,to me its like the Wizard of Oz for the new millenium.
B000063DHK|5.0|This is, without a doubt, Iron Maiden at their peak.  The recording is great and the song selection is excellent, too, although the setlist is heavy with tracks from Maiden's three albums prior to this one (Number of the Beast, Piece Of Mind, and Powerslave) and pretty light on the ones before that (only 3 songs from the debut album and one from Killers).  Still, the performances are awesome, and its cool to hear songs that they probably haven't performed live in years, like Revelations, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Powerslave.  Anyone who has the original Capital Records version of this disc and is still a fan of it is best replacing that version with this, since that version contains only the first disc of this 2 disc set, so you're missing out on more great tunes like Phantom of the Opera and Wrathchild (which were on the original vinyl and cassette versions of Live After Death; I can't imagine why Capital left them off the CD).  Iron Maiden was never better than this.  The next couple of releases that followed were pretty good, but the band started to slide once guitarist Adrian Smith left, and they really fell off once vocalist Bruce Dickinson departed.  The line up changes, combined with changing tastes and styles in the metal community really left the band hurting.  Still, you can't disregard the quality of this album.  A must for any Maiden fan and any fan of early eighties metal before thrash and glam took over and split up the scene.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Bought this one on the recommendation of a couple of friends.  The comparisons used were intriguing: Dave Matthews, et. al.  Popped the disc in, though, and was the most disappointed I have ever been with a cd.  The music was cheesy and overorchestrated and the lyrics were even worse.  It's like someone took the journal from that moody girl in the back of your high school English class and went to town with a thesaurus.  Come on guys.  If you can honestly tell me that \\"I want to run through the halls of my high school/I want to scream at the top of my lungs\\" is a good lyric (or even remotely similar to anything that deserves a record contract), I will die of shock.  Oh, and stop with the Dave Matthews comparison.  He sounds more like Michael Bolton on a bad day.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Well, I`ve never read the novel by H.G. Wells himself, but I`ve heard lots about it, and as the great grandson of H.G. Wells had directed it, I had expected it to be a little longer and deeper in dialogues. The film only runs for 96 minutes, which I think is way too short for a good movie like this. You never really comes into the world of the film before it ends. <BR>I could say that the first 40 minutes of the movie is as good as possible, but in the latter half, it all passes too quickly!<BR>The movie is about a technician named Alex Hartdegen, whose beloved is killed in an accident, and then he spends years building a time machine to change the past. But (of course, it`s a science movie),something goes wrong and he is thrown 800,000 yers into the future where mankind is divided in two races, which are simply : the hunters and the hunted. <BR>The special effects are very fine, but the story is smoothing out towards the climatic ending of the film. The acting is also rather good (may be except for the pop star Samantha Mumba, who makes her acting debut here)but the movie should have been longer. <BR>Worth to notice is also the excellent music by Klaus Badelt - I can listen to the soundtrack a million times over and never get tired!Well, this film is not bad. It`s just that I had even higher expectations on it....but I will buy the DVD, as it is a film worth owning.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Before I bought this movie, I had never read a Harry Potter book. In fact, I really had no idea who he was (except for the bits of information from my brother). I read several reviews, and decided I would go ahead and buy the DVD when it first came out. I have not regretted my decision since.<br />Prepare to be amazed as Harry Potter, a not-so-ordinary boy becomes an extraordinary wizard. The plot line is interesting, and the movie more than adequately explains the story to those of us who were not previous addicts. A new viewer will easily be able to catch on quickly. This movie has everything from fantasy to sci-fi to sports action to science. A truly great movie that everyone can enjoy.<br />The DVD is well worth the money to purchase, as much for the special features as for the movie. The makers of this DVD have gone the extra mile to bring you a tour of the magical Hogwarts, so that after the movie you can do a little bit of exploring on your own. This feature had me hooked for hours. There are numerous others, so prepare to spend an evening with this DVD.<br />The movie is great for those with children, because it is very clean compared to other movies. If you have young children, however, please remember that this is a PG film so you may want to view it once before you purchase.<br />If you're not into the magical realm of movies, then I recommend that you rent this one before you buy. If you like a good movie that is interesting and entertaining for all ages, and will keep your interest throughout this is the movie to buy. The special features of this DVD are the icing on the cake.

B00003CXQY|4.0|The Emperor's New Groove is a very interesting movie. Viewers will have a comical experience, typical of Disney movies. The animation of this movie is also excellent, showing details that really make the movie shine. The music is wonderful, contributing to an overall outstanding movie.<br />This movie is fun for all ages, clean for a child safe movie and comical enough for the adults. Join the arrogant Kuzco as he learns a lesson in hospitality, he won't soon forget. Prepare to meet Pacho, the villager who unwittingly will teach him that lesson, and a score of other interesting characters. This movie had my interest from start to finish.<br />The Ultimate Groove has special features like you wouldn't believe. Did you ever wonder how a Disney movie was made, or what goes on behind the scenes? Prepare to have these questions and more answered as Director and Producer take you behind the scene, on your choice of tours. Play a game, and help Kuzco get to the castle, but beware. Danger lurks right behind you.<br />This game was fun, but not that fun. I would not spend too much time on it. Overall, I vote for the Ultimate Groove for the backstage tours and commentary. If this does not sound like your interest, the normal version is an absolute must.

068485743X|5.0|Readers and editors are over burdened with books, book deals, writers, publicity, and other aspects of their daily routine.  They are expected to read manuscripts at home, so it is no wonder that to get through a large slush pile editors use the precedent: find reasons to reject manuscripts in order to go on to the next one.<br /><br />This book does not teach 'how to write,' but how to avoid the mistakes that send your manuscript to the recycle bin.  That is the craft of writing.<br /><br />To be successful, you have to capture your audience in the first five pages.  Noah Lukeman, a prestigious editor turned agent knows the secrets of successful writing.  In reality, you must capture your reader in the first five words, sentences, or paragraphs with a strong hook and the good writing.<br /><br />Lukeman arranged the chapters in The First Five Pages to show each process in rejecting manuscripts.  Follow the steps, and if you are lucky, you might get a contract.  Do not follow the steps, and the only reason your manuscript will reach the one person who can make a difference is through a fluke.<br /><br />Each chapter concludes with write and rewrite examples and practices.  The Lukeman way is included at the back of the book.  The only way to become a better writer is to write.  The following is only a brief synopsis of a few chapters.<br /><br />Presentation: The number one reason aspiring writers get rejections is that the work is inappropriate for the market.  Simply put: do not send a bodice-ripper, swashbuckling tale to someone representing coffee table books.  Other problems are spelling errors, sloppiness, faded text, and dirty paper; they all indicate carelessness that is generally reflected throughout the book.  Research your market, and prepare your manuscript according to the instructions given by the agent, editor, or publisher.  If they want Ariel font, give it to them.<br /><br />Adjectives and Adverbs: The next step to rejection is the overuse or misuse of modifiers.  These words tell rather than show your noun.  \\"If a day is described as 'hot, dry, bright and dusty,'\\" these words are tedious and the image becomes significantly unimportant.  Overuse is very easy to spot by a cursory glance.<br /><br />Sound: If your manuscript has reached this level, it is being read.  Pacing, rhythm, meter, or beat is about the way your prose reveals the story.  \\"Prose can be technically correct, but rhythmically unpleasant.\\"  Read your work aloud; if it does not sound right to you, pay attention.<br /><br />Comparison: Analogy, simile, and metaphor can be overdone.  I read about 1/3 of a book recommended to me as an excellent thriller.  The plot, characters, dialogue, details, and descriptions were good.  I could not read the book because everything is not like something else, and every paragraph or three included a simile.<br /><br />Style: If the writing feels forced or exaggerated, or the writer began to showcase his words rather than the story, the probability of rejection is high.  Another nit for me is redundancy; this is a matter of using the same or similar word in close proximity.  It is also a reason for rejection.<br /><br />I recommend two books to my clients or fledgling writers.  This is one of them. THe other is Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself into Print, by Renni Browne.<br /><br />Victoria Tarraniun.  \\"If a day is described as 'hot, dry, bright and dusty,'\\" these words are tedious and the image becomes significantly unimportant.

B00001OH7O|5.0|Before the arrival of the Thin White Duke or Ziggy Stardust, there was Bowie, just before the Spiders were about to take England and the world by storm.  Hunky Dory came out the year before and to me, was the best album he put out in the 1970's.<br />\\"Changes\\" is classic Bowie from opening note to the closing saxophone, done by Bowie himself.  It's a hand-up to the younger generation who have problems from the old fogies who look down on them with contempt and pity.<br />I'm also partial to the sauntering piano and vocal of \\"Oh! You Pretty Things.\\" which comes alive with Mick Woodmansey's drums mid-song.  The mellowness continues with \\"Eight Line Poem.\\"<br />\\"Life On Mars?\\" is one of the biggest justifications for Bowie's existence.  Well, that and \\"Space Oddity.\\"  Oh then there's \\"Time Will Crawl\\" and then, ... well, the symphonic wall and piano surrounding the chorus that break in beginning with \\"Sailors fighting in the dance hall...\\"  The line about \\"the Lawmen beating up the wrong guy\\" brings to mind Rodney King.<br />It would've been interesting to have the kind of parents on the light-hearted \\"Kooks.\\"  A click or so away from conventionality, it seems.  Classic line:  \\"And if the homework brings you down/Then we'll throw it on the fire.\\"  Equally light is \\"Fill Your Heart\\" a quick jazz-swingy number of freeing one's heart with love and forgetting one's mind.  Apart from Sgt Peppers, the people of Pepperland might accept this song heartily.<br />The reflective \\"Quicksand\\" is the opposite and presents a gloomy, dark vision, having the guitar of \\"Space Oddity.\\"  The piano and strings come into play effectively as in \\"Life On Mars?\\" especially when juxtaposed with the apocalyptic \\"Don't believe in yourself/Don't deceive with belief/Knowledge comes with death's release.\\"<br />Sound bites:  The acoustic guitar is really strong on rhythm in \\"Andy Warhol\\"  With Mick Ronson's snarling glam-rock guitar, \\"Queen B-tch\\" can be considered the first volley by the Spiders.  Compare this to \\"Suffragette City.\\"  And finally, \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" is exactly what it sounds like, a nod to one of if not America's greatest songwriter and storyteller.<br />To say that his recent album 'hours' was close to this misses the mark, although there are overtones.  Alternately upbeat and melancholy, with not too many traces of the Spiders invasion that would suddenly come the following year.ompare this to \\"Suffragette City.\\"  And finally, \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" is exactly what it sounds like, a nod to one of if not America's greatest songwriter and storyteller.<br />To say that his recent album 'hours' was close to this misses the mark, although there are overtones.

B000060MY6|1.0|Okay, okay, we get the point. LA can be a place of torment and rude awakenings, shattered hopes, strife, and malice. WHO CARES!!! Any film that requires a third or fourth viewing needs some serious help. I've watched it once, that's right - ONCE, and I hated all of it. From the beginning when the car wreck happened, I was left scratching my head and asking, \\"WHAT'S THE POINT?\\" I know, you intellects out there know the point and so do I. Tell me, did you actually enjoy watching this film or do you just keep it in your collection to impress your fellow film critics? This film was hard to take and it messed with my mind it a terrible way. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! Scratch that, watch it and than you can see my point. Or maybe you'll like to try to figure out the great \\"puzzle\\" and watch this film five or six times. Believe me, I'm the most open minded guy when it comes to films, with Thin Red Line, Splendor in the Grass, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest being three of my favorites but THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE!!! Unless you enjoy lesbian sex scenes ... and a movie that goes NO WHERE, don't waste your time!!!
B00000J6AG|4.0|Moby's become a little more funky and diverse since Everything Is Wrong, which was his ecletic masterpiece.  \\"Honey\\" and \\"Run On\\" are prime examples of that, a soul/scat verse set against piano.  There's more bluesy soul in \\"Natural Blues.\\"  You know, \\"Oh lordy, troubles so hard.\\"  And \\"Find My Baby\\" plays at the blues set to a synth-beat with some guitar coming in later in the song.<br />I find myself leaning towards Moby's ballads or melancholy songs \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\" is my pick here, and the soulful words match the wistful symphonic music.  Then comes \\"My Weakness,\\" which has an African choir or something mixed in with synth-strings brimming of the sadness of infinity.  \\"Rushing\\" and the self-explanatory \\"Guitar Flute & String\\" are other in the softer category.<br />\\"Bodyrock\\" a rap sample played against his usual keyboards, but it's novel in some way.  \\"Machete\\" is kind of a throwback to his earlier days<br />Note:  the version of Play came with the original version of \\"South Side\\" on the CD and a bonus one-song single--read the Gwen Stefani version.  As a result, first came the original Play, then the version I have, and finally, the Gwen Stefani version of \\"South Side\\" replaced the original \\"South Side\\" on Play.  Personally, I prefer the original version.  See what trend Mr. Richard Melville Hall has started.  First an album is released, then a single from the album that is different remix, featuring some other artist.  Finger these as guilty culprits:  J-Lo, Mary J. Blige, and Jagged Edge on their latest studio efforts.<br />Two things are certain.  One, I can't go anywhere without hearing a snatch from one of these songs in a trailer for some movie.  Two, Moby's ecletic sampling has expanded.  Is that good or bad?  Yes, I can tell it's the same guy who did that mind-blowing Everything Is Wrong, and Play does have its standout tracks, but in terms of being eclectic, Moby's overdone it, so as a result, it seems more numbing and impersonal overall.<br />Extra credit for his usual mentally illuminating essays, especially the ones on consensual crimes, why he is a vegan, and the various quotes, which are words to live by.l.<br />Extra credit for his usual mentally illuminating essays, especially the ones on consensual crimes, why he is a vegan, and the various quotes, which are words to live by.
0790729628|4.0|Although I did enjoy the Directors Cut, I still prefer the original version and hope that it's remastered and re-released sometime this year, the original films 20th anniversary. You learn so much more with the original version - Harrison Fords narration tells you many more details about the replicants that you would otherwise not know. Interesting fact - the person Ridley Scott originally wanted for the lead role was - Dustin Hoffman (with elevator shoes).
B000063S6Z|3.0|18?  Or is this Re-play?  Better still, maybe we should retitle Play 17.  Well, if it helps any, some of you may have gotten Play with the B-Sides.  My ex-colleague Chris told me that the material on 18 sounds a lot like the B-Sides.  A big-up to Chris for that info.  And in looking at this review, there will be more than just a few references to Play, because part of 18 could've been leftovers from Play or even the B-Sides (are there such things as C-Sides?), Play stuff that Moby should have left alone, part stuff that works, and of course filler.<br />Remember that lovely-as-the-heavens &quot;My Weakness&quot; from Play? Well, Moby has speeded the tempo up, put Jennifer Price as vocalist, and retitled it &quot;In This World.&quot;  Now, I'm an advocate of recycling, but I have to draw the line somewhere and this is it.  Ditto for &quot;One Of These Mornings,&quot; which wavers inbetween &quot;Natural Blues&quot; and &quot;First Cool Hive&quot; from Everything Is Wrong without the Enigma beats, plus the symphony wall of sound added.<br />And  &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; started like an instrumental afterthought to &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad&quot; until Moby's vocals took over.<br />Some songs are clearer hi-fi instead of the minimalist lo-fi filler that plagued much of Play.  &quot;In My Heart&quot; is what Moby should have done on Play, but since he did it on 18...  &quot;Signs Of Love&quot; has a clearer wall of sound with Moby on vocals.<br />That doesn't mean Moby hasn't done anything good here.  &quot;Fireworks&quot;, which might be called &quot;Flute Piano Strings&quot; a la Play's &quot;Guitar Flute Strings,&quot; will make Moby a lot of money if movie companies ask him to use it for trailers or as part of a movie score.  It's actually not that bad.  The title track is another instrumental tune that might do well for sad movie endings.  &quot;At Least We Tried,&quot; hauntingly sung by Freedom Bremner, is as sad and basic a goodbye song as any.<br />The diverse use of different vocalists is a refreshing change, and some big names at that.  Sinead O'Connor lends her vocal talents on &quot;Harbour&quot; and Angie Stone and MC Lyte do their bit on &quot;Jam For The Ladies.&quot;  However, given O'Connor's talents, she should have been given a better song.<br />Despite the last track being a tired throwaway called &quot;I'm Not Worried At All,&quot; Moby had better be.  Then there's the cover photo of him in a spacesuit on some new planetary landscape, but the truth is, Moby hasn't covered too much new ground.  Maybe he should give Everything Is Wrong or even his first album a relisten.  Leave Play behind, please!  If he makes 19, that's how many copies this album will sell, and his rave new world will come crashing down around that bald head of his.  I'd give this 3-1/4, but gotta round down.diverse use of different vocalists is a refreshing change, and some big names at that.

B000002IWH|5.0|=========================================<BR>The One \\"Must Have\\" CD, Especially If You Plan To Have 10 - 100 of Your Closest Friends Over To Party!<BR>=========================================<br />  \\"The Crow: Original Motion Picture Sound Track\\" remains on My personal \\"Top 20 Albums of All Time\\" list and rates as one of the best Sound Tracks ever made. It was recorded in 1996 for the picture \\"The Crow\\" starring the ill-fated Brandon Lee, only son of Martial Arts Film Legend, Bruce Lee.<br />  Brandon, who died in a bizarre on set accident, starred in this film about a dark hero who comes from the afterlife to bring justice to those who would do evil. His death reinforced the dark mood of the film and as recent legend would have us believe, fulfilled the curse of his father for bringing the ancient art of Kung Fu to the masses, as the film about Bruce Lee's life hinted at.<br />  This recording showcases a diverse community of talent and even groups I would otherwise never have listened to, make an impressive effort. From it's haunted opening strains by The Cure, it takes you on a visceral musical journey. The second track by The Machines of Loving Grace set a dark metallic feeling that fits with the movie perfectly, though a one hit wonder, this is the hit that put them on the map.<br />  Then with the third track it takes an Earthy, melancholic turn with The Stone Temple Pilots. Next on the list is a remake of the song \\"Dead Souls\\" by Nine Inch Nails, which is as angst filled as any Modern Alternative battle cry but with Trent Reznor giving it an edge lacking in most of the songs of the day. The Fifth track on this Masterpiece is a song called \\"Darkness\\" by the ever rebellious Rage Against the Machine. This bands mix of Heavy Metal guitar riffs, Rap lyrics and sense of social responsibility doesn't appeal to the masses but this is one of the best Tunes recorded in their prime and makes you wish they'd never broken up.<br />  The low points of the album, in my opinion, come in the form of the Violent Femmes, Pantera's Metal anthem \\"The Badge\\", The Jesus and Mary Chain,  Medicine and Jane Siberry (who seems oddly out of place amongst this collection) but even these artists, with the exception of Pantera, are not that bad and don't detract from the album as a whole. They are, just as they say, \\"not my bag of tea\\". Even at its' worst, their songs are pretty damned good!<br />  Notable exceptions on this album are, the Rollins Bands' \\"Ghostrider\\" (lead by the ex leader of Black Flag turned actor Henry Rollins. Not as Punk as his roots but definitely an acquired taste.), Helmet's \\"Milktoast\\" (a Bass thumping slamfest),  and last but not least My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult's \\"After The Flesh\\" ( a Techno driven scream dream that makes you want to hop in your car and play \\"Need for Speed\\" for REAL on the highway!).<br />  It is often said that the whole is much more than the sum of it's parts, and in this case it is not only true but a physical law of nature! This CD is a MUST for any self respecting collection, especially if you plan to entertain 10 - 100 of your closest friends on a Saturday night! If you haven't seen the movie, please do so. Go to your nearest video store and rent it. After that, RUN, don't walk, to the nearest record shop or order it from online as quickly as you can (I say get it from a store only because you can be sure to unwrap this magnificent piece of art all the sooner)!<br />Discography:<BR>------------<br />1) The Cure - Burn<br />2) The Machines of Loving Grace - Golgotha Tenement Blues<br />3) Stone Temple Pilots - Big Empty<br />4) Nine Inch Nails - Deads Souls<br />5) Rage Against the Machine - DARKNESS <br />6) Violent Femmes - Color Me Once<br />7) Rollins Band - Ghostrider<br />8) Helmet - Milktoast<br />9) Pantera - The Badge<br />10) For Love Not Lisa - Slip Slide Melting<br />11) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult - After The Flesh<br />12) The Jesus and Mary Chain - SnakeDriver<br />13) Medicine - Time Baby III<br />14) Jane Siberry - It Can't Rain All the Time<br />Do you kind of get the impression I liked this album?<BR>Well, you're wrong!

B00003CXI0|5.0|In 2001, two fall blockbusters involving witchcraft and wizards reached the theatres.  Unfortunately, I don't have a wand with which to say \\"Review autoscriptus!\\" or some snowy owls on one-day delivery standby so I have to do this with my fingers (sigh) and create words of wonder on the movie I liked better.<br />While I haven't read J.K. Rowling's books, it must have been chock full of detail  I don't know of the movie:book accuracy ratio, but for director Chris Columbus to fit it in two and-a-half hours, it must have been a book spectacularis.<br />Witches and wizards were persecuted throughout the ages, regarded as threats more than freaks as Harry's aunt did her sister, and more often than not, burned at the stake.  With Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the song remains the same, only this time, his uncle, aunt, and obnoxious cousin treat him contemptuously, as if he's an unwanted burden.  Who knows how his life would have been without the flurry of invitations to Hogwarts School courtesy of one-day owl delivery?  Fortunately, giant Rubeas Hagrid comes crashing to the rescue.  The real adventure begins from there.<br />Daniel Radcliffe gives a performance competentus and credibilis as the totally likeable title character.  Of the troika of main characters, he's the most human.  However, Emma Watson as the resourceful and well-read Hermione Granger steals the show wands aloft.  Despite being snooty and knowing who she is, she proves herself to be a cut above others in classes (see her frantically waving on Professor Snape to call on her, and her proficient wand handling).  She does have feelings, though, as she angrily stomps past through Weasley, who fed up with her conceit, was verbally cutting her down a peg to Harry, finishing with \\"No wonder she doesn't have any friends.\\"  If Hermione's character leads more children to flip pages instead of flipping bad guys on their PS2's or X-Box's, so much the better.  Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, makes a good foil for both his counterparts, being a fellow explorer and Christmas holiday companion with Harry or someone for Hermione to impart knowledge.<br />The other performer to whom this show belongs to is veteran actor Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant gameskeeper Rubeas Hagrid.  After Krull, Nuns On The Run, two James Bond movies, and From Hell among others, he has finally become a recognizable face on American shores.  American audiences should have warmed up to this talented performer earlier, and that's something I should've said.<br />As for other veteran actors, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Zoe Wanamaker do wonders as the professors of Hogwarts, but Alan Rickman turns in a solid performance as the sinister Professor Snape, who doesn't seem to like Harry all that much.<br />People, (or should that be muggles?) this is one movie specialus.  The special effects, while spectacular, do not detract from the character development or dialogue, like certain films I'm not going to name.  They merely support the magic whether it's the entrance to the square or the action scenes, such as the Quidditch match.<br />Well, review terminatus, and see you at the theatres for the Chamber of Secretsl for both his counterparts, being a fellow explorer and Christmas holiday companion with Harry or someone for Hermione to impart knowledge.<br />The other performer to whom this show belongs to is veteran actor Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant gameskeeper Rubeas Hagrid.

A core trio, with two former members guesting, producing some of the most violent and scary music recorded in the entire rock era.  &quot;Red,&quot; the opening track, epitomizes this approach most strongly, with a full-on lead guitar attack that grabs you by the throat from the first moment you hear it; it's music for being beaten to within an inch of your life by a street gang.  &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; covers something like that very subject; then, just as you thought you could sleep, along comes &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; which, while violent in its approach, has a somewhat tongue-in-cheek twist in the third verse, when the narrator (Wetton), having a nightmare about being in a jetliner about to crash, awakes to find himself safely about a Greyhound bus.  &quot;Starless,&quot; the closer, is a mournful, minor-chord paean to depression and inward turning, with some genuinely spine-chilling Mellotron bits.<br />Run, don't walk, to your nearest music store and pick this one up...or click on the &quot;buy&quot; button further up the screen.  Red is definitely worth having.

B00005RY7X|4.0|Andrew W.K. is to music what NASCAR is to sports.. They're both loud, fast, easy to follow and people either \\"get it\\" or they don't...<br />Andrew W.K. is the twenty-first century reincarnation of Twisted Sister, with the same \\"protest-rock anthems\\" about adolescence, rebellion and not caring about how cartoonish the whole package seems... There is no intellectual heavy lifting here... Granted, the music is edgier (only slightly) and the lyrics a little darker (i.e Ready to Die) and while the cover photo will shock your grandmother, it's still suprising to me how broad the appeal of this music is...<br />If you enjoy driving around with your windows rolled down and the music loud, trying to see who you can annoy, this album is a must.. If you enjoy solidly built, guitar-driven rock with pop sensibility, this is worth your hard earned cash.. If you're just plain curious about how someone can fill an album with each song built around the same mind-numbingly simple melody, and then get away with titles like \\"I Get Wet\\" and \\"Party Till You Puke\\", then think of this as a musical \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\"..  And if you're 16 and planning on sneaking your first beer at a friends house this Friday, you already own this CD<br />But coming from a thirty-something male listening to this CD in my minivan (turning it down at intersections so as not to offend the guy in the Lexus), if I can enjoy Andrew W.K. (and I do, thoroughly), you're gonna love it..<br />And, by the way, I never did like Twisted Sister.. <br />Indulge in this now..  Andrew W.K. is destined to \\"burn out, not fade away\\"
0425107469|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read.  Period.  I'm not yet 20 years old, but this is the best book I've read by any author in my life thus far.  My dad's got lots of Dean Koontz books on the bookshelf, collecting dust and gaining a fine yellow tint to the pages.  I've read most of them, and one night I had nothing else to read; until I moved away some of the paperbacks stacked up in the front.  Behind all these, was this book, as if out of harm's way. <BR><BR> I picked it up, read the main idea of what the story entailed, and decided I'd give it a shot.  Good Idea #1. <BR><BR> I read about 80 pages that night, and I could hardly put the book down until I was through the good parts.  But that's just it!  That's not possible.  You tell yourself that you're going to read 5 chapters in one night, then go to bed.  But then on the fifth chapter, the story just leaves you hanging, wondering what will happen next.  It's near impossible to read two or three chapters and then just put the book down.  It's that good. <BR><BR> Two things happened that I've never experienced while reading a book:<BR>1. Extreme emotions surged through my veins while in the midst of the story.  I was thouroughly immensed in the story, and I HATED for it to end.  It's a shame there wasn't a sequel.  And by sequel, I don't mean one modeled after the movie series. <BR><BR>2. I now want to re-read the book.  I've read some good books in my life- believe me- but nothing quite like this.  I've read the Harry Potter series thus far, and I've enjoyed each book tremendously, but I've never had the urge to re-read any of them. <BR><BR> The phrase, \\"There are no words to express how I feel\\", does not quite pertain to this particular book, as you can plainly see, but take my word for it.  It's well worth it.
B000002UA9|5.0|&quot;Please Please Me&quot;was one of my favorite Beatles albums.&quot;Twist And Shout&quot; was my favorite song of this album.&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was a great rock song in my opinion.The guitars solos of this album was great.raw and rough and still very rock &amp; roll.Lennon and McCartney begin to flex their writing muscles and make history in rock and roll history.<BR>THIS ALBUM IS ESSENTIAL
B000001E8S|4.0|My favorite band in the world is U2.  That said, this album is not a U2 album.  It is a Brian Eno album, with help from many other musicians including Luciano Pavoratti (though I do admit most of the assistance comes from Bono, Edge, Larry, and Adam).  It's a good, strong techno album,easy to relax to.  However, it is not the long lost step between ZOOROPA and POP.  It is the opposite of the 3 U2 1990's albums.  Instead of Eno assisting U2, they assist his vision.  It's all techno here folks, no memorable pop songs that you'll be hummin to yourself on the way back from lunch.  However, if you want to see what U2 are capable of when they relinquish control and serve another creative light, go ahead.  Anyone looking for the next &quot;One&quot; &quot;Lemon&quot; or &quot;Gone&quot; or &quot;Discotheque&quot; or should stay far away from Passengers.  We can only hope Larry Mullen comes around to this album in a couple years so we can see a Passengers 2.
0764005685|5.0|This has to be one of Dario's best films! I love the whole fairy tale type story. The score is wonderful and Jennifer Conelly is great! SOme people say this is a very gory film, it isn't. When it does show gore there is SOMETIMES a lot but its nothing that will make you sick. Don't even try CREEPERS, which was cut by 28 minutes! Ths is the way the film was meant to be!
B00005V9HH|3.0|As a fan of the film, I purchased this disc (again) because of the extra features.  In all fairness, the documentary 'featurettes' are interesting.  But beware - the deleted scenes are a joke.  A couple are about six seconds long.  John Ottman's introductions are good, but the scenes are a letdown.  Not to mention the fact that they seem to have come from a vhs tape with poor tracking.  The gag reel is not funny, and is cut like a public access music video.  Further, the 'remastered' image of the feature doesn't look much better than the previous release.  Oh well, for 18 bucks, you get what you get.

0312265859|5.0|They just keep getting better.  I LOVED this one.  The plot was a little darker, the relationships more entangled (Ranger/Morelli) and Grandma Mazur's kickin'!  This one had me laughing out loud....even sister Valerie came around!  I kept thinking \\"if that was me in that situation, that's exactly what I would be thinking/doing....\\"  Hurrah for Stephanie!  Lets have another one SOON!

B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is one of the best ones I have! It's almost hard to believe Avril is only 17. Why is this, you say? Her lyrics are soooo powerful and well-written. And she wrote them herself! Every since the first time I heard &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio, I was obsessed with Avril! She has a good voice and good looks. There is a lot of variety on her debut album, Let Go. A lot of the songs also tell stories, and they're great stories! Sk8tr boi is one of my favorite stories on the CD. It's about a girl who's girly, and takes ballet. This guy is a skateboarder, so they're pretty different. They end up splitting, but secretly, they both want each other back. The Sk8tr Boi rocks it up on MTV one day, and girl sees this and goes to a concert of his with her friends. You can listen to the song to hear the rest :) Other songs like &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot; are well told and sound really good. &quot;My World&quot; is a story about Avril's life. She mentions growing up in the 6,000 population town of Napanee. All in all, all the songs on this album are great to listen to! Rock on, Avril!
B000056VIY|1.0|She can't really sing, most girls can sing just the same, it's called modern recording equipment. Brief history: First she was a dancer, doing moves choreographed by someone else(okay), then she was an actress acting parts written and  directed by someone else(fine), then she's a singer who doesn't write her own material(not to mention remixes of remixes), now she's a restaurantuer who didn't come up with the menu(enough!). Also if you want to see an example of a nice rump check out Natalie Raitano.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Unlike some people who complained about Chris Columbus' so closely following the book in his adaptation of JK Rowling's first book in the HARRY POTTER series, I LOVED the fact that all the sights and sounds I had pictured in my mind came so wonderfully to life in this film.<br />Outstanding acting by the 3 juvenile leads, a wonderful supporting cast of Britain's best character actors (a stand-out is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid), fantastic special effects, and a true sense of wonder--something not often found in \\"kid\\" flicks these days (look at what else passes for a kid flick: Max Keeble's Big Move, Snow Dogs, etc.).<br />The DVD is wonderfully presented, although I must confess that it took me longer than I thought it would to crack the codes to find the deleted scenes.  Beautifully packaged, nicely put together (although it could have used a sneak peek at HP & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS), totally enjoyable.<br />My wife, who did not see the film in the theaters or read the books, became a Harry Potter fan after watching this movie.  Now we are both waiting for the next film--and praying that JK Rowling doesn't off poor Ron.
0812550757|5.0|As the Ender series progresses, Card's novels become less focused on action and more focused on the underlying philosophy of this universe. If you liked Ender's Game and are looking for something similar, this might not be perfect for you. However, if you really enjoyed Ender's Game and are hoping to experience more of that world, I definitely recommend it. Card presents some very interesting ideas as he weaves a highly enjoyable tale. For mature readers who enjoyed EG, I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series.
B00005YU1O|4.0|Lucid dreamers, amateur philosophers, autodidacts and fans of paint-by-numbers take note:  this movie is for you!  The film begins with a tango that sounds like Piazzola but is apparently pure Texas - a nice surprise.  The animation is reminiscent of a more detailed (and deft) paint-by-numbers style.  Squirming strokes and flat sections of color wobble and morph from cel to cel giving a sense of depth and muscularity that is more typical of fine-art painting than contemporary animation.  There are several different animator's hands in evidence, but the multiple styles are similar and complementary.  It's worth seeing just for the look of the thing.  <br />The plot, as such, is basically Wiley Wiggins walking around trying to figure out where he is, with side trips into why he is, or who he is.  The characters he meets on this ramble are intensely ordinary yet interesting, and the whole thing has a very &quot;finding ourselves&quot; college-town feel.  Even the crackpots are interesting, if only for the pure spectacle of watching an inspired lunatic perform his or her best schtick.  It does drag a bit in spots, but I suspect the scenes that will seem more or less compelling will vary from viewer to viewer.  However, I particularly loved the angry guy, the lucid dream/light switch guy, and the girl with the angular face and red sausage curls.  And if you have wondered what happened to the couple from Linklater's earlier &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; we do find out here - a nice little valentine.  <br />There is no action to speak of, no real conclusions - just lots and lots of talk and some really gorgeous and unique animation and a fabulous soundtrack.
0451175123|5.0|This was the first Ayn Rand book I read and it changed many of my point of views on life and my creativity. The suspence and storytelling capabilites of Rand are amazing. If you love to create, read this book. And if you love living an independent life read the rest of Ayn Rand's books.
B00003CY0V|4.0|It has explosions and Halle Barry's [chest].  Despite what the critics say that makes for a movie any man is sure to love. The same critics who bash this because it's totally implausible are the ones who loved \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\". Yeah, that's sure plausible to be able to run up the side of buildings and jump 30 feet in the air without any assist. If you want plausibility go watch Schindler's List. If you just want a good time and would like to see Halle Barry's hidden assets then grab some popcorn and enjoy.
B0000047CX|3.0|There is not much to say about this album that has not been said here by others. I will limit myself to endorsing \\"Getz/Gilberto\\" as a very pleasurable, if not earth-shatteringly important album.<br />First of all, I am amazed at its clear, atmospherically recorded sound. This disc is top of the line when it comes to sound.<br />As for the songs themselves--\\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" has become a standard. The other songs all showcase the genius of Getz and the marvelous playing of Gilberto. This is truly lovely music that exemplifies all that is best about the Bossa Nova style. One song in particular desrves more notice:<br />\\"Corcovado\\" is a gem that doesn't have half the fame of \\"The Girl From Ipanema.\\" Yet, I would rank it right up there as one of the two great tunes on the disc. There is something about the almost introspective joy of this song that makes it music that is truly worthwhile.<br />I recommend this disc to anyone who likes lovely music. It may not change the world, but it is certainly nice to listen to every now and then.
B00006690G|5.0|Ok, any person out there who has something bad to say, I would like to know what album this year has come stronger and harder than the Eminem Show?  The beats on this CD are ridiculous, compared to his previous albums, which of course are excellent as well, but the beats just don't seem as cultivated as the ones on the Em Show.  This is the only CD this year, besides Ghostface Bulletproof Wallets and Killah Priest Priesthood, that did not let me down when I bought it, and I normally don't even buy CD's.   Some of the best songs include Superman, which is a little harsh toward females, but being a female all I can do is laugh every time I hear it.  I think my favorite is the song My dad's gone crazy, with Halie singing the hook.  Who would have ever imagined this being able to work, but it does.  There is a touching line about a little girl inside of a plane aimed at the world trade, that fits so well into the song.  I really like the mature political approach he took.  Eminem was not cocky at all, but he does know he deserves more credit than he gets, and he does.  Of course his first radio track is going to be a little more mainstream to attract listeners, but the album as a whole is nowhere near pop.  The most enlightening thing on the Cd was the list of rappers he put out, with Reggie Noble being first, who is always slept on, all the way down to himself, which needs no explanation. This is almost an on point description with the exception of Jay-Z.  We know you're cool with him Slim, but come on now, is he really deserving of a slot on your list?  Overall, do not sleep on this album.  It's classic Eminem that will grow on you the more you listen to it
B00005T30L|1.0|It's  ashame that American Beauty star Thora Birch was apart of this movie. The movie dragged on and had no substance to it. Thora Birch's character was an annoying brat who needed a slap in the face of real life. I don't recommend this movie to anyone with taste.

0375751513|3.0|Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs.  Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women.  Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality.  To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking.  Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.<br /> The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas.  While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance.  Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait.  At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.<br /> Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation.  But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale.  The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.  But no such ending was provided.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is one of the few films to look at mental illness in a real and positive way. It is also an amazing motion picture. Concerning the story of brilliant mathematician John Nash, played by the brilliant Russel Crowe, and his wife Alicia, played by the luminous Jennifer Connelly, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; succeeds in taking the audience on an often intense and emotional journey where you care deeply for the characters.<br />The film follow Nash from his college days at Princeton University where he makes a groundbreaking discovery, to his winning the Nobel Prize in 1994. John Nash courts Alicia, a beautiful young woman who is his equal intellectually and emotionally. They eventually marry and have a son, and then John is diagnosed with schizophrenia. I won't disclose the film's jaw-dropping twist, as some reviewers have. Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have come under fire for &quot;cheating&quot; the audience, but this method was used to make the viewer aware of how schizophrenia works, and the huge effect that it has on people's lives.<br />&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; would not work without the central performances of Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. Crowe makes Nash such a rich and absorbing personality that you cannot help but be riveted to him. He works with subtle gestures and eye movements to personify John Nash, changing his entire body to be that of the character. That is real acting folks. This film is one of the chief reasons why Russel Crowe is one of the best actors working now. He makes us sympathize and love Nash, but never pitying him. Jennifer Connelly follows her amazing performance in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; with this role. As the wife of the mentally tormented Nash, Connelly creates a woman of enormous strength and loyalty. She is every bit Crowe's and Nash's equal, and deservedly won an Oscar for her subtle and emotional work here. Together these two actors create two noble and real characters. Ron Howard also is excellent his his direction of the film, never letting the events become sensationalized or melodramatic. It is always real and heartbreaking.<br />Above all, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is the uplifting story of a man who was able to conquer the demons within himself. As the elderly Nash says to Alicia in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, &quot;You are the reason I am here. You are all my reasons.&quot; It is a triumph of a beautiful mind, a beautiful man, and a triumph of unconditional devotion and love.o is excellent his his direction of the film, never letting the events become sensationalized or melodramatic.

B00003CWRX|1.0|Another exammple of Hollywood's view of the world.  As an ex-smoker, the significance of this drama eludes me.  I mean its not as if nobody has the slightest inkling that cigarettes are bad for you and addictive and you shouldn't smoke.  But apparently the responsiblity does not lie with the individual - to get a grip on him or herself and not smoke - but with the big tobacco companies who are made to seem as if they are preying on a hapless populace who regard them with tragically misguided childlike trust and reverence.  From the gravity of this movie a newly-arrived space alien who wandered into a theater and pointed his antennae at the screen would get the impression that we earthlings are very much like the eloi and morlocks of HG Wells' future world.  The eloi smokers - lets call them the smokeloi - go around in a beatific daze with a cigarette hanging out of the side of their mouths at all times.  They are not eaten by the tobacco-producing morlocks - lets call them the philmorlocks - but presently some of them develop a whacking cough.  The time traveller witnesses this situation and it does not occur to him to ask the smokeloi why they don't just stop smoking.  Instead, he suggests that the smokeloi should sue the philmorlocks for everything they own - which in this case is plenty.  The scene fades out with the thus incited smokeloi still smoking but now jumping up and down chanting slogans, holding placards with cigarettes hanging out of the side of their mouth.  They buoy the time traveller aloft like he's stage diving at an REM concert and as the light hits his face in those last few moments you can't quite tell if he's supposed to be Al Pacino or Russell Crowe and come to think of it you don't really care.
B000056K04|2.0|Ahh..the Dave Matthews Band. I love these boys. But not so much this album. I guess I'm just used to the sound of their previous albums. There are some great songs on Everyday though..<br />I Did It: I know a lot of people don't like this song, but what can I say? It grew on me. It's a nice catchy song that gets me moving. <BR>Space Between: This is a nice song as well, but I hate the chorus because of the cheesy 80's sound it posesses. If they'd take that aspect of the song out, it'd be a great song.<BR>Dreams of our Fathers: I like this song a lot, partially because it reminds me of another song of theirs \\"Rhyme & Reason\\" on Under the Table and Dreaming. It's a nice song. :)<BR>What You Are: A good song. There's not much to say.<BR>Everyday: Love it, especially acoustic. Sounds beautiful acoustic.<BR>When the World Ends: Really funky song. I enjoy it.<br />The other half of the album I do not really care for. I am a little dissapointed, but I'm not going to shun them for it. I like how they took a chance. Now all I'm waiting for is the release of Busted Stuff on July 16. I can't wait for that gem. Will be much better :)<br />I know some people have only heard Everyday, and if so, I urge you to go out and listen to their 1994 release Under the Table and Dreaming. It doesn't get much better than that. :)

0790751089|4.0|I am sure that every woman, and more men than would like to admit...can relate to this movie!  If you can get past Clint and his sloppy, smacking smooches...this movie can tear at the heartstrings like no other I have ever seen!  <br />The scene with Francesca's hand on that truck door handle!  I have to give old Clint a hell of a lot of credit for that scene.  It was simple yet ever so powerful...and so reminiscent of the human condition as whole, if you ask me.<br />When did we all stop letting out intuition guide us?  When did we all decide that the \\"ultimate sacrifice\\" is letting yourself live out your days in mediocrity of the mind, body and soul?  <br />To live out your life unsatisfied is a crime of nature.  I would have told a different story...Francesca...take it from me, sister...GO FOR IT!!!<br />And just by the way...D. Grant Haynes from Middle America...should I happen upon you the way Robert did Francesca...would you promise to run away with me???  I loved your review.  More men should think the way that you do.
B00005ATQD|4.0|If I could recommend a film to any married couple on the dangers of promiscuity outside of marriage I would without a doubt pick this one.  <br />This film presents a truth that this hedonistic generation is too weak and selfish to believe--FORNICATION IS A DANCE WITH DEATH.  <br />The only reason people were disappointed with this film is because the sexuality wasn't as erotic as they had hoped.  Really, the only truly erotic scene in the whole film happens to be between a husband and wife.  <br />Kubrick takes so much time to make a film that he can't afford to be as exploitative as most filmmakers are today.<br />My only dissappointment is that this was Kubrick's last film.  Though I think it was interesting, it is hardly the movie he should be remembered for.
0876855575|3.0|I had read Charles Bukowski's poetry first, and was extremely impressed by his abilities as a writer. This was the first of his novels that I read.<br />While the writing style is good and the plot moves you along, one of the things that struck me most was how meaningless the story was. It does nothing to inspire or to teach. It is simply a portrait of a man who moves from one fist fight to the next - and is usually the one who starts the fight because he doesn't have enough depth of character to understand himself or other people. It's a portrait of a man who does NOT rise above his surroundings. He hates those surroundings, and doesn't embrace them so much as hold them up as a testament to his pain, like a child dramatically nursing a wound that some other child inflicted, long past the time it really hurts.<br />The mood is stark and hopeless. The writing style is sharp and brief. There are no beautiful poetic interludes, or any evidence that he's a poet. It's merely the diary of a misanthrope, a misogynist and a hopeless drunk. Reading about his life is like watching someone say, &quot;So there,&quot; after driving his car into a utility pole.<br />His female characters are two-dimensional - a problem many male writers have because they don't entirely realize that anyone is &quot;in there&quot;. He refers to them all as &quot;snatches&quot; and &quot;c**ts&quot;. He can't have them because he isn't attractive enough, and he longs after them, NOT because he likes them, but because he merely wants them.<br />When I was done reading, I wondered what I was supposed to have taken away from it. Was it just a snapshot of a life and an attitude that makes the reader recoil? The point was NOT that he rose above anything despite desperate circumstances, because he let his circumstances win. Was his point that we can't ever understand his genius because of his unique and noble suffering? That we should understand that he could do nothing to prevent his wasted life?<br />Sure he could. His abusive father and his weak (and poorly developed as a character) mother give him an unhappy home, but he doesn't describe anything that would have been insurmountable. <br />I did not find a large soul behind the words in this book. I found a small one. I found a man who is petty, and spiteful and weak.<br />Maybe THAT was his point: that someone who isn't much can still find a publisher and convince people to read books about his less-than-noble life and bad attitude.
B000066NW0|5.0|I have been looking for an album like this for a long time.  It is so perfect for everyone.  The songs have incredible lyrics and rockin' beats.  When you hear &quot;Complicated,&quot; you don't think that Avril is the girl singing it.  When I got the album and actually saw what Avril looked like, I was hooked.  Not only is this girl's voice amazing, but she is such the sk8er punk!  I think that we need more singers like her to be role models for the different crowd.  Some of my favorite songs on her album are Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi, Tomorrow, and Nobody's Fool.  Losing Grip is such an ex-boyfriend song.  I love it cause it's everything that I think about too.  Sk8er Boi is a great story and it's very addicting.  You have to listen to it yourself to get the whole point.  Tomorrow is more of a ballad in which Avril's voice and the lyrics of the song will just make all your problems go away.  Lastly, Nobody's Fool.  What can you say about this song??  It's like her anthem.  This girl knows exactly what she wants.  That's what makes her so great!  Listen to this album and be ready to be inspired.  Check out this girl and fall in love with the amazing new talent, Avril Lavigne!
B00003CY6M|4.0|John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale make a charming duo in this light romantic comedy.  They meet one day and have a wonderful time together but Kate has the theory that if they are meant to be together they will be without any effort on their parts, so she does not give him her number.  Instead she writes it in a book which she says she'll give to a bookstore and it's his job to find it.  We then see them several years later as they are both about to marry other people.  There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before, but though predictable it is charming and makes for an enjoyable evening's viewing.
0441009425|4.0|Revelation Space is a great first time effort at science fiction by Alastair Reynolds.<br />Much of why I liked Revelation Space was the way Reynolds created his version of humanity.  Helped by science, humans have begun to evolve into different if not species then at least sub-species.  And, this science rushed sub-evolution is propelled by culture not nature.<br />This is somewhat &quot;Big&quot; sci-fi with an archealogical bent pointing towards a mystery whose solution will influence mankind's future.  In this way it shares a common theme with Engines of God by McDevitt, although Rev Space relies less on archealogy as substance in the plot.<br />All in all it's a fine sci-fi tale whose ending is a bit disappointing.  No matter, with some strong characters (especially the two female protaganists) and nice attention to details, I enjoyed the read.
B00000IB4D|5.0|After his first venture into jazz, the jazz/rock masterpiece Caravanserai, Carlos Santana recorded four albums also with jazzy textures, but less panache than Caravanserai. Instead, they have a lighter feel, with elements of spirituality in varying degrees.  This reflects Carlos' having come under the influence of spiritual teacher Sri Chinmoy, as well as his subsequent associations with John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, with whom he recorded one of these albums, and Alice Coltrane (another of the albums was recorded with her).  The four recordings have various musical elements (including gospel), but jazz, including the music of Alice's recently deceased husband John, was at each of their cores.  Welcome is the second of the four, recorded shortly after Carlos took the spiritual name \\"Devadip.\\"  It is also the jazziest, the most free-flowing and modern-sounding, the lightest and airiest (but not lacking in intensity), the strongest musically, and the best.  Welcome is amazing, one of the most wonderful things you'll ever hear from Carlos Santana, or anyone.<br />I feel Carlos Santana may be the finest guitarist of the century, maybe of all time.  He usually has a large supporting cast, but he still has a very prominent, if not a dominant, role in almost all of his albums.  Welcome is the exception.  Instead of being marked by Carlos' guitar solos, this album features virtuoso performances by a wide array of musicians and singers.  Also, in addition to the Coltranes and Herbie Mann, six different members of the Santana Band were involved in the authorship of the songs. Welcome is a tour de force, not just of Carlos, but all.<br />The opener, \\"Going Home,\\" is based on an Alice Coltrane recording, but instead of strings employs glowing organ, combining with the pretty guitar and percussion for a majestic, dreamy introduction.  The next track, \\"Love, Devotion & Surrender\\" (actually, also the title of the album recorded with McLaughlin), features Wendy Haasand Leon Thomas on vocals along with Carlos. Leon also does it up on \\"When I Look Into Your Eyes,\\" which concludes with a moog synthesizer, and \\"Light of Life.\\"  But the best of the limited singing is the lovely, ethereal vocals of Flora Purim on the very pleasant bossa nova \\"Yours Is the Light.\\"<br />What is remarkable is that every single track--literally--is a gem.  Certainly this is helped by having peerless Santana percussionists Armando Peraza, Chepito Areas, and Michael Shrieve all on one album.  Their showcase is \\"Mother Africa,\\" which also features great saxophone work by Jules Broussard.  But the most outstanding feature of Welcome may be the keyboard interplay of Tom Coster and Richard Kermode on so many songs, including the salsa \\"Samba de Sausalito,\\" the album's catchiest number.  Still, all of the instrumentation is beautiful and gives the songs exquisite textures.  There are chimes, marimba, flute synthesizers, some smooth (not overdone) strings, all those pleasant sounds that make you feel good.  The extended tune is \\"Flame-Sky,\\" also excellent, and in which Carlos' guitar takes its turn in the spotlight along with that of John McLaughlin, who makes an appearance.  The closer is the title cut, written, fittingly, by John Coltrane, and also gorgeous.<br />I cannot say enough good things about the sparklingly superb music on this album.  Thus, I have nothing more to say.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones might arguably be the best rock and roll band of all time.  They sure are the most fun to listen to.  With dopey lyrics and no holds barred music they practically rewrote rock music at a time when it had become bloated and overly produced.<br />And this is one of their best.  &quot;The Ramones&quot; became one of the founding albums of the original punk rock explosion.  With little studio savvy (or music savvy for that matter) they produced this great slice of two minute songs every single one of them a keeper.<br />&quot;The Ramones&quot; is a must have for any rock music lover.
B000002B30|4.0|When a \\"Greatest Hits\\" selection is made for someone of such stature and longevity as Bruce Springsteen, there is of course going to be some discontent about the choices.  By now, most people agree that the term \\"Hits\\" does not mean \\"hit singles\\" alone.  Altho there might be a tendency in that direction, it is now accepted that \\"Hits\\" also means strong, popular album cuts, and I have no quibbles about their inclusion on this CD.  What is problematic is that four new \\"bonus\\" tracks make their appearance while Bruce's first two albums are blackballed in their entirety.  Not only are the four new songs not \\"Hits,\\" but they are not particularly strong, \\"Secret Garden\\" with its nice atmosphere being the best of the lot.  Besides, to exclude \\"Rosalita\\"?  Give me a break.  The reality is that \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a misnomer, and even \\"Anthology\\" would not be a good substitution--how about \\"The Bruce Springsteen Sampler\\"?  <br />Even if the parameters are not consistent for everyone, the notion of objectivity has a place.  For example, altho I think \\"Candy's Room\\" and \\"Prove It All Night\\" are better songs than \\"Badlands,\\" they are not more justifiable inclusions from Darkness on the Edge of Town because \\"Badlands\\" is a signature tune for Bruce.  I don't like some of the slow stuff as much, but similarly \\"The River\\" and other mellow tunes are appropriate here.  Thus, I will limit my disagreement to replacing the four bonus tracks with \\"Spirit in the Night,\\" \\"Rosalita,\\" \\"Tenth Avenue Freezeout,\\" and \\"Prove It All Night.\\"  If I were to get more personal, I would also move in \\"Backstreets,\\" \\"She's the One,\\" and \\"Candy's Room\\" and kick out \\"Badlands,\\" \\"The River,\\" and \\"My Hometown.\\"  This would leave some balance of representation among albums, except Born to Run is the Boss's Best, always, above Born in the U.S.A, the superb \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" notwithstanding.
B000021XS0|5.0|I reviewed this album when I first got it, but I must review it again.  I've now had it for about 8 months, and in that time I have, through countless listens and a bit of digging on the internet, I have now figured out about 99% of the story.  I can now say, with total confidence, that this is the greatest album ever to grace mankind.<br />Even before you even give a trace of thought to the storyline, just the music itself will convince you of how great this is.  The naysayers will throw out terms like \\"self-indulgent\\" and \\"musical {gratification}\\", but I don't hear that at all.  Yes, the music is technical, and there are some rather lengthy instrumental passages here and there, but to me they don't sound pompous, they sound fun.  It sounds like they must really have a blast when they're playing this stuff, and that's really what it's all about, is it not?  Besides, it's not self-indulgent if you've got fans who enjoy it as well.  Plus, they know when to rock out, and when to keep it emotional and restrained.<br />This album is just perfect in ways I could never express in words.  We've already established the greatness of the music, every member is in the top ten best of his respective instrument, but it doesn't even stop there.  James LaBrie is possibly the most amazing vocalist I've ever heard.  Despite what anyone...says, he has talent that is nearly incomprehensible.  He actually makes subtle changes in his vocal delivery to represent the different characters, and even the emotions within the characters.  How could any human being possibly do that?  The only other vocalist who might could pull this off is Matt Barlow.<br />Then, we have the story.  I won't go into it, because making these discoveries is half the fun, but once you figure it all out, you will be amazed.  This story is deep, complex, emotional, and even a bit wicked.  I really can't believe they came up with all this.  They could have easily just made another rock/metal album, but instead they have created this unstoppable juggernaut of an album.  Grammys?  Ha!  This is worthy of a Nobel Prize!<br />I'm sorry if I sound a bit stubborn here, but regardless of what any opinion anyone holds for this album, the fact remains that this is the greatest album ever made.  It is bigger than your opinions, my opinions, anyone's opinions, this is the best, and that's all there is to it.  I mean, take any other album, \\"The Wall\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Operation Mindcrime\\", any other album that anyone considers the best ever, and this album destroys it.  Buy this, please, you're doing yourself a huge favor(but get \\"Images and Words\\" first, because \\"Met. Pt. 1\\" is an important precursor).  And check them out on their upcoming tour.  Come August, I'll be doing just that.ve created this unstoppable juggernaut of an album.  Grammys?  Ha!

B000069AT7|1.0|OK, I have no real problem with a director changing a movie and doing silly things like changing walkie talkies into cellphones and inserting newe incredibly obvious CGI versions of E.T. into the movie. Whatever. I didn't go see the movie because I wanted to see the original.<br />Now the only way to see the original is to buy this rather idiotic {price] \\"Gift Set\\" which comes with a bunch of stuff I don't need. There's no option to just buy the original version. The ONLY WAY to see the original version of this movie, THE WAY THE MOVIE WAS MADE is to drop [price] into the lap of Universal.<br />But wait it gets worse... At [price] you expect some extra features, right? Wrong! Sort of. The only real features (trailer, deleted scenes) aren't even available on the DVD. No, you need both the DVD *AND* a new expensive computer with a DVD-ROM drive *AND* a fast internet connection to see the scenes quickly *AND* it better not be a Mac. And you know that online content will only be around for a few months before the website changes and that will no longer be available.<br />And finally, let's hope you're not a sound buff. The original version, eventhough it was filmed with 6 discrete sound tracks isn't even going to have surround sound --- eventhough it had it in the theatres!!!<br />Thanks but no thanks. I won't spend a dime until this is all fixed.
B000002JKA|5.0|Sorry, I've had to keep re-reviewing this album.  It's a bit hard to pin down, it would seem.  This album did not grab me as quickly as &quot;Images and Words&quot; or &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, but I've stuck with it, and though I still prefer those two albums (and I think the &quot;sellout&quot; album, &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;, may be a bit better as well), this is an excellent piece of music.<br />There is generally a much darker theme about this album.  Lyrics deal with addiction, betrayal, love, hate, a veritable collage of human emotions.  This album has some of their heaviest riffs, and some of their most beautiful melodies.  &quot;6:00&quot;, while not their best song, is one of their most aggressive, and indeed a great way to start off an album like this.  &quot;The Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie&quot; are a great one-two punch of crunchy riffs, and great lyrics and vocals.  &quot;Voices&quot; is, I think, somewhat overrated, in that it doesn't hold a great deal of variety for such a long song, but the great lyrics make up for it.  John Petrucci is undoubtedly one of the top songwriters.  I think my favorite has to be &quot;Lifting Shadows off a Dream&quot;.  Amazing ballad, with a lot of atmosphere, and a slight U2 vibe (in a good way).  &quot;The Silent Man&quot; is a great acoustic song, and &quot;Space Dye Vest&quot; is a delightfully creepy closer (BTW, Houston is definitely not a dry heat, believe you me:).<br />All in all, this is an excellent album.  My only real complaint (other than that it's a bit harder to get into than the rest) is that Mike's drumming doesn't stand out as much as on other albums, but that's a minor complaint for sure.  If you like Dream Theater, buy this, it's a thing of beauty.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|\\"Memento\\" is the kind of movie you are really going to like or not.  The story is a whodunit thriller with some intriguing, if not confusing, twists.  I liked the movie.  However, upon exiting the theater, I saw a lot of head shaking and some displeased facial expressions.   As well as, a few people whispering \\" I just don't get it......\\".   <br />Well folks, this is just the kind of movie a lot of people will debate, argue, critique, and talk about, and in the end, agree to disagree.   It's not for the light of heart who are looking for a romantic comedy with a very predicable ending.  It's also not a great cinematographic wonder, or a gun shooting, let's see what we can blow up in every frame, type of action movie.  This movie involves paying attention and putting all the pieces together.  <br />In the opening credits you see a Polaroid of a murdered man that fades away, and then, the movie begins. Of course, the movie starts at the actual end of the story, yes......,  it's told in reverse.    It moves backward, scene by scene,  each scene overlapping the other slightly, just in case you missed something.  The story also has a few extra flashbacks thrown in to confuse us more.   But, these flashbacks are very important and pertinent to identifying with the main character.  <br />This isn't used too often in moviemaking.  It does force one to pay attention though.   It makes the movie patron think,  mentally work a little, and then form your own conclusion about the film's \\"message\\". The director's vehicle of delivery to the audience was done on purpose, no doubt.  <br />The ending  is appropriate for such a convoluted twist of events.  It's well worth waiting for and your glad you finally got there.  It feels like you've been on a very thrilling ride but your ready to get off now, thank you very much.  Or, you just solved(or not) a difficult crossword puzzle.   Others will just feel mentally challenged, a little confused..... But, so what.   Maybe that's the pointof the story.  It's what makes moviemaking and a good story, interesting.   In this case,  maybe a bit bewildering, but very cleverly told.  It's definitely open to a lot of interpretations.  For some, at least.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's CD &quot;Let go&quot; is awesome.  It's one of those CD's where you can listen to the whole thing and never get bored.  I defenietely reccomend this CD to absolutely anyone considering it deals with issues that we all go through.
B00005JKNF|2.0|Yes, this movie has great cast, good acting, grand period setting but where is the meat? I mean, much touted mystery. The movie starts off slow and boring...and stays that way, despite so many people going up and down the stairs, in and out of rooms, in and out of light and shadows.<br />Definitely overadvertised, overpromoted, overrated, overhyped, overpraised...I guess you get the picture.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have found this CD to be one of THE BEST pieces of artistry I have ever listened to....The album is tremendous- expressing anger, depression, remorse... everything.  Chester Bennington's early struggles echo throughout the lyrics brining an eery truth to the music. While people may say the musical aspects are \\"basic\\"- but blended together it is enough to breathe life and energy without overkill. Major \\"metal heads\\" may find this album \\"weak\\"- but they can find other heavier artists.
0451163532|4.0|It is as interesting as any of Tom Clancy's books with out boring you with 60 different plots that you know will eventually come to geather.  It is great non-fiction book that lets you emerse yourself in the characters as well as the events of the time.  If you have to do a report for school it is a great book, but it is just as good if you are looking for an interesting non-fiction read.  A real page turner.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|Yes people! If you know nothing about Stevie Wonder, (how come?), this is a beginning. I was on holiday traveling across the States in 1982 just before this came out and at night DJ's would preview the album. Coming from London I was high steppin' up Broadway when DO I DO came on the first walkman I ever owned. I stopped walking and started dancing on Broadway because I was in New York and Stevie had this cut on an album I'd only heard about, then BAM! there it was. A few nights later coming out of my hotel on Lexington Ave I heard RIBBON IN THE SKY and it was so beautiful in its melodic in its Jazz pop complexity. (Why did this not chart when I just called... topped the world charts??). Then I was in Chicago when I heard THAT GIRL on the radio and smiled walking among the pople but nothing prepared me for the night in Califonia when I heard Front Line for the first time. Funky, angry, pointed and political. <br />These four new tracks fit the singles from Stevie's 1970s albums perfectly. What is so audacious here is the relentless musicality of the funky groove between the classic ballards. In the UK Stevie gave a concert in 1980 that was so magnificent there wasn't one bad review in the British press...do you know what that is like a in Nation that loves to find fault?  In that concert he played all of the hits on this album, and the night was so hot even the security guards were dancing. When it's for real I have to say we Brit's go for it dambusters! And Mr. Wonder did it for us. <br />Here's the deal. This CD is full of confidence because it contains hits from Stevie's glory years when he set the standards of Soul, R&amp;B, and pop music from 1970-1980. What is so good about this best of... is that it was personally supervised by Mr. Wonder and cut after cut takes you on his journey. But it leaves you to make up your own mapping. There isn't a false moment on it and to close the set with DO I DO is knowing how to leave your loved one wanting: after building upa sweat with  Funky soul and the beauty of the ballards. You can't go wrong with this because it was produced and remastered by Stevie at the time so the sound and the SOUNDS are right on the money!
0316666343|4.0|This book was a bit over the top - and the ending feels rushed - but it really was a worthwhile read. The narrator is fun, witty and very likeable and the author tells the story with feeling, and good emotion. The writing is clean and crisp, with some flowery prose - but that's expected from a 14 year old narrator so the flowery prose is believable. I enjoyed the book and finished it in two days, reading several hours per day.
B000065U1N|5.0|I love this movie, but you have to understand that this was a true story ...putting the troops there in the first place [was stupid]. But, this movie is great, lots of action, and it is sort-of intense. I would recommend this movie for adults because of the content, and because they would actually understand it. So rent it or buy it, and either way you will love this movie.<br />...
0425170349|5.0|Although it was somewhat predictable it made you want to keep on reading.
B000066NW0|5.0|Listening to her first single, &quot;Complicated,&quot; I knew this cd would be special. I bought it and found that it was even better than I had expected. You have to look beynd the fact that she is a contributor to the selling out of punk music, her melodies are catchy, and her lyrics are phenominal for someone as young as she. And to top is off, she's a skater chick. Avril Lavigne has shown to me that she has the potential to become tomorrow's big star. I can't wait for her sophomore album to see if she can live up to her potential.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Be prepared for your life to change after hearing this cd....dont try to fight it let the music flow over you. From the first track, Around the World....through Get On Top, Easily, Purple Stain and ending with road trippin' this album never dips below genius! Even though it is only just over 56 minutes long every note is bliss....which is helped by flea's masterful bass playing....its just beyond description....dont miss this record...you will regret it. Now lets all look forward to By The Way.....its gonna have to do alot to knock Californication out of my cd player!
0596000480|5.0|This is one of the best programming books I have ever read.  The author's style is very readable and he mixes in the appropriate amount of code samples to illustrate the concepts.  All code samples are very well documented, which is a big help.<br />    This is really two books in one.  First is a thorough explanation of the JavaScript language fundamentals and how to use JavaScript in web pages.  Then, comes the very complete reference sections which describe all classes and functions of core JavaScript, client-side JavaScript, and DOM programming.  As a result, this is the only book you need to both learn and use JavaScript.<br />    The author also does a nice job of pointing out which functionality will or will not work on Netscape or IE.  And, he  includes useful tips on how to work around some of these issues.  <br />    Those with experience in HTML but no programming languages may have a hard time with the level of detail in this book, but experienced programmers will appreciate the serious treatment of the JavaScript language.  Beginners who just want to learn how to do simple scripts may want to look elsewhere, but for the serious web programmer, this book is a must have.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I had no idea what I was in for when I decided to watch \\"Snatch,\\" but am I ever glad I took the time to watch this movie.  Let me say this: this has to be THE BEST CRIME CAPER MOVIE I have ever seen!  Wow, this is such a great movie...I don't know what else to say.<br />Just imagine a caper movie where everything that could possibly go wrong does.  Imagine a movie where different conflicts and interests drags all of these characters together in a unpredictible situation.  Imagine.....a dog that can swallow an entire squeeze toy ball??  Very possible in this movie, in fact, that's all I can tell you.  I don't want to give anything away.<br />Performances in this movie: very top knotch.  Brad Pitt once again shows how talented of an actor he is (and you can't even understand what the hell he's saying!!!!).  The writing is very original and clever, bringing tons of twists, crazy characters, and the most ridiculous scenarios to the tablle; with the end result being a very ingenious movie where everything all comes together and makes sense.  Brilliant directing, as well.  I like the slow-motion sequences; very clever and well-structured.<br />The DVD is very high quality as well.  Lots of special features, concidering this is a two disk set.  Haven't gotten through all of them, yet, but I liked what I saw.  The picture quality is very good and the sound quality is off the hook.  I was amazed by how good this movie sounded.  I'll have to get the soundtrack if I get the chance.<br />Despite what critics may think, this is a very clever and hillarious crime caper that will have you laughing like you would never believe.  This is one I will be sure to watch over and over again.  I am sorry if I couldn't get into too much detail about the story, but that would ruin the movie.  The best part of the movie is that it catches you off guard, showing you something you would never expect.  I went into seeing this movie without knowing a thing about it, except that is was a caper movie.  I am glad I didn't read any reviews that would give away the story.  All in all, \\"Snatch\\" is an amazing film that pulls no punches.  See this one as soon as possible!  I loved every minute.ie.  I am glad I didn't read any reviews that would give away the story.

B00005221L|5.0|Predator, the film which helped launch the career of director John McTiernan (who would later helm the first Die Hard movie), and the film which introduced us to one of the most terrifying and impressive movie monsters ever in the Predator.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star as US commandos on a rescue mission in South America, but when they find a group of skinned corpses hanging upside down, plans change.  Eventually, one by one each soldier is picked off by an unseen force, until only Arnold is left, and he comes face to face with the sleek alien hunter called the predator which takes his prey's skulls as his trophy.  The design of the Predator itself is in a word, awesome.  FX and makeup legend Stan Winston (responsible for Pumpkinhead and the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park for starters) outdid himself with the design of the beast, as Arnold puts it in the final fight, \\"One ugly mother......\\".  While the movie is great, some more special features would have been nice.  There is a rumor of a battle filmed between the Predator and Billy which would have been nice to see.  All in all though, if you've never had a chance to see the original Predator, now has never been a better time, its one of the best sci-fi/action movies of all time.  On a side note, future governor and former WWF wrestler Jessie \\"The Body\\" Ventura played one of the commandos, and Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally supposed to be the man in the Predator outfit, but he bowed out at the last minute to film Bloodsport.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I had no idea what I was in for.  I knew from talking to a bunch of people that this was a movie that I was not going to get, no matter how many times I would watch it.  That alone caught my curriousity.  I like movies that make me think.  I like to be tricked, confused, surprised, shocked, disgusted, and so on.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I will say this, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a very original film that kept my attention from the word \\"go.\\"<br />I admit, I had no idea what the hell I had just witnessed after this movie was over.  There are no chapter stops, so I couldn't watch certain parts over again without rewatching the whole movie again.  I didn't know if I liked it at the time, but I was pretty sure that I didn't hate it.  I was just...puzzled.<br />I have to thank a reviewer on this site, I forget the person's name, because the reviewer pretty much explained what happened, and it also made me feel good that it was pretty darn close to my theory.  I don't know if it's the exact and right answer, but when I rewatched it, it all fit in.  It was so simple...it was confusing.  I think that's what did it for me and made me appreciate the film more than I did the previous viewing.<br />I'm not going to go into detail about the story; that's something you're going to have to see for yourself.  It'd runin the movie if I did.  Besides, I wouldn't do it justice if I tried to explain it.  Here are some of the elements to the story; a girl with no memory, another girl who wants to be a star, a club, an accident, a load of money, some kind of thing that lives behind a fast food joint, and a little box.<br />I really liked how this film was shot and directed.  I have never seen a David Lynch film, so this would be my first one.  The score was also very haunting, as well as the overall product of the movie.  The movie is haunting, dark, and colorful at the same time.  This is a movie that will mess with your head though.  Maybe that's why I didn't get it the first time; because I was trying too hard.<br />As far as special features, there really aren't any, except for the trailer.  Would've been nice to have chapter stops.  This is the perfect movie that they could've really added some neat features and Easter Eggs.  So, be aware of that.<br />All in all, a very good and challenging film that requires all of your brain power.  Because of it's orinality, I'm sure that this is going to be one that many people may not like or get.  I'm not even going to try to convince you to see this movie.  You're on your own.  At first I thought it was an okay film, but after seeing it again and able to put the pieces together, I realized that \\"Mullholand Drive,\\" is a well-structured film that takes chances without fear.  I don't think it's the best film of the year, but I think it's on the list.  Bound to be a classic, if not already.; because I was trying too hard.<br />As far as special features, there really aren't any, except for the trailer.  Would've been nice to have chapter stops.

B00000J7S8|5.0|I'm a dancer and this is one of my favorite CD's. I like it for it's swingin' music and the way the ballads are mixed into it. It has given me a new appreciation for ballads. <br />Too many musicians really can't swing so ballads work for them and that's about all they can tackle. There is nothing worse than ten or twelve ballads angonizing over failed love!<br />Later gaiters,<BR>Brad
B00004Z1MN|4.0|I really, really enjoyed this movie.  Was it a critical phenomenon? No. Was it destined to win a trophy case full of awards? No. It's just a good story about a man who gets to change his family history,...You leave this movie with a good feeling inside, one of knowing that all is right with the world, and to be honest, that's what I go to the movies for.  I liked this movie enough to buy my own copy, and believe me, that is saying something. I am not a movie person, preferring always to read the book if possible, but I solidly support the rating I give 'Frequency.' It has universal appeal, and is a good movie for families as long as their children are old enough not to be disturbed by some of the violence. This is not a movie to watch if you're looking for tortured genius or scathing social commentary. It is, however, a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon.
B000066NW0|5.0|Aight ya'll, all I can say is Avril is THE best no matter what your hater friend tells u!  Avril can rock with the best of em!  You've all heard her first single, \\"Complicated\\" and I know you love it!  If you dont, YOU WILL!!  And I promise you if you loved \\"Complicated\\", you'll bend over backwards to hear her other rockin songs from her debut album \\"Let Go\\"!  Avril's wicked lyrics keep one wanting more, and that's just what you'll get with tracks like \\"Sk8r Boi\\" (my personal FAVE) and \\"Mobile\\".  She's not ALL hardcore with tracks like \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\".  Every one of the 13 songs on the album ROCK!!  Go out NOW and get this slammin CD!  AVRIL ROCKS LIKE POP ROCKS!!!
B000009HPP|5.0|Grace is probably my favorite single album.  I bought sketches not really knowing what to expect, and got more than I hoped.  The first CD is all professionally done studio tracks that Jeff recorded with his band in between Grace and his death.  This disc is incredible.  If he had released that alone as his second album it would have easily met the expectations set among his fans by Grace.  'The Sky is a Landfill', 'New Year's Prayer', and 'Morning Theft' are three incredible songs  that come on tracks 1, 7 and 8, and hold this incredible CD together.  The only tracks I'm not as fond of are 9 and 10, but still this is an incredible CD.<br />The second CD is not as impressive at first listen.  It is more tragic.  The different mixes of 'Nightmare by the Sea' and especially of 'New Year's Prayer' that start this off are actually better than the mixes on the first CD.  Then come 7 tracks that Jeff made at home preparing for the studio sessions that were to lead the 'My Sweetheart the Drunk'.  As his mother explains in the liner notes, these are just Jeff at home with his four track.  The sound quality isn't as good, but you can still feel the artistry coming through.  The last track rivals 'Hallelujah' as the best cover ever.  'Satisfied Mind' is a particularly appropriate song to finish off this CD.  Overall, the second disk is not as fun to have in the CD player all the time, but if you listen to both CD's, you can just hear what would have been' Jeff's final version of the album coming together, and it would have been awesome.  Put together some of the best of the first CD with full versions of the stuff on the second, and you would have gotten a CD maybe even more masterful than 'Grace'.  If you like Jeff Buckley, you need this CD before anything else of his but 'Grace'.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|I have never understood the panning of a film because it strays from the true story, so let's just get that out of the way. This is not an accurate portrayal of John Nash's life. That being said, let's look at the film as entertainment.<br />The story concerns a man - a mathematician at Princeton - who lives in a world of delusions. He hallucinates and speaks to people who do not exist except to him. To him they are real and interact in his life in a positive and negative way. The scenes with Nash and the non-real characters are the most interesting part of the movie. When he is medicated to bring him back, or to keep him in our reality, he can no longer function in a world of academics and mathematics. A world he values. He makes the decision to stop the medication and live with his delusions. Most of the film takes place before he makes this decision and if there is a flaw in the film this is it. The many years that pass between stopping the medication and the Noble Prize award ceremony at the end zipped by like the roadrunner. I am certain Ron Howard meant for us viewers to wonder who was real and who was not real for as long as possible and I can't argue with that. It worked for me. <br />The expression of love from John Nash to his wife in the audience at the award ceremony at the end of the film did not quite ring true for me as he was quite unlikable and nasty through most of the film. My wife, on the other hand, went through several tissues. Many tears were shed. <br />The cast is first rate. Another nice Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer (soft spoken and menacing even as a good guy)performance, and if you compare Russel Crowe in Gladiator to the John Nash role in this film you will appreciate the fine job he does. I liked the movie. I was entertained and what more can you ask. Just go see it as a movie and not a true story and you might like it too.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is the ultimate rockstar. With her current single &quot;complicated&quot; being rotated and as of last week being #2 on TRL, Avril is making a pretty good name for herself. Her debut cd &quot;let go&quot; features ballads like &quot;I'm with you&quot; and &quot;naked&quot;, while she rocks on with &quot;my world&quot;, &quot;sk8ter boi&quot;, and &quot;mobile&quot;. Her lyrics include life of an adolecent looking forward toward womanhood, this relates to every tennage girl in the country. Avril's new disc is basically diary into her mind. She seems more of real artist because she even wrote all of her songs and plays a guitar! How more real can you get? Avril is awesome and she is #1 in my book. Best of Luck to her.
