B0071XO8RA|5.0|Didn't completely grab me in the very beginning, but by the first &#34;cleaning&#34; I was hooked. I'm invested in Juliette and sticking with her to the end.... Just hoping she makes it.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Too many ads that are too long. Ad free version not available for the kindle fire. Otherwise,it's good. Now I am adding words.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I really like music...I really dont like working out.  I try and swim as a supplement to my gym routine and have always thought of swimming as boring as there is no music and swimming gets old quick for me.  I was really excited to use an underwater MP3 player because listening to music while I work out adds to the time I spend in the gym.<br /><br />It was easy to download music I did about 300 songs on mine and the time was the same as loading my Zune or Ipod Nano.  Sound was ok but what do you expect swimming underwater.  Never adjusted the speakers once I got them in position.  I have used 3 times and each time I have noticed I am in the pool longer than normal as the music keeps me motivated.<br /><br />I have never used an underwater MP3 player but the Finis is better than I would have expected.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|GREAT BOOK.  I just felt it was a little bit too slow at times... and really hate there is yet another BOOK to follow.  To me it could have probably ended is some chapters were not so drug out and even a bit boring.  I will continue to read the next tho.  All in all just not really thrilled like I wad for this BOOK.  Hopefully it is a bit more exciting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is a heartbreaking love story: Young romantic love, love shared between parents and their children, and love shared between friends .  The character development is superb.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Great stuff!! David T does a fabulous job,  Very moving, pulled me right along into the plot - looking forward to more of this story!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it is one of the greatest game ever on the earth. I so think all kids should get it. It is great.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing author. Always keeps you guessing!  The book had so many twists and turns and was incredibly interesting. Couldn't put it down!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The standing case is a great accessory for the Kindle Fire HD and makes it very easy to use when traveling.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I will keep reviewing this show and you can bet that they'll all be great. Just like the show. It can be funny, sad, intense,  and exciting all at the same time,  or it can keep you in suspense until one of these traits shows up in the next episode...
B005544V6A|5.0|A great show that highlights how the business world really works. Not for people that have high morals though. It can teach you some decent tactics on manipulation though.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game was not of any interest at all.  It is so boring.  There has to be more to it to hold ones interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun with this game......I actually feel like a minion running and jumping!!!!!!!!!!!!!:-)).......This game is officially my favorite now,go minions!!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend friends to play this game!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins'  sequel to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is a gritty story of a government ruling it's people and fighting back to the death in order to maintain that control. With female heroin, Katniss Everdeen highlighting the narrative of the novel, it's a much better ride than it's astounding predecessor. I found Katniss' humanity and ferocity to continually care for others outside herself in spite of the daily reminders that terrible people are out there willing to kill for entertainment magnificent. Collins' description of the island and her ability to manage so many characters, old and new, is amendable.<br /><br />Peeta's character doesn't have as much dialect as he did in the first book, but the strength he is presented with in this book was great! He has no one to live for and still chooses to put Katniss and her family ahead of him. Come to think of it, that might be what makes him so human!<br /><br />There are so gory descriptions of death, but I did miss some more of the elaborate descriptions Collins' provides in the prequel.<br /><br />All in all, great quick read!
B0090EJ99A|1.0|Very distasteful humor needed less criticism of the different cultures displayed in the movie. Should have toned down the use of children to display sexual context.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|My son and I watched this movie and liked the action and drama....but the end of the movie didn't understand how TC came back to life and ended back up on earth with his wife??  Maybe we both missed something...that is our only complaint.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Timeless and relevant even today. Bradbury will amaze you if you let him. I admit the stories start off slow and a little cheeseball but when he hits his stride in Usher 2 and never lets you forget why he is the heavy hitter of sci fi. Funny, tragic, ridiculous, and poignant.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Under the thinly veiled guise of an academically researched presentation of the \\"Good News\\" concerning Jesus of history; A scathing and brutal, difficult to read, attack on Christianity, Jews, the Bible, and Jesus the Christ. Liberals, atheists, jihadist minded Muslims will be delighted, while all others should definitely pass on this one.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|We rented this before the Sea Of Monsters came out just to refresh our memories. I really love this series!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I think the movie was a little slow at times but overall interesting.  I grew up in this era and remember the hostage crisis well.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this app I've played it for a while now. It keeps you busy and is always adding new stuff!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was long overdue for reading this novel.  My high school English teacher encouraged us to read about Jean Valjean!!!
B000784WMW|5.0|I cannot believe that there are people who hate this version!  This was a 1983 TV series that is very well done.<br /><br />  I confess to liking the 2006 Toby Stevens version a little bit better than this one, but ONLY because this one is a bit slower than most.  It DOES However, pay more attention to DETAIL - something that few people appreciate these days.<br /><br />****  I do have one Tip:  Don't try to watch it all at one time ... it's far to LONG.  Watch it one or two Episodes at a time and you just might like it better.
B00122HT04|4.0|I would highly recomend this album! Go get it today! Avenged Sevenfold is amazing both lyricly and musically! What are you waiting for?!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I played this game for 3 days and it said I needed to get the app update-so I click to update and the app store only gives me the option to open the app, not update. So I click &quot;open&quot; and I'm told again to update the app. I can't play bc I can't update bc the app store has no update. Irritated.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|What's not to love with this guy? You can always count on been for a smile.... just ask him a question.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is one version I hope to get very soon!  I've seen it on PBS a number of times and it is very well done.  In my opinion this 2006 version is every bit as good as the 1983 Timothy Dalton version.<br /><br />  Toby Stevens delivers a strong personality for Mr. Rochester and Ruth Wilson is an exceptional Jane Eyre!<br /><br />  One of the many reasons I love this version is that it has so much more detail and comes in 3 full Episodes!
B008NF45S2|5.0|Found my printer right away.  Did have to manually install the driver, but after that it's been working like a charm.  Have even advised to others to load this app for their printer.
B00CL1SR7O|4.0|The CD arrived before the expected delivery date in excellent condition, without any damage to the package. It was a gift for my little brother and he loves the CD
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This is an interesting story but is goes on forever.  The author tells about many generations at the same time.  You better keep notes so you have them all straight.  It would have been better if it were much shorter.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|If you like eve, elite, tradewars, etc. just buy it. It is incredibly good and has continual, frequent updates. This is my favorite game on any platform.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Asia deliver in spades once again.<br />80's supergroup Asia return with their best effort since their first album (yes, they were albums back then) with the new CD, XXX.<br />Now kiddies, do not type Asia XXX in your Google search engine (especially if you are looking up images)! but youtube Asia, Face on the Bridge.<br />This is the first single off the XXX album and it is a ripper.<br />Other tracks to look out for are: Bury me in Willow and Judas.<br />To me, the standout is the last song, Ghost of a chance - one word - WOW!<br />Seriously, Asia have aged well and this is a must in any CD collection!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really good game really passes the time, I really enjoy playing it with my Hunan d and it really helps me problem solve
B00CH26TL8|3.0|not as much fun as I thought it would be.  very disappointed, not very challenging, played it once and I was done.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The movie definitely held my attention.  All the basics of a post apocaliptic world.  But if the alien had all those clones doing nothing, why not send them in to destroy everyone instead of wasting all the time having the drones look for them?
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this easy read!  I ride the metro daily and like something that keeps me entertained and wanting to come back for more.  Good love story!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Says update needed but won't let you update. Please fix soon I really like this game, I want to be able to play again
B0086700CM|3.0|not as much fun as I thought it would be.  very disappointed, not very challenging, played it once and I was done.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie!  Reminds you what is truly important in life and what true, honest friendship really feels like!
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Four Stars for Safe Haven.  If you like Nicholas Sparks, you'll like this book by him.  He writes with his usual flow that keeps you turning the pages.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am always interested in what happens when we shed this costume/ego. This journey of a scientist  makes it very believable and fills my heart with hope and lessens any fear of the unknown.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Occasionally Ms. Roberts steps out of the 'girl-meets-boy, neither-likes-each-other, together-love-and-kisses, the-end' genre and writes a story, or series, that are based more on a good plot line, than typical romance. This is her best yet. Of course, there is  woman and man. Of course there is a romance, but that isn't the story-line. This has a plot about search and rescue dogs, figuring out the mind of a killer, fully-rounded characters.<br /><br />One of my favorite fiction books. When I want something I don't have to think deeply on. It has a little suspense, a little romance, a lot of dogs.  I re-read it every couple of years.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy book to read, only took me like 2 days. Just as good as the 1st book and equally hard to put down.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|liked the story and the characters, couldnt imagine life like that. would recommend to others, read for my book club
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I wish that I could play more levels for free!!!  WHY NOT GAME GUYS????? Would give 5starz if I got a few mor levels.
0142405809|5.0|I love the author.. like her other books, such a nice story.., very cute, and also nice illustrations..<br />my daughter loves it... i think i read it at least 50 times already...
1250029465|5.0|I loved this book and well worth spending part of your day with. The storytelling is great and you can really hear the \\"voice\\" of James as you read it and he explains their story. As one person said in the video, \\"it's great to see the story of a young man who lost his way but found it again with the help of a loyal cat\\". I lived in the UK for a number of years and now understand the purpose of organizations such as the Big Issue and what they are trying to do as well as the invisible homeless. You just don't realize that these are people are trying to turn their lives around but starting 10 steps behind everybody else.<br /><br />Can't wait for the second book to be available in the US in Kindle format (it's on UK site but you can't download it if you have a US account).
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My first book by Neil Gaiman, and I really enjoyed it. It's one of those books that you'll just fly though. I read it over a weekend sitting beside the beautiful St. Joe River in Idaho. Definitely worth checking out.
B00004RF97|5.0|This is a great light comedy with several of the best stars of the era.  A favorite in our house. Not to be missed!
0142407542|5.0|we also have The gruffalo.. my daughter loves it together.. i just love both story.. very creative and clever. highly recommended
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|If you are not really caring about Hi def, well this one is for you. These four movies are on one disc 2 sided. The Quality for picture and sound is ok. But I think they should have put them on 4 discs.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Good book. I learned a lot. I'm avoiding Wheat almost always. Which is hard if you love Mexican/Texican food. But it's worth it. Will have Papacitos on my Birthday, but it's been helping a lot. Feel better, lost a few Lbs. without really trying.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is a classic that everyone should see!  Great story and cast, and it's so well known that there are tons of references to it in pop culture.  I didn't see it until my mid-twenties, and all through the movie I kept thinking: &#34;Oh, *that's* where that line comes from!&#34;  See it tonight - you won't be sorry!
0142402753|5.0|nice, heart-warming story, with nice illustration. i have a couple books written by the author... this is one of the favorite.. i bought this book when my daughter was 3 years old.. she liked it very much.. she still likes it.. very much..
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|We downloaded the free version of this and my son loves it! There are just enough activities included to please him for awhile. Would love it if you could earn points to unlock new options but haven't been able to thus far. Definitely won't be delelting this anytime soon. :)
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Anthony is obviously not famous for his writing skills, but he's a pretty good storyteller and has had an unusual life to say the least.  What strikes me the most is his authentic voice and brutal honesty.  It's refreshing in a world of people who typically cover up who they really are.
B000002L7R|5.0|Prince's sixth album showed him stretching his wings and getting creative and interesting, even psychedelic.  Two top ten hits and double-platinum status make this one worth a listen.  Check it out!
0142501123|5.0|very cute story with nice illustrations... i also recommends the gruffalo, gruffalo's child, the spiffiest giant in town, where's my mom.. my daughter loves all those stories... i read those so many times.. now...
B008K3HRF0|5.0|sweet movie - cute charaters - was a free digital copy with original purchase - what more could you ask for!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think I just had high expectations for Khaled's book because The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are two of my favorite books.  He still is a remarkable storyteller who captures the poignancy of the human  ability to be beautiful and kind while being so twisted and sick.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love this series. I love the fact that it is futuristic, yet rustic. I enjoyed the interactions of the cast and the whole story, the movie Serenity. The only thing I did not like was that it only lasted one season and was cancelled.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Thr interface is pretty nice and it is easy to edit photos. However when I try to save the finished work to my phone (samsung gakaxy s3) it doesn't actually generate the image files. I tried manually entering the file path and still no luck. I wish you could save and modify the default save location as part of the app settings. Having to specify it for every file save is stupid. The app looks nice and all but without the ability to save your work, its useless. I hope they publish an update.
B00003CXA6|2.0|This dvd was not as advertised (like new)!  The dvd had skips and froze in the middle of the 2nd day!!  I will not ever buy from this supplier again!  Also, I hope you don't either!
B0073COMUW|5.0|I ordered these for my wife's office, she's a graphic designed. I installed 8 recessed light fixtures and these bulbs in about a 200sf rooms and it's amazing. The daylight white is perfect for her art prints. These are BY FAR the brightest LED bulbs I've seen.
B008220C56|2.0|this movie reminded of Moulin Rouge in many ways, except for one crucial factor - the frantic, intoxicating energy of MR was missing. making for a somewhat dull movie. The stage concept was just silly - i get it, life is one big stage. But what is such a voluptuous story and in many ways an actress's dream is just lost in all this nonsense.
0783231032|5.0|Love this comedy. Even though it's very silly and campy, it makes for a great late night movie. John Belushi makes me laugh just looking at him.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Good story line and character development. The absurdity of the retiree coming back as the bad-ass hero is compelling to say the least...very funny!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I have avoided &#34;classics&#34; since Silas Marner was forced upon me in high school, causing me to miss delightful books such as Emma.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Clever lines, intricate revenge theme, big guns and John Malcovich steals every scene he is in. Oh  and the good guys win. What could go wrong with that?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wanted a game that was entertaining, time warping, and not too mindless so I can relax while the hubby watches sports.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was great!!! I only wish it kept going!!! Definittely not long enough for me. This was one of my favorites so far.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|Was prompted to download while accessing another app. No real instructions on how to play. But, my daughter enjoys playing it.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Heartwarming and cute movie! Only a little bit of violence. My eight year old and I loved it. We are looking forward to seeing the next one.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Enjoyed book. characters were very interesting. Good read. Disappointed with the ending. Not sure if I would recommend it 3 stars
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the show! Works great on the instant video, I am going to watch the rest of the seasons as well!
B00DB31Y3U|1.0|If you like to hover around the bedroom and a/c ducks this app might be for you. I think it's not bad for six years olds but that's as far as it could reach in terms of the age group. ..
1449320104|5.0|This is a very well organized, straight to the point book - just as the title suggests. Explanations are clear and concise without all of the other minutia that bogs down other technical programming books. If I had to have just one C# reference, this would be it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|i really like this series, but the battles are a bit tedious.  Many characters to keep track of too. But a great story
B00AG297GK|2.0|As usual his movie is pointless. But did have a few moments that made me laugh out loud. I did not expect anything so it was okay at best.
B0090SI4OC|3.0|Rating lower since digital copy does not work in CANADA ... This was the principle reason to purchase the product fron Amazon .. Not satisfied since it should not be sold if digital copy worthless ...
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I rate this book a ten star.<br />Because I like really violent and bloody books.<br />Everybody should read this book.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|The idea was good but it was poorly done. The inside her head voice got really annoying and the acting wasn't all that great. It just got really annoying overall.
0345479092|5.0|I love this book. Every idea she had worked like a charm! My baby is the best sleeper & very predictable on her schedule. I also never had to guess why she was crying because I already knew! LOVE this book!!!
B009CF7GRY|1.0|updating this movie was pointless as placing it in modern times just doesn't fly or feel real.  Stick to the original movie.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Movie was cute. Technically the sound was awful, Sound effects and music too loud compared to the rest of the movie. Watched the whole movie with my finger on the volume button on the remote.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I picked it after google reader decided to go away, really enjoy the format and interface. Big picture and teaser headline help me choose which stories to check in to.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Prior to reading this book I must admit to not knowing who Tesler was. I consider myself lucky to have stumbled upon this little gem.I now feel my education lacking for never having learned about this genius of a man. The importance of his inventions are massive. One can only guess what he might have accomplished if he'd had the necessary support. Great writing by Sean Patrick made a potentially complex subject easily accessible.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in learning. I would like to see it as mandatory reading for all adolescents and young adults. I think they would be well served by the story of Tesler and the importance of following ones own path.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I hated to see the show come to an end.  You should know the result of the stories from the beginning. but I was very surprised.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Of course this is my personal oppinion.<br /><br />I'm the kind of person that has a very high musical appreciation, who listens to music more than the lyrics. However, in this case I paid attention to both as much, that's why I enjoy B. Sprinsteen's work so much, and I came to the conclusion that this is the best B.S. album since \\"Born in the USA\\" taking into account that it's my #1 album. The musical work by The E. S. B. is supperb and richer in sounds than ever. The lyrics are the kind for a mature person who considers facts rather than fiction or personal drama, which music is so overloaded with.<br /><br />In conclusion, This is my #2 Born in the U.S.A. along with Born t... & Nebraska.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I can finally get back to my life because I have finished all seasons of Fringe.  It really had me hooked!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up and easy to use, love the youtube queuing feature but definetely needs more applications and support. Looking forware to the future.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Good app and free.  Works well and use as a back up 2nd alarm when I dont have another with me.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for although every book that I've gotten that been written by Scott Kelby has been outstanding and easy to understand.
0486282112|5.0|&#34;By the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open, it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay<br />To mould me Man, did I solicit thee<br />From darkness to promote me?&#34;<br /><br />A young Swiss student discovers the secret of animating lifeless matter and, by assembling body parts, creates a monster who vows revenge on his creator after being rejected from society. It is not long before he regrets his creation and woes himself.<br /><br />As I was reading Frankenstein, I was behooved. It was very moving and poignant, every sentence seemed to convey powerful images to my mind, and seemed to convey much in a short way. The way Victor Frankenstein spoke and described nature echoed the pantheistic and poetic verse of Wordsworth. It felt like I was reading poetry in prose form. I was especially amazed the way the &#34;fiend&#34; spoke to the doctor. We feel sympathy for the monster, but his crimes make us hate him. He is a tragic here like Macbeth who blames his creator. But I believe Victor was penitent for his sin, and harbored the idea of revenge for the monster. We are a witness to the testings and trials of both. I highly recommend reading this short but powerful work.<br /><br />It was an awesome book. Thank you Mary Shelley.
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|This film completely failed to reach its own perception of itself as profound.  When Natalie Portman is skating and quoting Romeo and Juliet I kept wondering what the significance of that dialogue was. Very little if any- we move from Shakespeare to the ensemble cast singing, \\"Sweet Caroline.\\"  And that too had the failed high jump of pulling the plot and characters together in any profound way.  Each development in story and character was kitsch at best and very little of the sentimental resolutions mattered.  It would have been better to just keep it as it was- a tired plot of a reunion of 20 somethings mourning the end of childhood. Nothing in this film was funny, smart or otherwise unique.<br /><br />The cast however did indeed redeem its own lack of substance. Portman is the only high point- one scene with Rosie O'Donnell was funny (although cliche) and Uma always has some sort of provocative edge.  But my God- what a loser of a script.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Love this series of books about Harry Hole.  Sad to see that he is gone - wonder what is next????
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This was a good movie; reminiscent of Huck Finn adventures. McConaughey scruffed up really well for this and was totally believable.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was having fun playing this game and today it wanted me to update. Now it says go to app store when I get to app store it says open when I press open back to game which says go to app store. back and forth back and forth and CAN NOT get game to open to play!!! NOT HAPPY!!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is a great movie with a great ending! I wasn't expecting it to be so good for some reason? I love MM & his acting ability so I rented it based on that alone~I was pleasantly surprised! Gotta, gotta see movie!!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I love Dexter!  Sad that Season 8 is the last :(<br /><br />This one doesn't have you biting your nails as some of the past seasons but is still VERY good!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The best in James Camerons movies. He gets better with age and this movie has the adventure and promise of any species to be better than man. Totally fantastic in 3D and the action is awesome. Worth the amount in 3D format just to see all those colors, action and adventure come alive.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This story is a realistic sequence of events that are sad and scary.  How one can overcome and survive such horrific acts is unthinkable.  Jaycee's story is one of a true survivor and a big heart.
B000W022XG|5.0|This is the best make out album is for liberal pensive types...or for me, in any case. Languid is the rhythm, engaged & questioning are the lyrics...removed enough in style to be unobtrusive
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Love this movie. So funny, I'm buying it! Watched it while on a plane and was laughing out loud the whole time.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Should be read when you are young as well as when you are an adult.  There is no one like Mr. Clemens.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I found it challenging and a lot of fun. I am just a little upset the my kids did better than I did.
0425252868|5.0|A great story but also personal since my great grandfather is involved and mentioned in this moment of eventful history.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Very well written book, well thought through and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.
B0070DQZ86|4.0|It was really good. The internet connection wasn't that great, but this director's cut was pretty nice. It explained a lot from the theatrical version.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This is really a good read.  I will probably read it again in the future.  This is true Jodi Picoult.
B00005V9HH|4.0|The twist, building and build-up seem so carefree, casual, and simple.  Still this is the movie that proves the writing and acting is what makes a movie great.
141659521X|5.0|Mitch my all time favorite character. I always read these stories with a look between the lines. Going to miss his story coming to end, but all great things end sometime.<br />Brad Thor very compatible with his character in his series.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The novel did not hold up in the sense of the characters actions and/or thoughts.  Deception sunk the ability to believe the characters had any understanding of what they were doing.  Also, the author was busy dropping names of authors either to prove they did or didn't matter to the story--I couldn't tell which.  Particularly, the main female character was unbelievable.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was very happy with this game until it updated! When I open it it tells me to go to app store to update. Once there it doesn't have an update just tells me to open it. So disappointed. This was my downtime game. Something I did when waiting for kids etc. PLEASE FIX!!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great! Can't wait for the rest of it! I thought there was a part II - it was so good.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This new book by Neil Gaiman is more of a novella than a novel. It is deceptively simple in it's story of a young boy who meets a strange family of women with unique powers. The consequences of this special relationship are haunting and provocative, leaving the reader with more questions than answers. The theme of people being given whatever they want or crave, and the damage that can happen as a result, makes this a relevant and disturbing fairy tale for modern times. That women are depicted as powerful but compassionate is a refreshing antidote to all those wicked queens and evil stepmothers.
B0040ORC1M|4.0|Thought Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were wonderfully cast.  Their stories were well done and seemed to be accurate.  I would recommend this film.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I like that this book was written in Ky's and Cassia's point of view, but that was also why I didn't like other parts of it.
B004UIOUHC|2.0|This did work out for me.  I think I got confused between the mobile version and the mini version.  And it takes up too much room.
B008476HBM|5.0|It was a joy to re-immerse myself in 19th century prose. Reading it in ebook form is a special treat, as you can open a dictionary just by touching the word in question. Also, having seen several movies and TV series retelling the tale, it was good to go back to the original, and reconsider the various film versions in light of the book.
0770437400|5.0|It's an awesome book that takes you through several stories in the zombie apocalypse. The book is easy and fun to read.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The show takes you back to a time that few people can imagine and gives an interesting look of how things were in those days. The plot is never boring and the actors are truly a delight to watch. It is a real treat for your mind and gives your brain a vacation from the redundant reality tv shows.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The writing just flowed. I felt caught up by a wave of emotional involvement with people and was blown away by the skill of Khahed Hossein in making them all come together with such natural grace.<br /><br />I haven't read anything so stunning for ages.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not care for this book as much as I thought I would.  It is OK but not great.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A beautiful spellbinding novel. I couldn't put it down. The words make one question all memories and dreams as to their possible reality.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works perfectly! very easy to sep up (almost plug and play) and receives wifi signal quite smoothly! i see HD youtube videos without any delay
0307891372|4.0|A player without this tool would never enjoy the full game and probably never find a lot of areas on thier own.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book! Suspense and turns! I couldn't put the book down. Lost sleep over reading what he would do next!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is the bomb!!! Start with a poor country and wait till everyone in the world is infected and then start your symptoms becuase syptoms are what kill.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Maybe I skimmed the description, but I found many more features than I expected in PicShop. It worked great with my Kindle Fire (pre-HD), and I've had the itch to try out all its featured for two days now. The sketch option is no good with just a finger, though that's not their fault. I should have skipped three previous graphics apps trusting something like this was out there.
B00D41H2PS|4.0|Love mysteries and love being able to get lost in the game- good story line, graphics aren't bad either.quick n easy
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Great movie, genre breaking.  Not your typical superhero in this flick, so prepare to be surprised.  Watch this, you will not regret it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|It was a great movie.  We really enjoy watching it again and again.  I was a bit nervous about the movie compared to the other Bourne movies.  It was good and had nice tie in.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I have been reading Wheel of Time for more than half of my life, waiting for this conclusion. Reread the entire series one more time after this book came out, just to savour the uncertainity. A Memory of Light truly fullfilled all my hopes for WoT.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|works fine on galaxy lll. Images sometimes a little dark for these old eyes. puzzles are quite clever.  liked the final jigsaw
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to begin!  Was sad for the way the third season ended.  I enjoyed seeing the historical reality of what life was like in that day and time.
1423140591|4.0|This is great light read.  It is very action pact.  I feel it was a big set up book.  It made a bit harder to read but I did enjoy the read.  My daughter loves the book and has read it multiple times.
1400052181|5.0|From a hard working woman to enjoy. Easy read, each time given it was greatly appreciated. There's is not much more to say great book enjoy.
0385349947|4.0|I'm sure some of the things she has to say will be controversial, but there are many great quotes here.  Of course, I was hoping for the &#34;answer&#34; to dealing with bias in a male-based industry, but life isn't that easy.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I love this movie. It's too bad it didn't get the appreciation it deserves when it first came out. It is such a good story of adolescent struggle, and learning what is important in life. It'll leave you with a smile on your face and the desire to go do what you are passionate about, too!
1423113462|4.0|This is great light read.  It is very action pact.  It was a set up book.  I did enjoy the read.  My daughter loves the book and has read it multiple times.
B00CX7OW1G|2.0|Bought this video strictly because Ben Affleck was in it.  Mistake.  Tried hard, but just couldn't take any interest in the film.  It just rambled on and on and painfully on.  I really should get a refund on this one, it's not worth the price.  Won't make this mistake again, ever!  Ben you let me and many others down.
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|This was a book selected by my book club. I would not have finished it otherwise. While I appreciated a lesson on England geography, I enjoyed nothing else about this book. The story and characters were boring.
1595141715|5.0|This is a terrific book that will change the way you think about how we interact with each other on a daily basis. A compelling read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A rare treat - DeMille's John Corey meet Paul Brennan in the same adventure, which takes place (mostly) in Yemen and accordingly we get to learn about the culture of the people in a new land.  Both hilarious and dramatic, if you have liked any of his other John Corey books, you will like this one (Corey is the dominant character; Brennan not so much).  A great read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nice to have this electronically now I can take it anywhere without having a big text book weight. Must get this
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Oblivion is a wonderful film with some great philosophical elements to ponder. In many ways, it is a parable that mirrors Genesis, where a \\"perfect\\" couple Jack and Victoria live with little worry in an Eden like state where all of their needs are supplied. They are ruled by an authoritative voice, telling them how to live and what to do, in the form of Sally. Their \\"sin\\" is that of curiosity, as Jack sought knowledge of the world, instead of his simple task to live well and perform menial tasks. His command is to perform Sally's bidding in obedience, ignorant of the past or even future.  Of course, the wakeup-call of that knowledge leads to rebellion, and ultimately expulsion.<br /><br />I find it interesting with the analog that Sally is shown to be an incredibly powerful AI, instead of the expected alien beings, with a singular voice, even proclaiming to be Jack's creator and God. Sally shows some concern for Jack and Victoria, though, Sally is an angry and vengeful force when disobeyed, with her  drones sweeping in like angels from above to smite.<br /><br />It begs the question if there was a different undertone to the story beyond the simple \\"aliens invade and exterminate everyone\\". Perhaps as an intelligent being, Sally chose two of Humanity's \\"best\\" to start the Earth anew, while whipping out the \\"evil\\" of the old world with floods and fire. Perhaps Sally was both malevolent and benevolent, instead of a simple destructive force as seen in the eyes of the human survivors fighting their war. If Sally had succeeded, would she have left Jack and Victoria to repopulate the Earth after she had gone?
1440503257|4.0|I think every fantasy book should have its own cookbook. I love reading the recipes for the foods inspired by and featured in Harry Potter. It's particularly interesting to see the difference in English cuisine versus American cuisine.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very easy read.  This was a great story based on true events in history.  It was truly amazing what the kids went through.
B004AFFZNI|4.0|using it so i can run an external mic for Motovlogging, its a case with a hole in it so i didn't have to sacrifice my waterproof one, not sure what else to say
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great show . Can't wait to see rest of seasons . Acting is brilliant. Hated pulling for the drug dealer , but couldn't help myself.
0307454541|1.0|I couldn't get into this book. I wanted to, since everyone else seemed to be. But I couldn't. I didn't finish it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the acting and the story. Every season, I think the story gets better.  It is one of my favorite programs!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one you may play alone or with the kids. Clues may be anywhere and fun to figure out. None of the levels were too difficult - anxious for more!
B000IDEORY|5.0|A must see for all! Always feel better after watching Patrick and Jennifer fall in love. The music and dancing get you out of your seat!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book should change you. I have read that some people didn't think it was all that great, and to that I have to respond that they just didn't get it. It's a remarkable story of growth, change, struggle, and healing. I loved this book. It touched my heart and inspired me to look at not only flowers, but life, in a new way.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|I'm a rational person stuck in a bible thumping red state, (Indiana). Mr Harris' book offered me a glimpse into a possible, but sadly unlikely, future in which civilization shakes off the bonds of superstition.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|This is, in my opinion, probably one of the best seasons of this show. Definitely in the groove and before the story lines got too messy
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever if you like it for kindle then get (this app is only for kindle) pocket editor! it is a minecraft cheat app where you can get almost every item. GO MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is an excellent read for teens who feel that they are the &#34;wallflowers&#34; of their social groups - but even more than that, it's a great read for anyone. It highlights what is really important, how to be yourself, and how to accept others as they are. The lessons in this book translate to any age group.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Very funny and good for the whole family to watch. The amimation is really good and the characters are great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting book.  You will have to watch the movie.  The book is more into detail.  A must book to read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is really good for little girls! The ponies are so cool! And I don't think that this app has &quot;in app purchases&quot;.
B005TBWN0K|1.0|I could really love this app, but whenever I try to start from a blank page the app crashes after just one minute and I lose all of the work I just did. I was going to attempt too use Stitch for concept maps in my history class, but I simply don't trust it! Please somehow fix this bug!!!!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I have used a similar version of this on my iPhone for the better part of two years.  In fact that is why I chose this particular calculator.  It works quite well and I have not had a bad situation with it EVER.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|The only reason i would not recommend this movie is if you have a problem with the premise of Transformers. But if you are like me and find the prospect of giant robot battles exciting then this is a great picture.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I love I can listen to the podcasts offline on my phone and tablet. It was free, so that's even a plus.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Typical Tom Cruise type of movie. Wanted to see more of Morgan Freeman not that great in my opinion but worth a rental if you need your Sci-Fi fix.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|An easy read, even in little chunks (I read it during my commute to and from work on my kindle and it works great for that).  The ideas really stick with me when I think about people trying to make changes in all areas, it's a book I've wanted my friends to read to discuss, and I have certainly taken away lots of little ideas that have helped me feel empowered toward making changes in my own life and work.  I look forward to trying to apply these ideas!
B000002OMN|5.0|Cd is in great shape and plays great. Extremely happy with the purchase and will buy more at a later date.
B003E88TKS|5.0|The movie gives you an insight on the life of a busy businessman who travels very often for work. It inspires you to become a frequent flyer member yourself. It also shows the importance of loving relationship and the impact of family on one life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have tried many different DVDs over the years, none of which I have stuck with. 30 day Shred is challenging, but something I know I can stick with. I like that it has three levels to keep you challenged and seeing results. The very best thing about this video is the length of the workout, it is under 30 minutes, which for me is fabulous because I am a new mom and only really have time to workout during nap time.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie with a great sense of humor, a bit reminiscent of another zombie fave \\"Shaun of the dead\\".
B008FRFN7A|4.0|The app works fine but does not print email. If this were the case, this app would get 5 stars.
B00CFA227C|4.0|I enjoyed the bluray. The director took a different twist to the story and I enjoyed the way he approched it.
1118490371|5.0|Perfect book for me - just what I needed to get me started. Would recommend to any novice programmer plus reasonably priced!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I have this app on my Iphone and really have fun using it. It is just as fun to use on my Android tablet!
B004GYY714|5.0|i put this on my ipod and i love it now i can listen to my music everywhere i go
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is so good, i hate three fact that i have to wait till next summer for the next season.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|True story of a great patriot. I have watched this movie many many time and I'm still moved by it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's song as some of the best around, I would buy another album in a heartbeat when she has more...
B006AZZPCM|4.0|When your downloading MP3 format songs they should downloaded as MP3 and not in that format it comes in make it better....
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Awesome movie! Entertaining, it is something different.  I didn't think I would like it but it was intriguing enough to order.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She brings a whole new era to music.  My wife and I love to listen to her music and look forward to more releases.  Ms. Lindsey, keep up the grand work and never bow your head.  You have earned your place in music history.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You are transported back to a time where the upperclass of England ruled everything and had no clue about the average citizen.  They lived in a world of their own.
B00D6M86RS|4.0|I downloaded this game to my kindle fire hd because my mom has it on her laptop....it has the same graphics and it is a lot of fun to play when I have to ride around with her.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Okay so I used to live in Pittsburgh so we thought it would be fun to watch this movie....of course we like Tom cruise as well. The move was really great until the actors spoke. The script was horrible! If you like car chases and bad ass violent main characters this is a great movie...i'd just watch it with the volume off.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|moved well and very entertaining as usual David B does a great job of keeping me interested, strongly recommend to all.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book gave me a lot to think about as a female sales manager in a male dominated career. About ready to start a family. Tons to think about. This book will Continue to be a guide as I traverse the waters of my life and career.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|well I guess it's ok I like it I think you should get it if you really want it - ______ -  #awesome
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The most amazing $35 tech item in the history of the world. I am enjoying mine and while it isnt an absolute media center replacement yet, for $35 it is pretty awesome.
B000TKZ3TO|5.0|My fave of all time! Love it . It made a great one of kind present.i dislike having to write a 18 word discription of why I like the product!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I would read the story at my grandmothers house and was always a fan of horror/suspense/thriller/supernatural movies.  Add Amanda Seyfried as red riding hood and you have a great movie.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Yeah! No one can keep Ky and Cassia apart! And if the society or the rising try anything, they'll be killed by Katniss!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|You would probably have to know how to read. I recommend for kids maybe 6 and up. Otherwise it's a.great game
B008Y73940|5.0|Despite the wonderful reviews it took me a long time to actually sit down and watch this movie. I was afraid it was going to be all about courtroom drama. I do enjoy those movies from time to time, but just haven't been in the mood to watch that type of movie. The acting was amazing and the plot was very good, lots of twists but not unbelievable.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I have always loved vampire movies and basically anything considered &#34;scary&#34;; add action, werewolves, family honor and even though they said this was a low budget movie, it will always be one of my favorites.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It validates what other NDErs have written about. Doesn't provide the secrets of the universe but offers the personal transformation this person went through and he shares it with us hoping we can be open minded and know this life is just another journey that us multidimensional being have to go through in our way into the eternity.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As an historian, I always wondered about the truth of Jesus/Christianity This book delivers a well researched argument for what really happened..
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|If you are on the fence about 3D Blu Ray in the same way that I was, trust the Life of Pi 3D Blu Ray to make you a believer. Terrific film, which is actually complimented by the 3D rather than forced as many films are nowadays. Best price that you find as well, this same package still going for around $34.99 at local retailers.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Seems to be fun so far. I will have to play a few more levels to see if it is great.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am annoying this game but wish I could play a little longer to determine it I want to buy the rest of it.  but I am enjoying it so far
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Since I first saw this movie as a child I have always loved it!!! Barbra is stellar in her film debut as Fanny Brice. Omar Shariff is also amazing in this role as her troubled gambling husband Nick Onsteen. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Great story, costumes, music and acting!!!!
0763657875|5.0|I'd gladly recommend this book, not only to travelers to London, but all folks - big & small. It was wonderful!.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read Ender's Game a couple of times .  Great series!  In my opinion Orson Scott Card is one of the best sci-fi authors.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can play this game till my coins run out then set it down for about two hours then run em out again!!! I love this game. :)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie is perfectly cast!  What a pleasure to watch Helen Miren be a hired gun!  We watched it twice!  Well cast, well written and somewhat different from the usual Bruce movie in that the comedy goes very well with the killing!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Bought the CD because of a few songs I loved and I love every song on this album.<br />If you love Radioactive and Demons, you'll love all of their songs.
B00005LW7R|5.0|Classical music has always been a big part of my life  growing up in the New Rochelle,NYso this recording is music to my ears......One time as a child my parents treated me to &#34;day in New York City&#34;.  My dad know someone at the New York Opera company so dad pulled strings for me  me hear and meet  the great Diva Maria Cassis.. I was HOOKED for life.  Thank you.<br />Ave Atque Vale,<br />Dr. Bob LupiNACCI,pHd
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I downloaded this app a while ago. When I first got it I loved it. Now.... not so much. It crashes my kindle all the time. I have had to 're-download it atleast 3 times the past month. Also it does not allow you to watch certain videos (on my kindle I can't watch Vevo music videos). Sometimes it works fast and loads great but, most of the time its very slow and it freezes alot. One other problem is that it will stop in the middle of a video and you have to let it load again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great season with many surprises and wonderful acting and casting as usual. Cannot wait for future seasons.  One of Masterpiece Classics's true masterpieces of television.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Thought the book was more of a biography but turned out to be a condensed chapter of his extensive life.  A drawn out opening with little to do with Teslas life and finishes the same way.  Good if you want the short and sweet of Nikola Tesla.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything about it.  Talent.  Wardrobe.  Cinematography.  Direction.  Story.  An in-depth look at what makes English life so interesting, especially to us anglophiles in America!
B002G1YPH0|1.0|After this was shipped to the wrong address, I later tried and get a replacement which would of costed me 9 Dollars. Let's get to facts: I payed 31 Dollars for the Hyper 212 Plus (Including one-day shipping) then make it 40 because of  somebody elses fault? Let's be real for a second, you want me to give you money for your own fault? After that I did get a replacement but I still give one star simply for the fact that: A part I needed was shipped to the wrong address (had my address and everything and they STILL failed) that it took one more day instead of the first day I put for shipping, which I basically wasted 3 dollars for shipping. Cooler Master is horrid when it comes to knowing simple knowledge.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An excellent history and cultural archeological treatment.  If you have a concordance with your bible, I recommend using it as a reference as you are moved from decade to decade.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|Though it's a Shakesperean story, the core of the plot is timeless. Greatly told. Very realistic. Translated into the true language of the heart. Great job Baz Luhrmann.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|I was looking to be able to play the game not just to learn about the levels.  It just was not what I expected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I have played. Never blurry. The competitions are amazing.Great graphics. No game could be as good as this one. I can't stop playing because this game is addictive. :) couldn't be any happier
B002PLALCO|5.0|Pink always has such great tours and they are incredibly energetic. There is a lot of great dancing and great music. Pink puts on a great show and really knows how to entertain a crowd. This is full of great Pink songs, including some really good covers of other famous songs.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I enjoyed the book. Thought it was better since it was recommended as great. It was good enough for me to finish reading.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|Alan played himself once again in this movie, but it was still refreshing and interesting.  And, of course Diane Keaton was outstanding.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Some people might find the game getting more difficult and that is because of the symptoms you might have in you virus so you want to get rid of all the symptoms so your virus will be un detectable. You can then wait until you have infected everyone on earth then get deadly symptoms.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best show on television. Story line and characters, excellent. I was told by my daughter that D A was very good a week before Season 3 started. I started watching Season 1 on amazon and was hooked after the first episode. I watched Seasons 1 &2 in 6 days in time to start watching Season 3 on PBS. I can't wait for Season 4.
B0031SCV46|5.0|This is my first Midi controller.  I've played around with my friends before so I'm familiar with them, but damn I love this one. It's got everything I need to record professional sounding piano tracks onto my record. And being that most of my songs.. Actually ALL of my songs have piano in them, this tool was greatly needed!<br /><br />I use this with Logic Pro 9 and it runs incredibly smoothly. And not to mention this was really easy setting up. all you do is plug it in.. Choose what instrument you want ... and then your good to go. The velocity sensitive keys work like a charm also.<br /><br />I recommend this if you are just starting out in the studio and don't want to spend too much money. Cause this sounds very professional and I know this will get the job done 100% fine.<br /><br />165$ is a reasonable price for what you get with this keyboard.<br />NOTW here I come.
1596177373|5.0|I love these cards. They are funky and cute. My neice loves them and tried to steal them from me when she first saw them. A great gift for any Tim burton fan.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|I have seen all 3, but this one is still the best of them.  The others do not have the same kind of thrill.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This book is an amazing journey for the reader as well as for the main character Nate.<br />When the story begins Nate is experiencing strange nightmares where he always seems to be facing death. Having lost his father and with his brother having been institutionalised by his mother, Nate feels he has no one he can confide in or call a true friend.<br />He learns to trust and finds friendships which help him to discover the truth about his nightmares as well as the special powers he possesses.<br />This book never stands still. The reader is rushed through amazing episodes as Nate learns to use the array of skills he possesses, escapes death and has to save the lives of those who are important to him.<br />The writing is detailed and creates a vivid picture for the reader of the world Nate inhabits.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is probably the most popular and best game I'd played in my middle school years and elementary school too. I really enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|There's no update for my device while my other siblings are having fun creating new things but I'm left in the dust... otherwise good game people u should get it
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love the entire franchise and although this had some kind of cheesy comedic moments, it was well worth the watch.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|If you read,  &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; you will be disappointed.  Just did not enjoy it.  Perhaps it was to many characters and to many changes in the time periods.<br /><br />Hope
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Love playing with the gf. Always turns into a make out session. Will keep playing forever. Never thought I would like it but I do.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it sucksand hhen i try to use a video it turs white and the audio plays oonly then when i shut my kindle down it still plays iuntil it ends........IT SUCKS AND THE OWNERS JUST WANT AN APP with tons of downloads and it is a rip off. im gaad it doesnt cost money
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is a great adventure and is enjoyed by my entire family. Lots of gunfire and monsters (aliens, really) so families with young children should beware.
B008U6Q90Q|5.0|Nice really nice, was kinda shock on how thick the record was, I know it says 180 grm bit dam the thing is thick son. The sleeve is nice the fold out album cover is cool, your getting your money's worth with this company.
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|A Classic you would not want to miss, you could not ask for better cast, the story is fantastic, screenplay wow!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book was good but gruesome. I thought it was very in depth with its detail. A little too in depth.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|When I got this as a gift, I thought, \\"Kinda boring\\", but I learned it's not what I think, it's what my child thinks and he LOVES IT!! At first he would set it off accidently, but when he finally started to understand his movements a bit better, you could tell he was interacting. He's at 3 1/2 months now and has been playing with this for over a month.<br /><br />Sometimes all it takes is for him to see the snails smiling face for my son to start smiling and laughing! It's so funny. We haven't even used the roll fuction. He just likes to watch the face, especially when it lights up and makes noise. I do wish it had more than 4 sounds, because when he continuously hits it, it can get annoying.<br /><br />I do like that it has 2 volume settings. I found some of his toys too loud and you can't do anything about it.<br /><br />It seems to be very sturdy.<br /><br />I don't understand reviews that bash a toy just because their child doesn't like it. All kids are different. Saying it's a bad toy just because YOUR kid doesn't enjoy it, doesn't actually mean it's a bad toy. If there are actual problems with they toy than that's a different story.

0385334206|4.0|I'm a Vonnegut fan. Not a huge one, but a fan nonetheless.<br /><br />In fact, I live on Cape Cod and pass the tiny cobblestone building that used to be the first Saab Dealership of Cape Cod every day. Way back in the 50s, Vonnegut himself worked there, scribbling crude sketches on tiny notepads with a Saab letterhead. How could I not be intrigued? How could I not desire to pick up everything he's ever written and read them all?<br /><br />The thing I like about Kurt Vonnegut most is that he knows how to hit close to home. And not just for people from Cape Cod.<br /><br />Breakfast of Champions is a \\"novel\\" in the loosest sense: it is more accurately described as an experiment in prose, in which Vonnegut takes 300 pages t basically just describe one important action. There's a lot of buildup, some resolution, and a climax, so that's not to say this book is without plot. It is simply unusual in it's presentation.<br /><br />This novel deals primarily with longtime Vonnegutr character Kilgore Trout, an eccentric Sci-Fi author, and his acceptance of an invitation to come to an arts festival in the middle of nowhere. In the same Midwestern Town, car salesman Dwayne Hoover starts to slowly go insane. These two characters are destined t meet, and, when they do, you won't believe what happens.<br /><br />For a book that is scant on the \\"norm\\", this novel does a few basic things very well. Vonnegut develops a world built on racism and war, class tension and secrets. He does this very slowly (for the better part of 300 pages), taking his time to really make you feel the effects of the plot on the characters themselves. When thigns happen in the world, they happen organically. Even when Vonengut (quite literally) steps aside and says \\"Here I am, the author, writing this\\", there is still a distinctive element of reality inherent in the story. It's crazy.<br /><br />The strongest part of this book is the writing. Oh, the writing. Vonnegut is at times tragic and hilairous, always keeping his reader going and interested despite the lack of a true, cohesive plot. Vonnegut has a lot to say, and amongst his tangents and asides, he does get the point across, although toward the end of the book, it seemed as though Vonnegut was hitting his reader over the head with a paddleboard shaped theme.<br /><br />The only part about this book that I had an issue with was the plot. Or, well, the lackthereof. This was a character driven story, but there were only two characters who were actually important, so a lot of the extra stuff felt like fluff--even if it was intentionally so.  It definitely got tiresome when you're halfway through the book and one character has done nothing and the other has been riding in a truck for 8 hours. Luckily, Vonnegut's style is enough to overlook this, but every once in a while, you feel fatigued, waiting for something to happen.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book. Much better than [[ASIN:0385333870 Galapagos]], but nowhere near as good as the masterpieces that were [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five]] or [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]].s keeping his reader going and interested despite the lack of a true, cohesive plot.

B0026QC0TA|4.0|The whole family was able to watch it. The characters were true and felt real. Great acting by Matt. Will see more feel-good stories like this one.
B005H9B44A|1.0|I tried this movie on my iPad and my tv. Neither choice improved the sound quality. I had to turn up the volume way too much to hear the normal speaking parts then when the action sequences played, the sound was too loud. I have not experienced this with any of the other movies watched on amazon.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I like Paul Thomas Anderson, and I was a fan of &#34;There Will Be Blood.&#34; However, I'll pass on his latest release. A lot of the movie looked improvised, especially by the enigmatic, unpredictable, and childish Phoenix. Philip Seymour Hoffman looked pretty solid, unfortunately his character was too ambiguous to swallow and get a reading of what he was suppose to be? I believe a doctor of all trades, that is why he is called &#34;The Master.&#34; But just like Paul's past screenplays, there are holes, and questionable motivations from his characters. Most of the performances are convincing as the acting in Paul's movies usually are. In conclusion, the film is way too long, and lacked a story that had substance. I wanted to like it, I just couldn't get into it.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Like many I was not sure I would like this one, the whole premise of Lincoln hunting vampires seemed far-fetched & ridiculous at best, however I was really surprised at how well I liked this film, it didn't try to re-write history & stayed well in the historical context of Lincoln & his accomplishments, some have noted that it made the southern people all vampires feeding off their slaves, & that is why he freed the slaves, but it never really says that all southern people were vampires, just a few, there is a mix of history & fiction, but historically it leaves one to wonder if this kind of thing could have been plausible, Lincoln was said to have bragged about being a vampire hunter, I am sure he was joking, but anyone who lived then is gone now, so how do we really know?...we don't...at any rate this is a fun movie & Benjamin Walker really brings Lincoln to life, & Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a good Mary Todd, & Rufus Sewell was defintely having fun as the main vampire, even his girlfriend is easy on the eyes as another vampire, & Dominic Cooper was fun as Lincoln's mentor, the last scene with him makes you wonder why all of our Presidents leave office looking a lot older than when they went in, I won't spoil it here, you do have to suspend beleif at the end with the train on the falling bridge but this is a breathtaking action scene nonetheless, there isn't much I can say that others haven't already covered, but this is a fun movie & has a level of seriousness to it that keeps it from being totally over the top.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I had such a blast but then it started asking me to up date, but I couldn't because there is no up date button, it just said, please update. Gerrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|After watching Arnold in last year's action ensemble \\"The Expendables 2\\" I had to wonder if he could still carry a film after years of being Governor, this film put that fear to rest, Arnold definately doesn't shy away from the fact that he is older now, & that is what makes his character so likable, also Arnold doesn't mind letting the supporting cast have equal screen time, everyone from Forrest Whittaker as a F.B.I. agent chasing a dangerous drug lord to the drug lord himself making his getaway in a super fast Corvette to Johnny Knoxville as a guy who helps Arnold all get to shine here, as Arnold who is a small town sherriff knows that the drug lord will soon be passing through his town that soon becomes a battleground as the drug lord's lackeys try to ensure his safe passage through, Arnold & his deputies take them all on, there is one scene where Arnold is thrown through a window & some residents ask him how he feels, his reply \\"old!\\"....once again Arnold doesn't let us forget he is older now, but he still has it, the one-liners & all, I really liked this film a lot better than I thought I would, If you are a true Arnold fan, this is a must have!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Great Story! So many stories tend to wander but this story kept my interest till the end, Looking forward to reading this series,

B002SSUQFG|3.0|I just got my today, model snk809. Looks better in person than on the screen. But, when I set it, I pulled out the crown and it did not stop the second hand. Nothing I did would make it stop. I called Seiko USA and the lady said it should stop, but that if it doesn't and it is otherwise OK, not to worry about it. Now I know I did pay a lot but if the second hand is supposed to stop when you set it and mine does not do that...isn't mine defective?

The app could be so much better, cleaner, and faster but if you have patience, you'll be able to get the weather data you crave. The radar maps are so slow to load and it takes a few seconds to zoom in and out. This could be an awesome app but the weather channel lets us down. This is similar to their website as well just too much going on.
B005TTEFRG|3.0|Story is a bit different from original Conan played by Arnold. This one is less serious. It tries to have more funny moment. The result is not outstanding. As a whole, it is worth possession judging of its price.

1594746036|3.0|It was okay. I didn't investigate it as closely as I should and didn't realize it was mainly aimed at young adult readers. The main characters are young children or teenagers (sort of, well, you'll see). Interesting premise with a good start but leaves lots of questions hanging. Photos are a nice touch and make the book shorter than the pages listed since many take up a whole page. (Another book that could have benefited from an area map.)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my first time reading Hugh Howey. I just finished the Wool series and I am literally about to order every other word he has written.<br /><br />The story's characters are so developed and memorable, and the way they have survived and adapted to this truly psychologically terrifying New World Order the author has envisioned and described in almost loving detail makes for a most engrossing tale.<br /><br />I couldn't believe this is a self-published book!? Wool reminded me of one of my favorite and most forward-thinking authors of all time, Maragaret Atwood. I would highly recommend to science fiction readers and anyone who ponders the what ifs of contemporary society.
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|My viewpoint is that when I read a book or attend a lecture if I can get one useful idea, it was worthwhile.  This was not worthwhile.  I really hoped/expected that this book might have some useful tricks and/or tips on learning a new skill.  And while it made a small attempt at doing that in the beginning of the book by giving extremely obvious suggestions on how to approach a new subject, the vast majority of the book (80%+) was spent going through a detailed synopsis of how he tried to learn several skills, which is not helpful at all in learning how to learn new skills.  it was probably reasonably helpful if you wanted some information on those skills in particular, but did nothing for the process of skill acquisition in general.<br /><br />The best advice the book gave was that new skills are difficult in the beginning, so don't get bogged down in not understanding everything right away...don't be afraid; jump in and learn anyway.

B000FCK65W|5.0|Awesome classic, beautiful yet Un-flinchingly gritty in its portrayal of life in turn of the century Brooklyn. Though often characterized as a \\"coming of age\\" tale, it is written with the adult reader in mind. I've probably read this book at least once a year and it definitely is worth a yearly re-read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|8 year old grandson loves it.  14 year old says it's for kids but he hasn't really tried it... yet.  He will, when no one is looking, and I'm sure he'll enjoy it too.  Long download on my old Galaxy but graphics are nice.

0767919408|4.0|Those of us who enjoy the books of Bill Bryson should be a natural audience for \\"One Summer: America 1927.\\" The author took a short period of time and looked at several events and the significance of them, exploring many prominent figures such as Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth, Herbert Hoover, Al Capone, and other well-known people, and lesser-known figures of the time such as Benjamin Strong, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In typical Bryson fashion, the chapters have a tendency to skip around among the prominent and not-so-prominent people at various times during the four months covered in \\"One Summer\\": May - September.<br /><br />As someone born in the last year of World War II, I have heard of many of these people since I was a child. I probably was one of the few of my generation who did not, at any early age, worship at the shrine of Charles Lindbergh, due to the fact that my father still thought of him as a Nazi sympathizer. I do remember thrilling to the movie version of the flight to Paris in the \\"Spirit of St Louis,\\" but also disassociated the character played by Jimmy Stewart with the real Lindbergh. Now, many authors, including Bryson, are quite candid about Lindbergh's anti-Jewish opinions and his admiration for Germany during the 1930's. When I was a teenager, the emphasis was on the trans-Atlantic flight and the tragic death of the Lindbergh baby for the post-World War II generation.<br /><br />In typical Bryson fashion, the quirks of public figures tend to be emphasized and some odd conclusions are drawn: for example, Bryson seems to believe that at an event in 1932 President Herbert Hoover was booed because he was not a loveable figure, where I might conclude that he was booed due to the terrible economic condition of the country. Bryson is much more sympathic to former president Calvin Coolidge, especially after the tragic death of his teenage son, who died from blood poisoning, after a blister he received while playing tennis at the White House became infected in those pre-antibiotic days. Coolidge was never the same, and by 1928 was no longer a serious candidate for another term. Bryson seems to be amused by Coolidge, who has taken a turn as a new conservative icon, with a least one biography recently published after decades of indifference by most historians.<br /><br />Also included in this examination of 1920's culture is how popular the written word had become. Bryson makes a good case that the United States had become, or was starting to become, a nation of readers after World War I, with the advent of new magazines, such as \\"Time,\\" and the publication of literary works that are now iconic (including the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald). Ofcourse movies, while popular, had not started to talk, therefore not as yet achieving the popularity that they would have in the 1930's, where weekly movie-going was a way of life for millions. Radio was something one listened to at home, therefore other private entertainment, such as reading, would be a very viable alternative. Newspapers were popular, as there was no TV or Internet with the 24-hour news cycle to compete. As an entertaining social history of the 1920's I recommend this latest in the Bryson Pantheon. It would be a good book to give to a high school or college student to use as a springboard to a discussion on how much society and culture has changed in the past 86 years, and the fact that you can get a few laughs along the way doesn't hurt.e White House became infected in those pre-antibiotic days.

However, I am always surprised to hear some people (who have not read the book or seen the movie) criticize the premise of the Hunger Games....it is handled so well in the book and the movie that it is a non-issue, in my opinion.

In some ways this series is enjoyable in much the same way as reading historical fiction... Except better as the filming of Highclere Castle is magnificent. I love the characters (great actors), the period fashion, the development of drama upstairs and downstairs! I am looking forward to Season 4.

B008C20TDG|5.0|I loved the fact that the entire first half of the book was a study in hormonal and general digestive systems. In addition, suggesting the re-introduction of some foods to test their effect on the body is perfect. Each individual's body chemistry is slightly different and here they are not advocating a one size fits all solution. A well balanced read.

B0002KQNL8|3.0|I remember seeing this movie on my Dad's VHS tape years ago.  I figure i should buy it on dvd because the quality of our vhs tape was fading.  I bought this movie and found that the original soundtrack to the film had been updated with a new stupid soundtrack that makes the film in my opinion really bad.  The scene were the zombies pop out of their graves in the original was really cool because the original song that played fit perfectly with the scene, in the dvd release it si a different song that makes the zombies comin out of there graves less exciting to see.  All in all the people who made this dvd should have done their jobs right and put the original soundtrack on the movie..The movie is still well worth watching because of the gore, some funny parts in the film, and how it tends to scare on some scenes..

125000098X|4.0|Archer will never win the Novel Prize. What he does do is write books that are engaging, with characters you can relate to, and sometimes he makes tangential references to his time in jail, which I find amusing. If you want something to read by the fire or at the beach these books are great. But you have to read them in order or you'll get really lost.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The kids love it, they want to watch it over and over. It's a great movie for family movie night

0887307280|5.0|How do I turn a business into a money machine?  That should be the number one question on the heads and heart of every business owner.  Yes, doing the business to serve others - but you can serve others through charity.  And without a sufficient cash flow, your charity work will be minimal.<br /><br />So get with it - and get which comes first.  Generating the income and profits in order to serve others.  Gerber has the priorities right.

B00BD6RFFS|2.0|The book is excellent, but they compressed the resolution of most illustrations to a really low resolution that make them unreadable on the digital edition. Not really fair :/

B00637D114|1.0|I purchased this movie for 7.99 and I thought I was going to get a very good quality picture for the price, but I was wrong. The graphics are very bad, it freezes, and it suddenly stops and resets. I use Netflix and i have never had a problem such as this one. I will not be using Amazon movie player in the future, or recommend it to any of my friends.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I just couldn't put it down. I can not wait to read the next one!
0316287059|4.0|The phrase a picture is worth a 1000 words came to life with this book.  I loved seeing stars put together  Some looks are classic and some trendy, but it's a fun book to peruse.  I have been inspired time and again with Kevyn's artistry.  I also was inspired to search him on YouTube and I was pleasantly surprised to see him on video.<br /><br />My favorite stars featured in this book, who looks I love, include:<br />Janet Jackson - natural, light makeup<br />Jodie Foster<br />Elizabeth Hurley - dark, raccoon eyes (LOVE IT)<br />Madonna - very soft, she looks like an angel<br />Vanessa Williams - I first saw and loved this look on her album in the 90s<br />Jewel<br />Sharon Stone<br />Sylvia Browne - she was hot mama in her younger days<br />Martha Stewart - wow, she was pretty back in the day!<br /><br />Stars as other famous people whose looks I love:<br />Tina Turner as Queen Cleo  - most DRAMATIC change award<br />Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis<br />Calista Flockhart as Audrey Hepburn - I did a triple take, it was so good!<br />Gina Gershon as Sophia Loren - double take<br />Hilary Swank as Raquel Welch - double take.  Wow!!!<br /><br />Another thing that I love about this book is that there's so much diversity.  Men are featured, shapely women too.  All colors are represented as well.  I am sorry that I didn't know of Kevyn back in his day, but I'm glad to have come across this book.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is a realistic look at young women in today's society, a #MUSTREAD for young women and daughters of older women. While Sandberg is a bit of a feminist, her advice is not offensive. I appreciate her honesty in sharing her own experiences.
0316286850|3.0|After scoring this book off of Ebay, I was disappointed.  For some reason, I thought that this book would be timeless because my friend and makeup artist mentor worked as a manager at a Mac store.  This book was disappointing because the information is outdated, mostly the color palettes.  I should have known better because fashion and cosmetics are seasonal industries.  Well, at least I didn't pay that much for it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I purchased the pro upgrade for this app which is supposed to take . Off all ads . Yeah there are still ads. This thing refuses to lad videos in a timely manner. Watching a 9min. Video? Prepare to wait 10 mins for it to load

B00B3N4CWK|4.0|very interesting movie, with many relevant and important topics that aren't seen in many movies.  VERY well-done.  I watched this because I was bored and I'm glad I did.  Highly recommend it.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|don't like it because it doesn't give all the levels that you need help with, only a few.  I rather play the real game on my kindle.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|If Jane Austen is your thing then this is  a very good book. The language is easier to follow than some of her other books and, for the most part, has a very focused theme.<br /><br />Not action packed but most Jane Austen fans are looking for intellectual stimulation and not vicarious thrills anyway.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I seldom find a soundtrack from a movie that was not a musical that I enjoy as much as I have enjoyed this one.  The music moves me along and makes my workouts fun.  I feel kind of heroic walking with this music on my mp3 player.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The same thing is happening to me with the update. So disappointed that this happened and all my progress is probably gone. I was actually even getting the hang of this game, and it was fun. I will update my review if Gameloft fixes this so I can play again AND keep my progress.<br /><br />09/02/2013 UPDATE: still disappointed after the updates and fixes. I had to restore my kindle and start over on this game. I am now on level 15 and my land expansions cost $1,600,000. That's right, I said one million six hundred thousand dollars!! Level 15! CRAZY. FIX IT FOR GOOD, GAMELOFTLIVE.<br /><br />09/03/2013 UPDATE:  since the land expansion costs over a million dollars, I deleted app and then reloaded. Got up to level 6. I bought a land expansion for $4,000. Said it would take 1/2 hour. I went to some friends land and when I got back to mine it said the land expansion had 4 more DAYS to go. I looked in the store and the land now says is costs $940,000.00. There is no point in playing anymore if land is this expensive, you can never expand your land. THIS SUCKS!!
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|At level 32 I was bored to death.  I've never played a game that worked so hard to keep me from playing.  The long long timers to hatch dinos, develop land and clear it gave me reason not to sign in for days.  If I wasn't waiting for these items, it was a constant battle to make enough money to buy things for the goals. Because I was trying to maximize the income, my park design was ugly.  There really was not much to do but collect money and wait.  Although the dinos are cute, I didn't think it was worth my time to continue.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I was excited to read another book by JK Rowling. This book was tedious and lifeless. I do not recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I found it to be a little tedious and not as interesting as the first book.  Hoping the third book will be better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It's so fun and addicting!!!! Getting the level ups is a challenge. But it's great eventually I'll get the mom minion!
0451232852|4.0|If you are looking for a &#34;get away from it all&#34; book, this will do it for you.  It's not the best plot, doesn't have the best character development, but it's a good read for losing yourself in.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a great book!  Very well written with thoughtfully developed characters and a fast paced story.  I would definitely recommend it.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|Found this book fair to good, will have to watch the movie before I make any further comments. A good book to add to my ebook collection
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought this movie was very creative and unique with just enough twists & action and surprizes to satisfy the senses!
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I'll just say up front that the second 1 hour episode which deals with Apollo 1 .... is the best hour of Television I've ever seen in my half century of watching.<br /><br />This series is for anyone who watched Apollo 13 and thought.... I'll have a lot more of that please! It is also not only for space fans and guys, my fiancee has enjoyed it although it took months for me to talk her into giving it a chance. This has science but also the great human stories and characters drawn so amazingly well.  It is now priced at about $15 which is only a bit over a buck an episode.. SUCH a deal. The only thing that differentiates the latest 5 disc set from the \\"signature\\" set is the fancy outer case.... so if you are interested.... do not wait, grab it and be transported to a better time in our countries history in my opinion.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES was a pretty awesome movie because the storyline seemed somewhat real. JENNIFER LAWRENCE did her best as the hunter who's life depended on winning this game at any cost and her performance was outstanding. The movie also tells us that whatever obstacles come your path, just keep on hoping that fate is something you can fight for and probably change.
0446572985|4.0|A very compelling story, beautifully told.  I kept being surprised and I like that! Before I knew it the book had ended and I wanted to read more and more and more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Simple fun and addictive.....easy to learn and straightforward game play.<br />It's a great way to pass the time and compete with friends on Facebook. I was pleasantly surprised when after playing once try it out and its free.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The storyline, the politics of the household, the subtle undermining and love, and forgiveness!<br />I can't wait for Season #4~
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|We loved that movie..  Didn't expect much but it quickly became on of my favorite movies... I would definitely recommend it -
B00BESCJII|5.0|Many elements of a typical coming of age film elevated by strong performances from most of the young cast, ultimately very little typical about it.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Do not buy this if you want to use it with an Amazon Kindle PowerFast Accelerated Charger, as it wont work. The charger works fine without this cable. It was a waste of money.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive. But, I wish it was easier to earn more invest points.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It' a great way to pass the time. I'm having a ball. Just wish it  played faster.  Trying to to get more friends to play.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Is there anything more to say?  Sorry, but the only reason to not purchase these movies is if you did not like the books.  Which, if you read the books, you liked them. How many people don't like the books? Zero! So buy the movies!
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King is my favorite author, and he didn't disappoint me with &#34;Joyland.&#34;  There might be a ghost in the book, but this isn't one of King's scary, gory stories.  I loved his characters and finished reading the book in one day!
B00E0S52K6|5.0|I think Buddy just hit &#34;The Big One&#34;, best album, ever!! This is a collection of EXACTLY what REAL Rhythm  & Blues consists of, music from the soul!!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Having just adopted a new puppy, I thought this was a book I needed to read.  Enzo is much smarter than most people I know!  I love his way of thinking and his revenge on the Twins.  There were several episodes that made me laugh out loud, but of course, I cried at the end!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I like many others enjoy playing candy crush this guide is not helpfull and would like to have the real game on my kindle so get with it
B0018RC7QE|4.0|This is an Enjoyable movie. There is No uncomfortable language or situations. Great watch for a rainy day or Sunday afternoon.
B004X0XA82|5.0|When i listened to the album i felt like I had been taken away to another world. This is the 1st full album i've bought in I dont know how long. Amazing!
0060873175|4.0|Despite its flaws, I enjoyed this book.  And I think a lot of the reviews on this site are simply overreactions.  I will address a few of the chief complaints.<br /><br />First, many were dissatisfied with the shrinking explanation.  But would it have been any better if he'd gone into even more intricate detail on something that's clearly impossible?  Keeping it short and sweet was a wise decision, in my mind.<br /><br />Did the bad guy put the protagonists in some \\"easily escapable, overly elaborate situations?\\"  Yes.  But if we gave every book or movie that did that one star, then 99% of the books on Amazon would have one star.  If you're willing to suspend your disbelief a little bit, the bad guy is a real bastard and has some clever strokes of his own.<br /><br />Character development was a little weak, as it is in all Crichton books, but no worse than the vast majority of fiction out there.  I did develop true hate for a few of the characters, such as Danny.  And while a little hackneyed, I appreciated Rick's transformation.  So while it was weak, to say the development was totally absent is unfair.<br /><br />I also don't understand why the plot is getting panned so much.  People, you picked up a book entitled Micro, knowing more or less full well what it was about, and then got upset at the plot.  Hey, it also reminded me of \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\\"  But I laughed for a few moments about the parallels and then suspended my disbelief so I could actually enjoy the story.  As far as that goes, there are a few interesting \\"Aha\\" moments and plot twists, so while not the best story I've ever read, it kept me engaged.<br /><br />In short, not the greatest book ever, but to give it one star is simply unfair.  Would it be my first recommendation to a friend?  No.  But do I regret reading it?  Absolutely not.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|You have to read this book :)<br />Eye opening, really.<br />Thank you James!<br />Go read it and have an awesome life!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I didnt find it helpful at all.  I was searching for some good info to get me through some of the levels and nothing was there for the level I was on.

B00APPMB9I|5.0|It kept me captivated and interested the whole movie. I really like the twisted feel to it. Great action, suspense flick.
B00957T6X6|5.0|When is the next one coming? cant wait!!!!<br />The story leaves us hanging and its so alluring its hard to describe
B002RI9QJE|5.0|Great book on the psychology that impacts our decisions.<br /><br />Super useful for the marketer looking to understand the behaviour of their prospects.
B00439MV42|4.0|Not as much fun as one and two, but an entertaining conclusion to the saga; satisfying ending.  Again great special effects for the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 2 year old and 5 year old love this game and I have to referee them playing or they fight over whose turn it is.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of my favorites. So happy it's free. Would recommend to everyone. My sister just read it as well.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Loved this game.  Completed it and am now looking for more like it. I downloaded a couple more that look similar, hopefull they will be as good.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This has been great to listen to in the car on the way to school/work, etc. It spans decades and has all of Barbra's major counterpart-singers on it. It's a great album for any fan of hers, new or existing, and is also a great album if you like her warm, softer ballads (I'm a hopeless romantic), though there are a couple high energy numbers in there too. Great album; I'm glad I bought it. Mp3 rip was an awesome plus, too.
B006Z00R1Q|5.0|This was a great suspense filled movie!! I never knew what to expect next.. Watch it.. You will not be disappointed!!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Perfect book för easy Reading in this category. You know what you get when Reading Jack Reacher.😉. Loke tio read this kind of book when traveling.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Fanboy of 10th and 25th. This isn't close. Took hugh jackman the entire movie stop thinking about singing  and just sing.  Russel crowe should never...I mean never sing again.  Anne hathaway was decent.  Coisette was great.  Just play excerps from u tube.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even if you don't like the whole zombie thing, the drama, the humanity, the pathos, the tragedy, and the triumph still make Dead worth watching.  The characters drive the story forward and keep me spellbound every week!
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|There just isn't enough information in this book. It has some experiences (40 obviously) with little detail to help you choose between them. A waste of time, even though it was free.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|But well worth the time it takes to follow him and watch him in action.  Acting is excellent, Watson is a great complement and a strong character in his own right and Moriarty is suitably devious and clever but on a larger scale than ever before.
B001OKGX92|5.0|Its a good movie that isn't just things blowing up because it looks awesome. There is a pretty good story line where Steve Mcqueen isn't just a hero cop.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am a dedicated walking dead fan and not just for the zombies...The character development running through these shows is phenomenal.  The zombie stuff if fun for me, too, but I really watch to see what will happen to these people as they face the unknowns of their existence on a primal level every day.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good book, my least favorite of his three novels, but still a good read!  I generally love all his work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If there was such a thing as a perfect book Hopeless would be it.  The story doesn't just suck you in, it transforms you.  You're still the same person after it's through but there's a little something extra that's been added to your life.  The characters were unique and real with their own personalities and quirks like the way Sky just blurts out things that she is thinking or the way she normally doesn't let situations embarrass or bother her and then there's Holder who always pauses a bit before answering a question.  Not because he wants to come up with the perfect answer but because he's analyzing the question from so many different angles and giving it the though it deserves so that when he does answer his response is the absolute perfect thing to say at the exact perfect time.  I became so immersed in their story that I felt like I had known them for most of my life, they were like my friends and family.  With every triumph I cheered and with every heartbreak I cried. I have never wanted so much to give two different people hugs as I did with Sky and Holder and I have never and I mean NEVER hated someone so much as I did a character in this book.<br /><br />  I've been reading a lot of books with similar themes in them lately and pretty much thought I'd seen and read it all but I was so wrong.  This book had several twists and curves and while I saw one of them coming a different on totally caught me off guard and I never even thought of it even though it was hiding right in plain sight the whole time.  It completely sucked the oxygen out of my lungs and hit me right in the chest.  My world actually spun when it happened.<br /><br />  I so love Sky.  She is beautiful, strong and was someone I wish I had the pleasure of knowing in real life.  And Holder, good lord Holder.  I actually feel kinda sorry for any boyfriends of the girls who read this.  I just can't help feeling that all of us guys will compared to him and found wanting. He was just so perfect, flaws and all.<br /><br />\\"I'm pretty sure we just broke the record for the best first kiss in the history of first kisses- without even kissing.\\"<br /><br />I have to say that first non-kiss kiss was probably one of the hottest kisses I've ever read about.  Their whole relationship was just intense and I can only hope that one day I'll meet a woman and be able to pour all of the love and desire I feel into my eyes and gaze at her with the same type of intensity that Holder does with Sky.  Everything he says and does is perfect but not because he's perfect even though he is.  I know it doesn't make much sense but you'll have to read to understand.  I was lost in their relationship.  I cried when they did, I laughed along beside them and felt horror when bad things happened and bad things do happen.  There are some very dark subjects in this book but the way Colleen Hoover handled them was just nothing short of amazing.  I've seen several other reviewers mention how Hopeless took their breath away and I have to agree.  I have never had a book steal my breath before nor have I ever found myself forgetting to breath while reading a book.  Only after becoming dizzy every so often did I finally manage to remind myself to breath.  So many emotions poured out of this book into me, then through me before exiting in the form of my tears and smiles.  This is just one of those books that remind you why you love to read so much.  If I had one word to describe Hopeless it would be PerfectlyIntenselyHeartbreakinglyBeautiful.  Yeah I know I cheated but it's impossible to describe this book with one word.<br /><br />Hopeless ended so beautifully, in fact the last chapter was probably one of the best endings I've ever read.  It left me with both joy for what is and sorrow for what was and tugged at my heart so hard that I was afraid that the story might actually steal it and only once the book was closed was my heart my own once more but my mind still hasn't been able to stop thinking about everything and I have a feeling that the characters and their story will be forever etched into my memory.
B0033AI44I|5.0|I  saw this film  when it was first released  and on the giant 70mm screen. Truly it is one of the all time greats in musicals. Fantastic<br />acting  and  some of the  most memorable songs ever written for a musical.The bluray release is  long  overdue and is a great addition to my massive musical  bluray collection. The  bluray release comes with several extras.
B008602KQI|3.0|Technically, the movie was well done: good cinematography; plenty of special effects, polished actors, with a story based on a futuristic theme.  However, I don't enjoy movies that depend heavily on special effects. The futuristic plot depicts an advanced society  with high level technology that still behaves like the ancient Roman society where blood and gore is seen as entertainment. But then, that also seems to be true of our current culture; if it were not so, movies like this would not be made. I guess violence and sex always sells.  Not that there are any explicit sexual scenes; only a shallow attempt at romance which makes it suitable for younger audiences.  There is no objection to exposing children to violence as any Saturday morning TV cartoon viewing will reveal.<br /><br />As far as entertaining, yes, it kept my attention.  I am sure we will see Jennifer Lawrence again and most likely, A Hunger Games sequel.  Worth watching but it does not leave you feeling that there was a message here other than the future will be much like the past.  I was hoping that the human spirit and consciousness would evolve at the same rate as its technology.  Apparently, the makers of this film chose to predict that humans will retain their depraved nature even when they are high-tech.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A story well developed with Characters that bring you into their world with well thought out stories of human nature.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|nice game. easy to learn. art and effects are above standard. in app.purchases are a little pricey but are optional.
0385528787|4.0|It has been a few years since I read the other two books in this trilogy, but in those I remember a kind of broader scope, and a suspense, as in \\"will he/can he really?\\" after we know the answer to that, this last book leaves us with a tighter view of the proceedings. This is Margaret Atwood's writing, so of course it is wonderful, however I would not be honest if I said I thought as wonderful as the first two. In spite of the closer views of fewer people, there is a what seemed to me a bit of a lack of focus in this one. Perhaps I could add how the first two books meshed, and this one, while not the red headed step-child of the three, doesn't carry the same resonance. Somewhere in among Zeb's telling of his life story to Toby, I found myself getting a little restless. And things at the very end, (without giving it all away) seemed inconclusive in some ways. It certainly did not end devoid of hope, but there was sadness, unavoidably. Still, compared to Oryx and Crake and After the Flood, this one was more of a let down. While I don't seem to have the time presently, I feel the whole trilogy may deserve to be re-read together. This review has been difficult to write because the first two were SO stellar, I find it hard to say that this could be anything less.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I am on level 85, Had me update and now it won't let me play, keeps sending me to app store...
B005LAIIJY|2.0|Too long, cliche-ridden.  Unbelievable--the music, the violence, everything.  This film was shit out of plot and the only thing good about it was the acting.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Big-budget action. Painful dialogue. Simple, straightforward, pleasing storytelling. Probably won't surprise you at all. Great for those looking for a little nostalgia.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is so easy to read. I could not put it down. The people in the book are so thought out. Amazing.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Nice fun little game with a &#34;despicable&#34; turn.  Still learning about the game.  Fun to play.  Not sure how I like some of the upgrades yet.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Merchandise is  as promised.<br />The packaging protected the product and was received quickly.<br />We have only one more DVD to view but feel confident the quality will be as the rest! SUPERB!
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found this book was well written and I found myself getting into the characters, but I was unhappy with the ending, I felt that most of the characters that were introduced did not get a proper ending, I was left wondering what would happen to a lot of them.

0375842209|5.0|I started this one at 9 AM and, with a short break for lunch finished it<br />around 7 PM. Others with whom I've shared it agreed that it was very<br />well written, strange and compelling.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie after reading several reviews. Some people have called this the next Avatar and that is one of the reasons that I purchased but it is far from that. I did not care much for the movie. Maybe I will try watching it again without much expectations. 3D effects were pretty neat but there were very few of them.
B00985E3UG|5.0|It is very well researched and informative about the motives of the big food companies and their intentional effort to make us addicted to their processed food.  It will give the reader much insight to why obesity and obesity related illness is such a big problem in this nation.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and believe it or not I have enjoyed watching the Blu-Ray at home better. This performance is a tour de force and it is a shame that they did not go on the road afterwards. I would have loved to see them live with Jason on the drums.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the BEST games out there. You will be sucked in and forced to try and complete this amazing game. The graphics are amazing and the music is also fabulous. If you are thinking that it is not worth the price, it is...and more! I cannot wait until the next update arrives. I am very picky about games like this, and The Room does not fail to deliver. Hats off to the developers, you have created another addict. Now, please, hurry with the next update...
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Onto Dark Places and a new favorite author.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|The experimental fringes and dance beats are everything you would expect from the PET SHOP BOYS, throw in their 'suitably vapid' lyrics and you have a juggernaut of dance tracks to sip your Appletinis, and dance your tush to oblivion.<br /><br />GREAT JOB guys!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am not sure why, but my husband and I could not stop watching episodes.  It was seriously addictive.  Have fun, but beware of loosing your life for an entire weekend.
B0055V0GQC|5.0|Totally Kick Ass.  I bought this cd hoping it was going to have at least a few good tracks, I was blown away!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive love it.Loads of different characters to unlock.However at a very high price.recomended to people who love arcade games.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game!#most awesome game#EVER! This was a great game you can brush your horse make the food and feed your horse buy treats for your horse with the money you earned at competitions best game I've played in a long time
B000MR9D5E|5.0|PLENTY of awesome footage of wildlife and various scenery from around the world, following common as well as rare animals and habitats. Very interesting and educations with eye- and brain-candy galore. Really enjoyed the footage and commentary! Some footage was shared with 'NG's Untamed Americas' and was a smidgeon of a let-down, otherwise fabulous!<br /><br />Pros: Seemed short because it was so interesting and engaging!<br /><br />Cons: There were not enough hours (see Pros). There is one more CON that might be considered a spoiler so stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled. Yes, 5-stars is still my rating, the series is totally worth the cost...and the last disc is bitter-sweet...<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER ALERT!<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />The final disc, while very interesting, was quite depressing. I can really appreciate the producers divulging into the background stories of the episodes, and getting a bit of semi-formal review on the state of the planet. However, they camera-operators, producers, and everyone else that was on-site for each of the filming sessions had some bad news regarding the environment: Pollution, missing species, some lonely suffering... If you have a soft heart, avoid the final disc, or schedule something very fun and engaging to do after watching to take you mind off of it...or go volunteer for an organization that can help do something for the state of the planet. My point is, after so much GOOD feeling during the other disc viewings, the final disc left me feeling sad, and mournful of the state that our planet is in. The footage and commentary was again fabulous throughout the final disc, and was still very interesting and fully worth the cost.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Kept the suspence going. Couldn't put it down. Liked it so much I couldn't wait to get the next book!
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|After reading the book for the fifth time, I still find myself rolling over from laughter. I consider myself a humorous person, but the oatmeal just takes humor to another level. Very imaginative indeed! I will never view my dog the same way.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|So good i couldn't put it down. The suspence just kept going and going. Couldn't wait for the next book!
B00846REIS|2.0|Could not finish this book.  The sexual contact started taking place before the main female character had a &#34;getting to know you&#34; conversation with the male, and she was telling him to stop touching her but he didn't.  In real life that would be rape.  Not my idea of romance.  Made me uncomfortable.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Loved the book the whole way through. The end was disappointing. Would like to have seen how their lives played out. Ending just kind of stopped dead.
B00005B36H|5.0|Very much recommend this album. Tool definitely brought out a more advanced and interesting perspective on how they performed. Parabola is a good song and Lateralus is the best Tool song I've heard easily, it's worth every minute on each track up until it builds up to Lateralus and then it kind of soothes out into a more distant rhythm.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE BEEN SEARCHING AND SEARCHING BUT JUST CANT QUITE PUT HIS/HER FINGER ON IT. THEN THIS BOOKS FOR YOU...
B004YW4L5K|4.0|There are many reviews of this book.  It captures many mythos and oddities of American culture.  It is a masterpiece in many ways that I feel will have longer  literature life than many more popular novels.  I won't belabor; but if you are a fan of the mystical commentary on the human  condition this book is a must read.  The more you know your mythology the more you will enjoy the insights.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I had been playing this game for a while now, level 60, and was finally able to get the neighbor problem fixed when I notice d there was an update. I figured, maybe this will fix all the other minor annoyances. I completely regret not reading the latest reviews before updating. Now, I can no longer even get into the game. It keeps telling me that there is a new version and to download it, which I just did. Please fix this major error so we can get back to actually playing the game.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I went on the game one day intell I got to the page then the game froze on me I try resting it but it did not work so i delet the game and that is my review
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast was announced, and I immediately bought it with intentions of replacing my Apple tv or Roku boxes that we currently we use at my home.  I got it the next day somehow and immediately started setting it up.  It took all of about 10 minutes to unhook my old Roku and hook this up.  Super easy and the setup instructions are great to.<br /><br />This just worked perfectly with my Iphone and my Android devices right out of the box.  I really REALLY like being able to control the volume right from my device.  To do this I usually set the tv volume to slightly higher than I normally do, but that gives me the control from my phone to turn up a quiet video, or turn down a loud video from youtube right away instead of fumbling for the remote on the other side of the couch.  The Included AC adapter is a huge plus.  I am very satisfied with the fact that they include it for the price point of 35 bucks!  I expected to have to provide my own for the price.<br /><br />++  I was able to log into XFinity TV, and stream Dexter to this in my bedroom pretty flawlessly through the chrome browser on my computer.  The apps for the phones don't have a cast button in them, and I don't think they will honestly, but if you have a good wireless network signal, I don't see any reason why you won't be able to do this.  Also the Cast plugin for Chrome is currently said to be experimental, which I can say is true when casting simple web browsing, but for some reason the video streaming was flawless.  I really really like this.<br /><br />++  I also carried this to California for some personal travel and was able to stream my Netflix right to it on the LED TV in the room!!!<br /><br />++  Youtube and Netflix are flawless in my experience so far.<br /><br />-- One note as of 8/10/2013 I occasionally have issues when setting it up to my hidden SSID.  I have connected to it about 10 times now and out of those 10 times, 3 simply would not connect no matter what I did.  I had to broadcast my SSID, have it connect, then I was able to hide it again and it worked.  Most people I'm assuming wont bring these all over and travel as much, so it shouldn't be a problem.dcast my SSID, have it connect, then I was able to hide it again and it worked.  Most people I'm assuming wont bring these all over and travel as much, so it shouldn't be a problem.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|This is the type of movie you show a group to calm there souls.  Im 75 and loved this  .no violence and it was a keep you interested and cheereful.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is DUMB BECAUSE ON CREATIVE YOU CAN'T TOUCH NO CHESTS NOTHIN BUT ON THE MINECRAFT ON THE COMPUTER YOU CAN DO CHEATS AND TOUCH STUFF
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This work creates a fictional future reality with astonishing detail and clarity by exploring the fictional collapse of modern civilisation from a wide variety of individual points of view. People always ask me why I'm so into this genre and I always say that it's much more about the reaction of people when the facade society crumbles. The work does this superbly. I read it a month ago and still think about parts today. Genius.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Really rhe only thing that made this a bit corny was the evil aliens (and also their evil animal &#34;pets&#34;), but even they weren't really SOOO bad.  Also, the reason why the aliens can only kill them IN ORDER was not explained.  The movie was good if you focus on the interaction between the characters.<br /><br />The setting is that this teenager is unique & important to the world, and he's hiding out trying to grow up like a normal boy in high school.  He has to deal with all the hard-ships of being &#34;different/special&#34; from the all mundane kids.  In this way, the setting kinda resembles the high-school-age Clark Kent in Smallville or the teenage John Connor from Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles.<br /><br />I liked it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An amazing story. The writing is rich,thought provoking and deep.  Such a different look at a terrible time in our history.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|Oh man, my mind got blown at the end. Now I have to re-watch the movie with this fact in mind.
B000GCFO08|4.0|Probably one of the best translations of a video game to the big screen.  There are definitely bad horror films out there and worse video game adaptations.  However, this one takes the freaky feeling and imagery of Silent Hill and puts it pretty much in a film pixel for pixel.  Maybe the lack of big stars also help the suspension of disbelief, but I have an easier time getting into these films if I don't recognize the actors from some memorable character.  Anyhow, it's fun, scary, and well imagined.  I would say about 1 in 10 horror films produced is worth watching, and this is part of the 10% that are.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Word of warning, you really need to buy the app to consider this as a valid review.<br /><br />This app is awesome for both adept magic players and those new to the game, it has an awesome tutorial that explains through each type of card. It has an ok campaign, and I've heard the multiplayer is pretty good but I have yet to use it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great read! Collins keeps getting better and better!! Even better than the first one. I loved  it
B000V39KDO|4.0|Based on a true story...rather loosely, this film still contains all the epic violent and action packed scenes expected in a movie with the title scrawled in blood. A pretty good storyline too about honor and the value of freedom. Yes quite unrealistic but still an entertaining film nevertheless.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|It's a good period romance but I didn't sympathize with the protagonist. That's no one's fault and it was an entertaining way to spend the weekend anyway. Wouldn't watch again but would recommend to a hungry Austen fan.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|We were inspired to watch this during Discovery Channel's Shark Week recently, and dismayed to find that we don't own it! In the interest of instant gratification, we rented it from Amazon instant video. The movie still rings true as a classic horror pic and the deleted scenes actually add some nice creepiness to the plot, instead of being unnecessary filler. Being a New England Native, it's also fun to play &#34;Spot the Martha's Vineyard Beaches.&#34; Great performances by all, especially Richard Dreyfuss.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I wish I had more positive feedback. Since all the upgrades my user name changed, it won't link to my 300 friends of game loft and the update keeps sending me to update and the game won't load.  It was fun in the beginning...but an uninstall is coming soon!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoying reading this book, it's amazing.<br />it's pretty long but Intriguing for all over the chapters.<br />I suggest you to watch the movie too, the American version is better(my mind).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read anything by Stephen King before because horror novels and horror movies give me nightmares, and I don't like putting myself through that. I picked up this novel because it was the book choice for my book club, and I was intrigued by the subject matter. It took me 3 or 4 months to read, because I have a busy life and this book is quite long. I didn't even get halfway through the book before i realized Stephen King is an AMAZING author. I love the way he writes. The story kept me coming back for more, and I was very pleased with the way the book ended as well. If you enjoy books about alternate history or time travel, or even if you want a solidly written fiction story to escape into, this would be a great choice. I LOVED this book, and if Stephen king ever writes another novel that is more fiction than horror I would likely read it too.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watch Falling Skies regularly and few other dramas. It keeps my curiosity alive and well, which is a feat these days with the library full of books. Great curiosity stimulant!<br /><br />.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, and you like science fiction, this is right up your alley. Watch and enjoy.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I really like this game. But you have to know that it has a lot of cussing. But besides that IT IS AWESOME.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Stargate is a movie for fans of science fiction and anyone else who wants to have a great movie experience. Join mild-mannered Dr. Jackson and tortured Col. O'Neill as they try to save a planet enslaved by the evil sun-god Ra. Special effects and thrilling music add to the fun. One of my favorites!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far I like it. Should be able to compete without training. Gems and rewards are easy and you get them fast.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you haven't seen The Avengers, what are you waiting for? Great heroes and heroines in Ironman, Thor, and company and a delicious villain in Loki. Witty dialogue and non-stop action plus great special effects will keep you entertained throughout the movie. Watch it again and again - you'll want to catch every word and wisecrack.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Piazzolla himself said that this album was his favorite. And to be honest this album is really awesome. The title Zero Hour refers to that specific hour of the day that is the end and the begining at the same time. This is late night music and match perfectly with a bottle of wine from Argentina and, of course, your lover.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A sweet story that is educational as well as a real page turner. A feel-good story with a happy-ever-after ending.
B00AQIZRLS|1.0|too boring for my little granddaughters.  deleted it off my kindle.  bummer, they are 5 years old and like more of a challenge.  this may be best for 3 year olds.
B007704HO6|5.0|Most heart warming book in years. So happy to follow how James leaned to trust people again through sharing with them the happiness Bob has brought along with him.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|great game and love how it just keep going.  always try to beat my previous scores.thanks for the delux version.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|Do you ever expect to back out of the app, go to the home screen, or just receive a text or phone call while playing? If so, I hope you're not paying a difficult game using the pencil, because you will lose it all! Meaning that if you're playing it on expert difficulty then you might as well reset the game! Solid two star app until this basic functionality is implemented!
B001BWDG0W|5.0|this is so upbeat and fun to listen to.  i listen to it while on my treadmill and it helps keep me going.  love all the songs.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What a wonderful, take-you-away-from-it-all read! I'm going to order the rest of the series right now!<br /><br />I loved the character development and the plot twists·
B009NPLIFE|5.0|I enjoyed every season of this hit TV series..from season one through season six episode ten..witch was the revealing of the true identity of gossip girl!!The posting in this episode was called the final chapter:-) It was a great  ending..,showing everyone years later,more mature,and how there lives had turned out!..,A total success!!
B009DT424Y|1.0|I was hoping this would be my solution to a wireless Mic for gaming on my PC. Well this device is easy to setup. paired it right away with the PC's blue tooth receiver. then did a mic test. Mic gain at full boost.......barely audible. tried turning up the mic's volume.....still barely audible....very bummed. Back to a wired mic i guess.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Awsome, such a good read. Can;t wait for the next book to come out.It was funny and loved the way the book was written.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great Stuff, that Masterpiece!  I can't wait for the fourth season.  It'll be quite a change after the developments in previous episodes.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock is very easy to use and works just as you would expect.  highly recommended.  It is intuitive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A classic in television.  Something to be purchased and watched for years to come.  We will be in England soon and will be gong to The Abby very soon.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|On one hand, this is grief porn. The portrayal of the out-of-touch royal family is fascinating.  Also Tony Blair's home life. Fish fingers anyone? The prime minister does the dishes, but he doesn't check the kids' room for glasses.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At first I thought it would be stupid but I ended up really enjoying it.  I wish they had hints or something because some of the clues took forever to figure out but in the end I completed all ten levels and had a blast!!
140006922X|4.0|Inspired by Father John P. Meier's \\"A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus\\" (four volumes published between 1991 and 2009), \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" is both biography of the historical Jesus lost in the murky mist of time (and revisionism)and a portrait of his earliest followers.<br /><br />Anytime you challenge established religious thought, you'll run into those who disagree but for those who are willing to approach Aslan's book with an open mind it offers much food for thought. Aslan gives us as much as we can know about the era as well as the life of Jesus based on historical documents of the time. He cross references various books (including those in the New Testament) looking for consistency to help provide a foundation of the life and times of Jesus.<br /><br />Aslan points out that the major change that occurred between Jesus' original followers and the Christian church that we know today occurred when emperor Constantine commanded church leaders to create a consensus on the doctrine of christianity. These changes included readopting the beliefs and letters written by Paul (Saul) who had been something of an outcast among the early followers of Christ particularly Jesus' younger brother James who continued to lead after Jesus was crucified.<br /><br />There are times that Aslan will ask you to make a \\"leap of faith\\" for various ideas that he proposes and, while I don't know that I agree with all of his conclusions, he makes powerful arguments in favor of them.<br /><br />Aslan's book is a well written overview on the changes within the early church and provides a context for Jesus in his time (for example he also points out that Jesus wasn't the only individual at that time who had followers that believed he was their savior--the difference being that Jesus' following endured). This is a thought provoking book that focuses on the historical aspect of Jesus not those based in faith. As such, it's a fascinating historical portrait.rait.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|A quirky British comedy that i saw once a while back and loved. well i just found it again and had to watch it. Still as hilarious and off beat as it was when i saw it originally. If you like any kind of British comedies there is a  good chance you will like this movie. I recommend it with out reservation to those who like off color comedy!
B004W1GD4A|5.0|The story of 165 Eaton Place continues in the early 30's. The house has been inherited by Lord Hallam Holland and he moves in with his wife Lady Agnes. Rose Buck, who now runs a small domestic hiring service, staffs the downstairs and becomes housekeeper. The upstairs dramas include a tyrannical and eccentric mother (Eileen Atkins), an out-of-control sister and glimpses into the life of a foreign office diplomat. Downstairs, there are quite as many intrigues, and when the upstairs and downstairs mix, there are the predictable problems.<br /><br />The scenery is lush, each character is cast with care; in particular, Ed Stoppard (son of dramatist Tom Stoppard) is mesmerizing as the stiff-upper-lip husband and diplomat. But every cast member has plenty of lines and a back story, which makes this an engaging series. The second season, on the cusp of World War II, is even better.<br /><br />It's a shame that Jean Marsh's illness and disagreements about the direction of the scripts (that Eileen Atkins was consulting on, as one of the original developers of Upstairs, Downstairs) ended up with the series cancelled after the second season. The last episode of Season 2 had many threads hanging that could have made a long and satisfying drama series. We'll just have to imagine them. But even though this is a brief series, it is produced with fastidious care and it's a worthy successor to the original.
B003UYUP5I|5.0|Dary!<br /><br />With the Playbook, I've learned how to be a better wingman.  Seriously, you give some good laughs the whole book, It is the perfect Barney Stinson humor, the way it is written it is as almost as I could hear his voice at HIMYM
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Always thought DS9 was a great series, taking the feelings of Star Trek and putting it into a space station was probably quite risky.  I enjoyed it when it was originally aired and am enjoying it all over again thanks to Amazon!  Great stuff, check it out!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very good word book and easy for me to navigate.  I recommend this app to everyone. Words right at your fingertip.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The setting, the music and the wonderful cast make this special. To see such great people as human beings, at the end of wonderful careers is very humbling, and yet, the tale is told with warmth and humour.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The best book I have ever read.I  can't.wait to read the rest of the series. I hope it is as good as this one.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|It was a decent movie. Entertaining. Matthew McConaughey TYPICAL - he plays himself well. Good acting overall by all. Good movie.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Certainly recommend Star Trek TNG. Season two is a short step up from season one, and each season gets a little better and has higher production value. Watch it
B000ICXQHE|5.0|Great actors overall in the movie. Denzel Washington plays a rather cocky detective with a bit of a chip on his shoulder. Jodi Foster was a bit cockier in her part- big attitude for the big bucks!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can't even update it at all you will be wasting your money<br />  I am asf jerome and except this
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game have been playing and starting over through 5 kindles but now I can't play..... plz fix
B0058SNI94|4.0|The shoes fit perfectly and are very comfortable even though I have a very wide foot. The strap on the back does not irrate my heel  as many shoes of this style do. The best thing about this shoe..you virtually cannot ruin them!!! Any dirt, mud, etc. washes right off and they look good as new...perfect to wear on warm rainy days since they dry quickly and are waterproof. I originally bought them for things around the house like gardening but I wear them all the time they are cute!
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Pretty good flick.. Gotta say though.. Part 2 is far more enjoyable and entertaining. But it's pretty good .so yeah watch it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is probably the best app of its kind that I have played. I only have a few complaints...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Helpful tutorial at the beginning<br />- Lots of different types of dragon to collect<br />- Good graphics and relaxing music<br />- Cool new items every time you level up<br />- If you connect to Facebook (which is completely optional, no pressure to do it at<br /> all) you can visit your friends' parks-<br />- You can breed hybrid dragons that you would normally have to spend gems on<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The legendary dragons such as Sun and Moon need to be purchased with gems<br />- Some things such as clearing rocks take a long time to do (but not as long as the times on Tiny Monsters)
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive is one of those movies thats really hard to describe without doing it the proper props it deserves. You either love it or you hate it. There is no in between. I LOVE IT. EVERYTHING WORKS.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Rarely have I found a book that drew me in the way this one did. The characters, even those found along the way, come to life as though they were personal acquaintances. I read it weeks ago, still many scenes and people encountered seem as fresh as if I still held the book in my hand. This story deserves to become a classic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This just keeps getting better.  The first season was amazing, this is better!  Now that you have a connection to each character, the story lines are going deeper and you can't help but be completely enthralled in their lives!
B00AG297GK|1.0|iI was hoping to see a cute and light comical movie but this turned put to be a disaster!<br />Not at all funny with humor that belongs in the toilet. I do not recommend this movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|First season was interesting, the 2nd season is even better. The bureacrats arrive in season 2 and the difference between them and the warriors is substantial.  Can't wait for season 3
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Powerful book with a surprise ending. Lots of things to think about. Well written, off to buy Mission Flats. I<br />Impressive!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Fell in love with this CD before I bought it and fell even more in love with it after I bought it.
B005544TRQ|3.0|I like shows that involve the law and problem solving. This show gives you all of that with good chemistry between the characters. I deleted a few stars for originality but the show is still entertaining.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|They suck you in and then break you're heart! The movie had great action scenes, but it was predictable, as usual.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I was skeptical.  But 30 days later I had lost 11 pounds and 3.5 inches off my waist, had tons more energy, totally set free from food cravings and chronic snacking, and a normalized menstrual cycle, My husband's chronic tendonitis is gone and his GI issues have significantly improved.  This is the best resource on the &#34;why's&#34; of the paleo diet I have read.  If you doubt, give it a try - it's only 30 days.  I promise you - you won't be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Can't play since an update!! And I've never been able to visit neighbors. It always tells me to try again later. And of course you need the hearts from visiting your neighbors. Gets irritating, especially when one of your missions require it. Great game otherwise. I play it on my kindle and phone. Please fix!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Maybe 1 1/2 stars,  I stopped reading after a few chapters.  I suppose its all about &#34;Muggles&#34; and we know how awful they are. Perhaps Rowling grew up with Muggles -- and had to create a magical world to escape them.  She's better off writing about her created world.  The &#34;real&#34; word she tries to enter is dreary.  The people in this book, as much as I've read are not exactly awful - but they are not interesting - and there are just too many of them.  It wasn't worth the effort to get to know one dreary individual after another.  I - sigh - put it down.
B007MP6Z5A|4.0|I'm not much of a film critic, and to be perfectly honest I only watched the film because Maria Callas was in it.  I love her work in opera and was intrigued when I found out that she starred in this one film.  And for Callas, it is worthwhile - she gives an incredible performance, despite never singing a note and having minimal dialogue.  The film itself is unique in other regards - the pace is slow, and dialogue is kept to a minimum.  Visually, we are provided mainly with landscapes, profiles and facial expressions.  Aurally, we get a range of exotic world music.  In both ways, the movie is like a collage - the sets and the music clearly do not fully belong to the time period or the cultures depicted in the story, nor even do these elements necessarily combine harmoniously with each other.  So I do warn that this film is a challenge for the viewer; it's definitely not your standard Hollywood storytelling, but undeniably artful and interesting.  Recommended for those who have an appreciation for international film and art film.<br /><br />The one complaint I have in this film is with the dubbing of the dialogue - I've read many places, that it was filmed in English, then dubbed in Italian, possibly by Callas herself and/or possibly by another actress.  The Amazon On Demand version is presented in Italian with English subtitles (which I don't mind), but while it sure sounds like Callas, I can't be certain.  I would be very interested to see the film with the original English restored, though that may be impossible.  Otherwise I wish it could be confirmed that Callas's own dubbing is presented.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Somewhere in her prison term Piper apparently forgot that she was a white blonde, came from a privileged background of money/social connections, and  had a job and supportive structure of family and friends waiting for her at the end of her internment.<br />She is so far from the lives of the women she supposedly identified with it is incredible.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|For me it was hard to control by just swiping the screen.  The jump and sidestep commands didn't always register fast enough.  Cute little minions tho!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun game but a lot of glitches that get nerve racking after awhile. Says I have an update but won't let me update or play the game now. Very upsetting!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Haven't had any problems with this app. It is challenging and fun. The story line may be long-winded, but it keeps it interesting
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe B at his best! Live and in concert! It doesn't get any better than that! What more can be said?
B005544V6A|5.0|What I really love about this show is that it takes being a lawyer and makes it hilarious and witty. The play between each other is along the lines of a sitcom with edgings toward that of a drama, best of both worlds.
B006LSZECO|1.0|well written, entertaining if a bit unrealistic as i went on but then the end? made absolutely zero sense. story full of holes. silliness.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Love this game but it's saying that there is an update that I have to go to the app store to update. I do and there is no way to update. Once it's fixed I can play again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait for the movie<br /> Can't wait to read the last book. I hope that it has the same intensity
B006P96PAO|5.0|I would recommend this movie for any family. The message is great and the acting was very good. I hope to see more movies from this group. Well Done!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Netflix did not have this fabulous french title. Amazon did.  I think it was only a $.99 film- More than worth it, If you enjoy French films, and maybe even if you don't...
B0026Q8EWW|2.0|The script was far too unrealistic, but the terrific actors at least allowed me to great through it.  I read the book so many years ago that I had forgotten that this was so far from reality as to be plausible.
B004G600A4|1.0|This DVD appeared to be in good shape but when it started stopping repeatedly I took it out to look at it. There were numerous scratches that you can barely see. Very frustrating...
B000QCS8TW|4.0|After having this built up by so many people over the past few years, my expectations were fairly high. Apparently too high. While I found the plot and characters engaging, I was less impressed with the writing. I'm not completely hooked, but will read the second book in the series and see how it goes.
B006WXHJOO|5.0|This an awesome movie for kids or adults. My husband and I bought it for us and we don't have any kids at home. It's such a fun movie.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Good plot, interesting characters. I totally enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good drama.
B000HF0ILY|4.0|The only thing that keeps this from being one of the very best Westerns of all time is the implied love scene between the Pale Rider and the miner's common law wife and the somewhat overwrought ending with the 15 year-old girl yelling &#34;I love&#34; as the man with no name rides away.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Now here's one for my age group.  It was so good.  And what a wonderful change to see some of India and see the people in their day to day lives.  I love this one.
B003TQ50V6|4.0|This movie does nothing that hasn't been done many times before but it does them well. It is entertaining, and fun to watch
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I thought the movie was way to long and therefore boring.i thought if they would have just edited some of the film out it would have been so much more enjoyable. Unlike a lot of the reviews I found lots of the movie predictable, although the main twist I didn't see coming.It felt a little to sterile for me too, not really sure how to explain that better.I guess for a war movie everything was clean and in its proper place, my bedroom looks messier than most movies and tv shows now days.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast paced even with the back story needed to setup the story.<br />Lots of plot twists.<br />Ensuing leaves you wanting more.
B00E193TM2|5.0|This is hard driving rock that is also accessible. Hat tip to FFDP for a whole disk of great workout music.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I need a tablet for this game it drains battery life pretty fast but you kill alot of time playing this
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I think this book would be appropriate for a high school student.  There is sexual content, though not graphic, including the rape of a drunk girl, and sex with a girl who didn't really want to do it.  I liked the layout of the book and how the story unfolded with lots of surprises and twists.  In the end, I don't think the reasons Hannah gave for taking her life were adequate, but I suppose well-adjusted teens don't commit suicide.  Yeah, all the things that happened really sucked, and they weren't fair, and she didn't deserve any of it, but we can not control other people; we can only control how we respond to what they do.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is mostly about the characters, and some about the cases, so watching in order is helpful. (and it's not like Law & Order) But, it's not repetitive, and the characters are worth watching, so online viewing without commercials (and a few episodes at a time) is great. Similar style show: White Collar.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I started watching the TV series on Netflix and finished it rather quickly.  When I saw that there was an actual book, I decided to read it.<br /><br />This is one of those rare moments where I admit that the book is not better than the show.  Granted, I understand that the TV show is written to keep people entertained and the book is written from Ms. Kerman's experiences in prison, but it almost seemed as though she just lucked out the entire time in prison.  She had plenty of friends and family who came to visit, plenty of money for her comissionary, and constant mail pouring in.<br /><br />As I stated, interesting, but I'll wait for season 2.
B008FBMLRQ|5.0|Its hard to go wrong and everyone should have this CD in their collection.  Doesn't mean you need to listen to it routinely but certainly something that should be in the library.  Some great classic songs that I totally forgot about and enjoyed brushing off the dust.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|See...Hollywood can produce a film without a sex scene and it still can be a great movie! Loved the scene when Bruce Willis asks her...&#34;Did he just call you Bunny?&#34;
B00094OBS4|1.0|This disc would not play at all.  We tried it in three different players and nothing. Returning for a full refund.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent account of an extraordinary experience! This book helps to confirm what a lot of us already know, that there is an all encompassing God who loves us unconditionally. We are not alone and this confirms what faith is all about. He has kept his promise and we will all be in heaven with him someday!! An excellent read, I highly recommend it!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I've seen this film about 6 times.  It shows the loyalty between a man and his dog.  The movie is based on a true story, which took place in Japan.  His master dies.  He had always met him at the train station every day.  Even until the day he died, he sat there waiting for him every day.<br /><br />Richard Gere was wonderful as the dog's master.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|As another noted, I can edit, but I can not save or post the image to FB. The Lite version I got from Play store, which I noticed has a higher version number, works fine.
B004MPRWJG|4.0|I would not have read The Lovely Bones, but I'm in a book club at work, which has led me to read several books that I would not have read otherwise.  But I did like it, in that it was thought provoking.  I think it might have been an Oprah selection, which means there are readily available book club questions that lead to good discussion.  And it's a pretty quick read, once you get into it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The book was a very interesting book but very hard to get into. The gradually picked up though and I very much so enjoyed the book.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I downloaded for my son who got familiar with the characters from the kinder surprise toys. We all loved it!
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I have read and enjoyed all the books of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. When I saw the movie trailer, I was pumped and immediately went to go see it when it came out. When I got out of theater, I was somewhat satisfied but not entirely. I don't hate this film at all.I enjoyed watching it and thought it was pretty entertaining. But that didn't stop from noticing all the flaws the movie has.<br /><br />I knew from begging there were going to be a lot of things that would be taken out ore changed for the movie. After all, if it did follow the book exactly, the movie would be like 5 hours. I can definitely say the movie followed only about 40 to 50 percent of the time. Like a lot of the other reviewers have mentioned, it is a bit disappointing that a lot of the main characters and crucial plot points had been left out. I kinda forgave it since this is going to a movie series, I figured that maybe they'll reveal these characters later on in the next movies that come out in the future.<br /><br />The slightly  altered personalities of the main characters kinda threw me off a bit though.  In the book Percy is described as being a somewhat awkward kid with ADHD, you don't see that as much in the movie version. I almost thought Annebeth was Clarrise (one of the character left out of the movie) when she first appears with brown hair and intentionally wounds Percy during the catch the flag scene, and the tomboy bookworm personality that she has shows up only a little in the movie. Grover is changed from  a coward into a wise cracking \\"cool guy\\"<br /><br />With it's set design, there times where the sets are done very well ( Ex.The Lotus Hotel scene, it was just as glamorous as I imagined), But other times its not that special ( Ex.Camp Half Blood, I know its a summer camp but couldn't they made it look less cluttered and small?) The action scenes were done pretty well, even if sometimes they were a bit typical.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this film though is that it tries too hard to be a  moody, serious adventure film like Harry Potter.  Even with it's several comical scenes ( which were often a hit or miss), it still tries to take itself way too seriously. The original books ( thanks to Rick Riodan's great writing) maintained a very zany and silly mood throughout, at least up until around the end of book 4.The books were often filled with much sharper humor and gave a different and more modernized portrays of Greek Mythological figures. (Ex. Zeus being portrayed as an executive with a pin stripped suit and Poseidon in typical fisherman's attire) What we do see on screen a lot of times is a typical view that's been repeated in several other mythology movies. So as a result, the adventure story the film is trying to tell doesn't seem as fun or interesting to get into, because the overall mood of the story has been changed and several things have been left out. Even if you didn't have time explain them, you could SHOW them instead.<br /><br />I know that no film based on a book adaption will ever follow it's source material exactly. Sometimes things will be changed for time,content ,and personal preference. But do the changes to the story work to it's advantage or it's disadvantage? But in this case it kinda works to it's disadvantage because the final  product is something doesn't really seemed as unique and special as it could have been.It almost feels like the movie is telling a story without really feeling totally interested in it. However, it's a still fun film to watch, if you ignore it's source material and accept it for what it is, it's a lot easier to enjoy. But I recommend checking out the books if you really want experience bigger and no doubt livelier adventure.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I've been playing diamond dash for a while now. It was good before but now it's freezing a lot making it hard to beat scores. And im on level 33 and still havent been offered the super cube. What's going on. Thinking about deleting this game.
B00005ASOC|5.0|We loved it.  So glad to have found it.  Really inspiring subject - great acting by whole cast.  Highly recommended
B002WY65VU|5.0|Good movie, great price, can't go wrong. Good story, good characters, very original. Am I reviewing the item or the sellers? Either way, good stuff.
0385341008|5.0|I was totally blindsided by this book. It is a story well told and important to read. It is also fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read. This book pulled me in with each word. Thisbis the second time ive read it, and i still couldn't stop reading.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I wasn't so sure going in if this would be a good movie, glad I watched it could be one of Matthew McConaughey's best films!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|doesn't really help. just has different suggestions on radom levels. I thought would go threw each level and explain that level
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I got this to play myself but the grandkids seem to beat me to it. Lots of fun and challenging. Another keeper :)
B004MC8CA2|2.0|very hard to navigate and use not worth installing and it was not very user friendly for a senior citizen to use
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This will keep your mind sharp and it has very nich graphics. I can share this game with the younger folks in the family and they enjoy it also.
B0089LOG02|5.0|lliked this so much posted on facebook as a good read, a part of american history not well known, liked it
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is great but when I tried to get on today it said I needed to update and visit app store. When I was redirected to the app store the &quot;update&quot; didn't show anywhere. I continued to gameloft.com and downloaded the version but it says my internet connection isn't working when indeed it's working fine..if there's something that I'm missing please let me know, I would love to continue playing.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Way too many characters to follow, 30, i believe. I would have given it a one until book club, when one reader found some redeeming quality that upped it to a two.
078689136X|4.0|We purchased this out of curiosity about the mingled marketing involved with the fictional TV show, Castle. Mysteries are among our favorites and this book filled the bill.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's okay, looks neat, fun to watch. Nothing substantial, just a fun movie. No memorable statements or cinematography, just a buncha mindless action and a twist you may see coming but doesn't really matter because it leads to more fun stuff and nothing thought provoking. Just enjoy it for the action and effects.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The series is great and looking forward to next season...it keeps your interest, characters are awesome and right on in their parts.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Definitely not an Arnold movie, but I guess if he wants back into film then this is a good way to start. Wasn't horrible, but it was fun.
B008602KQI|1.0|this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. i cannot believe that i wasted an hour or so watching this crap. i guess everyone makes mistakes!!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Looks wonderful, but really just too much going on. I followed it as best I could but already understood what it was trying to say long before the movie was halfway. No need to drill it in...
B00CA4S27W|5.0|The great number of Blackmore's Night fans, testify that it is not so hard to pass from the Deep Purple and Rainbow's Hard Rock & Metal, to the Blackmore's Night renaissance music.<br />The secret is Him, Blackmore, that has the gift to transform any song, any music in someting of amazing.<br />This Album is another pearl of the chain.<br />The only matter that is a bit harder to deal with, is the use of the acoustic guitar instead of the electric one.<br />This is due not only by the &#34;metal inside&#34; me, my red cells are \m/, but also from the fact that an acoustic guitar has not the same wide range of expressivity of the electric one. And we know that Blackmore is a master to keep from guitars all the best.<br />Probably Blackmore itsef felt this difference, and album by album increases the use of the electric guitar finding a perfect mix of acoustic and electric. :)))<br /><br />Very Touching the song dedicated to Jon Lord! R.I.P. :'(
B000GPIPTW|5.0|I have never heard the original Pet Sounds Album until now.  Brian Wilson most certainly is a musical genius.  He was able to blend in bicycle bells, animal noises and other unconventional sounds into songs that have such sweet harmony.<br /><br />The mono version of this album sounds a bit distant and coming at you, for those of you who have smoked pot and listened to music may understand.  I did it as a teeny bopper but not now.<br /><br />This album even the \\"fast\\" songs are so relaxing I just sit in a chair or on the floor , close my eyes and just listen to the uniqueness of this work.<br /><br />Even if you don't care for the Beach Boys you can buy this and listen because it was not and  never will be a beach boys sound.  If you  don't care for Brian Wilson you may change your mind after buying this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't put it down! my boyfriend and I challenge each other for hours! I just wish some more of my friends would play!
B000GCFBQU|5.0|One of the most satisfying books I've read in a long time. Strout writes beautifully and skillfully, and she writes about important yet not-too-universal ideas. I sure like this novel's flawed people, people who are doing more or less the best they can.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a fun game, but I wish that it you could replay levels. That's my only complaint.<br />Otherwise it's fun. Good job, just some minor revisions needed.
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|If you are a fan of Steve McQueen this original version of the 'Thomas Crown Affair' will not disappoint.  This is not an action movie of the McQueen style, but it is a simple straightforward drama set in the late 1960's.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Just finished the series on Netflix, decided to read the book, it's a lot different than the show. Recommend it
B005OT2YVA|4.0|No spoiler here, this is a remake of an ages old theme using the Transformers and their lost planet. Jealousy, intrigue, all your standard stuff with lots of action.<br /><br />As I understand it, this is the last Transformers with Shia LaBeouf. Megan Fox is long gone.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I'm a baby boomer, born and raised with bigotry. Fortunately I emerged with my own brain and always felt sorry for the less fortunate and suppressed. For anyone reading this review that hates anyone because of the color of their skin...I have only three words for you....&#34;eat my shit&#34;
B0082EOJYE|5.0|Best<br />Stolen Hearts<br />Just so lovely bought several copies for my family members so they could be touched by this charming film they they all heard with their hearts that were stolen like the many five star reviewers.<br />Loved it!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love this series and for this price it was a steal. If u like this series you should buy this item
B00C7E3EFU|1.0|To say I am disappointed is a understatement. Either I received a Defective Blu ray, or im going blind. The movie has very noticeable grain throughout and has something I have never noticed before. As two characters are walking their is a very noticeable cloud that surrounds them, this occurs several times. I'm really puzzled at some of the on line review sites that have raved about this transfer. HD Digest in particular gave it a 4 star review and went on and on about this blu ray. I will be returning it and stick with my DVD which is more enjoyable to watch than this version
B005LJITKI|5.0|The movie is very funny, however, sometimes the Amazon video player is not up to par, it frequently changes the picture quality. This hurts the viewing experience.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|When I updated the game it doesn't let me access the game it just keeps taking me back to the app store to check out some latest version of something I also looked around the store and found nothing, but really did like the game a lot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely adored the movie, so of course I feel the same about the game<br />It is  adorable and I am certain children will love it as well
B006O5XYWG|4.0|When you hear \\"Planet of the Apes\\" you instinctively think of the cheesy 70's movies that are almost unbearable to watch. I loved this depiction of the origins of \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and while some parts were a little cheesy, this was an excellent movie overall.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I was so excited 2 play this game ,but when I opened it it said there was a &quot;problem downloading&quot;. So I tried again and again but no luck .it was already on my kindle but it's like the game it's self couldn't load.....PLEASE FIX I'm almost positive I could rate this game with 5 stars if I could just play it!!!!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|What a good show!  I fell for the lead male character immediately, and have not changed my mind.  Gabriel is a modern-day Cary Grant!  His screen presence and perfect grooming are so like many of Cary's characters, I can hardy wait from week to week for the next show!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Its a nice game. Just another MOBA, but hey it's free. It feels allot like League or DotA. Hard to play on a touchscreen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Ok book I was a little disappointed as I heard it was really good.  The ending was terrible very bad
B007C7UZIG|4.0|It would be more useful to me if I played with many people. I don't so it is almost annoying. It's nice to browse the store while laying down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the way the story moved.  I'm looking forward to reading the next editions. I really want to find out what happens in the other silos.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was great.  My kids played it, and really enjoyed it.  Now it's been &quot;updated&quot; and I can't even get on it.  Don't waste your time.  Wish I could give it 1/2 a star.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this case because it's not bulky and it doesn't interfere with the screen on my Kindle Fire, at all. It's also really light and provides plenty of protection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is perfect with loads of hours of fun. my son and i play on this app while we are traveling.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|If you're a sci-fi lover, this flick is for you. Good fun, not overly complicated, and kept my attention throughout the 2hrs. Worth the rental.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game play. Different levels of difficulty. Doesn't repeat the same game and over and over again.<br /> Recommend this free app if you love solitaire.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I do love this game which is why I keep trying to play it.  Every time it updates it stops working has to uninstalled and start over except this time ... this time I uninstalled it and try to start it and it turns on and says go to app store for updated version so I do and I click open and it opens and says go to the app store for update so again I do and instead of just clicking open I look for the updated version.  So I download it and it starts all over again click  play  go online for updated click play go on lo e for updated so screw it I'm done.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|It is not a stretch to say that Breaking Bad is Shakespearean in its sophistication. We see Walter White make a questionable but understandable decision in episode one and then we follow, in excruciating detail, the consequences play out, consequences that are devastating both for Walter and for those around him. At each stage there is a certain rationality to the choices he makes, but when you step back and see what he's become due to those choices, the results are horrific.<br /><br />The big questions remain: has Walt been changed by the circumstances his choices brought out? Or was he always this way? Did it just take the right circumstances to bring the true Walt out?<br /><br />Truly superb. Must-see TV. Get it. Watch it.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|Ordered two of these, niether worked in either of my maglites I was looking to upgrade. Tried everything, rotating the lamps, switching out tested batteries, etc.. total waste of money.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|Inspirational, funny, very entertaining. Wonderful love story about a man cheated out of a good portion of his life.  Jim Carey makes it all so funny, b.
B0096HL33G|3.0|I really become bored with the story and the characters.  I love Rachel Weisz, but this was not among her best films.
B00AR3WD8W|3.0|With new Elvis reissues on which I already have all or most of the material, I get the new reissue from the library to compare the mixing and mastering and overall sound to my older edition. Like several of these recent \\"Legacy\\" editions, the sound on the newer release of this classic album is markedly inferior to that on the older edition. There are three elements that make up this album:<br /><br />1. Main Concert. For the main concert from January 14, they seem to have used the original 1973 mixes that were done in a hurry. Yes, they are remastered, but that can't change poor balancing of instruments and a muddy overall sound. The 1998 edition [[ASIN:B00000638B Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite]] is a clear, modern remix by the excellent Dennis Ferante from the original multi-track tapes. I put both CDs (1998 and 2013) in my stereo and played them back to back several times. 1998 is clearer, has better definition of instruments, more piano, and most importantly more Elvis. Also, I see that that edition is currently selling for $7.00 brand new from Amazon.<br /><br />2. Five Bonus Songs. The 1998 edition also has far superior mixes of the 5 bonus tracks that were recorded late, late at night after the audience had left. I saw a lot of complaints about the sound of those 5 tracks on this edition in other reviews and I heartily concur. They seem to have pulled these masters from the scattershot compilations on which these performances were originally issued (Mahalo From Elvis, anyone?) rather than using the clean, clear 1998 remixes. As with the main album, this is a baffling and frustrating choice to the longtime fan.<br /><br />3. Warmup Concert. Granted, I still don't own the \\"Alternate Aloha\\", the warmup concert on the day before the main concert. That warmup concert WAS remixed for this reissue and sounds pretty good here. If I was still a rabid Elvis completist I would obviously have to buy this to get that, but I'm not so I won't. Besides, for all I know the old edition of that, which I don't own, might sound better than this one. [[ASIN:B000002WAU Alternate Aloha]]<br /><br />In short, if what you want is to have the best possible experience listening to Elvis' Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite album, buy the 1998 edition. As Dan Gladden would say, \\"No question.\\"
B00BF11UM0|4.0|Pretty good tale of the slow sometimes plodding world of intelligence gathering where being obsessive compulsive is a definate plus.<br />No overacting, some violence and purposly no gratuitous pics if Osama Bin Laden.<br />Chastain is pretty god, the story builds appropriately and the characters interesting.<br />Probably a 6.5 or 7 of 10.
B0000844I8|5.0|I was an excellent movie, and I particularly liked the special features on the second disc. It was as good as I remembered it to be.!
B001HN6918|5.0|My kids love all of hte Panda movies...this one in particular really kept their attention throughout the entire movie.  I hope there is a Panda 3 on the horizon.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Not too challenging...I'm not a dedicated gamer.  A nice leisurely game of logic, limited to 44 actual &#34;puzzles.&#34;  I hope there will be a sequel.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I originally started this game on iPhone due to a friends recommendation.  The iPhone update caused the price of a land expansion to go from 4,000 - 6,000 coins (for a 3rd expansion) to 940,000.  Similarly, the game bucks cost went from about 20 to 280.  A bug report was submitted with no results...therefore unplayable.<br />So, I switched to the Kindle app.  The latest update now is in a continuous loop...entering the game tells you there is an update, go to the app store, which only allows you to open the game,which tells you to go to the app store, which only allows you to open the game....<br />If you enjoy a game which the programmers and marketing just throws something out there to get you to buy game bucks, this is for you...though if you cant get in, that business model ain't working so well.<br />Otherwise, don't bother downloading this, and certainly don't put any real money into it.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was an excellent movie with a true-feeling of heartfelt drama. Naomi Watts was a gem. Ewan McGregor and the young man playing the fantastic oldest son rounded out this emotional true story. Wish ending had been a bit more.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Not just a boring plot.Interesting insights into folks with mental health issues.Actors were believable. Do not watch if you are depressed, however!
1401311091|4.0|I was a little apprehensive because the book is ghostwritten. I was pleasantly surprised, though. Heat Wave is fast paced and engaging. I've ordered the second, third and fourth books in the series.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I get the new version that it request then it tells me to update app at the app store , yet it won't even let me update!  What the heck I can't even play. Please fix this***__thank you for fixing! That was quick! I do love this game
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Someone finally put everything I believe in 1 book.  Get Happy.  Having joyful fun with everyday life.<br />I dont allow my self to feel sad or down any more.  A must read!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|If you want to understand the basic tenets of evolution and don't have a biology background, this is the book for you. It gives concise explanations and brings to light amazing facts that you probably have never even pondered.  Though Dawkins is obviously the world's most well-known atheist, this book is written strictly from a biology standpoint, and I found it not to be on biased in that respect.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Sherlock is a great series ... very very addicting, awesome and exciting ... Superb video quality made it more enjoyable
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for my kids but I have so much fun with it .it's hard to put down.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This little cover rocks. I wish I would have bought it before I dropped and cracked my screen. I had this for a few months before I upgraded to the 5.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My husband really likes this app as he is a weather addict. So we can have the weather at his finger tips.
B0063IH60K|5.0|would tell others and wish I could more but that's on me why do you require this many words I see no reason for that
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It's such a classic, that how you can you not love it? It's free, classic, and entertaining, great for holidays
B0094BB4TW|4.0|not bright enough for me<br />why do I have to add more words if this is the only problem I see
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Without a doubt, Downton Abbey is one of the best viewing experiences my wife and I have ever had (movie or TV).  The writing, acting, and cinematography is absolutely superb!<br /><br />We just finished watching the 2nd season finale last night and can't wait to watch the premier episode for season 3.  It is one of those series that you wish would go on forever but you know that, sadly, it won't.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Mud is an okay movie - probably would not have spent the money to rent it - if I had known what it was or would have rented it on Redbox since that is cheaper.
0783229526|5.0|Fear and loathing...its a classic move.  Depp and Del Toro getting into crazy Vegas antics.  Its one you just have to have in the collection.
1594202842|5.0|For any one who loves structure, hard work, and discipline this book will inspire you!! The only thing I have against the author is that she should have done something when the old lady struck her daughter on several occasions with a pencil which I taught was fustrating. I am glad Lulu did not return to practice with that instructor. Great book!!!
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Naught this controller wanting a little different experience from the ps3 controller and try something different. The controller looked great and when I got felt really comfortable but then quickly noticed the sticks where inatiquite. Due to this my skills in both third and first person shooters where brought down. The buttons didn't feel responsive and stuck at various times through out gameplay. The controller does not use Bluetooth connectivity so it requires a USB dongle, so sometimes the controller would disconnect from time to time and often found this rather annoying. This had great potential.
0307341577|4.0|Gillian Floyd is a gifted writer and kind of a twisted puppy.  I've now read both Dark Places and Gone Girl, two books with characters who work so hard to be unlikeable - they lie, they steal, they manipulate - and yet you're mesmerized and reading as fast as you can to find out what will happen next.<br /><br />Libby, the protagonist of Dark Places, is the survivor of a massacre, losing her mother and two sisters in a bloody, horrific crime involving a knife, an axe, and satanic symbols painted in blood on the walls.  Young Libby's testimony sends her brother Ben to jail for a crime that spins the nation into hysteria over the dangers of satanic cults.<br /><br />We meet Libby as a young adult, depressed and destitute, resenting the victims of other mass murders for ending the flow of donations that has been her livelihood.<br /><br />At the end of her money, Libby accepts the invitation of a \\"kill club\\" - a group that obsessively collects memorabilia and investigates mass murders - and (for money) agrees to revisit and question the massacre, her brother's guilt, her childhood testimony, and the details of a life that was grim and desperate long before the knife and axe killed her family.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Libby, flashback from the dead mother, and flashback from accused murderer Ben, this is a finely-described, compelling page-turner that will keep you awake trying to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Numerous surprises in store, and a satisfying conclusion.  You may not walk away liking all these characters, but they have all earned their \\"dark places,\\" and you will certainly never forget them.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. It is very horrior and awesome! I enjoyed every moment of it and if you liked the old Evil dead this is worth a watch and even a buy!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that Expendables 2 was just as good, if not better, than the first film.  As we all know, that is hard to accomplish.  It was exciting from beginning to end.  Those who watch this and are shocked by the amount of violence are fools and idiots.  Just look at the cover and the plethora of action film stars who are notorious for acting in violent action movies.  Or, you can be really innovative and read the films warnings/ratings...  The music was a perfect fit, the language rough, but expected.  I would definitely watch this again and recommend it to the right kind of viewer.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Like many good ideas in the movie business, this one is a carbon copy of the first version. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But if there is a third installment it better offer something new!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A nicely done game.  Interesting puzzles, excellent interface, smooth controls.  Also game imagery is artistic, highly detailed, and beautiful.  Only real complaint is that the game wasn't long enough.  Completed entire game in roughly two hours.  Since I finished all the puzzles replay value is minimal.  Finding the solutions is tricky and the hints helped keep me on the right track a few times without necessarily giving anything away.  I hope they make more puzzles, with perhaps something more in depth.  The look and feel of the game made it feel like I got my money's worth, but with so little play time I feel a bit cheated.  Maybe they can create new rooms and puzzles but offer them at a discounted price when previous versions are already owned.  I do recommend this game to anyone who values game imagery, fluid controls, and challenging puzzles.  It is not for the easily frustrated.  Good luck, and enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I simply love this game! Very cool graphics and lotsa  powerups. Just keep running! Will I ever be safe from the killer gorilla?
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I really thought this was overall an entertaining and creative movie for the family. It was funny but not so childish that adults can't enjoy it. Of course, there is violence which the title itself indicates so I don't think it'd be appropriate for toddlers. Like I said, overall just a good movie.
1609611543|3.0|I understand the concern about the ingredients that is put in food these days, some of which is unrecognizable as real food.  However, eliminating wheat totally from my diet is just too extreme to maintain forever.  It is nice to get a bagel now and then, so while I do avoid wheat products when possible, I personally find it impossible to eliminate it totally.  I think any extreme diet is impossible to maintain.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|App updated automatically three days ago.  Now when I try to open it to play, I'm told an update is available and only given the option to go to app store.  When I go to app store, there is not an update because IT ALREADY UPDATED THREE DAYS AGO!  This is unacceptable.  Fix it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you liked the hunger games, I would recommend this book. Not only has Katniss's character begun to develop more, but the character's relationship with each other are more complex and exciting! I felt that the ending was a bit rushed and lacked a real proper ending that novels should have, even if they are in a series. Which is why this is only four stars. I generally felt that conspiracy of the other district was very nicely played.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an amazing story. Sad. Tear jerked. Two amazingly intelligent teens going through a horrible situation. Poor Gus! Loved Hazel Grace!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I LOVE this game!  I went to play this morning and I experienced what other viewers have mentioned....&quot;New Update&quot;!  I downloaded the game again and same message appeared.  I took the game off device and cloud, downloaded again and still no results!  Without shame, I can admit I am addicted to this game and my settlers were relying on me for timber....Ha!  HELP!!!
144236419X|5.0|Quick Shipping, Perfect Condition, This book is quite interesting, lets one see how so many lives were effected and changed by the war
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful game. The puzzles are challenging and intelligent without being frustrating. I didn't want it to end so soon - I hope there's more to come.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|I really love the sound and music in this album. He has such a great voice and it lent itself well to all the songs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one that all my siblings can bond with, I can play for hours on end but we can't do that because I have 7.1 and they have 7.3, keep working hard!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Season 4 it good but after the ending season3 had it was hard to beat. Would definitely recommend this show
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Well acted movie. The story line keeps you trying to guess the ending with not much luck. Enough mystery to be interesting.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Had a good thing going then left too much unanswered and tons of parts of the story that had no purpose. Never climaxed.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Thought this was great for all ages. Sure to make you laugh. My granddaughter loved it, she has also seen it multiple times with me.
0062073478|5.0|My daughter (11) loved reading this book and I am going to read it again: such an interesting concept, all the characters die, but who murdered them?
B004N6369Y|3.0|Sentimental, family oriented book. Love lost, love gained. Trials, misunderstanding and then hope, forgiveness and trust results. Happy ending. Good beach read.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|liked this movie because it was about his best film I think, Psycho and the making of it and what really inspired him.
082300659X|5.0|If you are a beginner with a strong desire to learn to draw, then I highly recommend this book! It is very well written and the videos that comes<br />with the kindle edition (I'm reading this on an Ipad) are amazing. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into making this book.<br /><br />The instructions are very clear and the author really knows how to get an idea across in a very simple way. Of all the books I've bought that teaches how to draw, this is my favourite!
B006QQ77F8|3.0|This older version (black and white) Lolita not what I expected, pretty much the same as the 1997 version but with a few changes and the sex is implied not out in your face like the colored version in 1997. If you never read the book eventually you see whats going on of course , but it was not for me, not a big fan of black and white films though so that influenced my decision.
B0094KTCCY|2.0|This movie doesn't quite have the charm of the original or Muppets Take Manhattan.  Maybe I'm just expecting too much, but I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  Plus it's too similar to MTM.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It has been very frustrating that there seems to be no easy way to access my small business account email, that is through Yahoo and readily is available over the internet, through my Yahoo app.  Additionally, because I have the Yahoo app, every time I log into my Yahoo account from my phone over the web, it converts it automatically to this app and I can't get my small business email.  I'm about ready to look at a different server for my website and business email accounts.
B000NW5CDK|4.0|This documentary uses very good archival footage and guarded yet revealing interviews. Does not glorify Dylan as you might expect but rather paints him in the light of an opportunist (even thief) with chameleon like qualities and a knack for reinventing himself.<br /><br />While the doc works hard at exploring the context Dylan's rise to fame, it falls short of  clearly coalescing the opportunist and the artist to make it a satisfying look at a very important cultural figure and leaves more questions on the table than it answers.  Well worth watching even with the feeling of wanting to know more that it leaves you with.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was the first book I read by this author. I loved the twists & turns. This book was very well written & I can't wait to read another one of his books!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Love Florence and her machine.  :) good CD as always. I haven't been disappointed in any of the songs on it. I give it a definite buy it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love the story line, even with the ending.  I cried my eyes out.  I would definitely read it over again.
B00846REIS|4.0|Well written story that kept me engaged and wanting to read on.  However, I was not expecting it to be as erotic as it was. Also be warned of the use of some strong language ... could have done without that.  Similar to the Shades of Gray series but in my opinion, better written.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This movie outlines the facts of what actually happened with the collapse of the World economy. The general population does not know these facts, and probably doesn't care. That's a sad commentary on the voting public.<br />Wake up, people. They are all in each others pockets. They might have started out with good intentions, but then reality sets in and they have to repay those favors that got them there.<br />None of the underlying problems have been resolved.<br />Watch this movie. Know the truth! It's astounding.<br />Well done!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very addictive game for any age! The whole family will definitely enjoy it. And best of all it's free! You can't go wrong!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved so many aspects of this book - humanizing the tragic orphan train episode in American history; the relationship between Molly (17) and Vivian (91); the Maine setting, just to name a few. The author does a wonderful job of interrelating the lives of the two women. I didn't want the story to end!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a very good app game.  I am greatly enjoying it.  It offers challenges when you need them.  Looking forward to playing more and more.  The designs are varied and make you work at it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was addicted to this book within the first two pages. The way the author writes is fast...some vulgar language (which I appreciate) and just all around nail biting....page flipping...the kind of book you just CANT put down. I was curious and anxious to start a new book filled with suspense and a unfamiliar writing style. Going into this with no expectations...I became a HUGE fan of Gillian Flynn. I will be downloading one of her other two books soon!!!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Politically &#34;correct&#34; version of southern living one version painted of some persons doing bad things poorly written  and violence driven and &#34;drivel&#34; a waste of some good actors time.
B00669MFA2|5.0|It was a clear black night a full white moon warren g was on the streets tryin to consume. No really it was a good movie
B003I55BIA|4.0|**3.5 stars for me**<br /><br />To outsiders Brittany has it all. She is popular, pretty & rich...she also is full of secrets. Life is not always perfect.<br /><br />Alex has never had a perfect life. His father was murdered and he is following in his gang footsteps trying to protect his family. He is rough and tough but with a sensitive heart no matter how he trys to pretend that isnt the case.<br /><br />They are both quick to judge the other but come to realize that they are not what the others imagines. Alex isn't the punk people think he is and Brittany's life is far from perfect. BUT together they come up with their version of perfect.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry turned out to be a pretty sweet romance even with gangs, tattoos, violence, traitors, ex's, etc...<br />I enjoyed reading it but I personally think this book is overpriced at over $7. It was a sweet read but just didnt leave me with that OMG feeling afterwards.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This app was already glitchy since today's upgrade it is continuously looping requesting for me to upgrade. this needs to be fixed before my crops die!! :)
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I thought that I would be thrilled. I have always wondered what the story would be on Oz.. Glad to have watched it at home.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game for family learning teacher the kids life situation I love it and can not put it down I at it on kindle and trails tribulations in
B000T433CO|5.0|My best friend and I sat down with a bottle of wine and watched this movies and we laughed til we cried. Great movie!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I Liked it. You do have to rely on the hint button alot  to know where to go. Great graphics and storyline. Enjoyed changing a tire on the truck. It is,a fun game.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|good movie. I didn't expect the ending that happened. I am glad that I got to watch it at home
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like the minions from Despicable Me, you'll love this game! You get to see Victor, El Macho, and more! Just get the app already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|There was more I liked about the movie than what I didn't like. He always gives his 100% in his movie's.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I didn't just ordered part one but up to part 3 of Die Hard, and i loved it because now my family is complete of this series.<br />I gave it a 5 star because the price is reasonable, it wasn't too hard to find it here in Amazon, and i love how it was sent on a timely matter and in great condition of packaging.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This worship CD has more than met our expectations - very uplifting!  We highly recommend it.  As you listen to this CD (or DVD) you will be brought into the presence of Jesus.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a great series.  Makes you want to live there.  Simpler times. Everyone knows each other . Brendan Coyle is great in it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show is amazing. A truly epic story, with deep characters, delving deeply into what makes each of them tick
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The story line didn't sound interesting to me, but after watching the first episode of Season 1 I was hooked.  Dialogue is very well written, excellent cinematography - particularly for a tv show - and great character development.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I grew up on classic rock. This is a great CD. Great choice of songs and all the memories too!
B002SHD9E2|4.0|Though Sarah Brightman is still the best &#34;Christen,&#34; Emmy Rossum was better than the Broadway substitute we saw.  It was easier to follow the plot watching the movie, and the ability to pause and rewind made the experience very enjoyable.
B00DHNBY02|4.0|Lives to Sam Raimi's original. Beautifully scored. The minimal use of CG gives it a more realistic feel to other horror films. Definitely worth watching by anyone in general.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|Very solid build quality.<br />Keeps accurate time<br />Makes a statement on your wrist.<br />Like the automatic movement.<br />Very solid value for the $$
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Could have used a bit more of Charlize, but the action is there, and the CAD effects are awesome.  Worth the price.
B000000OY9|4.0|I find it hard to believe that this album only averages three stars (with, as of this writing, 17 one-star reviews!) while the pile of junk that is \\"Everybody's Rockin'\\", a contractual obligation album if ever there was one, has four stars.  That just boggles my mind.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I came to Neil Young's music relatively late - I was familiar with his early hits, but hadn't bought an album until Freedom (drawn in by Rockin' in the Free World), then started exploring his back catalog.  The first time I heard Landing on Water I really liked it, and I still do.  I'm guessing most of the negative reviews come from people who were expecting the folkie Neil or the hard-rocking Crazy Horse Neil, and were thrown off by the keyboards, new-wave production and choir background vocals on this album.  I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of those choir vocals, but other than that this is a solid Neil Young album.  I particularly like the first three tracks and the song Pressure, but there's not a single song on the disc that I think is terrible.<br /><br />Don't let all the negative reviews from people who weren't ready for this album dissuade you - if you're a Neil Young fan, this album's worth hearing.
B00E193TM2|5.0|AWESOME ALBUM! Love it Every Track is Great! Even the remake of Mama said knock you out! These guys ROCK!<br />the singer reminds me of James Hetfield because he can Sing and he can scream! WHOOOOOOOO! FFDP ROCKS!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Best gritty drama in a long time! Sexy, smart, darkly funny, disturbingly pathological--can't help but watch! :-) Need I say more?
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Like most every track and its typical Megadeth, I like that Dave is mellowing out a lil, but just a lil!
B000SNW0HA|5.0|Including the hit song 'Around The World' This album came out for my graduation from Art and Design school in 1996.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|YOU can not beat Black Sabbath with Ozzy fronting the band! I do Miss Bill Ward but This is the best Sabbath Album since Paranoid!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|the new update won't even allow me to play. i loved this game until this happened.  please fix it now!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a witty fun show. It hooks you in from the first show. I wanted to keep watching episode after episode.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ivlove this app. I have it updated on my ipod but it doesn't have the update on this yet. I was wondering if it was possible to have them both have the same update on the same day.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Regardless of whether you like Sci-fi or not, I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a good story!
B000IMKDPC|5.0|Saw Wolverine at the movies the other day, am not watching all the other movies of the X-Men, from start to present.  They are great!  Wish I would've watched them when they first came out!
B002OKGJUO|4.0|This is a must see for anyone interested in this type of film. The very limited and rare use of special effects show just how far we have come and how a good director can create the appropriate effect without them.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Indiana Jones has become an adventure icon and there are few movies that keep the viewer engaged and entertained from start to finish. Perfectly cast as Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford delivers romance, humor, adventure and heart-stopping action in each of his movies in this series. The supporting cast members in each of the movies add their special acting skills and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. This is the ultimate collection for action/adventure fans of all ages and the series promises to provide many movie nights, appropriate for the whole family's viewing enjoyment! Even if you watch them over and over, they never get tiresome, you'll always end up on the edge of your seat and you may see something you had missed before.This series is truly great entertainment!
B005MMZ63C|3.0|I am not big on old movies but figured it was time to see this one.  The quality was good.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|I enjoyed this app very much but not as much as the first. I don't like the fact you have to rate the app for more weapons.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|If you're looking for a suspenseful crime thriller then check out Time Killer. The author gives the perfect potion of information leaving you partially guessing and always intrigued. There are scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat and you will keep turning the pages. The descriptions are great, the pacing is just right. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting and awesome read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun game! Not only for me, but my daughter as well!! Keeps us entertained for hours!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and easy to play :) I would recommend this to anyone I've the age of 6 because it could get complicated for younger kids but other than that it is sooo much fun!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|loved it until it told me to update. it won't work now. it keeps telling me to update. way to go amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|mind boggling so it was hard to put my kindle down. could not wait to find the clues and hidden items to advance to the next level.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Exactly what I expect from Bastille. Great music and even better lyrics. Great for people that like an electronic feel to there music.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Fast paced and fairly accurate with weapon tech.  A very enjoyable afternoon  book to pass time with.  Jack Reacher is a force to be reckoned with.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I love my case because it allows me to read my kindle without the case getting in the way, and then just slips right back on to protect it when I'm done.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I was addicted to it the first season and couldn't get season 6 on netflix so I bought it off amazon worth every penny to finish the series.
B005544V6A|4.0|It is smart, complicated, or should I say complex and sophisticated, but all in good taste. Very refreshing to hear tough guys without obscenities, powerful women without the hysterical attitude.<br />A very refreshing stile altogether where you can go an entire hour without blood, guts and dismembered corpses.<br />The conclusion: it is possible to enjoy something intelligently made and still be on the edge of the chair. Oh, wait, no one watches TV from a chair anymore...make that a couch or lazy-boy.<br />So why is it &#34;Almost&#34; there? It is just my personal opinion but they (the creators) could spend just a little more on expanded outdoor scenes, maybe even some air travel, Miami hotels or a witness in London or Dusseldorf...anyway, you get the idea: a few more bucks and we could be &#34;there&#34;, all the way.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book but was a little disappointed that there was so much technical stuff and not enough about the actual experience.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Love this movie! The actors are great, the scenery is beautiful, & the storyline is touching. Highly recommend this movie
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was a really cute book.  I have heard of it from other people so I bought it for my daughter and she loved it.  I also read it and I thought it was good.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|It is great for writing and playing games. As far as that goes it just plain great use for all things on the Kindle.
B008133MDK|5.0|So smart and well done . Sir Conan Doyle would enjoy seeing his stories brought into the 21st century. both actors are perfect in the roles
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have reading sci -fi for over fifty years and this author deserves a big thank you for crafting a well thought story's line and people you come to genuinely care about. Not seeing the end coming on the first half of the book was nice and seeing people actually change their opinions as they aquire new information is refreshing.  I for one believe that bad people don't see themselves as bad...often just the opposite.<br /> I look forward to more great stories and once again ...thanks!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I can't wait for season 2. I think the writers have captured the true personality for the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Conan Doyle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. Easy enough that you can always figure it out, just hard enough that you don't lose interest.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Did not know what to expect, but I enjoyed it.  A good ride with some unexpected twists. I would recommend.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|My son loaded this on my Kindle. I made him uninstall it. I do NOT want that hideous green toothy mug on MY Kindle!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Those constant pop-ups between games are ridiculous!! Other than them I really do like the game. I like being able to compete against myself--striving to improve.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Its easy to win and it gets fun after a while. The only thing I like is the way it makes you work to win.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It keeps on saying that I need to update and I did and now it won't let's me play the game...
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Have not tried it yet.  Do n ot know how to work it.  Don't know how to play it. what can I do.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I have a 2 year degree in Applied Sciences. I still found this a very dry read. I feel that it might be enjoyed more by someone with a higher degree or more geared toward neurosurgery.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|The new functionality: being able to enlarge a photo or read comments, then touching the back-arrow and getting back to the same place without the news feed whipping to the top of the list. I love that.
B009ZQRS2I|2.0|This movie brings up many interesting questions. How will true VR affect the world? Will we forget which reality we're in? What will it mean to be human when we can't tell the difference between humans and computer generated bots?<br /><br />Acting is rather poor. Story is not great. If you're a tech enthusiast, this is worth watching once. If not, I do not recommend this movie.
B00ALGW286|5.0|Marina is a bright and determined fourteen year old girl who is living in Moscow. The novel starts just before her entrance into the Russian equivalent of high school. Which, coincidentally, happens during the very last summer of the old Soviet Union.<br /><br />Her dream is to travel and see the world. For that, she is learning English, transfers to a specialized high school that has a heavy emphasis on foreign languages, and is planning to take exams for the Moscow State Linguistics University, a school that will allow her to get a job as a Russian-English interpreter, or perhaps even work with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or something similar; jobs like that are a ticket to see the outside world.<br /><br />Marina and her friend Nadia go shopping for school supplies, and decide to stop on the way to try this new exotic food they've heard so much about from a newly opened, \\"fancy\\" American restaurant, McDonald's. As they leave, the girls find themselves right in the middle of the  Soviet coup d'&eacute;tat attempt of 1991. Tanks are roaming the streets of Moscow, the hard-line Communist \\"Emergency Committee\\" is making declarations, people protesting one side of the putsch or the other, and the state TV stations are broadcasting nothing but \\"Swan Lake\\" ballet. Boris Yeltsin, then the president of the Russian Republic, is gathering support and making a stand in the Parliament building.<br /><br />Things are changing and will never be the same.<br /><br />This novel, \\"Moscow Dreams,\\" is a coming of age story, for both Marina and the just-born Russian democracy. Not everything in the storyline is tied up to the politics and social and economic changes of the time. Friendship, love, desire for a better future are universal independent of what government is in charge. However, Marina's life, whether she likes it or not, and lives of her friends, are affected by those changes. It is interesting to see how an uncertainty in the future gradually develops over the period of a couple of years, and how the young people, especially Marina and Nicolai, are managing to still strive to achieve their dreams.<br /><br />This novel is also a treasure trove of little, but authentic tidbits about the Russian culture. Celebrating New Year's eve instead of Christmas, for example. It's still the biggest holiday for Russians, no matter where they live; even though, today, they celebrate Christmas as well. Truly, reading this book was like taking a time machine into that era, at least for me. I was a couple of years older than the protagonists, but I still remember the references and the general ambiance of that time.<br /><br />The constant theme that is running through this novel is \\"change.\\" Frightening, yet exciting change, with absolutely no guarantees for the future, that can be experienced only by those who lived through turbulent times. There is a constant metaphor for this \\"change\\" in the form of a colorful, sacred Tibetan sand, that Marina's father brought for her from one of his overseas expeditions, that runs through the story and neatly loops into itself at the end.<br /><br />A couple more things to say about this book. First, it's authentic, down to little details. The author was there, in Moscow, when the events unfolded, and experienced everything first-hand. Secondly, the way this book is written is textbook-perfect. The language is deceptively simple and clear; the words melt into the background and do not interfere with your immersion into the story; the characters act naturally; the dialogs and the actions of characters move the story forward; the storyline has twists that keep the pages turning. This is no surprise: the author is a college professor who teaches English composition. So, if you are interested in the coming of age novels with a historical twist, pick this book up, you won't be disappointed. Recommended.couple of years, and how the young people, especially Marina and Nicolai, are managing to still strive to achieve their dreams.<br /><br />This novel is also a treasure trove of little, but authentic tidbits about the Russian culture.

0446310786|5.0|One of those required books from school that I avoided reading for years; I finally picked this up recently when different friends used references from the book and I had no idea what they were talking about. [Note: I haven't yet seen the classic movie either].  So, I went in fighting.  I was swept up nicely by the rhythm of Scout's narrative and her sharp impressions of people and surroundings.  An old soul, moulding into a younger version of Atticus.  The varying threads of the extended family, the central trial and its fallout, Dill, Boo Radley, Miss Maudie's fire, a rabid dog were all given a fair amount of time and the right amount of detail.  I especially was taken the inner workings between Scout, Jem & Atticus alongside Aunt Alexandra and Calpurnia.  I've read criticism's of the characters as one-dimensional - a criticism I don't agree with.  The main characters each are distinct and as everything is seen through the eyes of a young girl - receiving her impressions of the world around her is captured well.  Scout complicates the simple things and simplifies the complicated.  Once the book wrapped up - I re-read the first chapter and then the last chapter to close the story better in my mind (details at the open of chapter one that ties in with the book's close).

It does, however consistently want you to play online, which for those who want to maintain some privacy is an issue.

B008WOULPK|4.0|A fun, quick read. Provides insight into the fashion industry over the years from the point of view of a hard-working and charming personality.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is a great show.  It is funny, engaging, somewhat educational, and extremely entertaining.<br /><br />The relationships in this show will leave you either laughing or crying as the characters try to win cases for their clients.<br /><br />While many law shows are drab and drawn out, Suits almost enters the realm of Science Fiction thanks to the immaculate photographic memory and keen intelligence of associate and co-leading character Mike Ross.<br /><br />I would have given it 5/5 stars, but several factors have led me to give it a lower score:<br /><br />1.  Once one sees the outcome of a dilema, there is significantly less entertainment value for watching that episode a second or third time.<br /><br />2.  Whenever a dilema occurs in the firm, Jessica Pearson's only response is &#34;Make it go away.&#34;  She must have said this line a dozen times throughout the season to the point where it just became cliche.<br /><br />3.  The activities in the firm are highly unrealistic.  Harvey Spector and Mike Ross seem to get ALL of the attention, as though the firm has absolutely no other important or interesting cases being dealt with at the time.  Some of the cases (I won't ruin it) are also unrealistic, though I am mainly referring to the big case at the beginning of season 2.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, the show is still highly entertaining (and definitely one of the smartest shows currently on TV)
0061692034|1.0|Canada by Richard Ford<br /><br />Here is a book that does not live up to the hype on the cover.  In fact I can almost feel the reviewers trying to come up with some praise that does not say too much.  `Here is greatness. No doubt about it.' Says Eileen Battersby, Irish Times.<br /><br />The book begins telling us about an unlikely couple, Bev Parsons and Neeva Kamper.  He's a retired Captain from the Air Force and she is a Polish immigrant.  We hear again and again about how foreign she looks and how different she is.  She doesn't want to assimilate or associate with anyone in small town America. She got pregnant young with twins by Bev and they married and moved from one Air Force base to another for the children's first 15 years.  They came to a stop in Great Falls, Montana in 1956.  Bev goes through a series of jobs selling cars and the like before getting into trouble selling stolen beef to a restaurant.  The Indians he bought the beef from were left short money and threatened him.<br /><br />He always wanted to rob a bank so he convinced his law abiding wife to rob one with him. We get no reasonable explanation for this.  She seems to be an intelligent woman.  They commit the robbery in Chapter 16 and get the grand amount of $2,500, $2,000 of which they owe to the Indians.<br /><br />Chapter 30 - they get caught and taken away to jail.  The children are left home alone and no one thinks to take care of them.<br /><br />We are told in great detail what everyone is wearing, almost on every page and the style is slow, monotonous, plodding and very dry and boring.  The parents don't give much thought to their children or the fact that they are due to start high school in the Fall.  The story is told by Dell, their son who is far more concerned by the practicalities of his education and where they are going to live than anyone else.<br /><br />His twin sister, Berner is less concerned and has a boyfriend who takes up most of her time. The children have a good relationship with each other and love their parents even though the parents seem to know little about them.<br /><br />Chapter 60 sees Dell going off to Canada at last.  Taken by his mother's friend.  I'm afraid that was as much time as I could bear to give this book and the remaining 39 chapter had no interest for me whatsoever.
B002N1AERI|5.0|Got this along side &#34;Requiem of The Indifferent&#34; by the same seller, they came way early and in perfect condition, in plastic wrap, I popped this in the PS3 to play and I know iI loved each song before hearing the collective album, but the whole album played out just has some sort of magic, its so well done, and creative enthralling, the messages and art of this album is idk tear jerking!<br />Please buy this, seriously.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. There's nothing like a book with memorable quotes and this is one of them. I definitely recommend it.
0345472322|1.0|For me, too many examples of people (previous students, patients) who manifested similar traits that reflect major themes of the book. Seems like many of her examples referred back to her time at Columbia Univ, and not more recent work at Stanford. I am amused that one of the book's reviewers, Dr. Edward Hallowell is considered an expert on ADHD. I'm not clear how that relates to helping one assess and change one's mind-set. Personally, I'd rather read and attend trainings by Wilson Learning, as their group trainings are more relevant and direct. See:  [...]
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I was a bit too old for this movie when it was first released and never really saw it in its entirety until recently.  I sat down with my family one night to try out a new streaming box with our Amazon Prime account and found The Goonies HD was a free selection.  My 5 year old was a bit scared of Chunk at first but our 9 year old loved it.  After their first viewing of the movie that night, they couldn't get enough of it and they have watched it about 5 times in a week now!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Good writing, I just do not care for Gillian Flynn's stories. This one in particular I didn't like either of the main characters. I do want to say more but fear it would give to much away.  Second book I have read by this author and both not a big fan of because they are a bit dark, and depressing and I go away feeling like a bit of my soul was sucked away.  So I guess in that sense she is doing a darn good job at writing, if that is what she wants her readers to feel. I do think they would make good book club books though.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Loved Book 1 & Book 2 didn't disappoint! Clare is a brilliant storyteller! Very much looking forward to Book 3.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|And I am glad that I finally purchased this DVD.  Cabaret, along with great music, is a look at a time in Germany's history when things were getting to be very scary.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Wow. I can't describe this book in words. I loved this one because it was the battle against Valentine and the Shadowhunters/Downworlders. LOVED! There was so much action with this story compared with the others. How the author has seemed to amaze me even more is beyond me. I'm starting the fourth book after I finish this one. This is probably the only book out of the three I've read so far that didn't leave me wanting to strangle someone. You MUST read this!!!

B005723JSQ|4.0|This is typical Kinsella. A fun, fast, adorable romp full of &#34;did she really do that?!&#34; moments and sarcastic British wit. I read it in a very short time and really enjoyed it. You are not going to come out of the other side of this novel a changed person, but if you are looking for a very fun vacation read, I recommend it!
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Awesome movie good enough to watch it more than once :-) love the special effects great that its two hours long
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey manages to create a believable world occurring after some unspecific apocalypse.  The characters are flawed and lovable, and the story fast paced and addictive to the point that I've been up until 6am reading this damn thing!  I want a book club.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have not read this genre of books in over 30 years, but my son and grandson felt I needed to expand my reading, so they bought me a number of books and this was one of them....It is a continuation of Patrick Rothfuss's first book 'The Name of The Wind.' I enjoyed both books from the beginning to the end. It is fast paced an amazing story. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Great game ! Challenging levels, especially if you try to collect all the stars, some are really well hidden later in the game. Soft soothing music. Just a perfect labyrinth game :)<br />Minor thing : it would be a great idea to add g-sensor calibration ! Other than that amazing !
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I, unlike much of the world, did not run out and buy this when it was released, as I was not as taken with Love Song as most of the planet. I bought Kaliedescope Heart and basically memorized it and used it as my life track for months. I bought this only when her newest came out, and at that time bought all her CDs I could. Her range, her instrumentation, and her pitch are wonderful, but her writing is superior. And I have since come to appreciate Love Song!!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I love Judd Apatow movies and was looking forward to this quite a lot.  The laughs were far and few inbetween and in the end I actually found it to be a pretty depressing movie.  The upswing and resolution to the film felt less affirming of love and family and more like settling for what you're stuck with, without the redemption of a good laugh.
B008ODZNLG|3.0|This was a good documentary with a great life lesson: If you work hard and you go the extra mile you will be successful in whatever you put that energy into. I enjoyed this movie and do not regret watching it. However, it's a documentary that you can watch once and you got everything that you ever will out of it. I feel like I wouldn't have minded viewing it a second time if they had cut it down by half an hour or so. There is a lot here that isn't necessary and takes a lot of time to talk about... multiple times.. In essence, I don't feel like this is an epic and awesome documentary, but if you would like to get some cultural perspective (his eldest son has been his apprentice since he was 19 and is now in his 50's) and some perspective into what it takes to truly be accomplished than this film is a good film to watch. Oh, it's also good to watch if you like sushi and you want to see how the best of the best operate their shop. :P
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I grudgingly agreed to watch this with my boyfriend.  He loves Seth MacFarlane.  I could readily do without.<br /><br />So, I went into this with low expectations and, honestly, not the most open mind.  Wow, what a surprise!  It was really funny and, strangely affirming of love and friendship.  It managed to both be wholesome and chocked full of raunchy humor.  I enjoyed it enough to rent it a second time.<br /><br />If you're like me and can't stand Family Guy, don't necessarily write this off.  It's pretty darn redeeming.

B008YKGQR4|1.0|Don't download this app you will never get rid of it. It's like a virus every time you try to uninstall it it automatically reinstalls. Won't even sign on to facebook it may be a keylogger. Tried everything I can think of can't get rid of it.

B00ECU34ZM|3.0|But he is excellent as usual.  He is a great actor and, of course, without him in this movie it might as well have been a flop!
0446672653|2.0|I find this book very disappointing. I am fascinated with books on reincarnation but this one didn't move me a bit.Took me a week to finish it. It reads like a common fiction book.Didn't sound believable at all , maybe it's the way of writing ,I don't know.After reading enough good reviews I am very disappointed . I would give it one star but that means 'I hate it' and I just 'don't like it '-which is two stars.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie was thrilling and action-packed.  Truly an awesome movie worth watching and, perhaps, even watching a second time when it comes out on regular TV :-)

B0043JDUNS|3.0|...which can be fine if you're looking for more of the same. I was. So I liked it. Three stars because it's just action adventure fun. Nothing heavy. No super duper acting licks. Sometimes all you want is entertainment of this sort, and this franchise is good with that.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|great movie - not particularly relevant but a great way to spend an evening. I always enjoy all three main characters, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts - that alone is a pretty good reason to give it a chance. and it's good fun.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This is a clever idea. Cute, but predictable. Forgettable. No special acting licks. No great stunts. Just a cute story.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|A little confusing at first as to the relationship of the actors to each other.  Beautiful scenery and acting of the children was so real.  Julianne Hough was down to earth and a great actress.  Of course, Josh Duhamel is easy on the eyes!<br />Nicholas Sparks is a great storyteller, always with surprises intertwined in his story.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|I give three stars for entertainment value. That's about all there is here. But sometimes, that's all you're looking for. I enjoyed it.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|If you are a fan of the Star Wars Franchise, especially the original three films, this is the perfect deal. If you haven't yet seen them on Blue Ray you'll be blown away. They look like they were filmed yesterday. It's like watching them all over again for the for the first time. That said, there was a little bit for tinkering by the producers at Lucas Film and some of the additions, especially to Episode VI, are a little silly. That's the only flaw that keeps this from being 5 stars! Buy it though anyway :)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Written with beautiful, spare perfection.  Moving on a deep and personal level, the story's fantasy elements take a backseat to the sad, fond observations of childhood past.<br /><br />Even after having read Neil Gaiman's blog almost since its inception, I felt like I knew far more about him after reading this book - less because of Gaiman's inclusion of some semi-autobiographical anecdotes and more for his outlook on the days of youth.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This is a classic movie for both kids and adults. We all love it.  Hope to watch it again. ..

B00683JK9K|3.0|I have a hard time getting the pieces to do what I want them to do; So that frustrates me & makes me not want to play it.  To me, it has to be fun, al bit of a challenge, but not raise my blood pressure.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Although I enjoyed the book it was not as captivating as the previous novels by the same author. I found that it was definitely not a page turner yet I was happy to read sections at a time. Interesting but not riveting.
B004NJC0B6|5.0|This is a great concert. Anyone who loves Bon Scott will not find this lacking. You can see Angus's legendary energy alive and fresh.<br />Just wish Bon would have found a better pair of pants.
0375869026|5.0|Bought as a gift for my granddaughter and she said the book was received in great condition and she is having a great time reading it.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|The movie was very good; the video kept shutting off and I had to restart the movie from the beginning.  This video needs to be changed.<br /><br />Want refund!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Sometimes easy, sometimes challenging but fun altogether for the times folks would rather play a thinking game rather than a reacting game.  Similar in concept to myst but not nearly as engrossing.<br /><br />Definitely am enjoying this app.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Better than the previews. Kinda of a do the right thing movie, no mater the personal cost. The kind of character missing in America.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This thing is not even a beta product.<br /><br />First and foremost, the device does not connect to \\"N\\" networks. Devices you stream from can be on n, but not the Chromecast, it only supports b/g wi-fi connectivity. I was shocked by this myself, but after digging through the support page I finally found the unadvertised truth.<br /><br />This will limit the bandwidth to a ~2.75 MB (not megabit) per second. So be very aware that all transcoding and processing is being done on your laptop/desktop/mobile device/etc.<br /><br />So I excitedly plug the thing in, get it powered up, suffer through the wi-fi pairing dance, and start casting from chrome.<br /><br />The introduction video play back is stuttered, laggy, low res, and unwatchable. If this were a tv show I would lose my mind.<br /><br />The Chromecast tab in my browser starts to complain about poor performance and that my device should be on a \\"N\\" network if available. Due to the wi-fi pairing dance it wasn't. So I switch it over and start again. Video is a little better, but audio is sluuurrrrrrrrrrrrddddddddd. Audio and video quickly get out of sync. Again if this were a TV show it would be unwatchable. Mouths and voices need to sync up, it's not a \\"nice to have\\" feature, it's a \\"must do\\" requirement of any video streaming product.<br /><br />Yet again the chrome tab is complaining about \\"optimal performance\\".<br /><br />Fine, lets look at the settings. 720p is the MAXIMUM setting. The solution for poor performance is to set the resolution down to 480p. That's right kids, just downgrade to SD resolution and things will be fine...<br /><br />I decide to try it at 480p. Blocky, laggy, pixelated, hell.<br /><br />Fine, maybe its my source device. I startup my newer work laptop. Same problem. Fine, lets try my iPhone. Same. iPad (3rd gen) same.<br /><br />One of my co-workers brought his into the office thinking we could use it for screen sharing during meetings. Same kinds of issues. So its not a problem with myhardware, or my network. Three of my very tech savvy co-workers bought this thing thinking it was going to be AWESOME.  We have all since sold our devices at a profit through 3rd party sites, which is really a shame.<br /><br />People are overpaying for garbage. Do not buy this product until at least the next revision.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I only recently watched Downton Abbey through Amazon Prime.  I loved it so much that I watched all three seasons!  The characters are interesting and the story lines are great.  I highly recommend this series.

B00COGZ8FU|1.0|What a waste of time. Tom Cruse as Reacher is like Arnold Stang playing Rambo.  A younger Steven Segal or maybe even...Duane Johnson might have captured it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|She loves how much you can do on it. And for an initial price of free you can't beat it. And you can save a pic of your finished work to your photo album.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great Story and great performance, a definite tear jerker. The children are amazing actors, very impressive. I highly recommend this movie
0553801473|3.0|Argh! Just wrapped by 70-year-old brain around 959 pages and now have questions about \\"The Winds of Winter\\". Hopefully not as long or I will shred my face!<br /><br />Will Catelyn Stark be reunited with her 3 remaining children? Will it be under the heart tree at Winterfell where Bran, her 4th child is absorbed? Will she shred her face with her nails again when she finds that out? No One?<br /><br />Will mutilated-faced Brienne take herself & Jaimie to their deaths at the hand of Catelyn? No One?<br /><br />Will mutilated-faced Tyrion find \\"where whores go\\"? No One?<br /><br />Will Denerys FINALLY take her arse to Westeros, dragons and all? No One?<br /><br />And will Jon Snow survive his stabbings? Could he possibly be the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark? Or is it my brain that is being shredded by the endless characters? No One?<br /><br />Does the new book introduce 100 more new characters that have \\"aka\\" names? No One?<br /><br />And as for Reek. . . . . aka Turncoat, aka Theon. . . . . . .<br /><br />Signed: I am No One aka A VERY Disappointed Reader
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|There needs to be more ways to gain tokens to play games. I want to play more than one or more times an hour. I'm not paying money to play. Ridiculous
B002MFULQO|4.0|I lived these events and the movie makes a great case for multiple gunmen.  It has made me wonder, but not doubt the events as history has recorded them.  The movie could have been an hour shorter and still have made its point.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This is an Epic Story.. Must read... Reading Rabbit Run now by Updike (Working through Times top 100 books).. It is good, but I am afraid that after East of Eden nothing will compare.. Must read!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|More angry bird fun. Just keep them coming, with enough differences to keep it new. Keep up the good work.
B003B02O0A|4.0|This novel has well defined characters and a very plausable plot.  The story held my attention and I enjoyed reading the book.  John Grisham nearly always gets the story right as he did in this novel.  I am looking forward to reading the sequel when it is released in the e-book form.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I can't wait for season 4 to come to  Amazon prime. I love the show and I enjoyed every episode
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Thor was a good movie but the characters just didn't develop well enough.  This could have been a great movie but it would have had to be 1 hour longer.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|After a week the application freezes and not working properly. Don't trust instant positive reviews, like I did. I'll try another free calculator application.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|I enjoy watching, SciFi and I love a show with a twist of scifi, thrill and a kick of some romance (maybe).
1250007208|5.0|I just love, love, loved it! And it is not complicated to see why others may have as well. Cinder brings that whole Cinderella fairy-tale vibe, but with something more and a little twist. The characters live together in a mixture of Android and humans. How remarkable is that?! (Give me a moment to spaz!) I've mention this before, that I sometimes go complete wacky for a good YA Sci-fi and Fantasy book. Cinder, does just that.<br /><br />As Cinderella had her evil step-mother, Cinder has her \\"legal Guardian\\", Adri. Oh how can we ever forget the bothersome step-siblings? Well only Pearl is a pain in the ... Peony was a lovely character. They never once treated Cinder as a family member, more like their slave; working as a mechanic to earn pay for their belongings. It is infuriating. And as if Cinder's life isn't already hectic enough, there is a virus that is killing the people of New Beijing; on top of that, she finds herself getting involved with a handsome prince, Prince Kai. (Oh, illicit love.) And have I mentioned that she is a cyborg? I know. I know can this book get any better? Fortunately, yes. All this time, Cinder's life has been a mystery - a lie. There is more to her, and ... I will not be the one to tell you. *sticks out tongue*. I will not risk you throwing something at your desktop, or whatever you may be reading this review on, and then blame me for it! ;) Seriously, read it (assuming you haven't already).<br /><br />Cinder is the first book in a while, where I actually went back and re-read it -- after just finishing it for the first time. It is that good. Marissa Meyer kept readers engaged with her insane writing abilities, promising plot, and steady pace. The characters were diverse and I enjoyed \\"meeting\\" them; especially Iko. She may have been programmed, but her personality was fun. Cinder is a great female lead. It's amazing how throughout this read, with exception from her loose foot and the constant mention that she is an Android, I would have never thought she was one. She has so much on her plate, and she is only sixteen-year-old. Another important character you should know about is Queen Levana; she was merely introduced here as the evil queen, but I am certain her role will do large damage in book two.<br /><br />Ah, the ending! Immediately, after the last page, I knew I had to add Scarlet to my shopping cart. Marissa Meyer knows what she did; many of us have fallen for her tactic; she left the ending open to interpretation and imagination -- to what could have happened in the second installment. What will happen with Cinder's relationship with the Prince? What choices will she make? It gets readers hyped and then immediately they'll demand the next book in their hands. Not only that, but it develops a new lush plot, that no doubt will be epic, in Scarlet.<br /><br />I am pretty sure many readers may have gotten their hands on Cinder by now. I always take the longest to read all the \\"most-raved-about\\" books. But this one deserves all the love. Recommend to those whom are constiplating on whether or not to get it.never thought she was one. She has so much on her plate, and she is only sixteen-year-old.

0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner kept my teenage son riveted and excited about reading over the summer. He actually raced me to be done and would talk to me about what was happening. The last few chapters held him captive and he couldn't put it down. We will be starting The Scorch Trials soon and can't wait to see what happens next. We loved it.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Alright so to start this isn't some flimsy piece of steel. This piece is as thick if not thicker than my katana. The reason for the one star missing is that its a little tricky to get to razor sharp. However it can be done and even if you can't get it there it's still completely functional. For this price this knife is competing with absolutely nothing and it's absolutely phenomenal. I would compare this to the kabar Becker bk9 which overall is a better knife but for the price and the features? This is a knife worth at least 60 or 70 if not more. I don't go out to the bush without it either in my pack or strapped to my side. Which brings me to my next point. The sheath. Kydex insert and ballistic nylon outside. Absolutely great. With extra holes for extra rigging capabilities it's a great deal. The belt loop is actually good too. With a Velcro wrap around loop you don't even need to take your belt off to strap it on with the same security and most fixed loop sheaths. Worth every penny just for the sheath
B009G275TC|5.0|The XX created another classic.  I thought the smooth sound of the first album was a one off masterpiece but The XX delivered a second masterpiece.  While almost ever song is amazing, Swept Away takes it to the next level with beats that show they could easily put together a unique dance album.  One of the best bands to come along in ages!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's Uno.  Fun to play for anyone who likes the game, but not really anything special added to it.  It's nice that you don't have to know the people you're playing with.
B00ANMA9L0|5.0|Every song on the album is a classic but the highlights for me are:  Firth Of Fifth, More Fool Me, The Cinema Show and Aisle Of Plenty.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|well executed game!  beautiful graphics on every stage with lots of adventuring to be done,  game had a few bugs but overall its a good game.
B008XZKSKG|5.0|While many people, including myself, love the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, I think this is a collection of their strongest work.  Phil Collins' voice developed over the course of these albums, hitting its prime on Duke.  There are a number of songs that normally do not get any recognition but are classics.  This collection is my favorite out of the three box sets.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the game. Its so much more than a hidden objects game. It is interactive and alot of fun
B008BQL77K|5.0|Seriously love everything about this show. The snappy dialog, the New Yorkiness, the character development - not everyone that is good is good and not everyone that is bad is bad. Except for Hardeman. I seriously want to punch Hardeman in the neck. Full disclosure: My man crush on Harvey is approaching Mark Wahlberg territory. And Mike, well in the words of Kramer, \\"he is the straw that mixes the drink\\". Also, if you are a guy that likes movie quotes, this is your show. In a perfect world SUITS will run for as long as Law & Order, although they'll probably run out of movies to quote.....AS IF!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love that there is something new or rearranged everytime! It keeps the mind at attention & always thinking, Creative
B009NQZVKG|4.0|As usual, there are several subplots going on at the same time.  This requires the reader to pay close attention.  There may be some problems with transit times and several coincidences, but good anyway.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was really disturbing. The writing was completely engrossing, but there wasn't one character whom I liked. I don't completely buy the ending, but everything is so upside down in this story that that was the least of my concerns with it. It is definitely a unique take on marriage.
159315724X|5.0|This guy gives so many good tips and solutions to things I thought I was the only one that struggled with.  I really appreciate his humility.
0307463745|5.0|37 signals is probably the best unheard of company in the business and their approach to software and web-ware and how humans ( real ones ) work  is simply light years ahead of anything on the market. If you are in teh technolgy market gop real ALL the 37 signals books.
B00A757EFW|2.0|On the Kindle Fire the controls are a bit troublesome. Would not recommend it. How many words does this thing want me to write?
B000JMKO0A|2.0|This novel starts out with a hooker of an opening paragraph and declines from there.  It was given to me as a \\"life-changing read\\" but I could hardly wait for it to be over.  Terrible writing, by the way.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Was awesome did everything I wanted plus more is really cool uploading and downloading specific thing or a bunch and does it super quick
0143121421|5.0|I've read a number of Le Carr&eacute;'s books and enjoyed most of them. However only with this reissue did I consider reading this, his first book. Upon consideration, It is superior to all his later work. Every word is well chosen, every sentence well phrased, and the pacing of revelations is perfect. Even at the end, when the reader has probably figured out the final twist a moment before Alex Leamas, the main character, the book remains almost impossible to put down. Some of Le Carr&eacute;'s later books suffer from an over-abundance of action relative to character development or setting or theme. [[ASIN:014311977X Smiley's People]], for example. Others l found leaned too far the other direction ([[ASIN:0143119745 The Little Drummer Girl]]). Some of his recent books also suffer from a lazy anti-Americanism. But The Spy Who Came in From The Cold is perfect.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute;'s most celebrated character, George Smiley, appears in this book as a minor character, as do Peter Guillam and \\"Control\\". It feels totally natural that these characters, relatively senior in the service, would loom large in the life of Alec Leamas, but that when their own stories get told in [[ASIN:014312093X Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]], nobody thinks of him. Leamas's fate, as he himself understands, is only to serve as a minor cog in the great machinery of espionage.
B00AW57L96|5.0|One of those books you keep reading until 3am so you can find out what happens. Well-written characters, and gripping storyline. My favourite book of the year so far.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I just love this book and the entire series, it kept my interest from start to finish. Such a great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game love it play it almost always what would you shop try out now it's amazing awesome just you start and you feel it mandatory to play everyday
B00C061I1M|5.0|There was a time when plenty of country singers had twangy nasal voices, but those voices limited their appeal. It didn't stop Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and others having plenty of success, and it didn't appear to be stopping Dolly Parton, but she worked hard to change her voice as anybody who has listened to her music from different periods of her career would have noticed. So we come to Valerie June, who doesn't quite sound like any of her predecessors, although I detect echoes of Iris DeMent and Kitty Wells here and there.<br /><br />Valerie wrote or co-wrote all but one of the songs, which also appears to be original. On two tracks (Shotgun, Twisted and twined) she sings and plays guitar without any other musicians. A third track (Trials, troubles, tribulations) finds Valerie just singing to a musician playing guitar and providing male backing vocals.<br /><br />Elsewhere, more instruments are used but not many on any given track. There is a trumpet player on the opening track (Workin' woman blues). Valerie plays ukulele while singing on two other tracks (On my way, Somebody to love).<br /><br />This is a great album if you like country music sung by a woman with a twangy nasal voice. It won't be to everybody's liking, but it is to mine.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I am a HUGE Dwayne Johnson/The Rock fan and thus is the ONLY reason I ordered this movie... I got SO MUCH MORE than I expected...<br /><br />The plot was awesome, the villains were new and refreshing and the action TOP NOTCH... Truly a great movie and I will be watching again.
B00AMYX60U|5.0|The track listing only shows 12 tracks, but another song (Take me away) is appended to the end of the last track after a very long pause. Among those 13 songs, all but one are originals. The cover is of The power of love - not the oft-covered song originally co-written and a European hit for Jennifer Rush, but the Frankie Goes To Hollywood song. I like both (and a few other completely different songs titled The power of love) but I don't recall hearing another cover of the FGTH song before, so I'm glad that Gabrielle recorded it.<br /><br />The track Please don't say you love me (featured in the compilation Young folks) attracted me to Gabrielle's music, so I was pleased to find that it is typical of the album. All the original songs are about relationships, mostly but not all sad. However, there are no extremes of emotions here, so nobody should feel depressed after listening to the album.<br /><br />This is a high quality album from which it is hard to pick favourites. The two songs I was already familiar with before buying the CD are brilliant but do not stand out, which is a compliment to the rest of the album.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Just finished watching this and I can say unequivocally the I am relieved I don't live in those times....ummm yah it sucked to be anyone but the king.<br /><br />The series is done well the characters are consistent, there are some super steamy scenes throughout, and the action and gore are suitably enthralling. All in all I enjoyed watching it and shed a tear or two at the series finale. I don't know if I would watch it again maybe in a few years.<br /><br />The negative side is some of the storylines were dragged out way to long. I found myself yelling at the screen &#34;just kill her already....geez&#34; and some of the acting was cheesy especially towards the end. There were several plot points and characters that were never elaborated on or explained and that was somewhat frustrating characters would just appear and disappear from one season to the next and/or their motivation for their actions was very vague. It's history so I can't really blame the creators for revisiting themes but it got a little tired....I mean ya think the wives would learn to keep theirs mouths and thighs shut, especially the later ones, they have no excuse.<br /><br />Anyway I felt it was worth the money and I liked having the whole series in one case ready to watch. I haven't watched the bonus DVD yet but that's next. Enjoy!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I found this album filed, as I expected, in the mainstream pop/rock section of the local record store, but I think it really belongs in contemporary folk. Of course, marketing departments (whether within record labels or retail outlets) have their own reasons for classifying music, usually money, but misleading customers is never a good idea. I like folk music anyway, my tastes being somewhat eclectic, so I am very happy with this album. I figured that this might be a folk album anyway based on the cover, showing an Arizona landscape. I'd been meaning to buy some of her music since hearing her as a guest on [[ASIN:B000JJ3R7U Moving Out To The Country (Jools Holland and guests)]], and she easily lived up to expectations.<br /><br />KT not only sings but was involved in almost every aspect of the creative process, writing most of the songs, co-writing the others, playing various types of guitars and pianos, co-producing the album and even being art director.<br /><br />The first single, Feel it all, is presented in two versions, the main (but not only) difference being the addition of an electric guitar on the band jam version. Electric guitars feature on several tracks, but not the basic version of Feel it all. There is the occasional pedal steel, but you'll have to listen closely to hear it.<br /><br />This is an excellent comtemporary folk album that I hope KT and her fans are proud of.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie isn't super deep.  But it is a relatively clean, fun action-adventure.<br /><br />John Malkovich is hilarious in parts and Bruce Willis plays his normal role.<br /><br />Sprinkle a little Morgan Freeman on top and you have a tasty, entertaining Saturday night.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|While I always like this genre of movie is probably part of the reason I gave it 4 stars. I was dancing between 3 & 4 stars, but decided I liked it enough to give it 4.  I thought it had a cool story line, and the story is what kept me watching, and it was very entertaining.  The acting of the main characters well Meh for me I thought the characters were just never IN character, completely, but all in all it was enjoyable for me, it is something to watch not terrible not great....Good!
B001O1O71C|5.0|I enjoyed this book, even though the content was sad. I used it to supplement my History lesson on the Holocaust. The students liked the book as well.
8866134627|4.0|Working as an administrative coordinator, I'm using this notebook to take notes during the numerous meetings I have each week.  For the most part, I like the design structure.  Six lines at the top followed by two columns (a small column on the left and a larger one on the right, 1:5 approximate ratio) with twenty-four lines.  I use the top section for the meeting title and/or brief summary.  Small column for action items and larger column for notes.  There is also a blank section to enter the date at the top right of each page, which is very handy.  Pages are also numbered, which could prove useful if I need to reference a specific meeting in the future.  Size is great; not too big where it is cumbersome and not to small where I can't fit what I need to right.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see is an additional page strictly for notes.  Especially at long meetings, I need more room to make notes and the only way I can do that is go to a &#34;fresh page&#34; which has all three sections mentioned above.  Overall, very good and I would recommend.
B005HSL626|3.0|My grandkids enjoyed playning this when they were visiting.  Myself, can't say I have played it.  Maybe in the near future I'll give it a try.
159463176X|3.0|Having read and seen kite runner also read a thousand splendid suns, this book was equally good but not as emotional gripping as the previous two. Was still enjoyable for summer reading while travelling. Makes you want to visit Kabul of old before the wars.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This was something my grandson wanted to try when visiting.  Have to say he thought it was ok, that's all.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It's great set! I definitely recommend it! it has all the tos movies, and a must have for fans! Especially TOS fans
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This was somehow accidently bought.  My granddaughter liked it but I had it removed since I did not plan on playing it.
B009O5CLZY|1.0|My kids told me how much fun this game is, so I decided to be \\"fun mom\\" and buy it for them.  I saw the tons of good reviews without reading the bad ones.  BIG MISTAKE.  It doesn't work at all. Very disappointed!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this series and couldn't wait for it to go onto the prime category. A must see, but you should see it beginning at season one. Looking forward to the new shows in January.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Awesome concept - plan on taking the time to watch it more than once - easier to get it all the 2nd or 3rd time.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Great show, good price, all this discs worked.  I have no complaints, it arrived quickly and was wrapped well.  Watch it!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I've yet to here a bad song in the last four albums and Golden continues that streak, another solid CD
B003NS2T9G|3.0|It seemed to go okay.  The story arc needed some more help though.  It was told decently but something wasn't resonating very much as I watched the first episode.  I think they needed a plot first and then introduced the characters and the settings.  Seemed to be a little bit more reversed than it should have been?
B001FD5KJM|4.0|This was a good action packed movie but like many others I think this will be the end of Iron man.  They reached the edge of reality and kicked in the afterburners and just kept on going into cartoonville.  I watched it all but then again just cause my dog eats crap doesnt meen he likes it.
B0036MDNN0|4.0|The detail of this dinosaur was very good. The only mild disappointment was that it was a bit small. My grandson still enjoyed it, but he was not as impressed with it as his larger dinosaurs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game you search and find hidden objects to crack the lock and progress through the puzzle just another great thing from amazon and prime for kindle fire what a great value for your money
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|As someone with a design background, who loves graphic novels and video games it's virtually impossible for me not to see some value in this film. For me this is a gadget lover's movie; in this case the bubble ship. Never mind the story-line, it is paper thin. This movie is like one of those automobile ads where the vehicle for sale is shown in a variety of settings to show off its capabilities. After watching this film I wanted a bubble ship!!!<br /><br />I'd like my ship to come with the cool sky-house, female not included. If possible, sky-house should have a real color pallet- all white is too bland and passé. My craft should have the motorcycle pull-out bay option, and if possible throw in a killer sound system. No bobble-head figure desired. Not to mention throw in the get me out of earth's orbit and into space package; ya know- for weekend get-away to Mars.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This is a nice movie it is PG and does not have any bad language I would recomend it for a nice movie nite with the family
B0034DGP6S|3.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it as I was about to embark on marriage myself. More factual than a story. Sometimes a bit boring but you could skim past those bits. Very true to life.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This is one of the apps my wife choose to put on her amazon Kindle HD through Prime what a find
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I really like this case.  Not only does it help recharge my headset, it is in a nice sturdy case so I can just throw it into my work bag and not have to worry about damaging the earpiece.  I'm not a heavy user but do use it often and I'd say I probably only need to recharge the case once a month or so.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|My Wife loves to read I got my wife a Kindle Fire HD for her BirthDay I thought I would get to use it too she loves books and If I want to try it I will have to get one of my own
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is probably my favorite app that Amazon offers... if u like magic u will love this game. I do wish the encounters didn't play the same cards every time but it makes having a strategy a lot easier...
B009XWD02G|5.0|This is a good tool if you like to listen to music then this is for you it works flawlessly and that is what you need
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like hidden object adventure games this is a hell of a game  I like that tee graphics and color n the fact that you have to find clues n do certain things to find other things it's an awesome game
B0063M22QO|5.0|if you like puzzle games this is a good one you match like objects and eliminate pairs to clear the board its a lot of fun
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I love this movie it was great. The acting was spectacular Jamie Foxx was great and Leonardo Di Caprio was very charming. Samuel L was hilarious.  The entire cast was great and the storyline was fabulous.  Definitely one for the movie collection.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie it is a rare thing to find a good family movie these days
B00B04KVMC|3.0|Content is great!<br /><br />Sound is a big let down. :(<br /><br />Its why I give it a 3 star<br /><br />The Album sound quality isnt terrible but could have been so much better!<br /><br />I own several SC vinyl recordings and they all sound way way better than this one.  I had high hopes...  I knew going in that the CD and Mp3 quality suffered from the loudness vs clarity but hoped it had overcame in the vinyl version.<br /><br />For a comparison I played Damn the Torpedo's (picked up when I purchased SC) right after this one, both on vinyl, then Rumors (also on vinyl).  You can hear the difference!<br /><br />Same issue with Crooked Vultures, another Grohl,  maybe there is a pattern here?
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Susan Boyle's story; I watch/ listen to her singing I Dreamed a Dream night after night.  I enjoyed her book; she tells her story honestly and frankly, and makes one appreciate her all the more.  Read it!
B000002MUN|5.0|Great TP Album.<br /><br />Worth buying if you do not own.<br /><br />I had the digital version but wanted a better quality recording, vinyl was out due to price so I picked of the CD.
B0001907DA|5.0|police academy need i say more :) these cops r funny and full of entertainment this is a great movie with decent action i highly recommend seeing it
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is the second time I have downloaded this game and it upgrade and erase all progress I don't recommend this download.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|scary movie and funny movie in this comedy spoof of several other movies i highly recommend seeing it if you want to laugh at how silly other movies can be seen
034580709X|4.0|Totally Improbable, But Fun<br />Would any real-life detective set up his girl friend, a lovely, vulnerable, young woman, as bait to catch a sociopathic killer?  Would any detective proceed with this scheme knowing his fellow policemen have failed in similar scenarios?  Jo Nesbo creates some rather implausible situations in his Harry Hole series of novels, yet I love reading them.  I overlook the quirky plots because I like the detectives in Scandinavian crime novels.  So, if you liked Lizbeth Salander and Mikael Blomquist or Kurt Wallander, you will enjoy Harry Hole. Most of the novels in this genre use the same formula. The detective is a knight errant who perserves against evil in order to save women and/or children. These knights, however, are not without their blemishes and back stories. In the novel, The Bat, Harry goes after a rapist murderer who has moved from place to place in Australia. Like the partners Mikael Bloomquist and Lisbeth Salander, Harry teams up with an Aborigine detective and finds the villain right under his nose.  Harry is interesting because of his self-destructive tendencies (alcoholism), his defiance of authority, and his perseverance (to the point of endangering his own life). We root for Harry because he is a good person, hard-driving, and a romantic.  He is not perfect but he is real.  I love it when he uses duct tape to bind up his wounds in two of the Nesbo novels and I loved his going through customs in Australia in this novel and being stopped because he had misplaced his visa.  He always is having women problems but that is because he is obsessed with finding criminals and can't attend to their needs.  In this book and in others, we go deeply into the psyche of the killers.  Harry thinks, \\"The human soul is a deep, dark forest and all decisions are made alone....\\"  You will enjoy the mystery in this novel, but you will also enjoy Harry's missteps as he brilliantly solves the crime in an Australian society fraught with racism, prostitution, corruption, and addiction.stitution, corruption, and addiction.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|such a funny movie great for any true America who loves its country and wants to laugh at the bad guys i highly recommend seeing this movie
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fully developed and realistic characters, great historical detail, has it all - drama, comedy, sex, history, may just replace Pillars of the Earth as my favorite book.  Can't wait for the third book.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|as always chevy chase is being funny for Christmas in this movie just like he was in the Vegas vacation and others
B00CO5AQ12|3.0|Looks like awesome fun, the youtube video [...] shows its behavior nicely.    I'm ordering 2 kilos... just as soon as they let me know what the other 2% is. Plenty of things are \\"safe\\" that absorb into human skin through contact. The 2% is touted as \\"non-toxic polymer\\". Are we talking about a phthalate or phthalate analog here?    Besides that the durability of the product is in question until I know what the binder is. Will it degrade or sweat out in heat? How about cold mornings? Will oil from hands change the behavior of the product over time? What if it gets wet?    So it looks like great stuff, just give us an updated ingredients list please!
B00821OX98|4.0|Lead played by the guy from the Librarian movies.  A serious role and he plays it well.  Worth the watching.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Jimmy Walker goes to Spain to try to sort his life out, but instead takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of drugs, alcohol and breaking the law.  This story is dark and sexy, with some twists in the plot that'll keep you guessing.<br /><br />I recommend it to people who like darker stories.
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|The Martian Chronicles was the model for Star Trek and other favorite fantasies about space travel. Ray Bradbury's stories and novels inspired me to write a biography about him: Ray Bradbury: A Teller of Tales.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|It doesn't get Eddie Vedder than this!!!  His voice was perfect for the material.  Hard to pick a favorite, but &#34;Society&#34; is excellent.
1451695195|4.0|This book is presented by an individual who would not be easily convinced. I would not be either, but every argument and description I read had a ring of truth to it. I found it very interesting and comforting.
B002QCD2QO|1.0|Silly, overacted, boring, and slightly scary. I cannot figure out why it is on the BAFTA top 100 British movies of the 20th century. A waste of time.
0762449314|5.0|got this for my son's 11th birthday.  he's a new doctor who fan and looooooves the daleks.  perfect  little collectible
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was OK, but I found it disappointing based on the hype surrounding the book and upcoming movie.  I am a huge fan of Issac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and was hoping it would be similar - it was not.  I would say it is a unique storyline concept with unforeseen blot twists. I'm just not motivated to continue reading the other two books in the trilogy.<br />If, however, you are a speed reader and really like Scfi, buy it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy doing these jigsaw puzzles.  I really like the option of having rotated pieces when the puzzle gets too boring and being able to add more puzzles too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its great for people of all ages!<br />Its like subway surfers but has a story,  along with different power ups and obstacles.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|If you are not into rock music from 70s on, or into  recording studios...the film will bore you. If you are.... it is fantastic. I liked it an recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was not always an easy book to read as it forces you to realize how difficult life can be but especially for teenagers and their parents facing their mortality - much too young.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved watching this movie. I didn't go into it with any kind of idea of the story or expectations. And I was surprised to be so bowled over. The casting is perfect for such rich characters. This is a movie which deals with mental illness, without making those suffering the oft-portrayed, Hollywood version of &#34;crazy.&#34; It was funny, brave and unabashedly poignant.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Classic.  I have seen the old Dracular movie<br />several times.Have never seen modern version.Somehow I think the classic book must be the best version.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|If you were a fan of the original &#34;A-Team&#34; television series, you might be surprised to find yourself enjoying this pretty ridiculous romp. Its got action, humor a decent plot and enough ties to the original A-Team to make this flick just downright fun.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Good storyline<br />Not over the top<br />I am not a great Tom Cruise fan but he is good in this on and the supporting cast are excellent.<br />Well worth watching.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I watched this film when it first hit the theaters years ago and I just rewatched it again.<br /><br />Still great.  Love the characters and the acting is second to none.<br /><br />The \\"gangster trio\\" rocks!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nice solid read. Was referred to this from friends and one of my sisters, but it was kind of slow and not captivating like other books that I just couldn't put down.  This was too easy to put down and do something else.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the best show anyone can watch. not only is it Hilarious but you actually learn stuff!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great interactive game for all ages. My daughter and I love spending time together taking care of beauty. Now she wants a real horse. I'm glad we live in the city. Lol
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Luv the game but how do u update it on a kindle? Can some one please  help me thru this process? Thanksc
1416550550|4.0|If I had not already read another book by Morton I would have given this five stars.  However, great plot, kept my attention, and I didn't want to put down the book once I was half way through it.  Recommend.  Easy read.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It worked really well until I updated it. Now when I try to open it, it tells me a new update is available. So I went to the Appstore and it just has me open it again. And it still doesn't work. Now I can't play anymore
0345525558|5.0|Seems to be the accurate word to describe it.  Different story line, and I really enjoyed it.  Easy read, and I highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game kids love it.....(shh so do I)! They play on their tablets, my phone, and on the laptops. Comes in handy when they're on roundtrips! THANKS
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. We dont have kids yet and I would say the end could be a little scary for some younger kids, but over all it was a fun movie.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game says to go to app store to update. It won't update. Had nothing but problems ever since I downloaded this game. It's looking like it's going in the trash unless this problem is fixed asap!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This was just horrible movie. I couldn't even get through 30 mins. Everyone was so mean to each other and they lied a lot. I feel bad if that is real life for anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I reviewed other apps and found this to better then any others I have tried. This easier to use with the larger print.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game. Its addictive! I describe it to people as Sudoku with pictures. But I think it can be easier because if you make a mistake you can usually correct it without having to erase everything you have done. I love this game.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|its so fun because you can have free play and missions keep making them and you should make a gangster new york
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games could be violent at times, but it kept me interested. It was brilliantly written and kept me wanting more! The ending kept you wondering what happens next. During the actual Hunger Games, you will feel that same feeling Katniss does, Suzanne Collins did an excellent job with that. If you see the movie before you read the book, please understand that the book is so much better than the movie. The movie makes the Hunger Games seem darker and a lot more violent and morbid than it really is. The book will give you an entirely different perspective. I loved it.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|When I first used this it seemed great.  I used the video cam once & now it does not work.  The camera is ok, but I can use the camera that came with kindle for better pics.  The other reviews echo my experience…will remember for future reference.
0142421715|3.0|This was definitely not as good as the original. I still loved Crossed, but I was disappointed. Towards the end it got better, but the first half was quite dry. I wish it had been more interesting during those dry parts, but Crossed still turned out okay. It is about Ky and Cassia finding each other, staying safe, and all the trouble they go through trying to do those things. I hope you enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a far better escape game than 100 . The only problem I see is the lack of levels.Hopefully they will come up with more. Love the game!!!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Great series! I loved the dramatization of one royalties most infamous characters. I only wished they would've continued on with Henry's children's reigns.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a great sandbox game for all ages.  Simple to get started but also challenging for the strategic player.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|A great way to end a bad day ... grab a beer, some cold pizza, and leave your brain on the coffee table ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great idea but I still don't know to use the wepons in the game but that's just me very cool #help me if you can
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a fast and addicting read.  It triggers so many emotions from the reader and leaves you with an odd sense of being okay.  Highly recommend this.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Movie was given to a member of the orchestra for her library. Have not viewed the movie yet, but plan to.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I am so pleased to get this on my IPad. This is more or less the Bible commentary that I long needed to have on IPad.<br />Every book in the Bible has a different group of scholars who worked on it to write its commentary which obviously enriched the whole work of the Bible study.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|more drama content and fewer sexual scenes would've made the story more interesting; the repeated sexual scenes were simply unnecessary.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Story was very powerful. Music and performance was amazing .Having seen Hugh Jackman on An interview show talking about the Movie,  I knew That the vocals were not lip synced but performed as acting. That made the performances even more exciting.
B002UD56I6|5.0|His last recorded rehearsals...what more can you say. Priceless.<br />Know he's constantly embroiled in controversy but he's a brilliant artist. Every time I watch this, I walk away thinking how truly sad an ending for such a huge talent.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I have used a Foxit PDF Reader on my PC's for quite a while. I was told it is less vulnerable to hackers. I like it a lot so I decided to try it on my Kindle Fire HD. Works really well. I like it better than the other reader that seems to come installed on most computers.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I LOVE IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO DRESS HER UP<br />I LOVE IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE A HAIR STYLE
B003RNZDKY|4.0|this is real hip hop and i can appreciate that.  i like this album a lot.  there are really thought-provoking tracks on here.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Dragged a bit in the middle, but I couldn't stop reading it. It may be better than \\"The Dragon Tattoo\\", or at least as good. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book. I have the utmost respect for Lisbeth Salander.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|80s references and video games. Completely awesome book! I would recommend this to any of my geek friends, and in fact plan to spend the next few minutes singing its praises to them.
B00A285OOW|1.0|Repetitive dialog throughout the whole story. Like playing the same record over and over. No ending and we all know there was one.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|If you like mahjong and free apps you'll love this. The advertisements are kind of annoying though. But you get what you pay for, or don't in this case.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have really enjoyed each season of Downton Abbey! This one is no exception! Grateful that Amazon has these free of charge with Amazon Prime account.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Too many movies have no plot, no &#34;moral of the story&#34;, nothing to make it memorable.  Captain America breaks out of that mold.  At a time in our history when so many are struggling with lack of jobs, lack of morality, lack of pride in anything...this movie reminds you how awesome people can be and what it means to love your country!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome game haven't played in a while but I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone anytime
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I've been playing for a while now and today I got a message that there is an update in the app store...there is not. And I can't get the window to close within the game that<br /> tells me to update.  I would keep playing if I could, but can't.  Please fix this bug!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Once again, a great story from Patrick Rothfuss. However, while much is told, even more is only hinted. I hope we won't have to wait another three years for the book that ties everything together. This is a good middle book of a trilogy, but like most middle books it leaves the reader hanging, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Love this show. I used to watch it all the time when it was on tv. I would recommend it to anybody that loves to watch MacGyver get out of trouble
B009RX85N0|4.0|Season Two of Once Upon a Time had many good developments.  In season two, we got to see the wonderful Red/Ruby and Belle upgraded to series regulars. We got a intriguing new character with depth in Michael Raymond James' Neal Cassidy and Barbara Hershey is fantastic as villain Cora. We also get to see the coming together of the Charming family which is the heart of the show.  Some let downs in season two is too much time and sympathy for the villains at the expense of the good guys.  Too little of Ruby and Belle when they were made regulars and some loose storylines, such as August's and hype over Hook as a kickbutt villain when he is reduced to cheesy pick up lines and Coyote chasing the road runner storyline.<br /><br />The DVD itself. The good to me were the features of \\"Good Morning Storybrooke\\" and \\"Bloopers\\". I enjoyed those most of all. The DVD cover and disc were somewhat of a letdown. They did not feature Red and Belle who were regulars and the cover was nothing new or special.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is really good so go kill your<br />self if u don't like it it so funny and fun !
B0058VW36U|3.0|it will go free sooner or later but honest it should be free not paid for...  I love the game though... I could play all day....
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|it was really exciting.I was trying to correlate the hero with the experience of myself.The real pain never goes away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awsome book I liked the pig with the Apple part funny rebellious and cool I saw the movie witch made me want to read the book
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|please fix the upload keeps me going in circles saying it has a upload but there's nothing there I do not want 2 start over but liked playing this game please fix the glitches so we can move on
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Many years ago, I turned away from my liberal ideology by 180 degrees. Having learned of the social and economic failures of the Russian and Chinese socialist regimes, I started digging up critiques of socialism and social democracy that later I discovered were offspring of Adam Smith and the early classical liberals. After 50 years of blindly accepting that the only way humankind progressed was through the big lever policies of centrally planned governments, I found evidence that the market system which underpins the capitalist environment was the real engine of prosperity that drove upward mobility providing needed and wanted goods and services to billions of people willing to participate in its intertwining processes. For people looking for support of this view to carry them forward into the next century, Ridley's Rational Optimist provides a solid presentation of theory and fact. He has written a book that spans the trade routes and traders of millenia ago and tied them into the exchange of ideas and information which electronically courses through our daily lives and demontrates how each in similar ways catapults humankind to a new level. Doomsayers will probably downplay all of Ridley's analyses, but if you want an antidote to all the popular deniers of human capacity to generate self actualization, then get this book, read it and keep it close.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Overall a great app for a tablet.  Works well on kindle fire.<br />Please add the following to this truly spectacular app.<br />Future feature recommendations:<br />Better deck customization<br />Player vs player over the internet<br />Tournament mode<br />Allow players to create campaigns
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I found to much detail at times and repeating to much of the same details over again. Will try his stories again to see if he picks up the pace.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Watched Dr Who years ago and love the restart. Better effects, but the same awesome quirkiness and character and stories that keep me hooked.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Once you understand what is needed it is really fun, and it keeps your interest. Would recommend this to everyone.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|This movie is so relaxing and sweet and yet, so powerful in the concept it conveys to remedy the political turmoils of  today's world affairs!!
B006WPWH4E|5.0|I like this game, it really is easy to play, it keeps my interest. I would recommend this to everyone, and I like how it would work for anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I would get this game if I were bored anywhere and I play this game every single day it's fun .
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Not the worst or best movie ever but I quite enjoyed watching it with my family on a quiet evening.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this so I could workout at home and not have to join a gym. It certainly kicked my butt. I didn't end up using it for 30 days consistently, so I didn't see real results. That was several years ago, though. I am now more into working out, and I think this would be helpful to use now if I tried it again!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a very entertaining book series and I highly recommend it.  I continue to find it a captivating series.  I liked the second book a lot, probably more than the first.  So far, out of the three I have read, I'd say book three is my favorite, but they are all really very good.  You'll reach the end of book two and immediately need to order book three.  You might as well order all four at once!
0802473156|5.0|I personally have not read this myself; I bought this as a gift. I have heard from several people though that this book is really good, informative and interesting, for both sexes!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! Comedy adventure suspense and more. One of those movies you watch over and over and don't mind.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Makes you want to get out of your seat and dance, even if you are not a very good dancer!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have to say that at first I was just curious about the show. I watch the pilot and I was hooked. I cant stop watching looking forward to the third and future seasons. the show has great cast and good story telling. I highly recommend this show.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|I loved this movie! It was very raunchy and explicit. I was laughing every couple of minutes at something. Mark Wahlberg did an outstanding job in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone 18+.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|This movie had lots of twist and turns.  It left with a very good ending towards a sequel.  The 3D was very good.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|OMG.. that was the sickest part for me.  Lots of gore, better visual effects than the original (no surprise) but ending was a little... off the storyline.  I won't ruin it for anyone.  It's a definite SEE though.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was.  It keep me very entertained.  The 3D was great.
B008602KQI|3.0|An interesting story about young people chosen to fight to live or die in an unrealistic game of survival. Totally unrealistic story line.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This a pretty good prequel. They' made it fit together pretty good with original. Flying monkeys we're meaner looking.  Would have rather seen some closer to original.
B003RV43X4|4.0|This was a good movie.  I liked the story and it had great graphics.  It was lacking in the action and fighting area, definitely would have liked to see more fighting!  But other than that great movie!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Played for one day and really liked it. Later that same day I tried to play before bed when the game tells me I have a update, go to apps store. I've tried everything and I still can't play the game. Please fix the game!!!
B009VMN3RA|5.0|As a former personal trainer to what could be known as the Beverly Hills-Bel Air crowd, circa mid-to-late 1980's, I can testify without having met Sachi Parker that her heartbreaking and soul-baring memoir is quite likely close to, if not fully, 100% true. I honestly don't think Ms. Parker made up any of this, even the really out in left field (or out on a limb) crazy stuff. The L.A. film community is legion when it comes to occasions of really deplorable, egomaniacal bad behavior, especially towards us service industry drones, and alas, sometimes to their kids as well. There's a lot of megalomania up in those hills. I do know whereof I speak.<br /><br />One of my 4-days a week clients, a very big name multi-hyphenate in the film community with a well equipped home gym (screenwriter/producer/director--let's call him Mr. A), worked with Ms. MacLaine in a number of modalities for a couple of years, often intimately (on a strictly platonic basis). Like most of my clients, Mr. A would share things with me during our training sessions in confidence, knowing that I was a trusted confidante, and I wouldn't go around spilling his \\"insider stuff\\" about the Hollywood A-list crowd he often ran around with; I never have, Mr. A's trust in me is well founded.<br /><br />What I am willing to say is that there were multiple episodes of considerably less-than-fun, \\"I'm a HUGE STAR\\" encounters Mr. A had with Ms. MacLaine (some of which are on the same mind-blowing, you-have-to-be kidding-me levels as those found in Ms. P's sad book) which make all of Sachi Parker's allegations ring absolutely, dead-on true for me. If I went into detail, it would serve no purpose other than to pile on more ugliness onto what is undoubtedly a lifetime of these unfortunate behavior patterns. Those who have posted comments here maligning Sachi for her supposedly made-up \\"Shirley Dearest\\" tell-all are sorely mistaken, in my view; this book could have been aptly titled The Sad Truth.<br /><br />It's genuinely a tragedy beyond words that a woman who has traipsed around the globe, (sometimes with Mr. A), relentlessly searching for the golden nuggets of life's great mysteries, and shared with her readers her many pearls of metaphysical wisdom in her books, has completely and totally failed to apply many of those very mystical insights to her own life, and to her own child. Ms. MacLaine has completely missed the boat when it comes to one simple fact in life: Giving Feels Good. That she might actually leave this earth without having lovingly shared of herself--to say nothing of even a semblance of financial kindness--with her own flesh and blood, makes me wonder what really goes on in that head of hers. Perhaps a few more acupuncture-triggered past life regression sessions would help her zero in on why she chose to be so cruel and cold to her own daughter this time around.<br /><br />As for shipping off your 2 year old child to a foreign country in another hemisphere with only flight attendants as her guardians during this multi-day voyage, well... doesn't that really pretty much say it all?<br /><br />My heart goes out to you, Sachi Parker. I believe your words. That you've taken all these years of psychological abuse from both of your parents and are still managing a normal life with your own family is a testimonial to your inner mettle and strength of spirit. I salute you for your courage in sharing your story, and wish you only the best. Having come from a similarly screwed up family unit (just on a different scale), since you may never hear \\"I'm sorry I hurt you\\", know that I know where you're coming from--from one reasonably well reassembled damaged kid to another. Soldier on.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This story was interesting and a seemed like a genuine look at the sometimes banal, sometimes emotionally charged process of learning about yourself.  The story winded a bit at times, which did not bother me because I was so interested in finding out what happened to the author. I don't think you get the sense that the trek itself permanently removed any &#34;demons&#34; (for lack of a better word) from her life but apparently it at least contributed.  Either way, what she's done in her life is impressive and this book allows her and us to appreciate it.  (I read this entire book with my healthy, pain-free feet propped up and I'd regularly peer at them gratefully!)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this book quite beautiful. I loved the the feeling between Hazel and Gus. I have to say it really touched my heart without destroying it.
B00B769XB8|4.0|I ordered this movie only because my dear friend expressed an interest in it. Finally, we watched it and I actually enjoyed it. There's a lot of action, drama, and a bit of humor.
0385491026|5.0|I'd heard about Atwood, as a fine writer, and decided to read something by her a few months ago. Read quite a few reviews of her different books, and found it hard to decide which to read. For some reason, even the very positive reviews didn't make me want to read her books. The first two books I read appealed to me. She's a good writer, and she's concerned with essential human questions. But still, I felt I hadn't gotten to know her. This was the third book I read, and I had every reason not to read it. I knew it was about children. And childhood is a difficult subject for me. But the longer I read, the more I appreciated her work. It is difficult too, emotionally. I heard from some friends that it was hard to read. But I didn't find it hard. I consider it a masterpiece. Not that I identified with the heroine. But Atwood portrays the tension of wanting to be accepted and loved even in social circumstances in which you're not comfortable, and the growth of a person (in this case, an artist) in the face of adversity. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy depth in literature, to those who like to think.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It was okay, but didn't hold your interest very much. A lot of cheesy lines and at times looked fake. I wouldn't watch it again.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is a gorgeous way for little girls to practice on all the different beautiful products. My granddaughter designed a princess that she says will look like her when she is all grown up. Pretty dress, hairstyle etc.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I thought this movie would more of a kid's movie, boy was I wrong. Lots of action and kept your attention all the way through. I would watch it again.
B00004BZ16|5.0|This is The Clash.  There is a lot of depth here.  The albums shows all phases of The Clash sound and really flows into what the future will hold for B.A.D. After they dissolved.  It really is a must have for Clash fans.  Brevity is best, listen and experience the detail, lyric, arrangements, attitude, protest, beauty, anger and disgust.  Its all there, and more.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It was an okay movie, but I wouldn't watch it again. Some real boring parts and it was too slow.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I like the series, however there were several places in the third season on disc 3 and 4 that stopped and jumped.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It starts out a bit technical but as you go on you realize to really believe what is going on you need to understand his background. Could not stop reading. Open your mind. If you've ever been by the bedside of a loved one in critical condition or at the end of their life this book is comforting as well intriguing. I wanted more. I spent so much time in the hospital with my mother before she passed and the similarity was amazing. I've never spoke of a lot of the things I've seen because I thought people would think I was crazy. It's a wonderful read. I highly recommend.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is lots of fun! ONLY real downside is that the gold toke s don't regenerate that quick.<br />Other than that it's a great game.
