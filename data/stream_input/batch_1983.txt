B009JBZH54|5.0|It's Christopher Nolan's  Batman. What else needs to be said. Great price for blue-ray editions. Wonderful way to get all 3 movies.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|I went to see the movies in theatres when it first came out and was excitedto purchase it finally on bluray. Item arrived on time and packaged well and i recommend for any fan of Image comics, Spawn and Todd MacFarlane.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose to give it give 5 stars because i just couldn't put it down.when i was reading this book it was like i was in their world, it was all i expected and more. I would definitely recommend this book to readers who really enjoy romance.
B008602KQI|2.0|To me this film was a shameless rip off of Stephen King's The Long Walk which was written decades ago.  I am not a fan of the movie at all.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I feel sad that it ended like that, so quick to sum up peeta and katniss all that build up and then bam! They are  together force  in love with kids I that matter of a couple paragraphs. But great series none the less!!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I grew up watching Disney movies and almost all of them have the mother absent so this was a treat. The mother and daughter are strong, roll models and visually the movie is stunning. The extra footage included in this edition was also enjoyable. Great experience with the delivery in two days, so overall this was a solid five star experience.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I think I have already rated this - but since it was a gift I can't say much about it except it arrived in good condition and the person I gave it to was happy with it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as well written as I've come to expect of Grisham.  The ending was flat and lifeless.  He may be trying to turn out too much.
B009FZFONO|4.0|The video quality was good, purchase was easy and of course my wife and I really like our zombie show.
B0000640VN|5.0|Happen to like this movie very much and replay it every now and then, so glad to possess it for myself.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|This was a one-time watch for me, it is not enjoyable and I could barely make it through to the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful book!! Couldn't put it down!! At the end of every chapter, I wanted to continue to the next one!!
B00005J9PB|1.0|I didn't realize there were foreign versions that are not playable on any of my DVD players.  Learned something new every day.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It was different than the first but it had its own storyline.  I really enjoyed it.  Would recommend it to someone else.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first short story was great on it it own. Really reminded me of some of the great 50s and 60s magazine stories. The transition was a little awkward in the second chapter/book just because I felt the first book/chapter was well self-contained.<br /><br />There were some story holes or issues just from a practical stand point, but nothing that made me stop reading or even loose my ability to suspend reality and enjoy the story. Being in IT for over 16 years, I definitely found that aspect to be amusing and even auspicious at times.<br /><br />Glad I paid for it and read it off a some long forgotten recommendation when I added it to my wish list.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a showcase for Christina Aquilera and Cher's talent plus it is enjoyable to watch, no violence, vulgar language, or complicated plots to try to follow.  The product was nicely packaged and delivered in two days--again a great experience.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful book!! Couldn't put it down!! At the end of every chapter, I wanted to continue to the next one!!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|came on time was in good shape no problems enjoyed the movie.came on time was in good shape no problems enjoyed the movie.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I thought they should see Jim Henson's work outside the Muppet Movies. They loved it. I'll eventually get the other movies he did for them too.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Can I rate it in tears instead of stars? Actually that would require a  much higher rating scale than 5. I bought it for my 14 year old son, but it was too much for him emotionally. It is so beautifully written, but the theme of death combined with young love was heartbreaking and a bit confronting. This is not a criticism of the book, more a warning to arm yourself with emotional armour or a box of tissues.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A really fast read and extremely interesting. Read it after watching the movie and still loved it regardless of knowing the ending. Highly recommend to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book!! Couldn't put it down! At the end of every chapter, I wanted to move on to the next chapter!!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I own a few pair of earbuds ranging from cheap to pretty good and all of them sound the same when played through the FiiO E5 connected to my iPod. However, when I connect my Beyerdynamic DT990s (250 ohms) it's an entire different ballgame.  The iPod does not have enough power or ohms to push these headphone but the FiiO E5 does. It adds a little bit of bass but the richness and depth of the sound has greatly improved. The E5 does not have enough power to blow out my eardrums but that's okay with me (tinnitus runs in my family.)  After all it was less then 25 bucks so I did not expect any more then I received. .<br /><br /> Easy to charge using the provided USB cable. The light is red while charging and purple when on. The volume is controlled but a rocker arm. A tiny switch adds bass boost. There is a built-in clip that works on shirts but is does open enough for jackets. I have listened to music for hours and the battery has not run out so I'd say the life is pretty good.<br /><br /> I would have liked it to come with a small case but I found a mint can works well. The size is incredibly small so it needs to be protected from damage.<br /><br /> If you need more volume I suggest getting this unit. Don't expect much quality upgrade with the standard earbuds.
B00005V9IK|5.0|I know it a bit jingoistic but I mean to be, I'm proud to be a &#34;Ugly American.&#34; We saved Europe from itself twice in the same century. A movie about Americans defeating Space Aliens and then telling the rest of the world how to do the same using Code to tramsit the instructions (S.F B. Morse was an American too BTW) is just too sweet. Am I waiving the American Flag? You betcha! When is the last time France saved the world?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I could sit for hours and play this game(sometimes I think I do). I only wish the real coin dozer games in the arcade were this easy to win. The more you play the better the game gets.
B001AW156U|5.0|the ps3 controllers have terrible L2, and R2 buttons. These make  it more comfortable to play with. the controllers should have been designed this way in the first place. very happy that these exist. they can come off from time to time, but not often enough to remove a star.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Commendable performances by the talented actors and actresses and incredible creative story lines by the writers and vision and layout by the director!!!! Maximum stars awarded... Thank you for the entertainment
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Very poor story line.  Incredulous responses to situations by &#34;elite ???&#34; scientific crew leaves you wondering &#34;why in the world did they do that?&#34;  Like I said &#34;BLEH!&#34;
B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVED IT.  Cannot put these books down.  It keeps me turning pages until well past my bed time.  Cannot wait to read more of her work.
B004G6009U|5.0|I was more than satisfied with this product.  The movie Tangled is not only delightful and entertaining, but is also shows a heartfelt demonstrations of the greatest form of love.  This movie models so much that should be emulated today.  This movie, the story and the characters, will always hold a special place in my heart.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|There's quite a bit of variety here. There are some straight up blues-rock songs, a very old fashioned Delta blues song, as well as Motown and hip-hop influences. It all comes together beautifully most of the time--one or two of the songs aren't all that--and peaks at the stunningly brilliant Third Stone from the Sun/If You Love Me Like You Say. I would most recommend this album to fans of Jimi Hendrix or blues music in general looking for a modern/more open approach.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book can wait to read the last one , well worth the read, two thumbs up, can't wait to read them again
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Exciting sequel.  Can't wait for Book 3.  Story line moves quickly and with unexpected events alnong the way.  Good replacement series for The Wheel of Time/
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|5 stars great stress reliever! I play it every chance I get.  Especially, at the doctor's office and any free time I have.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift keeps making these great albums. I am enjoying listening to the songs. Some artitist's music tend to be of one note, but not TS. An album is enjoyable because there is diversity of sounds.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is the best alarm clock for the kindle fire love it it wakes me up in time for me to get ready for school
B0042TV4IW|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT I hate having  a minimum requirement on how much to write.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|This is a wonderfully done animation with some great music an interesting story line. Some tears might be shed. However, this is great viewing for the whole family, especially younger children. Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This was probably my least favorite book of the series.  But you have to read it to get to the third book, which is very good!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This set is awesome. Best bang for your buck. Has a decent amount of features, a great price, nice looking and sleek, and of course the films look great.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I've always wanted to learn how to play mahJong, and this is one of 3 different mahjong games that I downloaded. This is definitely the best one: the tiles are easy on the eyes, it has different backgrounds that are all pretty calming and don't take away from the tile artwork, and is pretty challenging. All in all very addictive trying to beat that clock. The sound effects are pretty funny also and make my boyfriend laugh when he hears me playing it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not crazy about the books. Poorly written. Do not like adding more words to the review when I've said all I want to say
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|Another great game from ZeptoLab. It's not terribly challenging, though the levels do get harder as you progress. My only complaint is that the Mushroom Power only seems to work once. I have the game on my phone, tablet, and Kindle, and Mushroom Power crashes the game every time I try to use it on all my devices, except the very first time I used it. Please fix this! Otherwise, it's a great game. My 5-year-old loves it, too!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was probably my favorite book of the series.  There is more to this story than his sexual preferences.  Good read!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My shrink recommended this to take my mind of some serious family problems.  It' worked, at least while I am watching it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It works great! I especially enjoy the radar view. I can check, not just my area but also on my friends around the country. AccuWeather is the best weather forecast there is.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game has great graphics but the story is hard to follow an you are continuously asked to purchase items which is extremely annoying after only visiting only one to two areas you run out if energy again very annoying
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great chess game! I play it once in awhile and the computer is pretty good. Haven't gotten tired of it yet.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|First off, I liked this book much better than Mark's previous effort Zero Day. Trojan Horse read as a much more mature thriller, although there are still some issues. There's no question that Mark gets the technology right, and I think his editors backed off a bit and didn't dumb it down as much as in Zero Day. That said, reading about someone staring at a computer screen is hardly compelling thriller material so the author takes his heroes on an adventure typical of the genre. If you just go along for the ride, this is an enjoyable book. But hard-core thriller readers might feel a little let down. I never felt the heroes were ever in any danger and as another review put it, it seemed they were extraordinarily lucky.<br /><br />Usually in this genre the protagonist also has a past or personal demons to overcome as well. It is the internal conflict in juxtaposition with the overt conflict that sets up much of a thriller's promise. The heroes in Trojan Horse come across as a bit too perfect. As far as antagonists go, the primary villain is an interesting character but I felt a little weak for the genre. He seemed more of a puppet rather than a force to be dealt with.<br /><br />All in all, I still enjoyed the book and would recommend it for a leisurely read. It isn't page-turning, gripping, edge of your seat stuff, (but most books aren't anyway) but the technology is solid and Trojan Horse definitely shows a growing maturity in Russinovich's writing.
B0067R0APK|4.0|This weather application works well and gives you what you want to know quickly. Though the free one works well too.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie Kids love it-  sound and pic wounderful!  if you need a fun movie for a trip this is it!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|very fast processor asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd as das das das das das dasd
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love puzzle games and this game fits the category but with a little twist. There are lots of puzzles to choose from. Alot of fun!
B00ARAO720|1.0|Horrible acting, and an embarrassment to messengers and cyclist! I guess this is what (some) fine actors do when they need money!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is really more for the collectors with the extra features and the animatrix cartoon. Blu-ray quality is good. :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|exciting  fast read.  hard to put down. grisham's best  book in along time.  clever  original  concept..you can tell  hero  is lawyer  because  he so smart.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have enjoyed this brain exercise game. It has tested my skills at figuring out how to complete the level.  The higher the level of course the more difficult it gets which makes it more entertaining it is and frustrating all at the same time.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Be aware that this movie does not go without the amputation of limbs and brutal deaths in its portrayal of the conflict in Sierra Leone. Still, gripping, poignant, truthful, and educational. A must-see for everyone. EVERYONE.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|A big Jeremy Renner fan, but this could have been so much better! I hope if they continue with him, they get better writers!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Feels good watching them again reliving the experience of watching the movies in the theatre. If only I can improve my home sound system...
B0000026UV|5.0|Love this recording. The CD has songs with a variety of tempos and the two artists complement each other beautifully.
B0036UMM84|4.0|Barbra always looked up to Judy Garland, so it is no surprise that she opted to do an updated version of this film.  It is a classic love story, and the music is great (beyond Evergreen)!  Since it was the mid 1970s, much of the theme includes women's evolving roles.  You cannot beat a love story where the co-stars have such great chemistry.  I have been waiting for this to be on DVD.  Watch &#34;On a Clear Day&#34; and &#34;Yentyl&#34; too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are the best books I have ever read. This trilogy is SO awesome and action-packed I recommend it to everyone!!!! I love u Suzanne Collins!!!!! Suzanne Collins should TOTALLY write more books!!!! I love the Hunger Games series!
0425252868|5.0|\\"What occurred, in most general terms , may well be one of the most remarkable stores in the history of warfare.  As remarkable as it is, it's a story I never wanted to tell.\\"  The author's lead paragraph.  How can you not want to read what follows.  This is a painfully researched book about amazing people.  The author admits to taking eight years to collect the detailed and beautifully presented information.  Ir reads like a novel and gets you as close to an airman's role in World War II as you would ever want to be.
B009JBZH54|5.0|A real collection set that should not be missed! Reasonably priced too! Batman fans shouldn't miss this and a sure set to get.
B000002LCB|5.0|I can't belive how long it was until I realized Mark Knopfler had written the soundtrack for Princess Bride!!  Thanks to Amazon!  That very day, I ordered this CD and couldn't be happier!  Adding slowly to my Knopfler collection.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|If you're looking for a reason to hate Wall Street executives, Inside Job provides that. I left enraged. Even my wife was angry after watching it and she couldn't be less interested in finance, banking, or our economic system. It was a well done movie, although there are definitely some holes. The preview and intro shows an interview with former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker although apparently what he had to say wasn't important or didn't go along with Ferguson's message since it doesn't make it into the film. It does a good job of vilifying those on wall street in addition to several political figures. It may be worth watching just to see Glen Hubbard, who absolutely blows his interview. The conclusion leaves something to be desired. Mostly I walked away incredibly discouraged. And just by the way, I'm pretty moderate and managed to enjoy it despite having some disagreements with left-wing ideology.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a great movie. Didn't know what to expect beyond the humor and I was pleasantly surprised! Going to he purchasing this movie for sure! The songs are so fun! And of course I was laughing out loud!
B0080OJBQW|5.0|QUality of writing on songs is suberb!  only second to his voice.  Underneath is my favorate!  Better yet there isn't a song I don't like.
141694737X|5.0|Not much to say- it's a very simple book.  My 16 month old loves it and we read it at least twice a day (I draw the limit there for my sanity).<br />She loves lifting the flaps and we're into animal sounds now so it works all around!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works fine in every way and is excellent protection. Every detail was perfect, it doesn't block the speakers or charger connection.
1846551455|5.0|Great book. This author is so interesting to read. I was anxiously waiting for the translation of the bat and now waiting for the rest of the serie
B00992CF6W|4.0|So far it is a hit with kids. Curtailing usage is the only problem.<br />Would recommend to kids and some grownups.
B004M5HUXE|2.0|I'm over half-way through the book and I'm struggling not to just throw it away. It's moving very slowly & written in language style that is hard to move quickly through. I'm amazed that someone thought if I enjoyed reading &#34;50 Shades&#34;, I would enjoy this book. So far, that's a joke. I'm haviing trouble even staying awake while reading this book.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I loved this book I thought it sent a great message especially to people who are going through a through a tough time. Definitely recommend !!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The public domain free version that I found on Internet was better. But Amazon wouldn't allow me to save it with &#34;Books&#34;, I could only keep it in &#34;Downloads&#34;. It had pictures, a new chapter would start on a new page like a real book. It was a higher quality item. When I discovered I could get it direct from Amazon I loaded that one and deleted the free downloaded one. But the Amazon version doesn't have pictures from the original book and new chapters and volumes start on the same page.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|Great movie, however i did not realize it was the new version. My daughters grew up watching &#34;The Secret Garden' with their Nana when they were young. Now young adults they cherish the movie as part of the memories of their nana who recently past away. This movie was well done except for the magic part kind of creepy for youngsters. I will have to find the old version again.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kid likes it, he switches between this and mine craft, go figure.<br />Lovely graphics, excellent story that carries the characters.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was very informative about the training and day-to-day life of our Special Forces. I was on the edge of my seat when the author was telling details of the Mission. However, as is usually the case, I wish he could have gotten to the details of the Mission a little sooner in the book. Of course, that would have made for a fairly short book.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Well written; glad there are another 8 or 9 in the series to enjoy.  I know I am getting into this late, but hey if you have not read the series and like interesting super agent type reads, this was great
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is definitely a book worth reading.  It is very enjoyable - who would think that one would really enjoy a book written by a dog?  Only reason I did not give it five stars is because the ending is a  bit hokey and predictable.  I would have enjoyed the book a lot more had the ending been left to the reader, or at least been a little more subtle.  Really important life lesson in there:  the car goes where your eyes go.....
B00886XQO0|5.0|Although the box was damaged everything inside was in PERFECT condition. this was a great gift my husband loves them and uses them for everything. xbox ps3 cellphone for all his online gaming chats as well
B009O07NDY|5.0|Best soundtrack ever! Amazing sound. Love the extended song versions and bonus tracks. Totally worth the money. I would buy it again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a must read I get bored with some books and lose interest but, this book is amazing and I was always ready to read more I bought all the others and can`t wait to read them all.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great thank you. Super Delivery on line.<br />Great you need to try it yourself.<br />Enjoy the amazon deals everyday like I do.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|this backpack is just what I was looking for. It was a gift for my daughter and she liked it also.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a very enjoiable game.  Anyone who what's to have some fun should try this game.  You will not be displeased
0307394549|5.0|I have been clipping the &#34;Cookie of the Month&#34; feature from Martha's magazine for years. Now I have them in one place.<br />Admittedly, I bought the book for the beautiful photos. Loved the introductory paragraph for each cookie that gives some hints on when you might want to make it and what to serve with it.<br /><br />All the recipes work, though some are more difficult to handle than the text leads you to believe. Also, as a baker whose files contain 50 years of cookie recipes, I can compare multiple takes on the same cookie. For my personal taste, many of the MS cookies contain too much butter. If you like the flavor of butter, great. But it can interfere with other flavors that make each cookie unique. I would up with a selection of 11 different cookies that I thought lacked diversity -  though the guests didn't seem to share this negative.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a great easy to play but can be challenging in later stages game. The artwork is awesome and pretty amazing as well.
B007V65R54|5.0|Made me think about forecasting in a whole new way, and gave  me baseball references so I could get my 14 year old son interested.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a nice romance with just enough suspense.  The last chapter was a little rough because I thought it was going to end differently than it did and I was getting sad, but then I got happy again.
0765325950|5.0|My eyes are sore as I could not take them away from the pages.  Great book!!  If you read the series, you have to read the conclusion.
0307460444|5.0|I'm a sucker for cookbooks with photos and this one doesn't disappoint. Great ideas for presentation. While the craft of some was beyond the scope of all but truly devoted Martha fans, most were &#34;doable&#34;. My only caveat was to wish there was a disclaimer for some things (dried coconut flakes, sloppy fillings) that look fabulous, but are either inedible or hard to eat without utensils.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|This is the way ebooks should be designed!  Not only is the a complete collection of Holmes fiction, it is presented with generous illustrations throughout.  And best and most important of all, you can locate anything you wish to read or review quickly and simply.  Most other similar Holmes ebook compendium collections are terribly designed with little or no illustrative material, and worst of all they load with terrible delays, and often inaccurately.  This book, unlike many other classic ebbooks, was put together with care and grace.  My favorite edition of Sherlock Holmes in ebook format.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Hilarious !!!  LOL A  LOT  !  The  SUPER NERDS  , SHELDON is A RIOT and the DUMB  BLOND ,PENNY !!! VERY FUNNY .
B0007ODLCS|5.0|This is an impressive collection for the price.  I recommend it highly for anyone interested in this great songwriter. Get it.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I cannot believe that Bruce Willis did this crap. What a waste of time and money. Bruce was good but the story was aweful
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app.  It takes serious concentration and an eye for detail to make this fun and challenging game.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|As this series continues, I begin to feel that never have so many delicious characters who we can love to despise been assembled in one fictive universe on television.  Terrible human traits seem to abound, and just about no characters can avoid the touch of human folly.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love the show!!!!.....On the edge of my seat the whole time.... Who is \\"A\\"? You'll just have to watch and see!
1452110581|4.0|Since our family loves cats and are familiar with how they appear to think, we thought the creator of this book really understands his cats!<br /> Personally, I think this book can be enjoyed best by reading it aloud to someone else. It is the best cat book yet.<br /><br />Lois
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have been in a reading slump the past few months, finding nothing to catch my interest enough to keep reading. Ender's Game is different. It is a little fantastic at times (it IS sci-fi/fantasy, though), but it is really engaging and fast paced. I am definitely going to pick up the next one in the series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Not sure why I waited so long to read what everyone else was already in love with. Even if you're not an avid reading fan, you can pick up this book start reading and not want to put it down. Great read and can't wait to start Catching Fire!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First book she has read and finished in years. she could not put it down. Great as a gift for the loved one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was asked to do this review solely on watching the preview to Season 3 of Downton Abbey, and I wanted to take the opportunity to say what a wonderful series this is!  The cinematography, acting, storyline, everything, is nothing short of amazing - the preview to Season 3 looks great and I look forward to when it becomes available on Prime.
B000TRXRUY|3.0|I don't remember ever watching Bruce Lee before and don't watch too many movies, but think this movie was decent. The acting and voices were a not very good at times and the video quality was not very high.<br /><br />However, it was nice to see a classic movie filmed 40 years ago that everyone praises. I liked to see how different Martial Artists live and different cultures
B003NFM3JU|3.0|Movie was nice and the 3D copy was as we expected, Enjoyed the Jim Carey version.Color on 3D copy was great.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book. It was very good and did not take long to read. I do not read many romances, but this was very good and funny too.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|just started playing...like it so far! love the idea of breeding your own dragons!! and it's. free.  also a plus! give it a shot
B0091REZMW|3.0|not what I was expecting...thought it would be more of solve all the clues in one room to move on to the next.
B002PLALCO|5.0|PINK Amazing tour, she never lets you down.  After watching this we bought tickets to her next concert. CAN&#34;T WAIT
B009PEPML4|4.0|It's been a decade since their last release and after hearing this album, I'm okay with that. They don't seem to have skipped a beat, the songs in this collection could have been added to their earlier album. I can't say I love it, but I certainly enjoy the oppertunity to revisit them.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The tiles are very small for my fingers.<br />Also the screen is so sensitive that I make many mistakes when I don't mean to.<br />I don't know how to find out what the symbols mean or what I have to do to get new symbols on the review page.<br />Where is there an explanation about HOW to play the game?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started. It is kind of predictable but definitely worth the read & it has some pretty interesting turn of events that happen that maybe you didn't expect.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'd heard good things about this show, and loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin are dynamite.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The white album was when the Beatles finally got away from Bobbie sox crowd. Great all the way the way thru. It was the stepping stone for greatness from then on.
B005723JSQ|3.0|I was looking for a light book to read over the holidays and this definitely did the trick. I did get a little annoyed with the lead character from time to time as she always pushed things a little too far and it stressed me out. I suppose that's the norm for Kinsella books though.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if you want a light fluffy read with a happy ending but keep your expectations low.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I downloaded some directions on how to use and read this. It was very helpful and I enjoy all the settings and adjustments I can make to the text. Also the instant dictionary is a wonderful features.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Last I checked, reviews on Amazon.com were reserved for the PRODUCTS. Since when did this site become a review of the stories within said products, i.e. books, DVDs, MP3s, etc? Talk about asinine individuals. Let me know how your DVDs/Blu-Rays are working. I can imagine by now, if someone was interested in buying one, they would've already seen the film.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is a good example of what can be achieved if you take the time to produce something above the average. American television has certainly become something of a waste of time. Thank you PBS for showing what is possible.
B00005R8FI|5.0|This is one of best albums. His old Blues breakers albums are the best. Players like Clapton,Page and Green all on the same album is hard to beat. I got to see him live and talk to him and he is a great guy who got many greats started.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|The game started out like one of those flash game, and if you are one of those who judge game on the first glance, you will get tricked. It looks easy, but it's hard. The BMG is awesome and smoothing. I still want to replay the game to get a higher score in Flower, because one of the stage where the petal has to fly through the power line and tower debrids, I fail so bad and got burn so many times. Anyways, they are not what they seem to be, and they are exactly as what they are called. I don't regret getting this collection game.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|Far and away, the best film version of Hamlet one could wish for. Visually stunning, well (for the most part) acted, and best of all- it's accurate. No confused Oedipal complex and misunderstood lines like Mel Gibson's version. Kenneth Branagh is not just a fantastic actor and director; he's obviously a Shakesperian scholar. This work covers every line, word for word, and the actors understand the significance of what they are saying. Brilliant work!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|A really enjoyable sweet movie. Fun and funny and kind characters. I watched it with my 6 year old and 10 year old granddaughters and we all enjoyed it equally.
1451695195|5.0|The fact that this book was written by a Harvard-educated neurosurgeon gave it great credence.  The book is a quick read and is clearly written. The narrative flips back and forth between what is happening to the doctor's body while he is visiting different dimensions, which I thought would be tedious, but it turned out to be interesting and gave even more substance to the fact that science and spirituality can and do co-exist.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|1st time I saw Trucks he was around 14 and traveling around with Greg and Friends. I saw him in Grant Street Dance Hall. Lafayette Louisiana. His father played with the Allman brothers. Greg would get him on stage and have him Play and few songs. The kid brought the house down. Very nice and kind of shy back then but you could see another star being Born. His Wife Tedeschi is a power house also. Also saw her at a young age and knew she was going to be big also. Together there is no stopping them.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Was a gift but have heard the family is enjoying it, and a good addition to their collection of Christmas movies
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointing and a complete waste of precious time.  Not close to the great story telling of the Potter series.  Hopefully this is the first and last of this effort.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It has lots of storage, good insulation to absorb impacts.  The compartments are adjustable to suit each person's needs.  Very durable and easy to use.  Good quality.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was awesome I couldn't put it down!!<br />I can't wait for the third book! This is my second time reading it.
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|Another band that was not out very long. The Song Bang a gong got them radio play. They were great live.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love suspense, great acting and an amazing storyline al involving zombies, you would LOVE this. Absolutely amazed at the work.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I like this darker version.  the effects were goregous, especially, the incorporation of the comic style effects.  I hope they make a sequel.  The stars were all a bit unknown to me.  I had to imdb most of them,  but the acting was great.
0810989956|5.0|my grandson (age 10) loved it!  He is a big fan of the Wimpy kids series and has read all the books...
6305014140|5.0|another favorite, arrived in good shape and on time, I have watched it a bunch since I got it years ago.
B000002OZY|5.0|I bought the album when it first came out. The days of live at Leeds and others all great albums. 1st Rock Opera.
B007SGM084|4.0|Loved the books, especially the last one. Kept me reading until the last page!! Held my attention and didn't want to put it down
B006LSZECO|3.0|A riveting novel.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I was very dissapointed in the end because it left you hanging (albiet knowing the end results).  I guess I don't like novels that don't have an ending, whether happy or not.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fascinating, heartbreaking tale. Have all 3 books ready because you won't want the story to end.<br />I am sorry I waited so long to begin!
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite anime. the disc arrived in great shape and on time, good as new.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I first started listening to John when he had a friend Sonny Landreth play on some of his albums. Love them together.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is quite a read, it had me entralled, couldn't wait to find out what Nick and Amy were going to do next.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like this app,it gives you various options &amp; breaks down how much power you have for various functions...I especially like the voice that lets you keep tabs on the power levels...
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|This movie is very thought provoking.  I have watched it a few times now and take something away from it each time.
1419705849|5.0|This was a gift for my son, had it on his Christmas list. The book arrived on time, in great shape, great price, my son was super happy.
B007CKNX28|5.0|What can you say about Jack White. Another young slinger who has years to play and change. Already great and like Clapton will just get better with age.
B00594XOZU|5.0|i liked it because i can now chat with my friends !!! it is awsome everyone can chat with my friends.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|played this on a 3 inch screen. I can only Imagine what it looks like on a tablet. Definitely worth the money.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I love the utility of this device but it looks and feels like I could break it by looking at it,  I would recommend it to anyone who has the Plantronics Bluetooth headset. It recharges the headset very quickly two time before it requires a USB connection to recharge the charger.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I feel the earth move!!! This is really a great cd.  I have heard Carole King sing with James Taylor so I thought I would get her cd.  Glad that I did.  This is a GREAT cd
B0018BF1KY|5.0|Love Rory. Great player! Early Rockin Blues from across the pond. There are many out there that only listened to top 40 and have no ideal on how much great music they missed out on. In those days if you didn't listen to Collage or under ground stations you missed out on alot.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Good purchase does what yahoo claims.  I used Amazon to help install Yahoo Mail on my Kindle Fire.  Like this product.  As I said good product and good purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book you don't want to put down. Keeps you guessing all the way through. Still can't believe how it ended.
0765325950|5.0|More than a good-enough end to the series. This was the fastest-paced, page-turningest book in this series of ~thousand pagers. Matt, Perrin and Rand, the girls, and some Chosen all get their screen time, as do the other dozen or so \\"principle\\" characters. If you liked the first 10 or 13, why not finish it out? I don't see how anyone who was still reading five books ago wouldn't still love this.<br /><br />Anything can be improved to personal taste, but this was good solid work, which wove the pattern back to a nice finish.<br /><br />Also, if you like the jumping perspective check out the [unrelated] Cloud Atlas movie when it's on blu ray/dvd/rental. If you don't the CA book might be ok.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It is really a great cd.  It was inexpensive and arrived quiclkly.  I love listening to it in my car and at the house also.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book so much. I read it before a while ago. I had to read it again it was that good!
B009VB97EY|1.0|We were ready for a good time movie but this is just further proof of the &#34;dumming down&#34; of America
B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow start, but stick with it, It is worth it.  The story was well written and the story line fascinating.  Evil comes in many a disguised form! I love it when a book surprises me.
0316067598|5.0|I ordered this book and several others to send to the soldiers in Afghanistan to give them something to read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game was very fun, not too easy or hard. The graphics were amazing and very life like. I just wish it was longer!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|We introduced it to our grandson who enjoys it as much as we do.  Always good for a laugh or few
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is an amazing end to the hunger games trilogy.  I love all the books but this one I like a lot because at has another meaning to it other than blood and killing. It shows what we as human beings are capable of. I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read for teens and adults.
1400032717|5.0|I ordered this book and several others to send to the soldiers in Afghanistan to give them something to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is inspirational and very fun to read. It took me a decent amount of time to finish it but it was definitely worth it.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this book. I bought all three and read them right away.  thank you so much.  I hope she comes out with some more.
B007N8RULO|2.0|This was one of 2 Spider Solitare programs I had purchased.  Both apps had been played slot.  This version quit suddenly and I never could restart it.  This is the only game app which I have had any problems with......!!
0374105235|5.0|I ordered this book and several others to send to the soldiers in Afghanistan to give them something to read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a very engaging yarn, as one expects from a Grisham work  Its theme is novel so far in the Grisham stable, but it has an ending surprise one always finds in his stories  but one I couldn't have anticipated.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|that Kindle fire HD is required! regular kindle fire does not have the GPS. if it worked on mine I'm sure I would love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book deserves all five stars. the authors truly captured my attention in every way. i felt as if i was watching a movie. i was moved and encountered every emotion; sadness, anger, remorse, passion, fear and defeat. i can't wait to read book three.
1594489505|5.0|I ordered this book and several others to send to the soldiers in Afghanistan to give them something to read.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Bought to add to my super hero DVD collection but haven't watched yet.  DVD was it very good shape.  Don't anticipate any problems.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved it. Made me burst out laughing with snappy dialogue. Engaging enough that I stayed up all night to read it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'm not much of a romance novel reader, and even though you know how it's going to end, you still enjoy the journey getting there :)
0393324818|5.0|I ordered this book and several others to send to the soldiers in Afghanistan to give them something to read.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Got at a great price and received quickly.  Still had free comic book offer inserts inside too.  Haven't watched the DVD yet but loved the movie when I saw it in the theater.
0345803485|5.0|I finish the entire trilogy in three weeks. I can't for the movie! I purchase the other two from store because I couldnt wait to get the next one
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time! Each episode is like a mini movie! The acting is great, and the storyline is wonderful! Two thumbs WAY UP!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The best Heroes movie ever, funny, action and marvelous special effects, a must watch, an instant classic, don't read just watch it !!!!
B0042JTDXK|4.0|This CD is different, and may not be what you're expecting from Josh Groban if you're familiar with his debut CD, Closer, and Awake. It is less bombastic, with simpler orchestral arrangements on some songs. It took me a few listens to really settle in to the music and begin to understand the album as a whole. It's slower, and a little melancholy, but still very beautiful. The standouts to me are \\"The Bells of New York City\\",\\"If I Walk Away\\", and \\"Love Only Knows\\". The only song that is an outright clunker is Galileo, which now earns a skip every time I come to it. Its lyrics sound as if they were written by a poetic 9 year old. (\\"Who puts the rainbow in the sky/Who lights the stars at night?\\") OVERALL, though, the CD is solid and I'm glad to add it to my Josh library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|True love. One of the best love stories I have read. Holder is the guy that every girl dreams of.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Channing Tatum is &#34;sex&#34; on two legs! Everytime he is on the screen, he lights up the movie, and when he is on stage dancing, you can't see anyone but him because he shines. His dancing makes you want him even more! I could watch dance all night, and never tire of seeing it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book and highly recommend it to even middle aged women, such as myself!  I read it in one sitting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is like being at the arcade.  Loads of fun and unable to stop.  Can't walk away and don't want to quit.
0385535147|3.0|While I found the storyline interesting, the whole idea was preposterous. I understand this is fiction, but I want my stories to be somewhat believable. Without giving away any spoilers, I can come up with at least ten things off the top of my head that could have gone wrong and foiled his brilliant \\"plan\\". To have everything just fall into place is a real stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />On top of that, I found the main character to be a total jerk. He knew who the killer was and could have revealed his name, gotten out and gone on with his life. Yet he comes with a scheme which cuts him off forever with his son, who he claimed to adore, along with his father and other family members who probably wondered what happened to him.<br /><br />Then his plan puts others needlessly at risk. The people he rented the plane from were likely in a lot of trouble thanks to him, yet he didn't seem to care. Others he involved could have gotten in serious trouble if they had gotten caught. His whole scheme began by asking someone else to put himself at risk before anything else happened.<br /><br />A minor nitpick.....Quinn hid out in rehab, claiming to have nearly OD'd on cocaine. The rehab clinic drew blood from him. If the rehab was a sham to give him an alibi, wouldn't the clinic have noticed he was drug free when they checked his blood?<br /><br />I enjoyed the story the first time through, but when skimming over parts a second time, I enjoyed it less and less.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Tangled was a pleasant surprise.  Nothing much like the old rapunzel story except for the witch and the long hair, but what a study of manipulative, controlling, parental behavior!  Funny and poignant with those snippets of adult humor that make Shrek movies so fun to watch.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Movie is nutty, but it is funny, gotta love George Clooney, I give it 5 ***** for the music and comedy.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Nice book to ready. Easy to download to my kindle fire hd. Easy to ready and interesting, like to ready more from this author.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Entertaining, uplifting, funny and the cast is outstanding. Harrison Ford is the sleeper and went unnoticed until he played Han Solo in \\"Star Wars.\\"
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Interesting book written with a lot of imagination. Truly makes you appreciate what you have and opens up your mind to new ideas.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've read in years.  Despite its length, I read it in three days, and can't wait to read the 'prequels' that are now out.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Bought the movie for my family. We enjoy watching the movie over and over again. Can't wait to what the others ones too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite writer. This was a great book! I have read every book that he has written and will continue to read any book that he writes.
0765325950|3.0|huge fan of the series and have been waiting for the end for years now. finally, it is here. i havent gotten through more than the first chapter yet, but i'm enjoying it so far.<br /><br />being a fan of hardcover books, the lack of a kindle version is not a huge deal to me. my review is to point out that i got a defective copy. not sure if it is a fluke, or if this batch of publications all have the same error - that being that the spine is upside down. it will be interesting to see if anyone else got an upside down spine. by that i mean that if you're reading the book, when you close the cover and look at the spine, the embossing is upside down. completely unnoticeable when the dust jacket is on, and the maps on the side of the front and back covers are correctly oriented with the rest of the text, so it's not like there's anything noticeable or distracting as you are flipping the pages. just noticed it now and thought it was odd. anyone else with upside down embossing on the spine? leave a comment or rate my review as helpful if this happened to you!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Great flick. A mix between Bullitt and Pulp Fiction (not my idea), quite a bit of gore, but great storyline and acting.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Bought the movie for my family. We enjoy watching the movie over and over again. Can't wait to what the others ones too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was funny and intimate and I just could not put it down. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick read.
0783225903|5.0|Terry Gilliam deserves the Nobel Prize for this film. While hilarious and dark, it will probably end up being as influential as Orwell's 1984 or Kafka's The Castle. Is it a happy ending or a sad ending? If there is an escape from the perils of overactive institutions and the stupidity of a populous so addled by nonsense consumerism and self-absorbed to the point that it cannot even sensibly react to terrorism (sound familiar to those of us who survived Bu$hco era Amerka?), it lies in the human imagination. Our Winston Smith in this case finds his loving place under the chestnut tree of his own mind. Well-acted, brilliantly edited, and superbly written this film is one of my favorites of all time.
0765325950|4.0|The journey of Wheel of Time, which is about 17 years for me, is done.  Having been a Jordan fan (although I was starting to slide in his later books, which seemed to lose focus) as well as now being a Sanderson fan, I was, of course, looking forward to this - the Last Battle, where everything comes to a close.<br /><br />It was, in many ways, everything I expected.  Every major dangling plot thread was finally gathered up and woven in.  All of the things that many have been desperately waiting for (particularly in the Aes Sedai and Seanchan plot lines) came in.<br /><br />I see that some people complain that the secondary characters were given way too much face time, pressing some of the main characters into the background.  It seems to me that this was intentional, that ultimately this closing novel was supposed to recount the Last Battle and display all of the people, great and small, who stretched beyond their limits to contribute to the ultimate victory.<br /><br />One of the things that I always enjoyed about Jordan's books, and Sanderson captures this well, is the feel of a bardic epic, where it seems like you almost have to read the words out loud for maximum impact.  This happened for me particularly in Moiraine's contributions, as well as the struggle between Rand and the Dark One.  I was hoping for a little more poetry in the ending, but it did capture the kind of ending I was hoping for.<br /><br />Now, if you've gotten this far, you probably ask, \\"why four stars?\\"  My objection primarily stems from what I see as an overuse of deus ex machina - someone is always showing up at just the right moment, or somebody suddenly does something completely new to turn the tide.  It's okay if it happens a few times, but it seems like almost every chapter ended that way.  I will say though, even with that, some of those deus ex machina moments were still incredibly dramatic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great App and very easy to use. Nice to have a calculator app that is so easy to use. I would recommend to any one who needs a calculator for their Kindle Fire HD
B005K17RU0|4.0|as accurate as any weather man, I like the multi day forecast.  Maps and radar work well.  You can save different locations, helpful for frequent travelling.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|Was buying as a gift. Did not get an answer back about it but did not recieve any complaints either!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game to play on my cell phone and my kindle fire hd.  Fun for kids and adult to play.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire is Solitaire what can I say.  My husband, who sometimes uses my &#34;kindle&#34; enjoys it.  I ordered it more for him than for myself.
B0083GQVOC|5.0|The story is incredibly grim and the horror of it unfolds and then folds up again until you feel like jumping into the story to try to stop what you know is coming.  The script is brilliant as is the acting.  I don't know why however John C Riley played the clueless husband.  This is about mental illness and how parents can wear the cloak of deniability so easily while trying to go on with their lives and missing what is happening in front of their faces.  Don't watch this before bed, you will dream about it all night.  It probably would have won Oscars if the subject matter weren't so tough to think about let alone begin a conversation about it.  This is not a movie for children.  It's a warning to parents and to our communities
B0015DROBO|4.0|This is a good read.  It pretty much follows along with the movie which is great.  I would recommend this book.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I tried several times but could not get it to work properly. I use WiFi printing on my phone all the time and it works fine. I might have to try again.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I was addicted to this game on my computer before I owned a &#34;Kindle&#34; and knew that I had to have it here as well.
1250027624|5.0|The book was great - even bettern than I expected.  I love the show and the book was very well doe.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|very good movie I watched it like 3 or 4 times...excellent!!!! I absolutlely love this movie I am definitly going to purchase soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've already read it once, but it never stops captivating and pulling you into it!!  I will never tire of reading this series!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Excellent read. King has always had me on the edge of my seat. He will always be my favourite. Hats off to the master of horror.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I have been following this show from the beginning and love the music - all new and fresh and well sung.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Thus book was good. Definitely keeps your attention and you never want to put it down. But the first one was definitely better...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I know God is there because he made me enjoy a really fun and addicting app. One of the best. Great app.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun challengeing game.  It does get boring after a while. There are levels for all ages to play.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This isn't the first time I have purchase this CD, I've been through 2 other copies.  I love ever song on it.  Mark Knopfler is the best.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|I have to give a thumbs up to the acting. Wonderful actors! The quality is very high and the scenes are well thought out. They did a great job portraying what really did happen.The only problems I had with this film, was that the scenes were very fast paced and they don't allow you to get to know the characters very well. There are some loose-end scenes that leave you hanging and wondering what became of those people. I thought they could've added more drama and imagination-- maybe deviating from the actual story a little bit by adding a side story romance. The ending is not very uplifting and could've used a better one. Overall, I think this is a one-time film.
1250010403|5.0|I had no idea when I picked up \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" that I'd love this series so much. It has an excellent plot thread along with some turns and twists that surprised me. I just finished number 2 book, \\"Sins of the Father\\" and want more! The characters are readable at every juncture of their lives and the time spanned is from the First World War, through the Second World War.<br />Write us some more, Mr Archer. I'll put it on pre-sale when available.
1452110581|5.0|I gave this book to someone for Christmas.  She really liked it because she likes cats and poetry.  Maybe you like one but not the other.  Then you might want to consider a different book.  Talk to your local librarian.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This CD is fantastic, it's so good to have a new Bonnie Raitt CD!  She just keeps getting better and better.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|excellent read lots of good drama and action and like the way could not guess the ending and could not put book down
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I grew up reading comic books.  Also love the Comic movie genre.  Captain America is one of the better movies made...sometimes it is a hit or miss and this one was a hit!!!!!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Superb acting as well as great surroundings coupled with well written dialogue gives us great insite into English history at the beginning of the 20th Century. WWI depics harbingers of change in British heritage . This is a splendid history lesson.<br /><br />VeryJerry
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he abosolutely LOVES it. The screen is much bigger then I expected, and it was quite easy for him to hook it up and play it. Great buy!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked the story in this book best. It kept me reading.  I didn't like how the book ended though.
0375869026|3.0|The book was written about a family with a boy who suffered from several birth defects or syndroms.  I felt that the book was a little predictable.  Though it was well written and readable, the only character that was realistically portrayed was the main character's sister.  He was physically difficult to look at, but of course he was a genius with a profound influence on everyone  who came in contact with him.  It was hard for me to believe a child protected from the world from birth could be that intuitive, going to school for the first time.  I would recommend it as a YA book for readers 12+
B009LDMJBU|5.0|I liked the last album \\"Ali e Radici\\", but this one is far superior. Most albums have a few great tracks, a few good ones, and the rest duds. This 14 track release consists of many great tracks, and the rest are good. If you are new to Eros, I suggest buying the Roma DVD or Live World Tour 2009-10 DVD as an introduction. His showmanship and high quality performance will make you a fan, which will help you enjoy this newest CD.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A very funny and down to earth movie.  It  looks  like some of the things that are still going on in the world.today.
B004QX07G4|4.0|This was Ellen's personality. I thought it was a good read but I thought she would talk more about her life.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this version of Angry Birds.  Incorporating the space version and the special abilities of the Star Wars characters makes a classic game even better.
0345536886|5.0|The characters in The Litigators are strong in their own ways. How David Zinc finds his way into the ambulance chasing firm of Finley & Figg is an interesting story in itself. At one point in the narrative, Grisham does a David vs Goliath (big pharma) trying to get the reader rooting for David when you are almost certain he is going to be crushed. At the end of that bit of drama, cone can only continue to root for the underdogs.<br /><br />Besides the plot and storytelling, I love reading Grisham for his analysis of topical and evergreen hot button topics that he looks at with a common-sense lens. And some commonly understandable legalese thrown in for good measure. Grisham's ability to bring out the human dimension of characters in the narrative is an icing on the cake. The Litigators is no different.<br /><br />The narrative leaves you entertained and satisfied at the end.

1609611543|5.0|I consider myself a cynic but after reading this (and it was a very easy read), I absolutely felt the Dr may be on to something.  I immediately cut wheat from my diet (particularly as I had been trying to lose at least 15 lbs for the better part of the last year!).  It has been a week and am sleeping better and have lost 3lbs so I am hopeful. I will try to update my review periodically.  I suffer from dermatitis and am hoping to see this improve or even resolve completely.  No obvious improvement yet but it's still early days...

B00ANT6OK8|5.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Director Kathryn Bigelow got everybody's attention in 2008 with \\"The Hurt Locker\\" and while this is certainly no sequel, there are some common elements that weave their way throughout both films.  Like Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James, Golden Globe winner Jessica Chastain's Maya is a bit of a loner.  Highly focused on their mission both characters have little use for nonsense.<br /><br />Maya is a CIA analyst recruited out of high school trained in the unglamorous work of sifting through leads to identify the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, beginning a couple years after 9/11.  Early on she joins a CIA interrogator (Jason Clarke) interviewing captured lower level terrorists.  The first 30 minutes of the film contains most of the well-documented torture scenes.  While unnerving, I didn't find them much more squirm inducing than when Daniel Craig as James Bond got his jollies wacked by a steel ball in \\"Casino Royale.\\"<br /><br />In any case, a tidbit of info was revealed which Maya locks onto and runs with it for years, much to the dismay of her boss (Kyle Chandler) in Pakistan.  He and most everybody else believe the lead is worthless.  The middle section of the film can be a bit convoluted with the unfamiliar names in this part of the world and runs like an elaborate procedural investigation that we have now become familiar with.<br /><br />Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal used eyewitness accounts for the basis of their film and it certainly feels honest.  Chastain's casting is interesting.  A fair skinned redhead clearly stands out in the dusty Muslim world and Maya seems distant, even from those closest to her.  Not that she has a personal life.  She does get close to another female analyst (Jennifer Ehle) who becomes a casualty.  This leads to Maya's increased focus on the courier lead she had acquired years earlier.<br /><br />Maya learns to be tough and vocal about her beliefs in the macho world of the CIA.  In one great scene, her superiors are briefing the Secretary of Defense (James Gandolfini) who is to make a recommendation to President Obama as to whether they believe Osama is indeed holing up in a barricaded house in Abbottabad.  One by one the various agency heads hedge their bets by giving their odds of him being there.  Maya isn't asked but shouts out 100%.  She backs off to 95% and says something to the effect of \\"I know you guys don't like certainty.\\"  When Secretary Panetta asks \\"who is this woman?\\" Maya responds \\"I'm the M.....f..... who found the place.\\"  Memorable line.<br /><br />The third act begins as the seal team gets the go ahead for the assault.  Even though we know the outcome, Bigelow takes us through the precision flying though mountain passes and into the Osama compound.  The house is locked up tight so explosives are needed to take down doors and barricades.  This isn't one of those typical in-and-out missions.  It is done in real time (or at least so it seems).  This is one gripping film that ultimately is about one analyst's determination to get Osama Bin Laden.  Mission accomplished.superiors are briefing the Secretary of Defense (James Gandolfini) who is to make a recommendation to President Obama as to whether they believe Osama is indeed holing up in a barricaded house in Abbottabad.

0525953728|4.0|If you are looking for the definitive account of the mission, this is what you want. The book talks in detail about the mission. If you're not new to SEAL books, this book isn't much different from the others. Honestly I didn't enjoy the book that much, I guess I have tired of the subject after reading on the modern subject for two other books previous or since there wasn't much suspense except in the final stages of the book. It is a pretty quick read, one to throw on the shelf for reference if you ever get to discussing the mission in detail with anyone (yeah right.)<br /><br />I was surprised how lethal the SEALs were in the mission. It almost seems like they could have used some restraint and not killed like they did in the compound. While they didn't kill the women and children in the compound, Bin Laden didn't even put up a fight and so he should have been taken alive.<br /><br />hey must have been very nervous for their own safety. I guess I don't blame them because I have never suited up for a mission like that.<br /><br />How interesting would it be if we had him alive? I would enjoy that very much.

0765325950|4.0|I picked up the book Friday evening and finished it on Sunday afternoon, then re-read the last 350 pages.  I cannot decide if Mr. Sanderson tied it up correctly and I will probably debate it in my mind for quite some time.  I imagine that it would be incredibly difficult to tie up all of the loose ends and there are many of them!  Also, a part of me would have liked for Mr. Sanderson to have added another 50-100 pages at the end of the book for obvious reasons.  But, another part of me put that book down satisfied - as my mind added those missing pages.  Mat was always my favorite male character, and Nynaeve was my favorite female character.  Their ending was satisfactory for me and I did sort of like the simple ending for Rand.  I was happy for him and I will miss reading about all of them.  I'll give the book 4.5 stars and this series is still my all time favorite.  As I have over 10K books in my library and a wife who stares at me when I walk in with a hardback, I can sympathize with those who demanded the ebook.  However I wanted the real book to finish my collection of my all-time favorite fantasy.

B00009ZYC0|4.0|First of all the movie shows the possible future of cities which are under a technological lockdown.<br /><br />However in the end, it is reduced to the human beings who were manipulating the technology for good or bad.<br /><br />It is worth seeing since advances in technological may be accompanied by certain down sides. Under the belly of it is the human being with its basic instincts and so technology cannot do a thing about that.<br /><br />In this movie people who were potential criminals were kept in animated suspension in bubble chambers. This as the safeguard society from their potential criminal acts but the controllers of the technology found ways to exhibit human nasty tendencies and so the whole idea of the technology protecting human society, fell apart, because the human remain as he is a basis survival organism.

0143116738|5.0|It is a very great book... conveys me the need to constantly reconnect us with our passion for life, and the importance of recognizing and respecting the passion of others, even being part of supporters to the others to empower you... Language very direct, objective and with many truths...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For those people who dare not entertain the idea that there is life after death, this book is the first must read.  Having lived a life time and talked to many people who have died, literally died and then come back to tell about it, this book will instill in any reader the fact that death is not scary, death is not the end, death is not a taboo, death is rather a beginning of life.  The reading is easy and once started I simply couldnt put the book down.<br />I would recommend this reading to any person who has any question about death and dying but more than that, about living.
0916990427|5.0|Tad James bases his whole NLP schtick on Time Lines.<br /><br />This book was semantically very difficult read for me<br />but with STUDY i got it.  Powerful, but maybe a weekend<br />with Tad James Company in Henderson Nevada would be<br />worth it.  I know the Tad James folks helped me with this<br />'therapeutic' semantic restructuring in only one weekend.<br /><br />i recommend this book howver for those who have an background<br />in basic NLP, anchors,  collapsing anchors, and values clarification.

0765325950|2.0|It's about time this series closed. I stopped reading six books in because it started to feel less like a good read and more like an accounting textbook. Not going to lie, I found out the series was over and just read the synopsis on Wikipedia because I rightly can't be bothered to read a series that has dragged like a Neanderthals knuckles.<br /><br />Now I have to say that a massive shout out goes to Brandon Sanderson for putting in the time and effort to completing the series. It was a monumental role to accept, having to mop up the series and give it some semblance of the awesome that it was when it started, but I just can't be bothered because the last books left me so disappointed for having wasted so much time on the monotony that came up in 5 and 6, and to hear that the following two or three were the same, and ridiculously long to boot, I just lost all will to continue the series. I may pick up Brandon's works but I refuse to reconsider my stance on the missing books.<br /><br />Now, I think I have justified my two star rating on account of the actual detail of the series but I am also protesting the lack of a decent ereader format. This is very clearly a cash grab and a poor attempt at trying to focus on the sell feature. A good book sells itself, and the quality of the written material is what dictates whether or not it gets on the best sellers list. Harriet has inadvertently spoiled any possible redemption that this book could provide on account of the fact that she has failed to consider that the reputation of the books is based on the labour. For all of you out there who have cried shame for people protesting against the e reader, think on this: many are using these books as an escape from darker lives a continent away; many have spent a good amount of money for e readers so that they can have the space to read their desired novels without having to carry a tome every time they want to read a chapter at Starbucks; many just spend a lot of time travelling. All of these are reasons for promoting an e-book release, and Harriet has gone ON RECORD stating that the reason for not wishing to release this book is, in translation, purely profit motivated. While Jordan may have written the last few books as paperweights the one credit that I have to give him posthumously is that he did love his fans, and this type of practice is clearly not indicative of someone who cares about her husbands legacy.<br /><br />I feel that my piece has been said. Brandon, thank you for putting the series to rest. It is worthy of a good funeralng.

B005QUQ99K|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and he really enjoyed receiving it.  It was received just in time for Christmas.
0385535147|5.0|The book was a requested gift for a grandson - he loved it.  He has been a Grisham fan for years.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series is a great one.  A stark reminder about how brave that generation was and how we should remember all of the evils that built up to those times.
1419705849|5.0|My son can not get enough of these books.  This last one was no exception. He is 11 and has been reading these for a little over a year and he finished this one in a couple of days.  He is ready for a new one now!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I though this was a fantastic mind challanging TV series. The amount of twists, turns and possiblities of technology highlighted was fantastic. The story line was a little fantastic at times but enjoyed it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I truly enjoy reading all about the afterlife and this book offers a wonderful example of God and His glory.  In reading this I can see how God set Even up from the moment of his birth to become a very special messenger of His existence, His true and unconditional love for us, and all done in a scientific way!  Atheists should read this with an open mind and face the truth...GOD IS FOR REAL!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book will keep you guessing and leave you thinking and in most cases it will also make you appreciate your spouse more.  Can't say a lot more without spoiling the fun.  It's a wild ride.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love YouVersion the best I have seen so far.  I have heard lectures about the meaning of words and how we receive them.  This app made it so much easier to go between the difference bibles and compare verses.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Every song on this album is just amazing! Their sound is something that I have been waiting to hear and their lyrics actually have meaning to them. I truly believe that if you like any other group from Fueled By Ramen then you should give them a serious listen. You will not be disappointed.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Eastwood's another great movie. No cowboy-ISH stuff. He plays a role of an emotional old man and its about a tender father-daughter relationship.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was so entertaining!  I read it during a stressful holiday and it was the bright spot of the season for me.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family to watch together.  My grandkids loved it even more & have watched it many times
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As a ANYTHING Horror fanatic, I adore this show. Worth the watch.  Give it a try you won't regret it.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|I would rate this collection as first choice, above those of Roge from Decca and Hough from Hyperion. The reason being mainly Roge set is not naturally balanced and Hough is rushed at times. Collard set is musically very satisfying and excellently recorded with plenty of details. At the price an outstanding bargain.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I loved this movie!  It gives you hope, love, problems being solved and other life lessons for all ages. I bought this for my collection for my great neice but I couldn't wait to watch it my self.  I was disappointed to learned she already had enjoyed the movie.  I have all the Tinkerbell movies and enjoy them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the series....only complaint was the streaming, it could have been better quality, but overall I am satisfied with the purchase
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was amazing so much better than the movie! Absolutely loved it I can't wait to finish reading all of The Hunger<br />Games books.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is a great game - addicting and really impressive. I just have one quibble, which is that when you do manage to stump the genie, a text box appears to search for the character, but there's no Search button, so after you type the name, there's nothing you can do but quit the game. I love the app, but I hope this bug gets fixed soon!
B004I744AS|4.0|I failed to look inside my Kindle Fire or I would have found that there are two Oxford Dictionaries so I deleted this program.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|If you like Denzel Washington then you will love this movie.  Denzel is one of hollywoods best male actors.  He brings a quality to every part he plays.  Must see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book<br />I like it all<br />I love your books please write more books<br />I love the hunger games books
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book is the third in the series and probably the easiest read of the triliogy. It is really hard to put down.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This program is essential if you plan on using documents, photos, spreadsheets etc. on your Kindle Fire device. I would also consider an upgrade to the pro version of Office Pro instead of the watered down version supplied by Kindle Fire.
B002PHVAQY|5.0|Vox makes a whole series of these small portable amps.  The work very well.  I love the portablilty particularly when traveling.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like that I can keep listening to my favorite radio station even after I have moved 600 miles away!
0062127241|5.0|Both my sons loved the book as they are both Townsend and Who fans. The book was purchased hard copy and kindle.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great program for all the documents, spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations you will need with your Kindle Fire device. I was a little &#34;miffed&#34; that you are then required to purchase additional fonts at almost the cost of this program.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|This is a good version of the VOX portable amp.  I own most of them and change them out for different kinds of playing.  This is good all around version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first two books were very well written. This one never fell short of that. When a book can actually make the reader feel emotions of the character....that is always a good thing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Some People believe Everyone should Read the Bible, I believe Everyone should Read this Book, Believe Me when I say it will change the way You Look and Feel about Your Dog, Please Read this Book and have Everyone You know Read it. I Promise it will be the Best Book You have ever Read.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is great if you need to access your desktop from anywhere. It does what it says.. Set up was a breeze.
B0081L391C|1.0|It was terrible. I  was so offended by the crude language. I thought it was going to be comedy not something raunchy.<br />What a waste of money.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|**May contain spoilers**<br /><br />I would give Season 1 of this show more stars since it was more plausible.  Both Seasons, however, had me twisting in angst - and I liked it.  I detest waiting for next week or next season.  But Season 1 of Homeland sucked me in.  Only the audience and CIA agent Carrie Matheson (Claire Danes) know that returned POW Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is a closet terrorist.  He shot and killed his friend without batting an eyelash, wore a C4 vest to kill the vice president of the U.S. (only to back out) and began an affair with Carrie.  The audience does not know if Carrie is really in love with Brody or just trying to gather more information.  As Carrie frantically attempts to derail Brody's terrorist quest, Brody takes out a restraining order on her and warns her to leave him alone.  She cannot and appeals to Brody's daughter to call her father on his cell phone just as he is trying to get the C4 vest to work in an underground bunker.  For her efforts, poor Carrie is arrested and hospitalized.  Defeated and with nobody believing her, Carrie is booted out of the CIA and checks herself in as a patient for her bipolar disorder where she undergoes shock therapy and loses some of her memory including the name of terrorist Abu Nasir's (Navid Negahban) son that Brody had shouted out one night in his sleep.<br /><br />In Season 2, Brody is now a Senator and is planning to run for Vice President.  Carrie is teaching English classes and living with her stable but bipolar father.  The CIA needs her expertise to try to turn a former female contact overseas to capture terrorist Abu Nasir.  Just at the last second Nasir receives a text message warning him of the trap.  Carrie returns to the U.S. and continues to work on the Nasir case (unofficially) and an older recording of Brody explaining his bomb vest attack on the Vice President is discovered in some items that Carrie steals from a contact of Nasir.  Carrie's mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), lets her know what was found and a new CIA agent Quinn (Rupert Friend) works with her in a surveillance sting on Brody.  Finally, Carrie is vindicated but not reinstated to her former job due to her bipolar disorder.  She confronts Brody, he is tortured and agrees to help the CIA.  For some unknown reason, Carrie resumes the affair with Brody.  The season ends with a bang with Carrie wondering if Brody was just manipulating her the entire time.<br /><br />There are many more plot twists, characters, and nefarious deeds than I have mentioned, and although the premise is not as plausible as some other shows of this genre, it is, after all, entertainment that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Recommend!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I cannot change the time zone to where I need it set.  I tried multiple times.  I'm in Ohio and it is set for three hours behind our time.  It's more like California time zone.  It is pitiful.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Was the best of the three and had to buy it before my friend could give me the paper version.
B00000I3JO|5.0|For those who have not discovered the Blue Nile in the USA, the sound is amazing and because they wait years between releases there is rarely a dud track.
B002KV4NTQ|4.0|One of the two best studio albums they made (the other being Beggars Banquet).  Must have for any Stones fan.
6305922756|5.0|Got the it was good very nice good movie very funny my wife like to quote it a lot she like nigel
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I have read all of Grisham so I was drawn to his teen novels too.  They are a great intro for kids into the legal profession with an interesting story line.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Extra nice, large read out. I think it will come in handy doing taxes etc. Cant wait for tax time now .. lol
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lot's of fun!!  Don't like the fact you have to actually buy bingo credits.  I will most likely stop playing when I run out of them.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty decent challenging game. some are too easy and some are too hard. also the game prices keep rising and you don't earn as many tokens.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This is one of our favorite christmas movies.The cast is great... It is a must for anyone's DVD/ blue ray library
1594744769|5.0|This book was recommended to me by friends.  I am actually only 1/2 way though it, but I am enjoying it.
B005P4P966|5.0|Highly recommend watching this TV series if you are looking for a lot of laughs.  Really a very good series.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I love this movie, always have.  Robin Williams brings so much happiness to those in war.  Also fighting for everyone to know the truth.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this book! It was such a revelation for me and my husband. We both read the book and found out that we do have very different love languages. This is why that we were starting to struggle as a couple, because he was showing me love in a way that made him felt loved -but not me. I was also doing the same thing. So we were both wrong. This showed us that we needed to express what made us feel loved and that way we could change our focus. He now knows how to show me love, and I know how to show him love. It has been a HUGE help. Now I am reading \\"The One Year Love Language Minute Devotional\\" By Gary Chapman. It is really great! It breaks down a day to day devotion to help improve your relationship while teaching you what God has told us about marriage. LOVE LOVE LOVE both of these books!
B007REV4YI|2.0|The James Bond franchise has once again proved itself to be a tired and cliched one. This edition proves it in spades. One of the few things that has been interesting in James bond flicks, action-wise, are the lengthy opening sequences. With \\"You Only Live twice\\" (1967) we had the astronaut-space-walk scene. With \\"Moonraker\\" (1979) we had the freefall-from-small-plane sequence. With \\"Golden Eye\\" (1995) we had the bungee-jump-off-damn sequence. With \\"Skyfall\\" (2012) we have the suited-man-on-motorcycle-on-rooftop sequence. And  Etc etc. And that's the best part, visually. Not bad but still Yawn.<br /><br />Incidentally, RoverGuy Ben and Jason Scott Whetzel gave reviews (one star) that say a lot here...<br /><br />As for story, this edition doesn't really have one to be worthy of an adventure. Pissed-off Javier Bardem wants to off M (a pale and boring Judi Dench) while a nostalgic Daniel Craig wants to save her ass. It doesn't work. This 'resurrection' of Bond never will. All of the characters look like death warmed over. Performances are wooden and repetitious. Add to this the other constant grating fact of so many James Bond films: bad sound editing. Is it only me or is it just inept soundtracks: Bond films are great on dramatic musical affects but horrendously bad on dialogue presentation. I strain to hear the over-done Brit accents which are strangely whispered or mumbled to the enormous chagrin of our ears, only to be bombarded with loud bursts of action-sound bites. Is it too much to ask that producers of these flicks might pay attention to character conversations and actually let us hear what is being said? Do we need our eardrums inflamed by highly overdone soundtracks in those action sequences? But I suppose it doesn't matter. James bond the character is as shallow as they come these days.<br /><br />BORE-iinnnggg.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Highly recommend watching this TV series if you are looking for a lot of laughs.  Really a very good series.
B005K17RU0|4.0|No problems using on Kindle Fire.  Nice looking weather app with all the basic features of one.  Only 4 of 5 because of all the permissions.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Great Movie, I love all the Marvel Movie that have been made into movie's, but Ghost Rider is simply the best.
0765325950|5.0|I thought this was a great ending. I can't imagine improving it. I was still surprised by some to things that happened. And was enthralled in the book the entire time.
B001AG52AG|4.0|Thought this was a cute movie!  On the HD version for my Kindle Fire 8.9\\" the polar bears really come alive!  Found the story line to be intriguing...had never seen one where people have little demons that shapeshift to protect them.  Very interesting!  Would definitely recommend this film!  =)
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The book was not an easy read, not only because of the subject matter, but in the way it was presented.  I know it was written by an untrained person, but it was very sad what she went through and not very well edited.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album has so many different sounds.  I have been listening to it everyday and I can't stop. One of the few albums that I have ever owned that I can listen to it from beginning to end without skipping a song to get to another one. Great job!!! I really love this album. Highly Recommened
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has been one of my favorite writers since I read &#34;The Forgotten Garden.&#34;  &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; exceeded all my expectations and is now my favorite book from Ms. Morton.  The characters are rich and believable and the plot line (over several generations, as is her style) kept me hooked.  I read the entire book in one weekend - I just couldn't put it down.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who loves to read and has discriminating taste about their book choices.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|My first Vonnegut. What a great writer. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a book with good old fashioned quality sarcasm.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like using Facebook to communicate with several friends at the same time.  I also like being able to share pictures and good/bad news quickly using this site.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used evernote for so many things since I got it. It works for capturing ideas when you're out and about, and it's perfect for organizing your thoughts. definitely a must have.
B00005JPS8|5.0|We found this DVD combo set for our daughter and bought it for her Christmas, along with 3 other DVD sets.<br />They all arrived in prefect shape and prefect timing.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The story of the courage of Marcus' team is inspiring. He tells you in a way that makes you feel like you are right there with him and his team. Great story of patriotism and will make you appreciate what the armed forces do for this country.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I liked this app very much.  It was very helpful on my smart phone.  Try it, I think you'll like it..
B000KJT8IG|3.0|The movie had too many curse words it had a PG 13 rating but it should have been rated R
B003YL4KS0|4.0|I love the book and my hair has never looked better, but the e-book formatting did not work on my computer. The videos would not run.
B006N57PXG|5.0|This is my second time reading this book and it was just as enjoyable as ever.  As an avid library user, I rarely ever buy books, so it's saying a lot that I couldn't resist getting this one. It's full of wit, action, and surprise twists.  The characters are deep and more realistic than most of us would like to admit, and I find this a rare and fascinating quality.  I highly recommend this book.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This site allows you to stay in touch with old collegues, get in touch with posible employers and keep your skills on your Resume updated.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's name says it all. Angry Birds. Great game to stay occupied while on the road or waiting around .
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Its good movie I like it. Its actors are also good and fight also I like Captain America also. i
B004HD61KE|3.0|Just finished this book.  I didn't enjoy the book as much as following book or the previous book.  The story line was not as strong but it was still a good read.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This movie was definately well made and very informative.  I learned a lot from this movies that I never knew regarding this incident.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas.  When I received it, I had to carefully remove the sticker from the paper cover.  Sticker was a rental company sticker.
B00112GVFO|2.0|Sahara as written by Clive Cussler is a great book.  This movie just had the title, the jist of the plot for his book and the names of the characters he uses.  The action is non stop which does make it an \\"edge of the seat\\" film, and the interaction between Al and Dirk is good, but the acting is terrible otherwise.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a light-hearted easy fun read.  Predictable in parts and not overly compelling but a fun and very entertaining romantic comedy.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I loved the movie and love the soundtrack even more.  Already have recommended it to my friends and they also love it.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|The sleeve is too small for the Kindle Fire, other than the tight fit it's a nice sleeve. My old Kindle fits just fine.
0446580848|5.0|Loved this book ! I always look forward to his new books and can not wait to get the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I started reading this book because of all of the five star ratings.. I laughed, I teared up several times, and I was even mad for  a good part of the book. Any book that can make me feel ALL of those emotions is pretty fantastic.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|This was an excellent remake of an older movie.  I remember going to see the original and this one is just as good if not better. Colin Farrell does a GREAT job in this movie!
B000063UR2|4.0|My girlfriend favorits and she could not find legend in any stores in are area that we live. I got for a Christmas gift.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I streamed this movie recently and forgot just how much I love it! Any lovers of the Brat Pack will love this movie (a true classic from the 1980s).
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|This movie was a &#34;B&#34; movie all the way.  No comparison to the first one.  Would not recomend to go to the theater or rent.  It did have some action but it wasn't enough to put up with the overall bad acting.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Young, confused, grieving and trying to escape a series of bad decisions including divorce and heroin use, this woman is frank, funny, and - by the end - fearless!  A great read and an inspiring adventure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Superb very entertaining and intriguing. Keeps reader totally engrossed very hard to put the book down and not just keep reading.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|A must have to play at your tea party! Original 1951 version that we'll keep for many grand kids and adults to enjoy. Good quality and sent in a timely manner.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love love LOVE this movie. I don't watch scary movies cause I'm a wimp, but this one was as funny as it was mildly scary. Twinkies and Bill Murray remind me of Ghostbusters, which is one of my fave movies of all time. Good buy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game.  Have had it about two weeks.  It is an easy to play and relaxing game with choices  provided.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Probably the best book of any in the Halo series. Written very well and offers a great back story on the origin of the Spartans
B003I55BIA|5.0|one of my favorite books. It's really awesome. Need twelve more words for this review to send... Oh, now three
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome story. Was real hard to put down once you started reading. Can't wait for the movie to come out
B001BR7CZW|4.0|This film is still hysterical after all these years. It is super clean as far as sexual content and violence. There are NO scantily clad women, no &#34;bedroom&#34; scenes, One of the main characters does kiss a former girlfriend one time, and one character asks a woman to meet him at a motel (but they do not get together). There is no violence in the sense of person on person, there are more car crashes than any other movie I can recall.<br />The one downside is the cussing. The &#34;F&#34; word is used repeatedly. God's name is also used at times. Just a warning in case it matters to you.<br />If it had been made without the crazy cussing, I would have given it five stars.
0452289963|2.0|Recommended to me by a counselor, but I never got past the first chapter.  Writing was too dense and impenetrable for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is what I've been talking about!<br /><br />I just got a kindle and I've discovered that because I can sample books I'm willing to try something new which for me happened to be Science Fiction. YET, what I found in this quite honestly amazingly deep and rich story had me shouting in the bathtub and tearing up for the connections the author had created between my universal truths and people living in a cylinder in the ground. I don't remember the last time I couldn't wait for a sequel or next story but I now found myself in th  position of waiting for it. Mr. Howey this book was worth ten times what I paid for it. I'm a teacher and a lover of literature and I am not exaggerating when I say that I've enjoyed this read as much as any other I can remember in a Lon long time. Well done sir. I hope your accreditation comes soon and I'll be happy to know I found your tremendous story of the dreams of the humble souls in the silo before it saw the accolades I suspect it will soon. I UTTERLY recommend this book FOR LOVERS OF ANY GENRE.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This is a really incredible collection of CD's. Bought it for my husband and he hasn't stopped playing the disc's since he got them.
B004E5GG50|4.0|Acting superb and casting good. A few historical distortions. Sometimes had trouble finding my way back to where I left off.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've seen IJ from theater, VHS, cable, HDTV and finally BR, and this is the best currently for home viewers.  The texture within images, sets, and costumes come alive on BR, its the sharpest and clearest video I've seen for the whole series, even compared to HDTV.  The sound is equally improved, superb imaging and clarity, even the musical scores are crisp clear and boom into my room with 5.1 surround, and the dialog doesn't get washed out by the music or sound effects.  To compare IJ before remastering, see the trailers on the disks: blurry, washout out and muted.<br /><br />Packaging is not best for storing disks; disk are inserted on the side like old LP records, disk are more likely to fall out once the box is removed from the sleave.  The package is full of Photoshopped graphics, I'd prefer screenshots of the best of each video.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I got this simply because of Angels and Demons and Davinci Code... While it is not as entertaining as those, this book is still a page-turner. Well written but a little campy at times. And to enjoy it, you should put aside the fact that this could never happen in a million years...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of the best books on this subject I've read yet.  I highly recommend anyone, regardless of religious or spiritual views, to read this.
0307346617|5.0|I have to say I didn't know what to expect with this novel. The whole interview format and personal accounts kind of put me off, but from the first page I was pleased at the cohesion and readability of the book. It's quite interesting and engaging.<br /><br />I think Brooks could have done a better job at character development. There was some, for example he visited and re-visited some of the &#34;interviewees&#34; multiple times, which gave some perspective to the story, but I guess he was kind of held back by the interview format. I was very pleased at how much emotion and inner-monologue type information came through, despite the rigid format of the storytelling.<br /><br />Overall I was engrossed, and would definitely be interested in reading more detailed, specific stories of survivors. It's such a birds-eye view that it never gets dull, but I particularly enjoy the one-perspective type novels where you can really get into a character's head. I suppose with this kind of debut, Brooks is totally free to develop the franchise.
0141341416|3.0|I am Not thrilled with this set.  It looked cheap.  Wish I would have bought the hardcover set at another store.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|App works fine don't find it real accurate. It gives a pretty good idea of upcoming weather trends and is easy to use.
B009POCFTG|4.0|I'll start with a disclaimer that, YES, the movie is extreme in a lot of ways. If you are offended by profanity, nudity, and the challenging of morals OR, you simply wanted to watch McConaughey smile his way through a typical male-lead role, then this isn't for you. This movie IS for audiences who want to see the darker and more desperate side of humanity. Most of the characters are not good people and you probably wont sympathize with them but this story is about characters rather then relation to the audience. This is the kind of movie that dares the viewer to go outside their comfort zone and experience terrible things at least from the comfort of your couch. McConaughey goes out on the ledge and delivers an ambitious performance as \\"Killer Joe\\", a terrible guy, but he's probably one of the most interesting characters you'll see on screen recently. I'm not sure what some of these disappointed people were expecting from watching the trailers but nothing about this movie said it was going to be a \\"light-hearted, comedy with happy, relatable characters\\". And you might as well ignore the complaints about the budget being $10 million. This isn't an action movie with CG and car crashes to pay for so who needs $50 million? These actors joined this movie (and in some cases, took a pay cut) in order be a part of a very different movie with interesting (yet disturbing) characters. Nothing about this movie indicates \\"low budget\\".
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Plays perfectly on the original Kindle Fire. Flow Free is fun and addicting at every stage. Always room for more challenges and quick play.
0061478784|5.0|In the ongoing battle over which is better: the book or the movie, I'm usually on the book side. However, Howl's Moving Castle is a special case: the book is fantastic and so is the movie--but they are almost completely different stories.<br /><br />The setup is the same: The main character, 18-year-old, Sophie is the eldest of three sisters so she knows according to the fairy tale rules of her world she won't be having any adventures. But after she runs afoul of the Witch of the Waste who casts a spell on her to make her old, Sophie decides he might as well strike out to find her fortune anyway. Along the way she finds a strange castle with four doors that open on different worlds, a fire demon, and the mysterious, vain, tantrum throwing, wizard Howl.<br /><br />But that's where the similarity ends. The movie by Hayao Miyazaki is very much focused on war with Sophie discovering Howl playing a role in an ongoing, very destructive battles among countries. (If you haven't discovered the great animator/storyteller Miyazaki yet, do yourself a favor and rent his movies, all of them. My personal favorites are Spirited Away, Ponyo, and of course, Howl.)<br /><br />I came at this backwards and saw the movie first. I loved it and thought the book would be even better as books usually are. But it is hard to compare the two because the book focuses more on a personal level. Sophie discovers her true nature, and Howl's, through the curse that is laid on her. The plot is incredibly complex with a lot of mysteries that Jones deftly ties up into a fabulous ending that left me smiling for days.<br /><br />So should you see the movie or read the book? My answer is: both in whichever order you want. Read it. See it. You'll thank me later.<br />(This review can also be found on my blog: YA Fantastic Book Review)
B0086700CM|3.0|I had fun just passing the time with this app. But when it got going really fast it would have glitches. It would slow down and cause me to die. It would not let me jump sometimes and it would sometimes just pause for no reason. It will stop should that( at least it did for me)when I deleted the app and got it back. But you lose all your data.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever! Better than Harry Potter.If you love mythology this is the book to read. Never ending stars.Great for kids like me.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Anything with Noah Wylie has to be good. DVDs arrived quickly and in new condition. I will be ordering season two soon.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This is a series that just keeps getting better each season! There's never a boring moment in the show, and I found myself laughing so hard, I cried!
0743270754|5.0|If you know someone who loves history, then get this book as a present. I love these non-fiction books that read as prose. I do have to  mention that it focuses more on the politics of Lincoln's life more so than anything else. If you're looking for insight into Civil War strategy, look somewhere else.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Love the latest Harry Bosch story.  Enjoyed the drama and intrigue.  Good and solid reading which I would strongly recommend for anyone loving suspense fiction.
140053271X|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my grand daughter and she is very pleased with it. I bought this because it seemed very easy for a 9 year old to use
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|This documentary was informative, as it was a more personal look into George's life, but still left some mystic about him.  I believe that he was an exceptional spiritual person whom had very complex personalities that also made him more human to the average person.  He had a gift no doubt and touched many with it.  He trained himself to prepare for the end and I am sure he is happier now then he ever was in this lifetime.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The last few Stephen King books I've read have been good but a little disappointing either in the ending or other areas (Duma Key, Under the Dome).  11/22/63 was perfection all the way through.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I recently purchased a new Kindle as my previous one was several years old and images were beginning to bleed into the screen.  The write-up said this cable didn't come with the new Kindle w/keyboard, so I ordered this.  As it turned out, a cable WAS included and I didn't need this one at all, but kept it anyway.
B000ZOW96Y|5.0|Nice followup movie to the previous two Oceans movies. Always a good plot and the movie flows very well. I would watch again!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Mysteries are my husband's favorite and he especially like John Grisham novels. He found this one to be another excellent read and kept his interest until the last page!<br />~Dee Madore~
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My husband couldn't be happier! Great book to spice up the bedroom or any other room for that matter. Loved it!
0375869026|5.0|My daughter LOVED this book!! She couldn't put it down!  She was reading this with her class and she couldn't wait for us to receive it so she could pass the class!
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Great old movie. Love how all of the characters interact with each other and the surprising outcome of the lives!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a disappointment.  I really don't know how it ended up on the bestseller's list.  It  was kind of interesting at certain points, but the ending was a bomb!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|OH my God I love this app it is so mysterious it's amazing I love it it's worth the price can't wait for the sequel
0316228532|2.0|I couldn't get through it, it was so dull and had so many characters that made little or no impression on me enough to remmeber them. Very disappointing.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|nothing more than a rip-off of the jason bourne movies. it was not a good movie. junk, junk & not good junk
B008F9E306|5.0|love the ti album.it was a great price for new release and i got it in like three days after released
B00884GR0W|3.0|I think this app should have a creative mode that has unlimited blocks and every block. Other than that this game is okay.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I liked it until I got to a part where<br />I had to enter a date into the computer<br />to unlock it. What date? I could never<br />figure out what they were asking, and<br />I couldn't skip it, or wasn't given anything<br />to go by, so I stopped playing.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Liam Neeson is often overlooked, other than &#34;Schindler's List&#34;.  He is excellent to watch in just about anything.  This movie is a tense thriller.  We didn't know a lot about it when we got it but it now is on our &#34;favorites&#34; list.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Since it is not clear in the item description, I would like to inform potential buyers that this turntable is not compatible with Mac computers. After setting it up and it did not work with my Macbook Pro I could not find anything in manual concerning use with Mac. I contacted Sony and support representative took some time himself to find out that the turntable is not compatible with Mac. I am returning product without using it with any other devices and cannot review it further.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|The play is different from the actual card game and there are no rules to direct you.  I was puzzled by the hands exchanging -- didn't know what that was all about.  Disappointing.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Clarity and sound is good and the overall movie quality is good too. Doesn't stop as some videos do to buffer.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|THIS NOVEL NOVEL IS FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS. There are symbols represented throughout the book Tom makes a transformation that you would never expect.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I got this for my 27 year old son, who enjoys challenging puzzles, for Christmas.  He was impressed and intrigued with it's complexity and found it to be a great challenge.  It was never left idle for the entire day.  Someone was always trying to work it out.  I, myself, find it very frustrating; but I am not a fan of complex puzzles.  Our family is all adults and it was a hit, however, I feel that children would really enjoy it too...if they don't frustrate easily!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As the third in the sequel it was interesting to tie up all the loose ends. Well written.  Not what I would call a happy ending and kind of put a pall on the whole series for me.  It went from a sci-fi/futuristic themed book to kind of a downer at the end.
B0050G3NWG|1.0|After two returns I give up. Defective discs. Quick replacement to but none of them work. Check yours out right away and save your packaging you may need it
140053271X|5.0|My grandaughter loves it, she is 11 and loves to read I believed is the best gift you can give a child.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|LOVE IT, READ ALL OF THEM.  GREAT STORIES.  EASY TO BE PULLED IN.  GOT HOOK AND NEVER PUT IT DOWN.  SAD BECAUSE LIKE ALL GREAT THINGS, IT MUST COME TO AN END.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's access to Twitter. No more, and no less. I like it. It does what it is meant to do.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Her best book since The Other Boleyn Girl, maybe even better.  I could not put it down and would read it again!
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  This show about &#34;zombies&#34; is about so much more.  It does get a little slow during season 2 but it makes up for that in the second half of the season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST STORY'S I HAVE EVER READ.  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE.  AWESOME. AWESOME.
B006LSZECO|4.0|My expectations for this book were quite high, based on critics' reviews and those of my friends.  The book hasn't disappointed, and I hate for it to end!  Wonderfully written, edge-of-seat stuff.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|A nice sprinkling of \\"not too distant\\" futuristic special effects but relays more on developing the plot which has a great back to the future twist to it and the characters are very interesting and believable. I'll watch it again!
B007IK44CK|5.0|The mission impossible movies continue to be some of my favorite films due to their james bond quality action and set pieces,<br />but like MI:3,  Ghost protocol takes it a step further and really pushes the multi faceted nature of it's characters.  Like all great films the film is really about the people in it....these people just happen to be secret agents trying to save the world:)<br />Brad Bird really rocks this story, and leaves you panting trying to catch your breath.  Kudos to Cruise on taking a chance with this brilliant animation director.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS YET, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.  ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS OF OUR TIME.  PERFECT.
0307730697|5.0|I don't write too many of these reviews but this book is awesome.  What a great true story!!  It's amazing what Adam (and his family) went through.  The book is well written and a must read!  I enjoyed the heck out of this book and you will too.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is great for fine motor skills,  and eye and hand coordination.  My daughter and I love this game.<br />she is 8yrs. and can beat me.  fun game
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I had no problems installing this game. Yes later in the game you pay an additional 99 cents but I thought it was well worth it. The graphics are great and its a nice long game.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I HOPE HE WRITES SOME MORE STORIES ABOUT THEO, I HAVE MY SON READING THESE NOW, GREAT AND EASY READS.  LOVE IT
1449415881|5.0|Dilbert Rules!!!<br />Scott Adams rules.<br />Makes my miserable day (in my cubicle) go by faster with a funny comic every day.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I paid for and downloaded this app over a month ago and I haven't been able to open it on my nexus 7. PLUS I do not see where to access support to help me with this. I'm not that particularly tech saavy but I do know how to follow directions and there are none that I can find.<br />The way I got to this page was that I was trying once more to register and use my documents to go. I decided to leave a review since I was already here.<br />If anyone else out there is having a similar experience please chime in here and maybe we'll get an app that works.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is such an addictive game.  I have tried so many other Majong apps but have found this #1.  I am watching for a second one to come out.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Movie arrived in perfect condition and is a great new addition to our family movies that we watch on a weekly basis.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app widens the arena for reading electronic media for the kindle.  The restriction of reading only on a Kindle device is removed and can be read on a phone or tablet.  And...it works!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fantastic.  It's totally worth the price.  Just be warned you will end up paying more during the game to finish it. But it's worth it.
0547564651|5.0|Parents, teachers, principals, school administrators, politicians should read this book.  There are probably others that should read it, too: pastors, school cafeteria workers, camp counselors, kids...<br /><br />I recommend it for practical reasons in raising children and long-term reasons for saving democracy.<br /><br />It is well researched, has interesting examples, and a good read, as well.
0553386794|5.0|Easy to read. The names were many and confusing getting everyone strait and remembering who is who. But I read all 800 pages in about a week. And am buying the second book now.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Simply was unable to put this book down! I recommend this book for anyone wanting a captivating read! A true page turner!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very easy to use and convienient application. One I will use on a daily basis. The full screen view is easy on the eyes and fingers.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I liked it up until it broke the Alfred Hitchcockian style. Overall good but a tad drawn out at times pleasurable travel read.
1416550550|4.0|It tells the story of 3 women and how they are connected over generations.  Loved the writing style...once I got past the first 3 chapters it was a work of art. Captivating.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is awesome. It's my favorite free photo editing app. It's really easy to use and there's lots of cool editing options to try.
B004IE0NY2|4.0|A 1995 classic by now! Must see now. After watching Dredd. &#34;I am the law!&#34; Excellent video/audio quality, choose the HD version
1594135851|5.0|Wonderful book!  The cover is different than the one shown, but I just wanted the content which I got unabridged
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it awesome book! Great writer and story! Can't wait to read next one! Couldn't get enough of it  read it in less then 3 days
B00009RDGA|5.0|A true Hollywood classic! Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are fun to watch and are a perfect pair. As well as Madeline Kahn for supporting actress. She brings her fine assets to the big screen. Great fun and a timeless classic.
B0068MNNOE|5.0|Putting aside whether or how true the story might be, it's a very good telling. Period accuracy seems very high and the cast performed very well. I didn't buy into the batch of manuscripts surviving the fire, but I went along with most of the rest of the story. It is well done and I gladly watched more than once and likely will yet again.
159413586X|5.0|Love this book!  It has a different cover than the one shown, but that didn't matter to me.  It came on time and in great condition.
0679805273|5.0|Wonderful, imaginative, and inspiring children's book. The book appeals to both the child side of me, and the adult side. Read this book three to four times a week, and I guarantee, you'll over come anything!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  There is some pretty dark history here, but the author did a great job of telling the story without being too graphic, or insensitive.  There were times when I literally laughed out loud, and other times when tears were falling.  This book made me feel the full range of every emotion I have and I loved it.  When I first started reading it I thought I was the wrong demographic.  For sure it had to be written for young teenage girls, but as I got into it, that feeling went away, and I was truly engrossed in the story and the characters.  Great read.  Couldn't put it down.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|The premis is so contrived you either have to accept it or there's nothing. I accepted it enough to get to the end only to wonder just why and what. It's not a bad thing to be left that way. I'm merely warning that this is not a regular story, but just what it is I'm not sure.
0545425115|5.0|Comes exactly as it looks in the photo.  The only reason it's movie tie in is because of the different cover though in case that bothers anyone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a great show. My boyfriend loves it.  i bought this for him as a gift.  The story is good and if you like british shows this one is definitely worth it.  it feels authentic and the actors are top notch.  the clothing and set and everything in this has a great attention to detail and you feel like you are stepping back in time with an old aristocratic family
B0054JZC6E|3.0|hoping the games get more fun the more I unlock.  that seems to be the facts.  the more I unlock the morrow challenging they become.  I cannot wait to unlock them all
0439813786|3.0|I'm not keen on this book no do I hate it. I wanted to look a little more at the story and its development. This does that, but the basis is limited to the film and not much more. In that sense it's limited.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I read my first Vince Flynn book (Protect and Defend) in the spring of 2012. Since then I have read all but Kill Shot. I love this series. I read this book in 3 days. It is a fast paced, shot em-up, kill the bad guy adventure. I love the characters as they evolve (so to speak)throughout the series. Mitch Rapp is the type of guy well all at some point in our lives wanted to be like. The Last Man was a good book, but it lack something I'm having a hard time trying to fiqure out. It just didn't have that \\"hmmpp\\" like most if his books. That being said, you cannot beat the CIA/Terrorist/Spy genre offerings by Vince Flynn. This is the fist book I reviewed on the series. Most of the others I would give a solid 4+ stars.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|My wife loves this DVD. Great purchase if you like Bon jovi all the classic songs that we grew up with.
B009YQJ322|5.0|The only word to describe this movie is awesome!! Karl Urban captures Dredd's personality perfectly. The FX are amazing, I've watched it so much since I've gotten it.
B003AQBYUG|4.0|Here you have all the Alien stories in one box. The first still holds up quite well. I doubt the series is something I'll watch over and over, but it's nice to have around for times a little of that sort of diversion is needed.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Working product, listed and described accurately. A great product for all Nikon users, professionals and amatuers alike. Highly recomended to those interested or involved in photography.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story should be a Hugo candidate.  I was unable to put the story down after the first page.  The author is able to present science and engineering  as fundamental to surviving in an alien regime.
1589949811|1.0|This is one of the card games I hate the most. It's more like a puzzle game, you simply figure out the best possible deck for each scenario and hope for the best. because whereas you have no random things to help you out, the enemies have random shadow effeects that devastate your \\"heroes\\" (which are no more powerful than allies). I'm all for hard games, like ghost stories and demon's souls, but this game (unlike the ones i mentioned) IS NOT BALANCED. Don't waste your time on this game
B005LAIHYU|5.0|loved it so much when i first watch the movie the first time i rented it  so i have to go buy it
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it cuz it's like a computer in my hands on the go when ever. It's great for the kids to learn games. I dislike the fact that there's not books for the kids for free
B00933JL0A|5.0|So many reasons why I LOVE this game where should I start?<br />1. No energy to use and then wait for it recharge<br />2. There is a currency you can buy with real money but you DON'T NEED TO!!!!<br />3. Play as long as you are entertained<br />4. Not trying to build some massive town that you constantly have to buy land expansions for<br />5. Finish the quest line and move on to a different town<br /><br />This game is very different than the &quot;other&quot; build a town games. In this game you have scenarios and each scenario has a different quest line. You follow the quests and build/grow/make what is asked and when you complete all the quests for that scenario you can either keep playing or start a different scenario. Several different scenarios to choose from so it doesn't get old to quickly. There is an &quot;in-game currency&quot;  that makes buildings instant but you don't really need it because as long as you have all the materials to build it they don't take long at all. There is no &quot;energy&quot; pool you use so you can play as long as you like.<br /><br />There is a paid version of this game which I think has more scenarios but this one is a great way to try out the game first (I will be buying the premium). The only other thing the premium one has different is there is an ad banner in the free one but it is small and out of the way and there aren't any pop up ads. If you are really annoyed by the ad banner you can use your &quot;premium&quot; currency to turn it off. You make plenty of it during the game so you should have enough to do so (haven't tried because it doesn't bother me).
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The Innocent was a typical Baldacci book, It keeps you wanting to continue to read to find the many questions of the plot.  I like the new character, it fits to mold of the other Baldacci characters.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|wanted to see this i haven seen this show in for ever and a day im a big fan of this show
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|It was a fairly good book. It was very long though it took me a whole week to read it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book by Nicholas sparks suppose to have a sequel to this love story or movie!
B008DKBQMK|5.0|Loved it but returned it as was wanting something that opened out like a book and had a compartment for my stylus
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daughter got this CD for Christmas from Santa Clause and she loves it.  She dances to it everyday and when her from friends come over, they all go crazy.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|This app gives you a start at some exercises but you must purchased the other app for a more detailed workout.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I finished this book within less than a week. One of the reasons I like it so much is because I get to learn more about what happened with JFK and the details I never really looked into before. I don't care much for the romance in the book but it doesn't mean it's not great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|some people have mods downloaded in thier game I want to download the herobrine mod but I don't know how
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|What I like about this book is everything<br />Mostly recommend it for all middle school<br />People having trouble finding someone
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a wonderful book . This book will leave you moved.  Just goes to show that you should believe in fate.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|This fan is incredible.  It is so quiet.  I used this fan to replace the 40mm fan that shipped with my Samsung SDE-4001 DVR.  I wanted to keep this thing in an adjacent room to my bedroom but the stock fan is so noisy that I could hear it in the next room!  The Samsung reviews are riddled with complaints about the fan noise but this fan is a direct replacement and completely solves the problem.  The connector that matches up to the board inside the DVR is even included with this fan!  I used the optional rubber bushings to mount the fan instead of the standards screws.<br />I cannot hear this fan unless I put my head down next to it.  Even then, I think I am only hearing the sound of the air that it is moving!  The difference is so drastic that I took video of the before and after and plan to post it to the Samsung forums so people understand that there is an inexpensive fix for this otherwise excellent DVR system.<br />I would recommend this fan for any 40mm application given all the connectors that are included.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I loved this game but it has chrashed twice now.  The second time is more frustrating than the first time.  If you are one of the unlucky ones who game dies around level 25 be prepared to never finish this game.  Fix the game if you want to make any money.  I wouldnt recommend even though I want to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this book, I had seen the first Hunger Games at the theater and tried to wait patiently for the others to follow in route but, I decided to read the book and I'm so glad I did. It was like seeing every chapter up on the screen full of vibrant colors and special effects. I can't wait to start on the 3rd book.
044024367X|1.0|This long,boring and meaningless book has wasted my precious Sunday.<br />I regret not checking the review before  started reading it.<br />NEVER AGAIN!!!
B000E41MRC|5.0|I think living in Germany during this period was like being lured into a trap.The process was slow and maticulous. I'm not sure if  this could  happen again. I don't think German people thought it it could happen until it was to late.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of the best that Sparks has written.  I could not put it down. This was more than just a typical love story.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I liked the action in this book.  Just as entertaining as the first in the series but with more action.  And a conclusion to some of the threads introduced through first books.  Fun.
B008602KQI|1.0|The premise for this movie is disgusting, especially in light of recent tragedies in this country.  Why must good writers and good actors choose the ugliest and most violent themes for &#34;entertainment&#34; ?  Even though we all know evil exists in the world, must we focus the eyes of our precious youth on such ideas? I bought this for someone else, and I will not be giving it to her.  I will probably put it in the trash where it belongs...
1939416019|4.0|i enjoyed reading this adventure and am waiting anxiously for the next installment.  Although Thor went through a quick evolution from poor shepherd to gifted almost-wizard it is understood that he still has much to learn.  Even as an adult i enjoy reading this author and encourage others to not over complicate a nice story.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was really very disappointed in this case.  It was clearly NOT a LifeProof case.  Plastic on the screen was wavy and pixelated, the plastic was cheap, and the &#34;Lifeproof&#34; case did not fit my daughter's phone in a custom way.  I bought this case for her as a Christmas gift, and by January 10th, the plastci cracked and broke.  I returned it to Amazon and got my daughter a REAL Lifeproof case from their website.  I am a little disappointed that Amazon would allow counterfeit items to be sold on their website.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was great and my daughter loved getting all of the series in one case. It was a perfect Xmas gift for the Harry Potter fan!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved it. I couldn't put it down once I started. Make sure your calander is clear for the day because once you start you wont want to stop. Other reviews give more depth so I'll be brief with mine. The characters on this book become this out of body emotional roller coaster. You feel like you know them personally with each page you turn.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree is as best as I can describe it a cross between Pink Floyd, The Outfield and Metallica. I know, it may be too deep for some folks, and that is OK; music is an acquired taste. Porcupine Tree is tasty! If you listen to a song and think you don't like it, give it a few seconds because chances are it will morph into something completely different before it ends. OK, I'll go ahead and say it, if your IQ is under 120 don't buy this album, just go download some Bieber or whatever you lemming friends are posting about on FB..., whatever you do don't dare to be different.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|The game was ok, but it was very short. The graphics were great. Not much of an HO game. Had to use the hint through out the game, since you did not know what direction to go in or what you needed to look for.
0765325950|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever read. Sanderson incorperated even the bit players from all the other books.  He killed of equal amounts of good and evil characters.  Very fitting end to the saga.  He left it open to the imagination how the Seachan captured one the the forsaken and that could make Aviendha's vision come true.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was more enjoyable than Fifty Shades of Gray for me.  The characters were more mature and likable, and I found Gideon Cross to be far more interesting than Christian Gray.  While many feel that this is a copycat of Fifty, I enjoyed the Day's writing, descriptions, and prose much better than E.L. James.  I could see the similarities between this book and Fifty, but at least Eva was not \\"biting her lip,\\" and listening to her inner goddess on her chaise lounge.  The supporting characters were much better and more flushed out than in Fifty.  I loved Cary.  He was messed up, but still cared for Eva and she did the same for him. I have read Reflected in You, and I am left hanging until the last book comes out.  I cannot wait!<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have started to read other Sylvia Day books.  I have throughouly enjoyed being introduced to a new author.  I will continue to read whatever she releases.  I am a huge fan!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book pulls you into the romance that is growing as if it were your own. It's a quick read with a fair amount of sexual scenes to keep the reader hooked.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is pretty good so far.  Nice graphics  interesting story line  hints fot those that need them<br />  most will
B003YFIUW8|5.0|My 19 yr. old son randomly picked up Room paperback at the airport while waiting for his flight. He needed something to read when he got to reception for the US ARMY. As soon as he was able to call me, about a week later he told me &#34;Mom you have got to read this book!&#34; So I found it in the kindle store, took me a weekend to read. I've never read anything by Emma Donoghue. I think I will try and read another one of her books :)
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is the first book that I've read by this author, coming across his name as he's responsible for finishing the Wheel of Time series. First off, this book has a great and interesting premise, of someone being able to manipulate objects by rewriting their past. The story is very well told, with the introduction to the world, and magic, being built up throughout the book and not overwhelming the reader at the start.<br /><br />My only complaint? I read the book in a few hours. I would've liked it to last longer, but I will still look forward to other books that continue this story line (or concept).
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It definitely wasn't all I expected it to be but still plan to read the other 2 books in the series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's a show about a life that I'm very intested in. I love to read or watch different life styles, especially of this time period.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought this trilogy because I loved all three movies and wished to own them. This product is even better than I thought it would be. The movies came in a cool box. Great gift idea
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I burn firewood and a couple of these are very handy in the right spot.  The light is a little bluish, but you get used to it.
0312330537|5.0|The best book nobody ever heard of.  I thought descriptions of Mumbai slums and underworld were terrific reading. Recommend for anyone who likes to read for pleasure and better under standing of the world in which we live.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Grabbed my attention and held it throughout. A different slant to much of this genre. Looking forward to more episodes.
0062073494|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express: By Agatha Christie<br /><br />\\"Not now. Not now. When it's all over. When its behind us -- then --\\"  This quote is essentially the spark that lit the long, winding fuse leading to the explosive labeled, \\"AHA!\\"  The person who spoke these intriguing words was Miss Debenham.  Hercule Poirot, the main detective in charge of the whole investigation of Rachett's murder, overheard this being said.  He started to wonder.  This is my favorite line out of the whole book mainly for its meaning and spark.  After this was said I automatically knew someone was going to die, hence \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\".  I also knew that the two people talking, Miss Debenham and Colonel Arduthnot, were close and may later turn out to be accomplices.  In the book it says that Poirot heard this and started to wonder. This says that Poirot is very observant and pays attention to small details and what they could mean.  One thing I really liked about this book was how there were three parts. Part one was essentially the story, that is, everything before the murder and the reactions of the people after. Every chapter in part two was an interview between Poirot and one of the passengers from the Calais coach.  Part two is when Poirot gathered the bulk of the information he needed to narrow down the murderer/murderers.  In part three, all of the pieces were beginning to fall into place and in the end Poirot found out who it was. Or so he thinks. I won't spoil it for you.  Another thing I really liked about this book was when you read this book, you don't only read it from one perspective, you get to see what happened from many different perspectives, some more reliable than others.  But reliable or not, it still makes the book a lot more interesting.  A third thing that made this book very fun to read was that is wasn't that difficult of a read, it was easy to understand and the writing flowed very easily.  There was one tiny, unnoticeable downside to this book. Well, I wouldn't even call it a downside.  At least half of the book is dialogue so it can get pretty confusing if you get distracted.  This is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I really enjoyed reading this book and following along with Poirot's train of thought while he was investigating.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and enjoys mystery.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This Reacher book bordered upon being boring with any true plotlines and characters being clouded by excessive detail and dwelling upon the trivial and unimportant.<br /><br />Eventually the story was pulled together after a flight through excessive time and space, which flight was cloudy and did little to develop the story or characters.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Highly recommend this movie.  The kids were singing along with the movie.  We rented movie, but will probably buy it as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing it had me on the edge if my seat in every chapter . I didn't even realize it was the end til I saw the words \\"the end\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app gets the most burn on our Kindle Fire. My kids have numerous activities so we always end up sitting around waiting. my son loves to play while he waits for his Taekwondo class to start. The games are easy enough that you have fin and challenging enough that you don't beat them all the first try.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Who wouldn't love a serial killer who takes out the bad guys.  I've loved this show from the beginning and still do.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game highly addictive i will be introducing this game to my grandchildren as a learning tool very creative
0345803507|5.0|This was the kicker ! ! Oh i soooo hope that there is another part to this bc l have to have it
B00005JPD0|4.0|I liked the movie enough to want the DVD copy rather than my recorded VHS copy, eventhough the tape recorded copy of the movie from an HD channel was quite comparable, just doesn't have the reliable life expectancy of a DVD. Same old story which lasts longer tape or DVD-CD
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander provides as close to scientific proof as we are ever likely to get of Heaven and of a beautiful afterlife filled with light and love.  This book is especially helpful for anyone who has just lost a loved one.  Their spirit lives on!
B002OFWG7E|4.0|I bought this item for a gift, do not listen to the Foo Fighters but the recipient seemed happy with the CD
0345803493|5.0|this book was so erotic and it keeps you guessing and wanting to read more.  I'm ready for the next one
B004DM0UII|5.0|awesome.!  abundance of variety radio choices...the settings<br />are well created for this type of app and user friendly.<br />don't miss out on this wonderful addition to your device!
B004SDEP38|1.0|Every button I press tells me I need to buy the full version. What am I missing? As someone well versed in technology this app defeats me totally and isn't worth a single star. I feel cheated.
B0086700CM|5.0|Kids love it - keeps them busy on the kindle.  Downloaded very quickly and have had not technical problems whatsoever.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Pros:<br />1. This processor is really fast and OC's well. I was able to OC it to 4.3Ghz with temp reaching to high 50's on full load. Even without OC, the turbo boost will keep at 3.8ghz under load.<br />2. It is a Ivy Bridge processor which means you can take advantage of PCI Express 3.0.<br />3. Temps are moderate.  It is definitly cooler than Sandy Bridge due to the 22nm manufacturing process.<br /><br />Overall a great processor.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Price is a little on the high side for this as you get a i7-3770k for less than $300 at reputed merchants if you search.<br />2. Stock fan that comes with the chip is garbage.  I got an after market cooler to keep the temps down.
B004CFBMRY|4.0|This is really a delightful book about running which encourages all of us to get off our buts and do what comes naturally (or does it?).  The story line is great and I specifically enjoyed the way current facts and theories about running are connected with thoughout the story.
0810993139|5.0|Okay, We all have seen the movies, but to read the book is another thing. I brought this book because my 8-year old doesn't like to read, but kept asking for this book. So I brought and now he wants to read the book each night we read a page. This is a great book.
B00AQ4U6P4|3.0|Saw a nice buildup trailer for this and thought \\"I gotta see this\\". First need to know information for anyone who hasn't seen it is that it doesn't give much on the horror side. Maybe a little suspense or mystery, but not horror. I went in looking for horror that never happened. The story is kinda given away early on or maybe even in the trailers. The only thing that helps the movie (and why I still give 3 stars) is because there's a decent twist (or twists) in the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was awesome. I look forward to the next one. Sylvia Day has a way<br />of keeping you riveted to the story anticipating what happens next to Gideon and Eva.
1400069289|5.0|Wow...inspirational reading at it's best. Now I know why it's so hard to kick all those bad habits I have! This book gave me enough information about habits to be able to identify some I didn't even know I had.  I feel as if After reading this book I am armed with enough knowledge about habits, and how they are created and changed, to actually work on changing my own.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It was a great concept for a movie, but the direction and ending were just ok for me.  I think with a bit more effort and character developement, it could have been a great movie!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This is a great addition to my DVD collection - I love the Sherlock Holmes' movies, including the old ones with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.
B00AG4NSY0|4.0|Beautiful songs and it's fun to recognize the voices of the cast members. I didn't give it a 5 star only because it never occurred to me that listening to Christmas music after Christmas is silly so I don't want to listen to it when it's not Christmas. Would have picked a year round selection of songs if I'd given it more thought. But will always love this during the holidays.
B007M45PMU|3.0|Some really nice tunes on this CD.  But some of them sound pretty much the same.  Enjoyed listening to the whole album twice, picked out my faves...and probably won't go back to the CD again.  I wish this band a lot of luck, but hopefully their next album will have a bit more to offer.
034580404X|5.0|I had heard my friends talk about this book set and couldn't imagine how it could be so addictive.  Since I've read it (all 3 books in a week) I have been sharing it with my family and friends and we can't stop talking about it!
B00005N6KG|5.0|In the ear headphones have never really worked for me, I guess I just have weird shaped ears, but these things are perfect. Good sound quality and they're very comfortable. The only downside is that they make a little indentation in my hair, but I don't really care about that.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not nearly as exciting as the others.  Not much hand to hand combat.  Very subdued.  Still good, but nothing like the others.
1419705849|5.0|Eight year old loves this book series.  Great for challenging my eight year old.  He has collected all of these books.  I sit and read them to him and he reads with me.  Recommend to any boy
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. I like all mahjong games though. The timed games really force you to act quickly, I have a hard time getting a 3 star rating in the game. I think if it's completed in under 5 minutes you receive the 3 stars. I keep practicing though.
1423140591|5.0|I found this book to be very exciting, I own all of the Rick Riordon books. I just can get enough of them. He is a great author, and I love the way he tells the stories.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|To me, this is a good teen novel!  But not an adult one...  The plot is a bit predictable and a little on the unbelievable side (you will know what i'm talking about if you read it).
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Don't expect amazing dialogue and character development. In fact some of the plot reminded me of the comedy \\"Mystery Men\\"...only they weren't trying to be funny. Still, this is super-heroes smashing things up and beating up bad guys and they did it well. 4 stars for being exactly what I expected it to be.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A must read!! So heart warming, I would recommend to anyone! Nicholas Sparks really knows how to pull the heart strings!!
B000E6EHGI|5.0|I arent good at telling reviews but whatever, I read other reviews, anyway the music that never stops, franklin tower, etc.<br /><br />I'm 33, and in the past I used too think the band was like heavy metal because of its name an skulls on cover of albums, before I even knew what were all about, until at early 2000s, I saw this ikes wee wee episode on south park jimboe says to mr mackey why dont you go to some grateful dead concert? That episode where he done drugs an got fired from showing kids the smell of pot. An his saying was Drugs are bad MMMM KAY.<br /><br />A little about my history, I discover this band a couple of years ago by searching em on youtube, they are great s***, I saw truckin song, casey jones, which is a real song, not a made up cartoon character name on TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.<br /><br />I arent good at reviews but I always wanted too hear an know what this band was all about ever sense I saw one episode on south park comedy central.<br /><br />I grew up listening too lots of JAZZ music, smooth jazz and fusion. Like Return to forever, Chick corea and Jean Luc Ponty, etc.<br /><br />Most of dead songs sounds a little jazzy an country, blues etc. in it thats part of the reason I like it soo muhc, I used too HATE country music but not anymore sense I started listening to this band, this isnt 100% country but some of it does comes close like some songs on american beuty album.<br /><br />I just arent a huge fan of girls singing on country music like Kelly Clarkson, because its sounds too girly for me, the music.<br /><br />And if you love the dead, then check out other country rock, jam bands too like PHISH, STRING CHEESE INCIDENT, WIDE SPREAD PANIC, UMPHREYS McGEEE, etc.<br /><br />Besides southern rock like these bands.<br /><br />I am also a fan of FRANK ZAPPA music too, partly because my father liked zappa an I grew up hearing zappa music like dinah moe humm.<br /><br />I search on internet and unfortunately Zappa never cared for GratefulDead, and there's some thing like a discussoin like whos better playing the guitar? Frank Zappa or Jerry Garcia?<br /><br />But screw it, anyway some one did said too me that I'm too young to like Grateful Dead, but who cares..<br /><br />Most of todays music is lame anyway like rap, hip hop and rnb.
B00851M38S|5.0|I just loved Shadow of the Wind and this is just as good!  I'm a huge fan of his work!  The way he writes his novels his different than american novelists.  Love the book, love the author!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|More twists and turns to the Pendergast saga I will be looking forward to the next book with these new character additions.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|This is a good period piece, well written, great acting, excellent actors.  Recommend to anyone!  Scarlet Johannson acting is good at the beginning of her career.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Bitter / Sweet ... Potato chips for the brain. Once you start reading it's hard to put down. Has a dark edge to it but otherwise enjoyed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hadn't read a suspense novel this good in along time!  Took a couple of chapters to get into it but once your hooked...  You have to get to the end!!!
B00656C6KK|5.0|I Love this CD.  My favorite songs on it are number 4 and number 11.  Doris Day's son sings number 11 and he had a great voice.  Doris and her son had allot of talent.  I always thought Doris had a special voice and to this day I enjoy listening to her music.  Wow what a marvelous voice she had.  Her voice is so soothing.  I would recommend this CD to any one who loved Doris Day like I do.  It will warm your heart listening to her music.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a great series with excellent script, beautiful photography, absolute great acting by all, hugh cast of stars and a classic collectors item.  I like the Original UK Version because it doesn't have the PBS edits taken out so it includes all scenes.  I would recommend this series to anyone that loves period movies.  The Brit's really did a great job in cast selecton, scene selection, costume design, etc.  I would give this a definite SEVEN STARS OUT OF FIVE!!
B002DOSBMK|4.0|\\"Homeland\\" is the first in the \\"Dark Elf Trilogy\\", and the first in a long series featuring the dark elf warrior named Drizzt Do-Urden.<br /><br />The opening book paints a seedy picture of the underground city of the Dark Elves known as Menzoberranzan - the society where Drizzt is born, and grows to become an extremely talented young warrior.  While gifted with weapons, Drizzt is a failure from a Dark Elf viewpoint because he doesn't embrace the dark teachings of his family, school, and deity.  Instead, he struggles deeply with his place in society and the corrupt structure that authorizes and encourages deception, great sacrifice at all costs to improve one's standing as an individual and family, and downright cruelty.<br /><br />If you like your heroes to fall on the \\"good\\" side, then you will likely enjoy this fast-paced adventure where you meet amazing creatures and enter into exciting battles.  If you like more of an evil character, or one that is more flawed in his ambitions, then Drizzt may be a bit too \\"good\\" for your choices.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book because you grow up with Drizzt and see the experiences that shape his unique character.  The author also includes several short sections that provide a philosophical view on Drizzt's motivations, which I thought make for a strong example and reminder for younger readers.<br /><br />The book is filled with some cruel scenes of abuse and lots of fighting, but the book is clean from a profanity/sex standpoint if you are concerned about young adult readers.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the books and buying the set all at one time made it very easy to go to one book to the next.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|would have loved to use this but no matter what direction you hold the kindle the camera is always upside down :( which is way too annoying to keep on my kindle.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book had me holding my breath to see what might happen next to the courageous players on both sides of these savage combat descriptions.  It illustrated in the most dramatic way that in the midst of brutality and carnage there also existed love, kindness and mutual respect that would be passed down to the next generation.
B0052GACNM|4.0|My husband loves the jazzy sounds of Tony Bennett and the duets are a nice mix. He liked him so much that he forgot he already had the disc...
B001PO53IO|5.0|This series is very underrated. It is one of the best installments of Star Wars. I only wish I had bought it for myself instead of as a Christmas gift.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|great movie, actually pretty scary alot better than todays &#34;horrors&#34;<br /> I cant wait for the remake, it actually looks promising
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i have read this book sso many times i almost know it word for word but i have to say that some scenes needed a little more brain power like the tree scene why wouldnt they burn it down but still the book is an over all work of complete awesomeness i would reccomend it for kids older than 12 because some scenes are a little intense on violence. it makes a great book to just sit and read for fun
B005Q1W10A|4.0|When I bought the first series DVDs I had no idea the production was so gripping.  Ordering the second series was a &#34;no brainer&#34;.  I was impressed with the story, the production, the costumes, the intrique.  My eighty years gives me the opportunity to judge the authenticity of the story.  Being Canadian also helps to understand the British .  Can't wait for the series three DVDs to arrive!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I love all movies starring Russell Crowe, I love adventureous Movies,always love Robin Hood. Great story have watch it several times since I purchase it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Here we go with a great mix of the passed angry birds. Its a combination of all the angry birds put together to make great a game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is the second book in the series so it was expected to be better and it delivers it might of had more story before the games than wanted but it is reccomended to an audience older than 12 because some scence can be a ittle to much for younger audiences and scary but this book is perfect for just sitting by the fire and reading on a snowy day
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Mis-casted. Especially for some of the women, but overall clean and fun. Bane's voice was weak, and the audio on the amazon copy is mixed horribly for viewing on Xbox on stereo television.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I have been a Trek lover since my Dad had me watching as a kid... Wanted to be an astronaut ever since. This movie was fantastic! Although it did not fit the Star Trek style as I have come to know and love, it was none the less a great and epic storyline... and highly entertaining. I put off seeing it because of all the hype surrounding it... as a true space show aficionado I was unsure about how it would or could translate to the big screen even though there have been many Trek movies we all know this one was different. And different was GREAT! Kudos JJ Abrams!
B004SDEP38|5.0|It can not get any better then this, its like a mini Microsoft office in the palm of your hands.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|L love the YouVersion Bible because it has so many versions and it is very easy to switch from version to version
B008DKBQMK|5.0|My kindle fire fits perfectly. The sleeve is very well made. Fabric is very pretty and of good quality. Love it!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Very good. Different. Would like to view other books by R. Joyce.  This book revealed a whole different view (to me) of the English people, whom I didn't think I especially liked....now, I do!!
B001O0KS66|5.0|I know they've been around for awhile, but I'm glad I just now discovered them. Really looking forward to seeing them live. they have a firm grasp on the \\" full range\\" of the American language.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show seems to break all the rules and yet I, a mother of two and teacher, can't stop watching this show! The characters evolve and de-evolve and they kill off people you come to like and yet I is so well made that you say ok... I gotta watch the next episode!<br /><br />A good show to start! My husband says the graphic novels are even more brutal!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The story has a plot though. The love story is really mushy and instantaneous for me, that is the twilightesque part.  Diana, the protagonist, is portrayed as strong but is still a damsel in distress.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting it down though. It is a different way to look into the witches and vampires and demon craze.  Worth reading for an easy read for the beach or lunch break.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Love it! Just wish it was packaged a little different but that doesn't make that big of a difference! Worth the price for sure!!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Awesome book. The ending sucked but good thing I don't have to wait for the release of the next one
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The beginning of the book was rather slow, had to force myself to continue.  It became a lot more interesting when it got into Pi's adventure.  Would like to see how the movie was done.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great book love the ending<br />I can't wait to read the rest of the series these books are full of suspense.....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was so much fun and the graphics were wonderful. It also had a fun story line. I would suggest setting it on hard when you start. It makes it much for fun and the game will last longer for you.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie does not disappoint! I wasn't sure about it, when I saw the previews, but it was very entertaining!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I missed &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; when it began, but Amazon has given me the opportunity to catch up.  You can buy either video or have on your digital video.  Really like the series.
0739368044|5.0|This 4 book set is one of the great fantasy stories told I would recommend this story to everyone WHO LIKES WIZARDS, WARRIORS, ELVES ,DRAGONS, ETC
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch this series, if you enjoy a post apocalyptic setting, the zombie aspect is just icing.  It's not done in a cheesy way, full of drama, thrills, twists and turns.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely stunning. My favorite. I've read it twice now , and it still is as amazing as before. I recommend to everyone.
1608871452|5.0|I bought this based on the 5 star reviews and I am SO glad I listened!  This is the ULTIMATE book for fans....it is utterly amazing!  Visually as well as the attention to detail.  You will most assuredly not be disappointed!!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've owned this since the day Cataclysm for World of Warcraft released some years ago now.<br /><br />I'll give you a few details about me. I'm female, I have tiny kid hands (my nails are so small that they have to custom fit fake nails if I want to wear them and my thumbnail is the size of a normal adults middle finger or pointer nail). So that being said, they're pretty small. I can easily reach all buttons on this device with the exception of the macro-changing keys themselves, they take a bit of an extra reach.<br /><br />People have been complaining that this device is too large but I question whether they really gave it much of a chance. I'll admit, it takes some serious getting used to. It took me about a week in total. Several years have gone by now since I purchased it and I can't imagine playing with a regular keyboard anymore.<br /><br />The controller comes with 22 numbered G-Keys, a joystick with 4 programmable buttons (and 1 if you click the joystick in) and two more buttons near the joystick itself. The software is also incredibly easy to use.<br /><br />I figure I'll give you my general game setup, in case you decide to try this sucker out, because maybe some people are trying to use the default setup and I find it to be very impossible with MMO's.<br /><br />G1=\\"ESC\\", G2=\\"TAB\\", G8=\\"CTRL\\", G9=\\"ALT\\", G15=\\"Shift\\"<br />G3=\\"1\\", G4=\\"2\\", G5=\\"3\\", G10=\\"4\\", G11=\\"\\"5, G12=\\"6\\", G16=\\"7\\", G17=\\"8\\", G18=\\"9\\", G20=\\"-\\", G21=\\"0\\", G22=\\"=\\"<br />G6=Character Menu (\\"C\\"), G7=Skills (\\"P\\") (\\"Shift G7\\"=Pets/Mounts), G13=Achievements (\\"Y\\"), G14=Friends List (\\"O\\") (\\"Shift G14\\" = Guild List), G19=Quest Journal (\\"L\\")<br />Joystick is traditional \\"W\\", \\"S\\", \\"A\\", \\"D\\"<br />Left Button (Near Joystick)=Map (\\"M\\")<br />Bottom Button (Near Joystick)=Inventory (\\"B\\")<br /><br />So that there is my general setup for all games, mainly World of Warcraft. It allows me to use all my skills with their modifiers, easily. The joystick is pivotal in moving and this far in, I couldn't imagine living without it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great gamepad, I recommend this one highly.<br /><br />The only con is that they don't make it for lefties. My husband is highly distraught by this.thout it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great gamepad, I recommend this one highly.<br /><br />The only con is that they don't make it for lefties.

1450400957|5.0|We don't see a need to go to a gym or hire a trainer--we can't really afford them and don't see the need since are egos don't need that much pumping up. But after buying books that (I hoped) would explain why they recommend certain exercises, and certain numbers of sets and reps, I just really got to the point that no one thought I had enough intelligence to understand what I was trying to do, and how to do it.<br /><br />(My hobby-sport is long-distance running and racing, and I finally learned via a running magazine that by not doing upper body weight trainig, I was literally eating up my muscles. So what i wanted to do was to maintain the strong body I had developed as a lad in New Mexico and Far West Texas, and in the Marine Corps. I'm now 68, and it's even harder.)<br /><br />Bam! I lucked out and got one of Mr. Delavier's books at the local library (&#34;Strength Training Anatomy&#34;) that for the first time showed me EXACTLY what muscles I was working and how and why to do the exercises. This was a year-long revolution for me.<br /><br />Then, I got his &#34;Strength Training Anatomy Workout&#34; at the local library, and immediately realized that I would have to buy that too--it compliments the first book, with more good exercises and insights as to what to do and how to do it. Now, both are full of notes and tabs and such.<br /><br />There are no indexes, which would help. Otherwise, these books are THE &#34;how-to&#34; manuals for revolutionary new, effective weight training. I am so grateful.

B009ZQC7MY|1.0|We saw Downton Abbey Season 3 [HD] Episode One on PBS (american version) a week ago.  So when we saw this Downton Abbey  Season 3 [HD] episode 2 [EU version]  available on Amazon Prime we thought  it would be worth it to pay $3 to see it early.  What a surprise and waste of money.  We had already seen it.  It was  the last part of the american version episode one.<br /><br />Don't waste your money  on the Amazon version.  Watch it only on PBS.  They have the FULL episodes free and you don't get the &#34;half&#34; episodes you get on Amazon.  The  equivalent of the PBS version on Amazon would  cost you $6 on  prime since you would have to  purchase two full Amazon versions to equal one PBS version.  Rip Off and disappointing.
B0013F1D02|3.0|This movie is pure fantasy. There is absolutely no reason for the pirate captain (Bob De Niro) to be a homosexual. This is inserted into the storyline without adding any value or point. It pushes the militant homosexual agenda upon an (intended) young audience. However, the storyline is a true fairytale. This fun movie has everything—love, romance, pirates, witches, sword-fighting, and ghosts. It’s a hoot. I just get tired of homosexual “statements” being made in various forms of media.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I love this movie. I ordered this for my friend for Christmas, it came quickly and she loves it (how can you not). It's a great Christmas movie to add to the classics.

I was a little disappointed to see that a few of the songs on their other cd were also on this cd, but they are worth it. These guys are fun and their music is soothing.  We will be using The Piano Guys for our wedding music.

0380730405|4.0|This was required reading for a feminine gothic class and I loved it! The story is timeless and relevant in any century. The language isn't like it would be in a Jane Austen novel, so that makes it easy to read and understand. The writing and plot is scandalous. I would encourage any woman or young woman to read this novel over the swill (that shall remain nameless) that is being published now.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|pretty fun game. I know that thete is a strategy to it, I do wish there were instructions on them.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|While the acting is good, and the storyline somewhat follows the fairy tale, this is a dark version of the fairytale  that was way too long.
B00006LPER|4.0|This is a good film, probably even a great film.  Isabelle Hupert's performance is rivetting.<br /><br />Great cinema is about effective story-telling.  It is not a question of feeding the viewer feel-good candy-floss, however much Hollywood may consider it otherwise.<br /><br />In that sense, this film probably is great cinema.<br /><br />It has a very strong, difficult, script, about an artist on the edge of madness.<br />It has good direction.<br />It has good camera work.<br />It has outstanding acting in both of the principal roles, and in most of the supporting roles.<br />There is an undeniable quality in the film.  It is easy to see why it won three of the four main prizes at Cannes.<br /><br />Nonetheless, is is a profoundly uncomfortable film to watch.

0765325950|5.0|I have been a fan of the Wheel of Time series since the mid 90's and eagerly awaited each new release. It is incredible to see this series end on such a high note. If you are a fan of the Wheel of Time, the conclusion is satisfying, surprising, and a fitting end to the series.

0345803485|4.0|I borrowed all 3 of the books from a friend, many people that I knew worked these up to be sooo good.  When I started reading the first one I will have to admit I was a little bored at first.  I almost was going to give up on it, I need a book to catch my attention from the beginning and it wasn't doing it for me. But I needed to see what the fuss was all about so I kept reading.  While I did want to read more to find out what happened with Anastasia and Christian I think that it was talked up to be so much more than what it was.  While some things were kinda hott some were also distrubing.  I gave it a 4 because it did make me want to finish it just to know what was going to happen with these two.

B00ARAO720|4.0|Is this a 'smart' movie?  No.  It's clever at times, but I doubt you're going to tax any brain cells.  However, this is an extremely 'fun' movie.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Brick, Inception, Looper, or The Dark Knight Rises, you might be disappointed.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from GI Joe, you might be pleasantly surprised. Really, this movie is a PG-13 Crank mixed with a contemporary Gleaming the Cube for urban cyclists. If that description sounds like something you'd want to watch, I think you'll have a good time with this movie.  If that just sounds terrible to you, you're a boring person who needs to loosen up and have some fun.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character development in this movie begins and ends with &#34;I like to ride a bicycle fast and recklessly.&#34; Some movies would try to tack on more levels of character development here, but Premium Rush only gives a quick nod to the fact that he has a life beyond his bike.  But he is extremely charming while riding said bike. Michael Shannon is the perfect dirty cop.  Again, you don't need much character development here, he's channeling every dirty cop you've seen in another movie. And he's the perfect actor for it; he just has that creepy vibe you might recognize from his time on Boardwalk Empire, it's like the off-putting delivery of Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints mixed with the poor impulse control of Gary Oldman in Leon/The Professional.  And there's some other people who like to ride bikes, or give people on bikes stuff, or chase people on bikes.  Really, the only other person you'll likely remember after the movie is over is Aasif Mandvi AKA that guy from The Daily Show (and Jericho, remember that show?).<br /><br />This is a chase movie, with wackiness and bike culture aplenty. And a plot point that either requires a previous understanding of hawala or a willingness to just overlook the need to understand it, as the movie is moving too quickly to stop and really explain that.  If you want to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt be charming, ride a bike, and thwart Michael Shannon with his traffic predicting brain powers, this is the perfect movie for you.  If you're the kind of person who gets hung up on films needing a 'plot' and 'character development', you might want to sit this one out.  But you really should try and join us in the first group--sometimes you just need to turn off your brain to have a fun time.op and really explain that.

B008476HBM|5.0|I have read thid book at least three times before. I enjoy it each time I read it. I sympathize with Elizabeth having to deal with her silly mother and two of her sisters. This novel gives the reader insight about what it was like to be a woman in England at the time. The main focus of each young woman's life is finding a good marriage. It makes me greatful that I don't live in this time period.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I thought it was a decent movie.  The 3 year old loved it.  He kept asking where sparky was after the movie.
0765325950|4.0|I am going to assume that if you're reading these reviews, you're already familiar with the Wheel of Time series. I don't think this is something you can really pick up on book 14 and understand anything that's going on.  If you're new, go start with book one.  Once you're addicted to that, it won't be long until you work your way to this book.<br /><br />OK, so now that I'm just talking to the addicts, don't pretend like you're not going to read this book. If you're anything like me, you HAVE to read this book.  It's the ending to an addiction you've picked up some time in the last few decades.  I'm not sure why you're reading these reviews, I know you're going to pick up the book.  But I would like to prepare you for some of the flaws to come.<br /><br />Most of the important loose ends get wrapped up here.  I'm not going to spoil which ones, but that's likely not going to be your biggest worry.  If you had some favorite minor character, you might be disappointed, but the major threads all get wrapped up.  The problem is, a few of them get wrapped up in a way that feels like they're being addressed just because they NEED to be wrapped up. Character X needs to die? They likely die, or have some other horrible fate befall them. If you're lucky, it'll take a few paragraphs.  Occasionally, it'll take half a sentence to seal the final fate of a (semi-)major character. So prepare yourself for that.<br /><br />My biggest problem, which I can see others not sharing quite so much as me, is that a huge part of this book is descriptions of major battles.  This can be super cool at times, especially imagining the interaction between magic users and feudal troops. However, this part of the book just keeps going. And going. After a few hundred pages of this, I got a bit sick of reading about troop movements. Sure, the overall plot was interesting, but the military aspect can get tedious if you're not that into it.<br /><br />That said, I devoured this hefty tome (literally hefty, you could give someone a concussion with this thing) in about a day and a half. It's quick paced, well written, and while it may not have the 'perfect' endings we want, it's an impressively good ending.  I usually wait for the ebook, but this is one I couldn't wait for, and I'm not disappointed in the least.y, you could give someone a concussion with this thing) in about a day and a half.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this.  It's a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone.  And the player is...acceptable.  It plays music, and doesn't glitch up trying to do it.<br /><br />However, the more you use the player, the more you'll find it's not all you want.  You'll listen to an album, and then it'll just stop; it won't keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. You'll want to do one thing, and you'll accidentally do another.  You'll never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it's not the perfect answer.<br /><br />If you want something with tons of options and personalization, look elsewhere for your music app.  If you're looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is clever, funny, exciting, and of a quality rarely seen overall, let alone in animated releases marketed with youths in mind.  The only reason I put 4 stars is because this movie was made by Pixar, and this isn't a 5 star Pixar movie. In any other context, yes, 5 stars, no problem.  But this movie fails to reach the (extremely high) standards set by Pixar's greatest.<br /><br />Should you see this movie? Yes. It's brilliantly paced, extremely funny, and has two shining examples of strong female protagonists with both Merida and her mother. Will it make you cry like Up did? Probabally not.  Does it take risks with the format of storytelling like Wall-E did? Nope; in fact, the plot is fairly predictable for an adult, though children might be taken by some of the twists. Still, while this isn't Pixar's greatest film, it's likely better than most of the other movies you'll see from 2012, and one of the best animated ones. If you're like me, this came and went at the theaters without catching it. Now's your chance--it really is worth the rental or purchase.

B000B5OD4I|5.0|This Seiko is terrific.  I also own the SKX009.  Truthfully, I can't see ever wanting another watch.  I think the design is clean and utilitarian, and the watch works great.  Of course, it is an automatic and does have a tendency to run a little fast after a few days.  Nonetheless, it is a product I depend on and am never disappointed by.<br /><br />I wear the watch out to fancy dinners (if I ever attend them), to work, and during most other everyday functions.  I also use it during moderate fitness workouts such as tennis, skiing, hiking, and lap swimming.<br /><br />I swim laps two or three times a per week and originally purchased this watch because I like to keep track of time using the bezel function but didn't want to have to worry about swimming with a watch that wasn't my everyday.  Because of the 200m rating, there is no concern about leakage (it's much more than is really necessary).  However, during the summer I like to do some open water swimming, and this watch has been great in that capacity as well.<br /><br />I purchased the SKX009 after I accidentally cracked the crystal on the 007 doing yard work.  There is really no reason I needed to wear the 007 for such physical labor, but I did and paid the price for my error.  That said, if you're looking for a really tough knock around watch, you might be better suited to the GShock or similar line.  In my opinion, this a highly functional watch with great classic style, but it does require some care in its use.  Nonetheless, I sent the watch into Seiko, and after paying the $60 repair fee, they sent it back to me with a new bezel and new hardlex crystal.  You can't tell it was ever damaged.  Incidentally, there are a number of other private vendors who also work on these watches and can even replace the hardlex for sapphire.  I just went the standard Seiko repair route.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific watch at a great price.  Not to be worn without some care, but a great timepiece mixing form with function.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The story was well written despite the few typos which weren't so many they couldn't be overlooked.<br />Overall the story was quite pathetic. Abby says numerous times to Travis to pick his battles and not sweat the small stuff but she blows fit after fit at everything he does. She's the queen of head games. She places blame on him for all her own issues and justifies it in the name of self preservation.<br />Travis is not without his faults but he makes attempts to fix them and please Abby. Sadly, it doesn't happen and she knocks him down time after time. It gets old fast.<br />Hope the sequel is better than this and the author restores the man's dignity. Groveling men are extremely unattractive.

B0087GZ8YW|4.0|John Rebus is back.  But no longer as the maverick Detective Inspector Rebus, instead he John Rebus, civilian working with the soon to be disbanded Serious Crime Review Unit (SCRU).  Some of his workmates are planning for retirement, while Rebus himself is planning on re-joining the police force.<br /><br />The novel opens as Rebus is attending the funeral of a colleague. He's craving a cigarette (some things never change) and his boss is sending him text messages.  Back at work, he takes a `phone call, and meets Nina Hazlitt.  Nina's daughter Sally went missing from Aviemore on the A9, in 1999, and Nina believes that a number of other disappearances from other towns near the road are linked. Rebus listens: a current missing person case also has links to the same road.<br /><br />Siobhan Clarke, Rebus's former prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, is investigating the current missing person case, and the pair team up on an investigation that involves a lot of travel along the A9.  Is there really a link between the cases, and will Rebus manage to solve the case before his superior officers finally lose their patience?<br /><br />Inspector Malcolm Fox also has a part in this story: the `Complaints' is investigating Rebus, and especially his connections with `Big Ger' Cafferty:<br />`I know a cop gone bad when I see one. Rebus has spent so many years crossing the line he's managed to rub it out altogether.'<br /><br />Rebus is an isolated character in this novel: partly because of the setting and partly because of his anarchic, maverick approach to investigating the case.  Times are changing, and not always for the better.<br /><br />`John Rebus should be extinct, Clarke. Somehow the Ice Age came and went and left him still swimming around while the rest of us evolved.'<br /><br />I've not yet read all of the Rebus novels, and I've yet to read the two Fox novels.  It's a bad habit of mine: reading series out of order.  But despite this, I really enjoyed making John Rebus's acquaintance again.  He's aged, and while he may not have improved with age as the whisky he likes, he still gets results.  Do the ends always justify the means?  Hmm.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-SmithHe's aged, and while he may not have improved with age as the whisky he likes, he still gets results.  Do the ends always justify the means?

0399160450|5.0|Outstanding, gripping novel written in the usual Tom Clancy style.  Very entertaining.  Mr. Clancy never ceases to amaze me with the detailing of his writing.  Again, outstanding read.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I did not like this game at all....instructions were not very clear and the screen shot was very small.<br />Sorry!
014050446X|5.0|Toddlers cuddle closely eager to lift the flaps inside the book to learn what was read. I read this book to my son who is 23 years now, when he was a toddler.  I just had to give this as a Christmas gift to my nieces son so they can enjoy it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The package came with good material. A part of the book from behind the scenes of the three movies of Nolan.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am on the edge of my seat in suspense throughout each segment.  No pat answers.  Cannot anticipate the next surprise.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|It was shipped earlier than expected and we were able to give it to our kids for Christmas. Totally awesome!
B003BWERF8|5.0|Very east to use, pair with headphones that are bluetooth capable, works fine with all types of &#34;I:&#34; products and other bluetooth capable stuff
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|Fab movie! Even the boy made a point to tell me how much he loved it! I was singing the songs all the next day!
B00008BRBG|5.0|I knew four of the songs, but it was great to hear the whole album finally.  I love the attack, the mix, and the drive, be punk, rock, or reggae.  I'm a big Police fan, and this album def lived up to expectations.
B00003CXA2|5.0|My 9 year old son wanted this for Christmas.  Of course we all enjoyed watching this classic. Now we can watch anytime we want.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book made me realize I probably did not know my own children as well as I thought I did, and made me think about how I would have responded if this had happened in my family. A sad, heartbreaking story of friendship, love and loss. Jodi Picoult writes so the reader can feel the emotions of her characters!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Modern action movies got you down?  Ridiculous extreme-sports usage make you groan?  Imaginative Statham-sliding-around-in-grease fight scenes starting to seem stale? Sick of parkour everywhere?  Do you feel like the only non-insulting action movies are so self-serious and dramatic that they've stopped being fun to boot? Given up on finding the middle ground between Christopher Nolan and Michael Bay?<br /><br />If any of these problems seem familiar, check out Dredd: one of my favorite action movies since Starship Troopers.  It carefully walks that razor-thin line between not requiring too much thought and not insulting your intelligence--big and dumb without assuming that you are. Grab a drink, tip back the recliner, and enjoy the badassery.
0316154687|5.0|Sedaris is spot on in this collection, and his stories are laugh-out-loud funny. The light-hearted and fun essays will keep you chuckling and wanting to share it with your friends. A great purchase, that I'm proud to have on my bookshelf
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love how George R. R. Martin always keeps us guessing. The plot is completely unpredicatable yet believable at the same time. Even 4 books into this series I still find myself wanting to laugh, cry, rejoice, etc. when i finish a really awesome chapter!
B006964E8S|4.0|A good read, but I must confess I had the sense all the way along that I had read this book before. I think the character in this book is just a little too close to Jack Reacher?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this calculator because I was too lazy to get up and get the one I own.  From now on this is the one I will be using.  The buttons are easy to see and I can recheck that I've entered the correct receipt amount when I total since it appears below the total.  The total is large and easy read, no guessing if that was a 3 or an 8.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Humanity in its truest form. Raw and beautifully honest. We have all thought this way or felt this way growing up. There is a little bit of Charlie in all of us.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a awesome movie. deamworks does not disopoint. this is a great holiday movie and it's a new twist on our most beloved fantasy characters. i just loved the story and the animation was great. it was funny and had alot of heart and a good message to it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1572816112|4.0|as a gift to Mummy, a good friend. She was very happy with the material and the design. Thumbs up!
0470876417|5.0|Love the combination of process and visuals ...setting-out a framework to understand today's business models as well as to develop new ones.  A great read!
B004HD61KE|1.0|I rarely bother to write negative reviews but the sales pitch for this book was effective (and misleading) enough to make me buy the on-sale $1.99 kindle edition. Then I spent an hour I'll never get back trying to read it. By the time we got to the golden plates (not a spoiler, this happens early-on) I felt extremely deceived and didn't want to spend another moment with the characters. I only write this review to point out that the whole Thomas Jefferson angle is shameless, implausible and made me actively dislike the book and the way it was marketed.<br /><br />The only way I'll get my money's worth will be by using the experience as motivation to learn how to remove unwanted books from my kindle.
B007QPFGJW|1.0|Some readers may find the characters and locale difficult to remember because of the foreign names.  Nesbo writes well and keeps the suspense going.  The unfamilar names and locations, however, slow the reader down.  Not an easy read.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|I absolutely love Searching for Sugar Man and the album Cold Fact but the arrangements in this take away from Rodriguez' contribution. Its like its about the orchestra and not the singer. There are a few that work really well like Cause but this album is its own worse enemy. Stripped down versions would be much better. The Movie and the most recent live stuff Rodriguez has been playing is so fantastic. Deserves the Oscar.
B0087GJ8KM|3.0|After reading Drive, I admit I am disappointed.  However, there is some good stuff.  I think the biggest thing I understand is that we are all salesmen.  With that being said this book does give you some quality ideas on how to improve your trade.
B005S39YGU|2.0|I was forced to watch half of the episodes in poor quality SD. This is not fault of my internet provider as I receive around 20mbps at all times. Also, none of the other streaming services have any trouble (like Netfix and VUDU) as I receive full HD from both without any issues. There is definitely something wrong with the Amazon Instant PS3 interface.<br /><br />Aside from that, the show is great.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I hate the new format.  It is very disjointed. B ring back the original format please. I always look forward to the daily mail.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I knew very little about this book when I bought it.  It was recommended by an author whose work I really enjoy, so I downloaded it blind and took a chance.  I started reading the book and very quickly realized it was about a high school girl, so I went back and looked to see if it was a Young Adult book as I wasn't really looking for a teen angst or high school love story.  Well, I didn't see anything posted that indicated it was a YA book, so kept reading.<br /><br />The first few chapters of the book were interesting and built some back story, then suddenly the book sucked me in and went from 0-60 and I could not get enough. I started reading it on a Thursday evening, read a little bit more on Friday evening - then I woke up at 4am on Saturday morning and read the rest of the book in one sitting.  I could not put it down.  The story line is not at all what I expected - and I absolutely loved that first scene in the book, where she goes a little crazy (when you don't really know what is going on) - because when you finally get there and it all plays out, it is SO worth the journey.<br /><br />I won't lie, I sort of figured out the plot twist fairly early on - but even then, I was still excited to see what happened.  The fact that there is SO much more to the plot twist than I ever imagined just made it even better!<br /><br />I only have one real criticism -  I felt that some of the dialogue was a little unrealistic for 17/18 year olds and that the coping ability and maturity demonstrated by the main characters was a bit beyond what I could accept for pretty standard high school age students. But aside from that, I do recommend this book.  It's a good read and I look forward to checking out other books by this author.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Really caught my attention, right from the very first note.  Almost as good as &#34;Give It Up&#34;.  Bonnie Always delivers 100%.
B008N1LL42|1.0|This movie is long and boring! Did they really need an hour before anything interesting happens? This isn't exactly an epic or anything. Its suppose to be an action popcorn fest based on a board game. This movie should have been 90-100 minutes in length, not 130!!!! I was just bored, waiting for the good times to roll. Even when the movie should have ended, it just kept on going! Jump to about the 65 minute mark, and you will be good to go.
0425221806|5.0|I love this book and Lightening by Dean Koontz the most, but I've enjoyed all of his books that I've read.  Though a few of them were not subjects that I cared to read about.  I have been reading the 1 star reviews of this book, there aren't many, but they are pretty entertaining and some are hilarious.  Everybody has an opinion of course, and in mine, this is one of Koontz' best.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The plot is a little predictable and thin, but the music and dancing, combined with the adult humor make it a great movie. Not the best for watching with the kids due to language. We streamed it from Amazon- the stream wasn't the highest quality and often pixelated/stopped to buffer. We restarted the stream and the 2nd time was perfect. Not sure where the issue was, but it corrected itself.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Touch before going to watch the movie. I have to say I loved the book a bit more than the movie. I was sucked into the story and it becomes your life. Each of the six tales is gripping in its own way and one cannot help but get caught up in the emotion of the story. David Mitchell did a wonderful job on this novel. I really recommend this book no matter what type of book you enjoy reading. It has a little bit of everything.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Great movie for watching with the kids. Subtle, clean adult humor makes the movie engaging for the whole crew. Streamed it from Amazon, no issues.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|This is a awesome addition to anyones music BluRay collection.  Jason did a great job following in his dad's footsteps
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book went so beyond the typical, mediocre young adult book. It has a great story line that never ceases to surprise you even to the end. There are some awesome characters that are anything but boring. It is the kind of story that has a little bit of everything; there was romance,drama,humor...it made me laugh and made me cry-which is what all of the really good books tend to do. I highly recommend this book, and it's not just for teens(I'm twenty-two and I really enjoyed it :)
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen and found this book quite entertaining.  There were even moments when I found myself chuckling out loud. Perfect for an afternoon read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />This is nutts!!<br />C
0345479092|5.0|I found this book very helpful and it was easy to read and to learn about positive ways to take care of my baby.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This was bought for my 19 year old daughter. She loved it when she was young. Still does!! !! !!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is freaking scary the update just came out for it one awesome thing about it is you get to choose your difficulty I started off on easy and beat it and my friend suggested I should try it on medium and I died the first time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|We love this book. I'm reading it to my husband. It is great!! The series can put you in the mood real fast!
B00AERRKHA|5.0|Great book.<br />Read it all in one sitting and I'm right in the middle of my second read through.<br />I especially liked the cameos from the other characters in the Vorkosigan Universe.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Bought this movie for my mom. I guess she liked it. I watched it. I was o.k. no big deal.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is very under valued!  While not perfect, and sometimes seems to present the home crowd as super supportive, this writer keeps you totally involved, and even makes the science of survival highly interesting, a true page turner!  Would buy anything Andy Weir writes! (hint to author - write more now, please!)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game.<br /> I don't really understand why you have to write so much to leave a comment.
0679805273|5.0|I love Dr. Seuss.  So inspirational.  Will be giving to my kids upon graduation (like every other parent out there)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have not really used this on the Kindle. I love Facebook though. ! ! ! ! ! !  !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wanted something quick to read as a filler so I found this and decided to give it a try.  Found it to be really good and finished even faster!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app on both my phone and Kindle. Very straight forward Solitaire (I hate when I try to get a simple game like this and they ruin it by trying to add a bunch of fancy stuff). Ads aren't too intrusive like with other free apps.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I know this whole series started in 2009 and all but I regret never watching it right away. TVD is an amazing show. Some people would compare the show to twilight. NOT EVEN CLOSE, vampire diaries is way better than twilight (& I'm a Twihard). I watch the whole season in one day. I am hooked on vampire diaries!!!! It you want a show that will make you want to watch over and over again. It's definitely VAMPIRE DIARIES <3
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Great app for the Kindle Tablet.  I have had NO problems with this app.  Makes using the Kindle Camera and Video Fun.  Highly Recommend it to everyone.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Great for taking you mind off of any troubles when you're on a long traveling trip. I hope you all like these. Features the music from the trailer used in the new Star Trek movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun. Someone had posted that it was like farmville which it definitely is not! i found farmville boring cause it had no story it was just planting things but this has a few different kinds of games and a few different way to gain coins and when you go up levels you can gain gems. i haven't had to spend a cent on this game. if you don't want to spend actual money just be patient as you level up to be able to get things that need gems and/or allot of coins. you can get more coins not only from the shops but by finding the pony hiding under a box and clicking on trees to shake coins out. the side games require coins and/or gems to play them but you can just use coins if you want sense those are eaier to get and it levels up your ponies. it's easy and attention grabbing. great way to kill some time during your day :-) &lt;3
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched series one and two within two weeks, and I can't wait to start the third season. LOVE it!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The beginning seemed fantastical and outrageous, but the ending made everything very logical in an illlogical way.  It wasn't until the ending that I truly appreciated the care and detail the author had taken.  A very enjoyable journey with some very wonderful characters.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Well I got this album around a year ago and I decided to review it today. The first thing I'd say about this album is that it's my new favorite! some people didn't like this album so much but for me I could literally replay some songs for hours! If you like raw kick a$$ sounding techno this is where it's at. Also I didn't really like piranha but the other songs make up for it buy it used if you're not sure.
B003YCIE68|5.0|Classic movie, and shipped fast! Brand new, still wrapped. Made a great Christmas present! Had been looking for this for awhile, and I am so glad I made the purchase.
B000SGSU58|4.0|It's a real page turner.  The plot goes back and forth from good courtroom drama to tense detective work.  It was also an interesting  snap shot of L.A. post-Rodney King.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the first series I could actually read all the way through and not be able to put my kindle down. It's the best series ever. I didn't want it to end. I'm glad Katniss stayed with Peeta, they are perfect for each other!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have now reread these books for the 3 rd time. Definitely true romance novels! If you have only read them once I would definitely recommend you read them again. You will find all kinds of little details you didn't find the first time! Bring on 4,5& 6!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After loving the Hunger Games and devouring it, each book was more and more disappointing, with this one the worst out of three. I still couldn't put it down, but yet had the nagging feeling that I was wasting my time on an activity akin to playing a computer game- something entertaining but not particularly enriching.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This item was bought from a wish list.  It was received in the time that was stated and it a good quality DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I've read in so long. Hopeless is a must read, really does make you feel and plot twisted are unpredictable.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My granddaughter recently started piano,which is why my husband down loaded this. Not only does she enjoy this but her brother now wants to take paino. I think it helps children see the fun in learning to play music as well as develope a talent. Most of all it got my grandson off of the video games!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|found these to be difficult to put down/  sort of an epic set in a society not unlike that of the handmaiden's tale
B00846REIS|4.0|Keeps you interested, easy read.  Can't wait to read the second book!<br />I wonder if Eva and Gideon will live happily ever after.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|i very much enjoy all of the books in the harry hole series: he is the ultimate dark antihero detective
B005VPRFSY|4.0|was excited to receive this item for my nephew.......he was happily putting together the ENTIRE THING and towards the end - realized there were three (3) pieces MISSING!!  I was MORTIFIED and he was very upset - being a young boy of 9 - he was beyond disappointed :*(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An excellent game and lots of fun. Very addicting, casual gameplay, makes this title a fine &quot;whenever&quot; title. Easy to play, hard to put down.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I don't watch much TV because most of it stinks. I won't waste my time on it. This program sets the bar at the highest level. Homeland contains the best writing, directing, acting and plot from any TV program I've ever seen. Claire Danes masterfully portrays a woman on the edge, trying to retain her sanity, her life and her job.  Damian Lewis captures the enigma that defines Captain Brody.  Mandy Patinkin offers his usual, high-caliber performance with aplomb. The interaction and rich development of the characters, the unusual and creative plot (with more than a dose of reality) and the action provide compelling drama. Don't miss this one. I don't know yet what Season 2 holds, but I can't wait to see it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is addicting and challenging and which keeps you on your toes to beat the clock.  It is &#34;similar&#34; to bejewed by more interesting.  I'm trying to rate this game but I seem to be doing something they don't want or need something that I am not doing right so all I can say if this is accepted is it is a great game.  You can get it on your phone, too.
B001P5Q6X4|5.0|Lamb of Gods great album wrath but with a crisp golden tone on vinyl perfect to throw on the turntable and blast the foundations from under your house
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Just watch it. It's vital to learn from our past.  However, Aldous Huxleysaid -<br /><br />&#34;“That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons that history has to teach.”<br /><br />Don't be part of this cycle. Watch this, and help humankind heal itself, and help pave the way for a kinder, more humane future.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Taylor swift is not exactly in my age demographic, but I bough this simply for &#34;we will never, ever get back together&#34;, a fantastic piece of pure Pop music.<br /><br />The entire album is a worthwhile listen - some country, some folk, some acoustic and some rock n' roll.<br /><br />Nice job, Taylor!
1878424319|5.0|I was going through a rough patch at work where it seemed dog-eat-dog. This book helped put that in perspective and relax me during this process. I keep the words handy at my desk and home &#34;not to take it personal&#34;.
B00979CS50|5.0|Wow, this was a very pleasant surprise!  Great guitar riffing, good singing, good lyrics, fantastic musicianship.<br /><br />For those that like short, snappy songs - BEWARE -- all songs here are long jams.<br /><br />Reminds me of his first albums with &#34;Cinnamon Girl&#34;, &#34;Cowgirl in the Sand&#34; and &#34;Down by the River&#34;.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|My daughter is really into Hello Kitty right now and she loves this particular stuffed animal. Keep in mind the toy is palm sized so do not expect for the product to be very big.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Great album!  Not purely the blues.  Lots of soul and pop mixed with a wee bit of Hendrix heavy metal (3rd stone from the sun).<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more great music from a very promising new artist.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The case itself was overall very well made. But after only about a week, the cover for the charging port broke.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I must admit, I was disappointing.  I read very positive reviews, but I feel the album is merely OK.<br />The &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; mix here is terrible.  Too much rapping and not enough singing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The best book I've ever read!<br />I need more than 14 characters. Blah blah blah. Meow meow dogs are cool
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|This contains a lot of carols you don't hear very often<br />at Christmas, and a few that aren't technically carols.
B0019N8P2W|1.0|I purchased \\"Daria: The Complete Series\\" roughly a week ago (January 9, 2013) with an Amazon.com Gift card alongside another purchase. I was extremely excited to see it sitting in my house this Monday. However, when I unwrapped the DVD case, I opened it and found EVERY SINGLE DVD was missing and only the letter from Glenn Eichler remained. Up until now, I've been an extremely satisfied customer of Amazon.com, but now this occurs and I'm suddenly A LOT more hesitant to spend my money here at their site.
B00005M989|5.0|Got is for under five bucks and it showed up in my mail box under 7 days after I placed the order
031250926X|5.0|My niece and I read this book almost everyday. It's the same classic Brown Bear, Brown Bear story just with a sliding window.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Best show on tv. My entire family enjoys it. Spent good times with the family as we all watched together.
0440539811|5.0|Everything was and is great! This is such an awesome book.  Definitely one of my favorites ever!  Thank you very much!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This app has lots of different puzzles so you don't have to keep repeating the same few. A good challenge at a great price.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Purchased for my husband for Christmas, he is a Batman fan and has collected all movies from the first one with Michael Keaton.  Received the movie fast when ordered and in excellent condition.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Its just a good movie. Ben is good but Jeremy steels the show I think. All in all it is a good movie.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Great read! Very clever plot! Kept me guessing till near the end! Couldn't put it down !  First book purchased on amazon!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great summary of the Navy Seals, who they are and how they are trained.  They don't call them Special Forces for nothing.  Story is sad but fascinating at the same time.<br />One critique, the team made a critical mistake in this operation gone wrong.  The author makes it sound like they were down to two options, it seems to me that more were available, but he doesn't address that issue.<br />Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Writing is simplistic to the point of boring.  One more book about a young girl who can't live without her sicko obsession.  What kind of role models are we presenting to our youth?
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I love this music. I can put it on, have it in the background, work and it is good music to have in the background.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I did read the entire book and it did keep my interest but it was a little too slow and did drag on.  This book is not one of his best and I did buy it thinking it was a Grisham book and I was going on a cruise and wanted something really good to read.  It is about a attorney that gets framed and ends up in prison for a 10 yr. sentence and how he gets released after 5 yrs.<br /><br />You will have to read to find out how he is released from prison.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Have not figured out how to get out of the game.  I had no moves left and I could not close this program and try again.  More instructions for these games would be helpful.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Makes me cry and I could watch it over and over and it's just as entertaining to watch the 4th and 5th time as it is the first. Great movie.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Stupid.  Not very stimulating..Boring.  Cannot understand whay an adult would be interested in playing this game.  Will be removing it from my game list
B0076DELIG|5.0|It has been along time since I read Michael Connelly. I wish I had started with his first Harry Bosch book.<br /><br />Very well written and some twists and turns that you don't anticipate. I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />This is one I'll recommend, now to go backwards and start reading the rest of the Harry Bosch series..
B00A757EFW|2.0|It's difficult to manuipulate.  I become frustrated trying to play this game.  Will probably remove it from my list of games.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I downloaded the full version from a website called 4shared.com. It works great on my kindle fire. All you have to do is go on the website and look up survivalcraft. Click on the one that says version 1 9. I like it a lot. I hope you guys do, too. GOD Bless you and enjoy. :D
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We love watching this as a family.  While there are some inappropriate content for those under 10, that asside, we all really enjoy it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I love all three Man In Black Movies.<br />Its a lot of fun if you like sci-fi films and Will Smith.
B001GS2JJ0|1.0|This is a GREAT album, but NO EFFING WAY is it worth $433!!!!!!! I can get it for $5.00 just about anywhere else!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Great movie for all ages<br />Told a great story about finding your family<br />A joy to watch the whole story together with enjoying family togetherness in the movie
B0092SPYQG|4.0|If you like past Papa Roach albums you will definitely like this one. It has everything you would expect without being repetitive of older material.
1451695195|5.0|Great book to show you there is life carrying on<br />credible story since it comes from a doctor's point of view
0553805371|5.0|Makes it all seem simple. From one of the greatest minds of the century. Should be a textbook for physics majors and laymen alike.
0307891372|5.0|I ordered this for my husband along with the game. He says it makes the game so much better to also have the guide.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Presents an alternate view of God, but doesn't seem to prove it's point as it's lacking the equations to prove it's point. Still it makes you think about the age old question of our existance from a different point of view.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great set to add to any collection and at a great price! All three movies are amazing and bluray is the best
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|This book is a bit hard to understand at times and doesn't prove it's points with much needed additional analysis, but I could not put it down and is definitely worthy of a re-read. I recommend it to everyone who wants to explore how we biologic entities actually changes the universe we live in.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I join the others who loved \\"A Higher Call\\". I would only add that being able to read WWII books in Russian allows me to find even more excellent books on WWII (the Eastern Front materials and the German memories never translated into English). Saying that, I consider \\"A Higher Call\\" to be one of the best WWII books I ever read (I still prefer the firsthand materials) and probably the very best aviation book I've ever opened!<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
B003ES61EE|5.0|this is small and handy for anyone who needs to have a lens cleaning solution handy.  It clips on like a pen.
B003O86FMW|4.0|not just for the teenagers - older folks can really connect with the characters. Well done and engaging. Had trouble putting it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Never thought I'd find a character I loved more than Christian Grey.  But now I want a Gideon Cross.  Book was amazingly written
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Recommend to anyone who has read the first two.  If you haven't read the others - read them both first!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Once you start it is hard to put the book down. Jack Ryan as always is out front and wide awake in the hunt of a major threat.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Some good songs, some not so good songs.  Just some different music in it than what I am used to.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I am so happy that I rented this movie! I've been wanting to watch it for a while and I forgot how much I love this movie!
B008FSCNTK|3.0|It Diana;s voice, but not her material! I am not saying that it's half effort on her part, but it's sure appears that way. I am one of Diana's fan!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just when I think it cant get anymore interesting then BAM, they do it again.  Cant wait for the rest of season 8 to be released!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Have read many of his books and consider this one very good, but not quite one of his best.  I would recommend it.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|I have given this rating because of the appalling service . How can you knowing the item was being delivered to Germany block<br />the viewing of it. I either want our money back or a replacement that can be viewed properly,and i dont want you to pass the buck
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a really great read that went fast and kept me very entertained. Subject matter is a little hard at times.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this CD and have listened through it many times. Every song is a hit. Buy this CD and support Lindsey. You won't be disappointed.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is worth the $1.99. It has a variety of modes and the devs regularly add new content, so it's always fresh and fun.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Awesome CD! Buy it. I will buying more of Lana Del Rey. This is the first time I bought a CD on-line. Thanks!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Once again Johnny Depp is amazing. The movie itself is OK but his performance is great. I'm glad I waiting to watch it at home and didn't pay to go to the theater.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy, fun, romantic read. How realistic is it?  Probably not at all but the story is an enjoyable romantic read.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. No violence, just a good story about a father and daughter and their relationship. An all around good story and the acting was very good. If you like Clint Eastwood, you will like this movie.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|We love the spin on the old tale of Rapunzel and beautiful graphics. Creative story line keeps adults and kids entertained. We seem to watch it regularly whenever we're looking for a movie we already have, never gets old.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is the first book of the series and it leaves you wanting more.  Great story and I highly recommend it!
B002PMPTIO|1.0|I ordered this online version by mistake, thinking it was a DVD.  But I played it twice, and the sound quality and picture quality were so bad that I turned it off and have never played it again.  I then ordered the DVD, and the movie itself is fantastic.
B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed Sins of the Father very much.  There were a few places that were a little drawn out and could have been somewhat shortened.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|As always Chevy Chase makes us laugh. This was a replacement for a vhs copy we have had for years!
B007BT0RKG|2.0|unfortunately this app does not work well with my Kindle FireHD. It relies on wifi for location services so most of the time the app doesn't know where I am
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fabulous book from a new author! Great read couldnt put down until done! Will be reading more of this one.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Totally captivating! Addicting! Get it....Watch it in order.....Then order season 2 and 3......you will not regret this purchase! Fabulous storyline, excellent actors!
B003F5WOEC|5.0|this album sounds great, and the vinyl record adds to the depth of the sound making all of those nuances fun. Plus the Black Keys are awesome, but you knew that.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have used this app for over 2 months. I am pleased with the ability the app has to store and use several alarms.  There is a wide variety of ringtones to choose from.  I love the option to solve a math problem in order to turn the alarm off.  I like that the app is free.  The ads are not obtrusive. I hope that by writing this update review, the app will not ask for more reviews for one month.  I recommend this app highly.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is a movie that I have watched on VHS for years and then I finally just had to own it on Dvd as well.  This movie never fails to mesmerize me (and it's not just because of Brad Pitt).  It's romance, love, action, adventure, and beautiful imagery throughout the whole movie.  I promise that if you buy this movie you will watch it at least once every year if not more often!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is great.  my kids play this...they are four and two and its great trying to get new games. I love that there are so many different games,  especially with my children's short attention span.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie is just a great movie! I've read other reviews about this movie and can't believe how horrible some of the reviews are because this movie never fails to move me.  The imagery is wonderful and the soundtrack is amazing!  Yes the instant love between the two main characters does seem to lack quality but it is even admitted between the two that they don't even know each other. I just love the imagery, drama, and music in this movie and watch it at least once every 6 months.
0765325950|5.0|I began reading WoT 10 years ago. Over the past decade, I've read and reread this amazing series many times and many times have found myself getting so immersed in the books that I confused the seasons in the book for the true seasons in real life! Needless to say, I am a big fan of this series, and was quite hesitant when Robert Jordan passed away and Brandon Sanderson was supposed to finish the series. Mr. Sanderson has done a fantastic job and I am quite pleased with the ending!! This book encapsulates exactly what you should expect out of a story this enormous! If you are a WoT fan, I thoroughly recommend you purchase this and enjoy every page!
B0041CGP02|5.0|but this Jersey man's newest other favorite son. While Springsteen is, as Dylan the poet of our times, Bon Jovi certainly entertains.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I couldn't even finish this novel.  The main character is bored and boring in her boring job which is supposed to involve some outlandish espionage scheme that was never clear to me in the half of the book that I read.  I bought it because it was by Ian McEwan, but it was not his usual good work, in my opinion.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|How good is to find not just a book, but a series that will keep you awake at night, stealing hours of sleep. It's a very good story, very well written.<br />At the beggining I was a little suspicious about all the reviews giving 5 stars. It didn't seems real. But they are!!!.<br />Must read.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of my favs out of  movie the Batman series. I'm  Missing Heath Ledger though, R.I.P.  Long but fast moving.
B0013KTGAG|2.0|This movie starts with a reasonable premise for a sci-fi space odyssey film.  Unforunately, it lacks and drags.  The dialogue is very quiet, the plot vague.  Often during the movie I had no idea on what was happening or why.  I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters in the film, and it when it was over, I was left feeling like I had wasted my time watching it.  Just not a very good movie.
B007SGM084|4.0|This trilogy has some explicit sexual content, but it also has an interesting story line.  It is most definitely for mature audiences.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I was interested in starting this series because I have heard that a lot of people like it.  I know as in a lot<br />of series the first book is a little slow.  That is the case with this book.  Although I do not want to give away the plot<br />you need to start out with this book so you get to know Jack. It does tell about his background.  So on that note if you are<br />starting the series and want to continue reading about Jack start out here and go on.  I will be purchasing the second book and<br />let you know about that one.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This movie is fantastic great quality high picture resolution love it. I watched the original tuskeegee airman movie that was a great film to but gotta say i like Red Tails a little better
B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley debut Albun exceeded my expectations, very well produced, the musical arrangements and the lyrics convey freshness and youth with the wonderful voice of Haley. I especially liked the slight taste of modern jazz that this album has. Congratulations Haley and I hope that you have very long musical career.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I WISH IT HAD BEEN LONGER. The graphics were great. The storyline was interesting, but it was way too short.
0525953728|5.0|Would recommend to any civilian that is interested in special ops. I read this book in one day.  Very quick and interesting read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was hoping she would end up with the other guy..... I liked the book, but a bit disappointed in the end.... I hope everyone else enjoyed it too!<br /><br /><3 Mona
B004SBQALA|1.0|usually the book is better and this situation is no different. this was more of a meant for tv movie that a major motion picture. they could have done better.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have never had any kind of tablet.  I have always enjoyed ebay but it required me to sit at my computer.  Now I can enjoy shopping while watching T.V.  Now that is really GREAT.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|A great read, just a tad slow in the middle...but still couldnt put it down. It is a thriller, a ghost story
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have always loved TripAdvisor.  Now I can sit on the sofa while my husband watches sports and dream about the places that I someday want to go.  This is app is so easy to use.  I can always find the information I am looking for.
0765325950|5.0|I have read and re-read this series for twelve years. I do believe this is an excellent ending to the series. Well done, Brandon Sanderson and the late Robert Jordan. While there are some parts of the book that I don't necessarily like, I think this is a fitting end.
0451197968|4.0|Early in his career, King, the modern master of suspense and horror and fiction, felt the need for an alter ego through whom he could tell stories of a content and in a style he didn't feel comfortable doing under his own name, and so he created Richard Bachman. When the truth came out, he pretty much abandoned Bachman, but those books are worth reading for their considerable differences from the rest of his work. (This one was also turned into a very bad film with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the plot of which is almost unrecognizable when compared to the book.)<br /><br />Anyway. It's the near future, and a very unpleasant place it is, too. Pollution is rampant, environmental illnesses are covered up by the government, the distance between the wealthy and the impoverished is far greater even than in our real world, and Free-Vee is the opiate of the masses, via the blood sports it broadcasts incessantly. Ben Richards has a wife and a child, the former working as a prostitute out of desperation and the latter seriously ill because medical treatment is nonexistent for people like them. Richards can think of only one option and that's to volunteer for one of the Free-Vee programs, in which he -- or his remaining family -- will earn money for each day he survives. And he manages to qualify as a \\"contestant\\" in the biggest game of all -- but doesn't discover until he's already committed that absolutely no one is allowed to survive..The book follows him through count-down chapters as he goes on the run through the northeastern states, changing cars and disguises, and finding unexpected assistance in avoiding the Killer teams while the nightly audience screams for his death.<br /><br />It's a blood-chilling story, almost a clich&eacute; now (but King invented it), and there are no happy endings. It's also a bit naïve in ways that the author would not be guilty of if he were writing (or re-writing) the book now, but that's okay. Read it as an artifact of its time and hang onto your seatbelt.our seatbelt.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want to put it down, a very interesting and entertaining read.  It's one of his best for sure.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you are a Wall fan, it's a must have.<br />When the movie 1st came out, I was afraid they would do the album justice, but IMHO, they did.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I was disappointed in the length and the depth of this story.  Interesting but not absorbing like some of his books.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Love the action, lots of excitement, and of course, Robert Downey, Jr. What else can I say? It was great.
0061992860|3.0|i am not an expert on wilderness survival but some of the material included was very out of date. Holger Neilsen and the Sylvester methods for artificial respiration! I was taught that by Red Cross in the 1950s! CPR that was suggested is out of date given last publishing date of 2010 and the newer more efficient methods are available readily on line. Makes me suspect the rest although some of it is common sense. Jim
B005DI66N4|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The trials and tribulations this man suffers are unimaginable. Things go from bad to worse, and then even worse. This book doesn't let up; do yourself a kindness and read it now!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was much better than the first. Although it staged on a bit moments that were boring. Would recommend this one.
B000099T2L|5.0|I already have this CD, but needed to replace it because scratches damaged the disc and prevents proper play of the music.  Nice to know I could find & replace it on Amazon.com
B0036EH3XE|5.0|It is a great series and this number 6 completed our collection.  We highly recommend it.  Thank you Matthew Fox for the creating of such a interesting series.  In the viewing, it gives one reason to ponder on the idea..........could this really happen???
B007SPPANM|5.0|Got this as a birthday present for my sister who loves the movie. She loved it and it's a good movie. Not much else to say I don't think.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Like the continuing story of John and Kate.  Lots of drama and dry humor from John.  Can't wait for the next adventure.
6305212112|5.0|Superb movie.  I watch it over and over.  I happened to be replacing the movie from a lost movie.  Just great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Bible on my Kindle and being able to review everyday is great .  I Love it!!!!
B005X5MY2Y|5.0|Perfect--was replacing a worn out collection.  Thanks for having this collection.  Now I can enjoy Rod Steward again without the skipping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my 8 year old son keeps very busy on this game building stuff all the time- it is a safe game for his age group and doesn't involve killing if you put it on the parental lock- which was a nice change it seems as if most games now a days involve killing.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Great movie.  I was replacing a movie that I had left at a previous house.  I just love the movie
B00A9933OW|5.0|I love this album, great songs as expected by Ke$. Nice beats as well . Defiantly some party jams on here.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game.<br /><br />It was worth the wait of downloading it. It would not let me get it til I registered a gift card/credit card.<br /><br />Every age can enjoy it.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Having this movie be a good price and give to my mom for her birthday was incredible looking forward to buy more in the future then having to go to stores
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's the complete saga of star wars, all 6 movies with lots of extras.  What more does a Star Wars obsessed 8 year old boy need for Christmas?  I certainly can't think of anything - can you?  If you are a Star Wars fan, this Blu-Ray edition is the one to get.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is the second time I have had to buy this movie the last one was very scratched up this one meets my sons expectation hes 5
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have been disappointed lately but this game makes up for it.  Great storyline and graphics.  More please.  Wish it did not take so long to download though.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|I love the turth and raw emotion. Whether you're a fan or not you will love this book. I highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and keeps you thinking. I work midnights and this games keeps my brain active and me alert when things get slow.
0765325950|5.0|It's a sad day when people give a book they havent even READ 1 star because they are too lazy to pick up said book and read it. Yes, they could have released the ebook at the same time, but guess what? If you have been following the series since its started THEN YOU STARTED OUT BY READING A HARD COPY. Grow up already. If you are too lazy to just pick up the book and read, or if youre just addicted to technology, or if you travel too much to carry ONE book then go complain on TOR's website. Stay out of where people come to read reviews about actual booke related issues, like plots and characterization. You're wasting time and space on here.
0984183523|5.0|I just recently completed my MBA and have been considering going into mgmt consulting for some time. Although I'm not ready for the life yet, the book has been very helpful for my interviews at non consulting positions!<br /><br />Victor frames all these situations for success in the consulting environment, but there are a lot of points one can take for general careers and for your own personal life, like creating a guests list for your future wedding (humorous example from the book).<br /><br />Nonetheless, I continue to read from his site and his email blasts and I'm confident that IF/WHEN I'm ready to get into mgmt consulting, I will be ready for it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I usually don't like animated movies, however my wife wanted to watch it. To my surprise I loved it!!!!.Everyone will like it.
B0053R3J7G|5.0|Lego creator came shipped to my front door.  This was the perfect experience.  I love shopping on line.  No hassles.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with the book after watching the AMC series. The book is different from the series and I'm still not sure which version I like. I am debating on buying any more of the books.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is fun until all the Puzzles are completed. At that point I wish there was a &#34;YOU WON!&#34; or something showing completion. There is nothing to do at this point to keep interest going. No &#34;carrot&#34; to make me want to continue playing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the way that peeta and katniss were not killed and that there is going to be another book. That's it
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've always loved playing Spider Solitaire. I like how rapidly The cards are removed when stacks are completed. I like the LH option. I wish a click would default to a particular pile rather than an empty space or a pile that makes no senst. In other words, I wish it was more intuitive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved it, wouldn't change a thing!!! What a great book!  I can't wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay!!!!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|While this movie was entertaining, it was more raunchy than I expected. Just make sure to watch it with someone with a sense of humor keeping that in mind.
0399160450|3.0|Much better than Locked On.  If you've enjoyed the early Tom Clancy books, you'll enjoy this.  Not much character development, but the action scenes are fun.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Great book - I can't believe this writer is not more popular in the states.  One of the better novels I have read recently
1611761182|5.0|We loved &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; so couldn't wait for &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.  Ken Follett has to rank as one of the top historical fiction writers of the world.  His works are meticulously researched and smoothly presented, never contrived.
0765325950|5.0|Twenty years..  Twenty years ago I picked up book 1.  I was young and free of responsibilities.  As the main characters grew up and developed into important leaders I grew up and started a family with responsibilities of my own.<br /><br />My children are now the age I was when I started reading the books and became fascinated with the capibilities of saidar and saidan.  I dream of writing  novel or novels as indepth as these were.<br /><br />We all knew some story lines would remain open.  How could you possibly close up so many very explicit details?  Especially after Robert's death.  I believe Brandon did an outstanding job of closing us out.  I truely would have been devistated if Ihad followed books 1-10 and been left without the finale.  Thanks for letting me see peace.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I have absolutely loved this bag so far. I have a Targus 17'' laptop backpack and always found it uncomfortable to wear and clunky to get all of my stuff into, this bag is the complete opposite. I have enough room for the things I need and the bag is almost unnoticeable when wearing it. When I pack it full of 4 large textbooks, my laptop, my tablet, my lunch, school supplies, etc., then I can feel that is it there, but it is still very comfortable to wear around and doesn't feel large and bulky on my back.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I liked the personal attitudes of the players. It tells a real history story in an different non boring way. It makes me eager to read more of P.Gregory's tales.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|These movies are sort of cult classics and having them packaged all together at such a reasonable price made it hard to pass up.
B007THA4FI|4.0|J.K. Rowling's first effort for adults is a resounding success. The only caveat: go slow and take notes for the first few chapters. The story starts slowly, too, and there are so many characters, you might forget who's married to whom. The plot line and the way the characters interact and intertwine is worthy of a Ken Follett novel. And it all comes to a crashing head in the last chapters. Brava, Ms. Rowling!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie has become one of the &#34;new&#34; Christmas classics. I never let a Christmas season go by without watching it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What can I say? This game is proven to take up hours of your time watching plants shoot an endless onslaught of zombies, and you're actually excited about it! Now if I could only grow such plants in real life...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Packed with many versions of the Bible.  Easy to use.  Not a Bible study program, but a great every day reader with helps.  Well worth having.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This was a good but not great read. Interesting how Jonasson wove so many historical figures and events into the story.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|What's not to like? Voice acting is awesome and the music is all great. I especially liked &#34;Smile&#34; by rising star Sabrina Carpenter!<br /><br />Both boys and girls should love this movie and everyone should find heart warming and another lesson and solid roll model demonstration for us all!
B0052GVGYG|4.0|Saw their live concert on AXS television the other night and decided to buy the album ... Awesome!  Blues rock at its best!  Derek Trucks can flat tear up that bottle slide guitar and Ms. Tedeschi sounds almost reminiscent of a younger Bonnie Raitt except a little more 'down to earth'.  Try &#34;Come See About Me&#34; and &#34;Learn How to Love You&#34; for good rockin' and for listening pleasure, if you have the time, try &#34;Midnight in Harlem&#34;.
B009FZFONO|4.0|When I originally watched the pilot, I wasn't nearly as impressed as I was as the seasons unfolded. It just seemed to discombobulated to come away with any sense of where it would lead to. Which forced you  to go show by show to make any semblance of understanding on what it was all about. But.... despite this form of keeping you on the seat of your pants week after week (like I just hate) in a 20's Serial Type shock endings. I survived watching this series by waiting for it to be complete and then watching them 2 or 3 at a time.<br /><br />I really wish these productions would work more like &#34;Eureka&#34;. Which always left you with a proper ending and kept you interested by making you love the characters. Today people just don't have the time to drop everything they're doing just to tune into their favorite series to have it end holding you on the seat of your pants for a week to see the next show!<br /><br />Other than that...... this is a great series, but could better with some what of a resolving close to each show. I hate soap operas for that reason!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I guess when you're married like I am and you have two sisters who like Nicholas Sparks, it's hard to avoid hearing about him.  I decided to read Safe Haven though after seeing coming attractions to the movie.<br />  I got the feeling from the coming attractions that Katie was in an abusive relationship before she met Alex.  I am someone who has read non-fiction books like The Stalking of Kristen and still remember Galina Komar getting killed by her boyfriend at her job after Judge Duckman let him go saying give him his dog back and he'll leave you alone.<br />  I'm not sure much has changed since then and I still don't think the courts take this very seriously but Nicholas Sparks does.  He really did his homework and showed the he understands how awful this is for a woman to go through.  People should read this book and really say to themselves that women should not have to go through this.<br />  With the tension of wondering if the relationship of Katie and Alex being able to work, I couldn't put this book down.  I can see why this gets a five star rating.  I would give it one also.  Great book.  Hope the movie is just as good.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Very good products and a nice addition to my golf gears, works as expected, very happy to have a product like this.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|It's not really all that bad, started out with a fresh turn, but ended in a pointless battle with an over hyped bad guy. The Dudge became a second rate S.W.A.T officer on a baby sitting mission. Anyways ya, good effects and acting, but it just did not really make any sense.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good acting and a good story. The picture moves along well and the story line makes sense. There is one spot where the picture gets a little awkward.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Another example of a completely under marketed film. from the trailer you kinda got the feeling it was just a remake. Well nope it's a totally new twist on the original. I don't want to give too much away but ya it's much better then i thought it would be.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I already have this on VHS and DVD, but now have a Blu Ray so purchased this for that reason. I love this movie. Love it Love it Love it. My son just purchased a 3D version for his 3D Television and I will get to watch it on his TV in the future.So if you love Jack Skellington, the Blu Ray is awesome.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun but takes a lot of thought. There were a few that I<br />thought were not solvable, but my daughter or husband figured them out.,
B00867GJYK|5.0|Upgrading my movies to Blu Ray and this was one I needed.  I love Nemo and this was a great purchase.  Shipped quickly and was received quickly. Packaging was great and there were no loose discs.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|When I read the description, I thought the chraracters were adults, from the nature of the prelude, but it turns out they are in high school. I still read the book, and it was a fast, entertaining read, with some twists, but not normally what I would gravitate to as far as subject matter.
B002VECM72|5.0|I truly loved this movie and thus purchased it on Blu Ray to watch at home. It was delivered very quickly and packed great.  There were no loose discs which is very important to me. This is a great movie for anyone to watch.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|LOVE the music and the actual CD was just fine but if you like to keep the cases beware! The product case arrived broken. The case cover was completely detached from the rest of the case. I don't ever keep a CD case so this wasn't a big deal to me but I thought I'd let everyone know. Otherwise the packaging was in good condition. Clearly this was a manufacturing issue and not an Amazon issue since the plastic wrap was on the CD.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|A mi hija le encantó esta muñeca.  Apenas la saco de la caja le gustó muchísimo. no deja de jugar con ella
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift... He loved it.  He thinks Bruno Mars could well be the next King of Pop.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|love this game!! but...... any way I can hook up a ps3 controller to my kindle fire? great improvement over mc3. huge maps!!
B004DM0UII|5.0|It carries WTIP from Grand Marais MN population 1200. What else is there to say? It is wonderful to get this access on my Kindle Fire.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|5 stars out of 5! I felt as if I were in the book along with Katie! Beautifully written! Can't wait to see the movie!!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I really enjoyed this short story. It was truly an amazing work and I'm planning on reading it again soon. I recommend this read.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I watch the show religiously and finally decided to throw down the money to read the comic. So glad I did. The small differences equal out to sooo much.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I am so very glad to have reread one of my favorite childhood books. Not just for children, but for anyone who would like to add joy into their life, at any age.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson loves it and so my husband and I have installed it on our tablets and cell phones. If he's happy, we're happy!
B00133KHCY|5.0|Movie recommended to me and I was not disappointed. Enjoyable story and the music was great. I would recommend movie
1611761557|5.0|Ah, what a lovely and wonderful book by John Taylor.  It was such a pleasure listening to his soothing voice while I was driving.  I would make excuses just to get in the car and listen to this book.  He really shows his life the way someone should... through his own eyes and experiences.  The parts I loved the most was how passionate he was as a teen about music and how he basically made his dream come true with Duran Duran.  Him and Nick - trying to find their own way.  And getting it.  I guess you would never know the feeling of a Rock Star... but John explains this pretty clearly.<br /><br />I am trying to be as vauge as possible as I don't want to spoil it for others.  If you are a Duranie like I am, you definitely need to get this book.  :)
B0049985XW|5.0|He is quoted as saying that this film was his most enjoyable. I concur. It is wonderfully shot. All the actors did a superb job. The movie takes its time to develop. As Bogey's character descends deeper into madness, you feel yourself being drawn along with him. Thoroughly enjoyable film. Highly recommended.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It was really interesting and awesome, it answered some questions I had regarding Alien but it asked even more and left room for a sequel and that is what I hope will occur!!
B0007O38XU|5.0|Thank you for the great product. It came in the condition that it was described in. Gotta love spaceballs. thanks
B005HI4LMS|5.0|And that actress, Katrina Bowden, wow!<br />It's hard to tell who's intelligent and who're the slackjaw morons in this movie until the end, and it's a nice sort of surprise ending, at that. Or maybe it wasn't a surprise. I don't really know. I was paying too much attention to that actress, Katrina Bowden, wow!<br />It gets gory, bloody, and really stupid in places, which was a lot of fun, and hilarious, although I might have caught more of the jokes if I hadn't been paying so much attention to that actress, Katrina Bowden, wow!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Good action film. A lot of my favorite actors in one movie. The sequal is just as good. I bought both of these for my husband. But the side effect is that I get to enjoy them as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a big reader. I bought this because everyone insisted and I needed something to read during my long flight. OMG! This book was hard to put down. I found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't stop. I laughed, I cried, I was aroused. I learned interesting information. This book has it all. I am  almost 51 but I found myself feeling like a young college student. I enjoyed reading it immensely and would strongly recommend it!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|It's been forever since I've seen a good action movie. Having a lot of my favorite actors in this film has me biased, but I like action films and the actors in this movie have always delivered.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I'm a huge fan and have always enjoyed Ellen.  I have all of her DVD's (including her old TV series), her books and I often watch her TV show.  When this book came out, I was very excited.  However, I was disappointed since I found that it isn't as funny as her previous books.  The other books I read within a day or two.  But, I've had this new one for several weeks now and still haven't finished it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|very fun game, i like the changes they made from the other angry birds, has alot of replay value. no problems on the kindle fire
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and it's a very addictive game.  I find that once I start, I sometimes stay up way too late playing just one more hand.  It's a lot of fun!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|you will kill quite a bit of time playing this game. it has alot of replay value to it also.
1577311523|5.0|This is a very powerful book that transforms the way life occurs, which results in more effective actions. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in evolving as a human being.
B00198X0VS|5.0|I love Will Smith so I might be a little bias. I love all the men in black trilogy. I own them all and watch them all!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I like Jeremy Renner in this. I will only buy movies that I know I will watch over and over and this is the movie I will watch more than once. It's very fast which is why I like it. I like the relationship between Aaron and Marta. I wish there was a bit more romance between them. Hoping to see Jeremy Renner in another Bourne movie in the future.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|I loved this movie. I have seen all the American pie movies and this was a great edition. I found the movie to be hilarious
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I thought this was a really good film the first time I saw it. I bought it as a gift.
B009MO5960|1.0|The first like 30-45 min is so flippen boring I almost just shut it off (many of my friends did). The acting was extremely poor. Now don't get me wrong I love the resident evil series, but this movie just made me dislike it. I felt like this movie was repeating it self over and over with just different looks.
0765325950|1.0|As many others have stated, I'd hoped to read this book on my Kindle, and find it absurd that I'm being forced to wait.  By the time the e-book is released, I may have decided to just wait for the paperback to come out, or buy a used edition.<br /><br />All those hating on those of us who use Kindles need to step into the present.<br />Are you all still listening to vinyl records? I have those, but I can't play them while I'm driving, or on a plane, or spending my lunch hour in the park.<br /><br />Kindles, like my I-Pod, give me the ability to take my books with me whereever I go, and read at my convenience and leisure. And while its not a good idea to walk into my workplace with a huge hardback book under my arm, I can bring my Kindle, and read on my breaks.  I can take it poolside or to the beach without fear of it being damaged, and I don't have to worry about people wanting to \\"borrow\\" it when I'm through.<br /><br />And, speaking as an environmentalist, consider how many trees e-books have saved.<br /><br />So I'll wait.  With my busy schedule it took me nearly a year to read the series up to this point.  I can wait a few more months.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|great music you have to listen yo it and concentrate not music for the site listening<br />I like the arrangements and nice album
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Being a fan of the Alien franchise, this was a must have release of the films. The films have been cleaned up and the visuals are make it look like it was filmed last week. Re-watching these films is a delight and I`m very happy to have gotten them as such a good price!<br /><br />Definitely recommend this to any Alien fan, especially if you don`t already down an edition of the Anthology.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|Ordered this movie for my niece and she did not find this very entertaining.<br /><br />Will not be ordering similar movies in the future.
B003OUXECE|5.0|I have to say, I'm in love with everything BioShock, but this novel takes it beyond. It's essential to read this if you love it so.
B007HO392S|4.0|She likes it, but there are a few songs that neither one of us care for.  Carrie Underwood has an amazing amount of talent.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Wifey picked it out, thinking that it was a comedy.  She'd seen some previews.  Although it was a decent movie, well acted and had a plausible story line, we were disappointed that it was more of a serious exploration of married couple issues.
0393316041|4.0|Good description of Feynman's curiosity and how it brought him success.  Would suggest reading by any parent encouraging the development of their children.
B00006LFGD|5.0|How can you go wrong with Barbara Streisand.  Duet songs are my favorite.<br />CD arrived in perfect condition.<br />Am very satisfied
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I think they could of developed a better story line for this movie. Also, Anne H. at Cat Woman just doesn't look right. She played the part well, but its just not the type of role for her.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Suspenceful with lots of twists. I really enjoyed this book, and am looking forward to more adventures with Lisbeth Salander.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great story line. My kids love it and what to watch each show over and over again. If you like storytales you will like this TV show.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|This 2007 concert captures the remaining members of Led Zeppelin along with late drummer John Bonham's son Jason on the skins, live at the O2 Arena in London in December of 2007.  All performers are in excellent form despite the passage of time, and the selection of songs should satisfy any fan of the group.  Robert Plant has a bit of rasp to his unmistakable voice, but he still hits all the notes just as strongly as ever, and Jimmy Page is incredible, as always.  John Paul Jones provides the solid accompaniment on bass and keyboards that he is famous for, and Jason Bonham is a hugely talented drummer and as close as we can get to raising &#34;Bonzo&#34; himself from the dead.<br /><br />As a younger fan, I appreciate the additional &#34;punch&#34; that modern recording techniques have given these amazing songs.  While I have no doubt that Zep has always hit listeners upside the head in person, I've always felt that recordings of their performances have not fully captured the experience.  This one has, for sure.  I highly recommend Celebration Day
1451695195|5.0|Interesting, to say the least !!  If its factual, well there's more after this. If there is, I hope it's a more forgiving life. I think it IS factual and allows me to approach death as a \\" speed bump\\" in life. If its NOT factual, my speed bump turns out to be a wall !!!!  Oh well ...
B000HF0KXU|5.0|Everyone has different tastes.  If you like action with a plot then I truly recommend this picture.  We will no doubt see it on cable for years to come,
1400067820|3.0|Antifragile:  Things That Gain from Disorder<br />Have not read it yet nor has the person to whom i gave the gift
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's a compelling story of the struggle for survival.  You must read the Hunger Games before reading this book in order to understand the connections in this book.  I'm reading the third book of the Trilogy now and it is a must read after reading the Hunger Games and Catching Fire.
1419705849|5.0|A Pretty good series.  Teaches kids lessons while presenting in their way of thinking.  They dont even know they are getting a lecture.
B0045EJY90|1.0|advertising is phony, as soon as i pulled it ot of the box i knew i was gonna send it back
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Another great album by Rod Stewart. Some Christmas classics and a new song to listen to throughout this holiday season.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I got the game free off of amazon one day. It was well worth my price, but i do not think I would pay over a dollar for it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great read.  Did not see the end coming at all!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves unpredictable books.
B008N9AASC|4.0|I would recommend this dvd to others who enjoyed his other dvds.  Not as visually stimulating, but still much better than anything else you will find out there!
B007EW9ISM|4.0|My applydea maglus stylus fell apart after 6 months of use, and I wanted to get this as a change of pace.  I don't like how you have to press down a bit harder, since the maglus required almost no effort at all, and the thickness of this isn't for everyone.  But you can tell that this is a well-made product.  It writes well, and is great for most applications and drawing.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a great historical fiction tale.  I liked the way it brought the three main characters to life in each section.  Don't want to spoil anything, the ending is fantastic, I couldn't put it down.
1609611543|5.0|This book is really an education in itself.  I started watching my diet right away and eliminating wheat.  I lost weight right away and felt better about it - it wasn't difficult following the guide lines.<br />I purchased this book for my son who found he was allergic to wheat and I know he will be getting a lot of use and information from it...<br />We were both pleased with the prompt delivery...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it all the time. Has everything you need from maps to forecasts. I have had no problems with it locking up either.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|When I first heard this book featured slam poetry (performance poetry, kind of like music lyrics without the melody), I hesitated to read it. While I love to read and write novels, poetry has never been my thing. Sometimes I just don't get it, and that frustrates me.    But am I glad I gave this book a shot! The poetry is a small percentage of the novel, but it's an emotionally packed percentage. The slam poetry is a way to understand the characters like dialogue and exposition could never accomplish.    Layken (affectionally called Lake by her mom) is 18. When her father died from a heart attack five months ago, her mother uprooted Lake and her younger brother Kel to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where her mother could find a better-paying job. Understandably, Lake is angry about changing schools for her last year of high school. That would be rough!    Her brother Kel seems to take the change in stride, especially when he meets a neighbor boy Caulder who is close to his age and temperament. They become fast friends. Luckily for Lake, Caulder has an older brother who is spicy hot: Will. Will is 21 and he takes an instant liking to Lake. Maybe Michigan won't be so bad?    Lake and Will are such endearing characters. But there are so many wonderful secondary characters as well. At first I wondered if Kel had Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, the way Lake describes her brother:    He's a strange kid, but I couldn't love him more. He has a game he likes to play which he calls 'backwards day' where he spends most of the time walking everywhere backwards, talking backwards and even requests dessert first.  \\"Hurry to says Mom Layken!\\" he says, backwards.    But then I figured out he just has an expansive imagination. Both Kel and Caulder are good kids, and it's hilarious when they stage a snowman death scene behind the car. Kel helps Lake deal with a shocker later in the story.    Lake has her ups and downs with her mother, but I thought this maternal advice before Lake's first datewith Will is excellent:    \\"There are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell...Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire you to want to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.\\"    Nick is a classmate she meets who's OBSESSED with the vaunted Chuck Norris. He has a different Chuck Norris joke for Lake each day, like \\"Chuck Norris got a g-mail account today. It's gmail@chucknorris.com.\\" (It took me a while to figure that one out!)    And Eddie becomes Lake's best friend. I love how she uses her difficult past as a source of wisdom in getting what she wants from life. She's a big reason Lake and her mother strengthen their relationship.    Eddie turns her gaze away from Will and looks at me.  \\"It wasn't death that punched you, Layken. It was LIFE. Life happens. S*** happens. And it happens a LOT. To a LOT of people.\\"    So true. Somehow this story makes the awful things that happen in life seem not so awful, and that's some powerful writing. This story has some twists--one I saw coming and the other I didn't. The romance is sweet and ethical. I can't get to Point of Retreat fast enough!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I couldn't put the other two books down so I had to read this one. I kinda wished I hadn't. Very weird ending. Seemed rushed or success from the first books changed the author. Read it if you have to but you have  been forewarned.
159562015X|5.0|To find happiness and fullfillment we must know ourself better then we will be able to find the job/career where we can make a difference and it all starts with knowing our strengths. This book is a very valuable tool to discovering my strengths so I can use them to find the right career and job for me.
B009F1DIOK|5.0|I loved the movie and have watched it multiple times.  Tolkien' s book was more of a guideline for this movie but I thought the changes a necessity to cut down the time.  The extended version gets you a lot closer to the book.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|The plot was so predictable, the characters were so flat, and the writing style is for dummies.  Why would anyone recommend this book or this author when there are so many who are better.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|All I can say is Still a Classic after 100yrs of Universal , highly recommended for horror classic movies and series
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app but I just wish I could figure out how to put videos online but other than that it's awesome I love the camcorder but I did have some problems with it at first but I fixed it
B008SVS0K0|5.0|The last of four albums, one after another improving the previous sound. Who knew these guys from Canada would be so excellent musicians?
B004UQPM4E|5.0|He absolutely loves it. The other half has played it so much I could almost recite all the movies line for line. Am a little worried that he might wear the disks out befor next year. LOL
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I really enjoyed this season, and watched it all in one sitting.  I watched a few episodes here and there on tv, but got the DVD for commentary and other extras.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this every day and find the weather fairly accurate.  I like the hour by hour showing of the weather.
0307949486|1.0|I was initially attracted to your offering because of the low price, but the speed of delivery and the quality of the product I received exceeded my expectaions.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read all three of the\\" 50 Shades of Gray\\" and thought this was just as good if not better!!!!!Currently reading the second one \\"Reflected in You\\"
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|Sorry Ian, but the Coverdale/Hughes vocal era brought out the best in Deep Purple.  This album and Stormbringer shows a group in transition that actually came out of it much improved.  The lyrics and instrumental show a group that moved above and beyond Smoke on the Water (still a classic) and Highway Star to some very interesting songs, my favorite &#34;Mistreated&#34;, a real gem of a vocal performance by David Coverdale.  Ritchie Blackmore sounds very motivated as it almost seems that he improved as a guitarist in these two albums.
